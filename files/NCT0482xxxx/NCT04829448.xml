  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SpineZone is an innovative physical therapy program with its focus on treatment of cervical,&#xD;
      thoracic, and lumbar conditions through the use of a multi-disciplinary, technology enabled&#xD;
      platform. Standard physical therapy modalities including exercise-based rehabilitation as&#xD;
      well as patient education on a healthy lifestyle (sleep, nutrition, posture) are employed as&#xD;
      part of the standard treatment. As nutrition is a key element in modulating muscle growth and&#xD;
      function in response to exercise, providing patients with appropriate access to nutritional&#xD;
      supplements that meet the metabolic demands of our exercise program are potentially important&#xD;
      to our clinical outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain manifests itself clinically with pain, loss of strength, difficulty with normal&#xD;
      posture, and decreased range of motion. In as many as 60-85% cases, LBP will become a chronic&#xD;
      condition, requiring long term care, and even surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conservative therapy is typically administered until it's no longer a viable option, after&#xD;
      which surgical options are considered. Conservative therapy includes physical therapy,&#xD;
      medication, steroid injections etc. Physical therapy and exercises are especially central to&#xD;
      conservative therapy. Numerous exercise and therapy protocols have been designed with the&#xD;
      goal to improve low back muscle strength, thereby alleviating symptoms, and potentially&#xD;
      underlying cause of the pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As nutrition is a key element in modulating muscle growth and function in response to&#xD;
      exercise, providing patients with appropriate access to nutritional supplements that meet the&#xD;
      metabolic demands of our exercise program are potentially important to our clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project specifically aims to assess the effect of ensuring adequate nutritional&#xD;
      availability of protein, as protein shake, as part of their standard care for treatment of&#xD;
      low back pain typically 4-12 weeks duration. In this experiment, we will compare muscle&#xD;
      structure and health and correlate improvements with patient-specific characteristics such as&#xD;
      demographics, medical history, medication usage, treatment expectations, and symptom&#xD;
      severity. Subsequently, this information will enable us to gain valuable insight into&#xD;
      physiological response of pathological tissue, and potentially, develop optimal exercise&#xD;
      plans to maximally benefit these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the adherence and compliance of patients taking a protein nutritional&#xD;
           supplement in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effectiveness of protein nutritional supplementation on improving&#xD;
           clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify patients (based on patient specific predictors who are most likely to succeed&#xD;
           with the addition of nutritional supplementation. The goal of this project is to assess&#xD;
           the impact of a nutritional protein supplement on clinical outcomes in individuals with&#xD;
           spine pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS We will recruit up to 100 individuals with LBP of &gt; 3months duration&#xD;
      that have been identified by the care providers (ie. Primary care physical, orthopaedic&#xD;
      surgeon, or other) to be appropriate and safe for participation in a physical rehabilitation&#xD;
      program with nutritional supplementation at SpineZone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon initial evaluation at the SpineZone clinic with a Physical Therapist, participants will&#xD;
      be offered the opportunity participate in the study and may receive the protein supplement as&#xD;
      part of their standard care. Potentially interested patients will be screened by inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria and as such, written informed consent will be obtained from each&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then be randomly assigned to the treatment (protein supplement) or control&#xD;
      group (no protein supplement) and commence their prescribed rehabilitation treatment as per&#xD;
      therapist recommendation. Individuals in the randomly assigned supplementation group will be&#xD;
      provided the supplement and will be instructed on its use (dosage and frequency).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSENT All guidelines for proper consenting will be observed. Consenting will be done in a&#xD;
      private room prior to any procedures being performed. Patients will be given ample time to&#xD;
      review the document and ask questions. All study procedures will be thoroughly explained and&#xD;
      all questions will be answered. Patients will not be placed under any pressure to participate&#xD;
      in the study. Consent forms will be obtained by the investigators of the study and/or the&#xD;
      study coordinator in the SpineZone clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal from the study: If the patient decides at any point to withdraw from the study,&#xD;
      they can do so without any of the benefits to which they are entitled changing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISK/BENEFITS RATIO The risks to the patients will be minimal. Although there is, future&#xD;
      patients may benefit from improvements to surgical procedures and more effective&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs which will be derived from patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY A confidentiality breach is a risk associated with data&#xD;
      review research; however every measure will be instituted to ensure that patient information&#xD;
      is kept confidential. Data analysis worksheets will be kept separate from EMR records. No&#xD;
      subject public health information will be collected or shared.&#xD;
