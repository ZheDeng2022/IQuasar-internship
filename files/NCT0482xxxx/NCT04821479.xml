    <textblock>
      An open-label, single-center clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of repeated&#xD;
      intrathecal administrations of autologous bone marrow derived mesenchyme stem cells in ALS&#xD;
      patients. The study includes 20 subjects (age: 20-70) with definite diagnosis of ALS and&#xD;
      ALS-FRS-R score of at least 20 and disease-duration of less than 3 years. The treatment&#xD;
      protocol includes four intrathecal injections of MSC, at intervals of 3 months between the&#xD;
      injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints are safety and tolerability. Several efficacy measures are assessed as&#xD;
      secondary endpoints.&#xD;

      An open-label, single-center clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of repeated&#xD;
      intrathecal administrations of autologous bone marrow derived mesenchyme stem cells in ALS&#xD;
      patients. The study includes 20 subjects (age: 20-70) with definite diagnosis of ALS and&#xD;
      ALS-FRS-R score of at least 20 and disease-duration of less than 3 years. The treatment&#xD;
      protocol includes four intrathecal injections of MSC, at intervals of 3 months between the&#xD;
      injections. The primary endpoints are safety and tolerability. Several efficacy measures are&#xD;
      assessed as secondary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applications from patients are received in our centre. An independent selective committee set&#xD;
      by hospital's administration examines anonymously, according to the predefined inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. After inclusion and screening visit, patients are followed up for a&#xD;
      &quot;run-in&quot; period of 6 months before the first visit (visit 1), to evaluate the progression&#xD;
      rate of their disease. and for six months following the last transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One month after inclusion, patients undergo bone Marrow Aspiration (BMA) procedure and MSC&#xD;
      cells are produced from the bone marrow aspirate. On the treatment visit, the patients are&#xD;
      transplanted with an intrathecal (IT) injection of MSC (1 million cells per kg of body&#xD;
      weight) and thereafter with additional injections every 3-6 months. After the MSC&#xD;
      transplantation patients are examined on a bimonthly basis and evaluated for ALSFRSr scoring&#xD;
      and forced vital capacity of the lungs (FVC) for a total follow up period of 3 months post&#xD;
      last MSC-injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish the progression rate of the disease the monthly changes in the functional ALS&#xD;
      score: ALSFRSr will be calculated during the 6 months-&quot;run in period&quot; and for the whole&#xD;
      duration of the study, ending at 3 months following the last injection of MSC stem cells. The&#xD;
      progression rate (as evidenced by the monthly changes in ALSFRSr and FVC) during the study&#xD;
      (calculated at last visit time point, 3 months after the last MSC-injection) will be compared&#xD;
      to the progression rate during the &quot;run-in&quot; period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow up visits include observation for side effects, full neurological evaluation and&#xD;
      muscle chart, ALS score and forced vital capacity (FVC) test. The safety is assessed&#xD;
      following treatment with MSC, using measurements of the following variables: physical&#xD;
      examination, vital signs (HR, BP, RR, body temperature), and clinical laboratory parameters:&#xD;
      WBC with differential and platelet count, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Ht), blood chemistry&#xD;
      for electrolytes, creatinine and liver enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All selected patients undergo bone marrow aspiration under light general anaesthesia and an&#xD;
      inoculum of crude bone marrow cells (150 ml) is obtained and two thirds of it kept frozen.&#xD;
      One third is cultured under GCP conditions at the human cell cultures clean room facility of&#xD;
      Hadassah HMO. The MSCs are obtained from the bone marrow of each patient and prepared using&#xD;
      our previously described protocol with slight modification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One month later the patient is hospitalized and a lumbar puncture performed under standard&#xD;
      conditions and local anaesthesia at the L4-5 lumbar level and 3 ml of CSF are removed and the&#xD;
      cultured purified MSCs (1x106/kg of body weight) resuspended in 3 ml of normal saline are&#xD;
      injected in the CSF, using a 20-gauge needle and 3-way cannula.&#xD;
