  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis is a rare disabling disorder that can be hereditary or&#xD;
      sporadic. Depending on the form, various tissues are affected. While in hereditary cases,&#xD;
      neuropathy is predominant, cardiac impairment is the main manifestation in the sporadic form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this project is to evaluate the proportion of patients with neuropathy&#xD;
      in a population of patients with a non-mutated TTR amyloid cardiopathy condition.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis belongs to a group of severe and multi-systemic diseases&#xD;
      caused by an extracellular accumulation of fibrillar proteins arranged in beta-pleated&#xD;
      sheets. This pathology can be hereditary (mutations in the TTR gene) or sporadic. Depending&#xD;
      on the form, various tissues are affected: peripheral nervous system (leading to neuropathy,&#xD;
      especially vegetative), heart, kidney... While in forms linked to TTR mutations neuropathy is&#xD;
      the main manifestation, in the sporadic form (also called wild-type), the cardiac impairment&#xD;
      is predominant. Other organ damages are rarely reported in this second form. In the THAOS&#xD;
      registry (Coelho T. et al, 2013), a clinical peripheral neuropathy is reported in 28.4% out&#xD;
      of 67 patients with the sporadic form of the disease, although the authors do not provide a&#xD;
      precise description of the neuropathy type. We propose to prospectively study patients with a&#xD;
      wild-type amyloid cardiopathy condition to identify and describe the associated neuropathy. A&#xD;
      pilot study conducted at the Bordeaux University Hospital demonstrated the feasibility and&#xD;
      interest of this research: it showed the presence of an undetermined aetiology polyneuropathy&#xD;
      in 35.7% out of 14 patients followed for senile cardiac amyloidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tafamidis is used on familial amyloid neuropathy and a recent study shows an effect on senile&#xD;
      amyloid cardiopathy (Maurer MS et al., 2018) which strengthens the need to determine the&#xD;
      frequency of neuropathies associated with wild-type amyloid cardiopathy and to type them more&#xD;
      accurately.&#xD;

The NYHA score is a classification in 4 stages of increasing severity is proposed by the New York Heart Association, it is based on the intensity of the symptoms:&#xD;
I: Asymptomatic, discomfort during exceptional efforts. II: Moderate discomfort for significant efforts. III: Discomfort felt during moderate efforts. IV: Discomfort during the slightest effort or at rest. Référence: Hurst Hurst JW, Morris DC, Alexander RW.

    <description>Patients meeting the criteria will be seen in consultation with standardized interview and clinical examination. An electromyogram will be then carried out to check for the presence of neuropathy. Finally, for patients diagnosed with neuropathy, a biological check-up to look for another cause of neuropathy will be performed. In patients who already had an EMG as part of their medical follow-up, the examination will not be repeated if it strictly meets the conditions of the minimum protocol and if it was done within the year prior to inclusion. In patients who already had an identical biological assessment in the year prior to inclusion, the sample will not be taken.</description>
