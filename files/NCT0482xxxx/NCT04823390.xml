  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative anxiety has many hazards and should be eliminated. Patients undergoing&#xD;
      ophthalmologic procedures often undergo it under local anesthesia. In a trial to improve&#xD;
      patients' satisfaction sedation is given. Sedation could be given either by an anesthetist or&#xD;
      patient-controlled methods. This study compared both methods of sedation in terms of safety,&#xD;
      depth of sedation, and patient satisfaction.&#xD;

      This randomized controlled trial was conducted in Kasr Al Ainy Hospital, Ophthalmology&#xD;
      surgeries operation theatre, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the approval of the research ethical committee (approval number MD-18-2019) &amp; obtaining&#xD;
      written informed consent from every patient, 30 patients belonging to the American society of&#xD;
      anesthesiologists (ASA) status I, II, aging from 40 to 65 years old, both genders,&#xD;
      co-operative patients aware of the instructions, scheduled for cataract surgery under local&#xD;
      anesthesia were enrolled for this randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, patients with a diagnosis of cognitive impairment or mental disorder,&#xD;
      hypersensitivity to any of the used drugs, having any conditions contraindicating local&#xD;
      anesthesia (e.g. Coagulation disorders) were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, patients having severe pulmonary disease e.g. (obstructive sleep apnea),&#xD;
      patients using sedative medications within the previous month, and patients with chronic&#xD;
      renal and cardiac disorder (e.g. chronic renal failure, heart failure) were also excluded&#xD;
      from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly assigned into two equal groups of 15 patients each, the anesthetist&#xD;
      controlled group Ga (n=15) and the patient-controlled group Gp (n=15). Randomization was done&#xD;
      using computer-generated numbers and the allocation sequence of the participants was&#xD;
      concealed in sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the anesthetist controlled group Ga (n=15):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine preoperative assessment (proper history taking, examination, and laboratory&#xD;
      investigations) was done to all patients as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the preoperative preparation room, intravenous access (20 gauge cannula) was obtained,&#xD;
      premedications were given in the form of (Granitryl at a dose of 10 mcg/kg as an antiemetic&#xD;
      and ranitidine at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg as antistress ulcer prophylaxis, they were given&#xD;
      diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride solution over 10 minutes), 15 minutes before giving the&#xD;
      local anesthesia. Then patients were transferred to the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room, all patients were monitored with continuous pulse oximetry,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, and non-invasive blood pressure measured at 10 minutes interval (the blood&#xD;
      pressure cuff was applied on the contralateral side of the IV cannula), and oxygen support&#xD;
      was given through nasal cannula applied near the nostrils at a flow of 5 liters per minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IV sedation was started before the administration of the local anesthesia in the form of&#xD;
      a bolus of 0.02 mg/kg of midazolam and 0.2 mcg/kg of fentanyl to all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then further doses were given as needed through the procedure according to the depth of&#xD;
      sedation. The depth of sedation was assessed at regular intervals (every 10 minutes) using&#xD;
      the sedation scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A depth of sedation level II or III on the sedation scale was targeted, level I was&#xD;
      considered anxious and needs further doses, and more than level III was considered a risk of&#xD;
      oversedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A soluset was filled with a mixture of 10 mg of midazolam and 150 mcg of fentanyl diluted&#xD;
      with 0.9 % sodium chloride solution to complete a total volume of 50 ml. and a concentration&#xD;
      of 0.2 mg/ml of midazolam and 3 mcg/ml of fentanyl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthetist withdrew 2 ml from the soluset and gave them to the patient according to&#xD;
      depth of sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the patient-controlled group Gp (n=15):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine preoperative assessment (proper history taking, examination, and laboratory&#xD;
      investigations) was done to all patients as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the preoperative preparation room, intravenous access (20 gauge cannula) was obtained,&#xD;
      premedications were given in the form of (Granitryl at a dose of 10 mcg/kg as an antiemetic&#xD;
      and ranitidine at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg as antistress ulcer prophylaxis, they were given&#xD;
      diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride solution over 10 minutes), 15 minutes before giving the&#xD;
      local anesthesia. Then patients were transferred to the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room, all patients were monitored with continuous pulse oximetry,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, and non-invasive blood pressure measured at 10 minutes interval (the blood&#xD;
      pressure cuff was applied on the contralateral side of the IV cannula), and oxygen support&#xD;
      was given through nasal cannula applied near the nostrils at a flow of 5 liters per minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IV sedation was started before the administration of the local anesthesia in the form of&#xD;
      a bolus of 0.02 mg/kg of midazolam and 0.2 mcg/kg of fentanyl to all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were instructed on how to use the PCS pump, then the pump (Accufuser) was connected&#xD;
      to the IV cannula, patients were given the press button of the infusion pump in one hand and&#xD;
      a clicker in the other hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were instructed to press the button as often as they feel the need to do so, as&#xD;
      there was a lockout interval of six minutes to limit the amount of medication, during this&#xD;
      interval the pump will not deliver drugs regardless of the patient's attempts to press the&#xD;
      button. The attending anesthetist was instructed to respond to the patient's question &quot;how&#xD;
      often should I press the button&quot; with the answer &quot;when you feel unsedated, anxious,&#xD;
      irritable, not calm, afraid of the operation and you want to be more relaxed and calm just&#xD;
      press the button&quot;. If the patient pressed the button during the permission time (after the 6&#xD;
      min lock-out interval), a 2 ml infusion of the drug mixture was administered IV, Otherwise,&#xD;
      no drug was administered to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this group, patients received a clicker, on the other hand, to press on both the pump and&#xD;
      clicker together, every time he/she used the pump to denote the number of attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observing anesthetist present beside the patient used a stopwatch to record the time from&#xD;
      the start of the use of the pump, and the number of the attempts that were recorded as the&#xD;
      number of the clicks done by the patient, and so in that way the anesthetist differentiated a&#xD;
      true attempt from a false one done during the lockout interval that was fixed at 6 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PCS pump was of 100 ml volume, of 2 ml demand doses, 6 minutes lockout interval and of no&#xD;
      basal rate of infusion, it was filled with a mixture of 10 mg of midazolam and 150 mcg of&#xD;
      fentanyl diluted with 0.9 % sodium chloride solution to complete a total volume of 50 ml. and&#xD;
      a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml of midazolam and 3 mcg/ml of fentanyl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A demand dose of 2 ml with 6 minutes lockout time was used. The patient was unaware of the&#xD;
      lockout period, the attending anesthetist was aware of the drug regimen to be present to&#xD;
      intervene for adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruction on the use of commercially available PCS pump was given verbally by the&#xD;
      anesthetist on the day of surgery and reinforced again in the operation room (OR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A depth of sedation level II or III on the sedation scale was targeted, level I was&#xD;
      considered anxious and needs further doses, and more than level III was considered a risk of&#xD;
      oversedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eye to be operated on was marked prior to starting the local anesthesia. The total volume&#xD;
      of 8 ml was prepared for the peribulbar block including a mixture of 4 ml lidocaine 2%, 4 ml&#xD;
      bupivacaine 0.5%, and 75 IU of hyaluronidase. The anesthetic solution was injected into the&#xD;
      extraconal compartment of the eye using two 23 gauge needles with 5 ml being injected at the&#xD;
      junction of outer one-third and inner two-thirds of the lower orbital rim and 3 ml were&#xD;
      injected superonasally beneath the superior orbital notch. The success of the block was&#xD;
      assessed by globe bulge, loss of ocular movements and the eye was padded 5 to 10 minutes&#xD;
      (with intermittent pressing 5 seconds and relieve the press for 10 seconds) to enhance the&#xD;
      spread of the anesthetic solution and prevent a rise in the intraocular pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After adequate and complete muscle paralysis (assessed by the inability to move the eye in 6&#xD;
      directions known as a gaze), the surgical procedure was allowed by an expert surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate, blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate were recorded as&#xD;
      a baseline before sedation and at 10 minutes intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' and surgeons' satisfaction, depth of sedation, and patients' anxiety were assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OR was equipped with emergency equipment and drugs. All the equipment necessary for&#xD;
      transformation to general anesthesia if needed at any point were also present including&#xD;
      (analgesic, hypnotic, muscle relaxant, laryngoscope, different endotracheal tube sizes a&#xD;
      supraglottic device, and a well-functioning anesthesia machine). This transformation would&#xD;
      have been needed if a safety endpoint was reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoints for anesthetist intervention included arterial desaturation &lt; 90%, for more&#xD;
      than one minute, hypotension &lt; 90 mmHg systolic or 20% decrease from baseline persisting when&#xD;
      repeating determination one minute later, inability to tolerate the procedure, oversedation,&#xD;
      airway obstruction, and the need for general anesthesia where the anesthetist will intervene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the procedure, the total amount of sedating drug administered was recorded, as&#xD;
      well as the number of attempts of self-administration was recorded before discharge from the&#xD;
      OR. The patient was transferred to the recovery room and the time to ambulation was&#xD;
      calculated, before being discharged to the ward safely.&#xD;
