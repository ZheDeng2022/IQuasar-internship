  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic allograft injury is the leading cause of graft loss in renal transplantation. The&#xD;
      shortage of available kidneys for transplantation has reached crisis levels with increasing&#xD;
      numbers of waiting list mortalities. Strategies to prolong graft survival are urgently&#xD;
      needed. The pediatric and young adult transplant population is one in which repeat&#xD;
      transplantation is inevitable and therefore, this group is one who will especially benefit&#xD;
      from intervention to prolong graft survival. The hypothesis of this proposal is that&#xD;
      subclinical viral infection is a modifiable risk factor in the pathogenesis of chronic&#xD;
      allograft injury. The young age of the proposed study population is an ideal one to evaluate&#xD;
      this objective due to the high prevalence of seronegative recipients. The studies outlined&#xD;
      will determine the temporal relationship betWeween subclinical viremia, renal allograft&#xD;
      infection and allograft injury. This will be the first prospective study in renal transplant&#xD;
      recipients to systematically monitor subclinical viral infection both in peripheral blood and&#xD;
      in the renal allograft with concurrent quantitative measures of renal function, allograft&#xD;
      fibrosis, and innate immune activation. The investigators have chosen these 3 outcomes&#xD;
      because they evaluate a spectrum of renal allograft injury and represent different stages -&#xD;
      from early to late - in the pathophysiology that leads to renal allograft dysfunction. In&#xD;
      addition, the role of virus specific T cell immune responses in the control of subclinical&#xD;
      viral infection and associated allograft injury will be determined. These data are critical&#xD;
      as they will provide insights into the pathogenesis of injury and will guide development of&#xD;
      interventions strategies. Importantly, the current treatment strategies for viral disease do&#xD;
      not prevent subclinical viral infection. Thus, the results of this study may identify that&#xD;
      prevention, prophylaxis and/or treatment of subclinical viral replication as a long term&#xD;
      strategy to prevent chronic allograft injury and prolong graft survival.&#xD;
