    <textblock>
      The study is an Observational, Phase 0 designed to establish that the risk for diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy assigned by the RiskAnalyzer improves the reading accuracy and consistency of any&#xD;
      reader and it decreases the inter-reader variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Objectives one, two, and three are arranged chronologically and in an increasing&#xD;
      level of complexity as a three tiered approach to support the primary and secondary endpoint&#xD;
      of the trial. Objective one is to test fully each system components of the study limited to a&#xD;
      single site. Objective two is to evaluate the efficacy of the RiskAnalyzer to assign the risk&#xD;
      of Diabetic Retinopathy in comparison to the gold standard. Objective three is to demonstrate&#xD;
      that the reader's accuracy in grading images is improved when risk levels assigned by the&#xD;
      RiskAnalyzer are made available to the reader while performing the grading of the images&#xD;
      which is the primary endpoint of the trial Methods and Research Design: A network of clinical&#xD;
      study sites will be established to meet the required number of cases needed as calculated by&#xD;
      statistical analysis. Male and Female Subjects between the ages of 18-65 who are either&#xD;
      pre-diabetic or diabetics will be eligible for participation in this study. Subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited, consented, photographed and their images graded by two trained readers and&#xD;
      analyzed by the RiskAnalyzer . The risk levels that are obtained from the RiskAnalyzer will&#xD;
      be compared to the current gold standard practice, manual grading of each case by a reader.&#xD;
      Data collected during this clinical trial will be reported to the referring physician in the&#xD;
      form of a retinal screening report completed and signed by a licensed Ophthalmic professional&#xD;
      and delivered to their attending physician. Risk levels for diabetic retinopathy obtained by&#xD;
      use of the RiskAnalyzer will not be given to the attending physician under any circumstances&#xD;
      in order to preserve standard of care for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and data flow process&#xD;
      of the RiskAnalyzer, retinal image reading system will be analyzed and based on the current&#xD;
      gold standard of a human reader. This study is a three-aims study, 24 month in length,&#xD;
      prospective, case-only study of the performance of the RiskAnalyzer. The risk levels obtained&#xD;
      from the RiskAnalyzer are not made visible, i.e. are not unmasked to either of the two&#xD;
      readers. In year two, the risk levels obtained from the RiskAnalyzer for half of the studies&#xD;
      are unmasked to the two readers while grading the image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to all study data and processes follows a role-based design. The clinical staff will&#xD;
      have access only to clinical data but not the technical data. The technical team will have&#xD;
      access to the technical data only but not the clinical data. The study coordinator will have&#xD;
      access to all data. The use of computers will adhere to the Guidance for Industry&#xD;
      Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Investigations and applicable sections of 21 CFRs part&#xD;
      11.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Sensitivity and specificity of retinal screening for risk stratification of DR using digital&#xD;
      fundus photographs and the RiskAnalyzer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Trial Methods and Research Design: A total of 10,000 subjects will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate in this study. These subjects will be enrolled through two parallel&#xD;
      collaborators, Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (Project ECHO) and CommuniCare&#xD;
      Health Centers. Each clinic will obtain approximately 50% of the cases per year or an average&#xD;
      of 50 cases per week. Subjects will be identified from clinics, CommuniCare Health Centers of&#xD;
      San Antonio, TX and Project ECHO, New Mexico. CommuniCare has two associated sites, the&#xD;
      Barrio Family Health Center in Southeast San Antonio, TX and the Dr. Frank Bryant Health&#xD;
      Center also in San Antonio. CommuniCare serves approximately 45,000 subjects a year of which&#xD;
      it is estimated that 5000 are requiring diabetic care. Project ECHO in conjunction with the&#xD;
      University of New Mexico collaborates with over 20 rural clinics in New Mexico to provide&#xD;
      service to underserved areas in New Mexico. A recruitment flyer and consent forms will be&#xD;
      provided to each site. Clinic staff will recruit subject for the study during scheduled&#xD;
      visits. Subject will be given a flyer containing information about the study and the informed&#xD;
      consent document. Subjects who are interested in being enrolled in the study will be referred&#xD;
      to a photographer within the site for Retinal imaging. Subjects will not receive a payment or&#xD;
      stipend for participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no screening requirements for subjects to participate in this trial. Subjects must&#xD;
      be diagnosed as a person with pre-diabetes or diabetes by a medical professional. There is no&#xD;
      requirement or solicitation for information regarding prior or concomitant therapy. There are&#xD;
      no criteria set forth for subjects to exit or be discontinued from the study once the retinal&#xD;
      screening is performed. Subjects will not be withdrawn from the study once retinal screening&#xD;
      has occurred. Once the subject completes retinal screening, the period of subject&#xD;
      participation is concluded. Images taken from subjects may not be used in the study due to&#xD;
      inadequate image quality. The number of images found to be inadequate will be tracked and&#xD;
      reported at the completion of the study. Retinal screening marks both the beginning and the&#xD;
      end of subject participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each eye, a minimum of two posterior pole images will be collected. One image will be&#xD;
      centered on the fovea and the second on the optic disc. A third image will be collected of&#xD;
      the anterior segment (front of the eye). Subjects will not be pharmacologically dilated.&#xD;
      Imaging will rely on natural dilation due to adaptation to darkness in the imaging room. More&#xD;
      than two images per eye will be collected only when the imager (photographer) identifies any&#xD;
      given image of insufficient quality for reading. Poor quality images are typically due to&#xD;
      physiological reasons, such as blinking or small pupils and will not be used as part of this&#xD;
      study. The retinal photographer will attempt up to 3 times to acquire images of a subject's&#xD;
      eyes in order to complete the imaging protocol. The study coordinator will conduct weekly&#xD;
      audits of the imaging procedure in order to ensure and document compliance with the study&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Class II Medical Device that will be used for this study will be a non mydriatic or&#xD;
      equivalent retinal camera. The retinal camera is intended to be used for taking digital&#xD;
      images of the retina of the human eye without the use of pharmacological dilation. The&#xD;
      retinal camera has the following photography modes: RGB color. A Digital Camera is mounted to&#xD;
      the retinal camera to perform retinal imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A picture archival and communication system (PACS) is used to receive DICOM images,&#xD;
      scheduling information and textual reports, organize and store them in an internal format,&#xD;
      and to make that information available across a network via HIPAA and FDA-cleared secure user&#xD;
      interfaces. The PACS is comprised of a capture component, a central server component, and a&#xD;
      viewer component that is used on general purpose computing hardware. Subject information,&#xD;
      procedure information, and image acquisition data is captured, sent to a server or&#xD;
      alternatively, it is accepted directly from a DICOM compliant device. After receiving image&#xD;
      objects and associated data, the server registers the incoming data and images with the&#xD;
      archive including any associations with prior cases. The cases are presented to users with&#xD;
      the correct permissions from a work list as controlled by a managing user. The image data is&#xD;
      transmitted and rendered on the user's workstation using a standard web browser. Once the&#xD;
      server registers a report, the report is available to the referring physician or client&#xD;
      service electronically or via fax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after the images and Subject demographics are collected, the photographer will&#xD;
      upload the data as a case to the PACS via a VPN connection established between the imaging&#xD;
      workstation and PACS. If the VPN connection cannot be established at the time of imaging, the&#xD;
      upload will be done at a later time, e.g. end of the clinic day. The data will reside in the&#xD;
      imaging workstation for up to five days in order to assure upload. The clinical coordinator&#xD;
      will conduct weekly audits of upload completion. Once in PACS, cases are read by readers&#xD;
      using a built in reading template that generates a report with their findings. The study will&#xD;
      not disrupt standard of care to the study subjects. Each site will follow its own standard&#xD;
      procedures and care. Findings will be reported to the clinic which referred the subject for&#xD;
      screening. Clinics will be responsible for follow-up care including any necessary&#xD;
      intervention or therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance of the RiskAnalyzer: The performance of the RiskAnalyzer will be calculated by&#xD;
      applying the minimally acceptable values for sensitivity (Seo) and specificity (Spo) values&#xD;
      specified in advance. For purposes of this study, the specified null hypotheses values are&#xD;
      Seo=0.85 and Spo=0.70. These values are based on data obtained from ophthalmic exams. The&#xD;
      efficacy of trained readers using retinal photography has been demonstrated to provide the&#xD;
      most sensitive screening and monitoring test for sight-threatening retinopathy, with&#xD;
      sensitivities &gt; 80%. Abramoff, et al. discuss the limits of sensitivity that can be achieved&#xD;
      by any system given the fallibility of ground truth based on multiple human readers. He&#xD;
      suggests that 0.85 is the limit of sensitivity that one can achieve. The specificity is based&#xD;
      on the efficiency that we seek in order to make this implementation commercially viable. We&#xD;
      have designed our study to achieve 0.90 statistical power and 0.99 significance level. If&#xD;
      confidence limits are based on asymptotic normal distribution theory, then sample sizes can&#xD;
      be based on the asymptotic variance formulae, as given by Pepe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective One: Objective one is to test fully the study data flow logistics and information&#xD;
      transfer interfaces. The testing will be done entirely at one recruitment, enrollment and&#xD;
      imaging site. The duration of time to complete this objective is three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Research Design for Objective One: Subjects will be recruited from single site.&#xD;
      All images will be routed to two readers for grading. If the two readers assign equivalent&#xD;
      grades to the image, a generated report will be given to the clinic to distribute the&#xD;
      referring physician. For cases in which the readers assign different grades for the same&#xD;
      image, the image will be routed to an adjudicator for resolution. The adjudicator will have&#xD;
      access to the reports generated by each reader, but not the risk levels from the&#xD;
      RiskAnalyzer. A report from the adjudicator will be generated and reported to the clinic that&#xD;
      will be responsible for distributing the report to the Subject and for any further follow-up.&#xD;
      Images will also be de-identified and routed to the RiskAnalyzer. The RiskAnalyzer will&#xD;
      perform its analysis of the image and generate a risk stratification of either &quot;Low risk&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;High risk&quot; for diabetic retinopathy. A report containing the risk levels assigned by the&#xD;
      RiskAnalyzer will not be distributed to the referring physician, clinic or adjudicator but&#xD;
      used only for statistical analysis in support of the endpoints of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes for Objective One: Data outcomes will demonstrate the ability to recruit and enroll&#xD;
      subject into the study at a single site, perform retinal imaging, upload the images to a&#xD;
      PACS, have the same images graded by two different readers, when necessary routed and graded&#xD;
      by an adjudicator and the ability to generate a final report. The reading process followed by&#xD;
      the readers is based on the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Disease Severity&#xD;
      Scale. Additionally data will demonstrate that images are successfully routed to the&#xD;
      RiskAnalyzer for processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective Two: Objective two is to evaluate the efficacy of the RiskAnalyzer to identify the&#xD;
      risk of Diabetic Retinopathy in comparison to the gold standard. The duration of time to&#xD;
      complete this objective is nine months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Research Design for Objective Two: Subjects are recruited from multiple&#xD;
      CommuniCare and Project ECHO sites. All images are graded by two readers and an adjudicator&#xD;
      should the grading by the first and second reader not be in agreement. The reading process&#xD;
      followed by the readers is based on the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Disease&#xD;
      Severity Scale. A consensus report generated by the readers or the adjudicator indicating&#xD;
      presence and severity of diabetic retinopathy will be given to the Subject through their&#xD;
      referring physician and referred to a specialist if necessary by the referring physician. The&#xD;
      same images graded by the readers will also be routed to the RiskAnalyzer for processing&#xD;
      which will generate a risk level of either &quot;Low risk&quot; or &quot;High risk&quot; for diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy. As the images are routed to the RiskAnalyzer, the images will be de-identified&#xD;
      and sequestered until evaluated by the RiskAnalyzer. Risk levels obtained by use of the&#xD;
      RiskAnalyzer will not be given to the Subject under any circumstances. The referring&#xD;
      physician is also masked from the risk levels assigned by the RiskAnalyzer. Referring&#xD;
      physicians are not co-located at VisionQuest Biomedical and therefore will not have any&#xD;
      access to the computers or data storage area for the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes for Objective Two: Statistical analysis will indicate the accuracy level of the&#xD;
      RiskAnalyzer as compared to the gold standard. Statistical analysis will use sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity, AUC, and a level of agreement using Cohen's kappa coefficients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective Three: Objective three will address the primary endpoint of the trial which is to&#xD;
      demonstrate that the reader's accuracy in grading images is enhanced when risk levels from&#xD;
      the algorithm are made available to the reader while performing the grading of the images.&#xD;
      The duration of time to complete this objective is 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Research Design for Objective Three: The RiskAnalyzer will be used as a first&#xD;
      reader. There will continue to be two human readers and an adjudicator. Ground Truth will be&#xD;
      established by either the agreement of reader one with reader two or by an adjudicator. All&#xD;
      images will be routed to the RiskAnalyzer which will generate a risk level of either &quot;Low&#xD;
      risk&quot; or &quot;High risk&quot; for diabetic retinopathy. The cases will be divided into two sets and&#xD;
      routed to both readers. One set of images will be routed to both readers with the algorithm&#xD;
      assigned risk levels while the other set of images will be routed to both readers without the&#xD;
      algorithm assigned risk level. An equivalent number of 'Low risk&quot; and &quot;High risk&quot; cases will&#xD;
      be selected for each set of images. Ground Truth is established by the two readers assigning&#xD;
      the same grade to the same image. When different grades are assigned to the same image by two&#xD;
      different readers, the cases will be routed to an adjudicator for grading and reporting. The&#xD;
      adjudication will become ground truth. The cases that will be adjudicated will only be those&#xD;
      that are different categories of risk stages. Adjudication will be based on the clinical&#xD;
      significance of the disagreement between the readers as follows: cases within severity scales&#xD;
      0 and 1 will be classified as &quot;Low Risk&quot; cases, while cases within the severity scales 2 and&#xD;
      above will be classified as &quot;High Risk&quot; cases. Cases needing adjudication will be those&#xD;
      differing in risk and those within the High Risk Category that differ between scales 2 and 3&#xD;
      (mild and severe), and 2 and 4 (mild and proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy -PDR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes for Objective Three: The outcomes from objective three will establish that the&#xD;
      RiskAnalyzer improves the reading accuracy and consistency between readers and decreases bias&#xD;
      between human readers. Statistical Analysis of level of agreement will be performed on the&#xD;
      risk assigned to the images by the readers when having and not having the risk levels&#xD;
      assigned by the algorithm using Cohen's kappa coefficients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes: Telemedicine retinal screening in conjunction with risk levels from the&#xD;
      RiskAnalyzer improve the accuracy of readers when grading images. The use of risk levels&#xD;
      assigned by the RiskAnalyzer in assisting the readers will decrease the amount of time&#xD;
      readers dedicate to the grading of each case. This may be a model to support the increase of&#xD;
      access to retinal screening, support compliance with retinal screening recommendations and&#xD;
      facilitate a more efficient use of the retinal specialist to evaluate and treat disease&#xD;
      leading to a more cost efficient method of care.&#xD;
