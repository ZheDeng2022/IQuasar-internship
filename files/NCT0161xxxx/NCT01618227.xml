  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loss of wrist flexion and extension is a common problem after wrist and forearm fractures&#xD;
      that may lead to disability and unsatisfactory outcomes after fracture treatment. In many&#xD;
      patients, this range of motion loss is caused by stiffness of the soft tissues. Such&#xD;
      stiffness may loosen up and improve with rehabilitation. Static progressive splints apply a&#xD;
      constant stretch upon the wrist resulting in a stretch relaxation and plastic deformation of&#xD;
      the soft tissues. By altering the splint's bending angle, one can incrementally increase the&#xD;
      force applied on either wrist flexion or extension. There are no data comparing&#xD;
      rehabilitation with static-progressive splinting to rehabilitation without static-progressive&#xD;
      splinting for the restoration of wrist flexion and extension after wrist or forearm&#xD;
      fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two months after study enrollment patients that use static progressive splinting have better&#xD;
      wrist flexion and extension than patients that use standard therapy techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Six months after study enrollment, subjects that use static progressive splinting have&#xD;
           better wrist flexion and extension than those that use standard therapy techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Motion at enrollment, 2 months and 6 months after enrollment correlates with negative&#xD;
           pain thoughts, pain anxiety, and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Six months after study enrollment, subjects that use static progressive splinting have&#xD;
           had fewer physical/occupational therapy visits than those that use standard therapy&#xD;
           techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Six months after study enrollment patients that use static progressive splinting have&#xD;
           had fewer additional surgeries than patients that use standard therapy techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will employ a prospective randomized design. Subjects will be invited to enroll&#xD;
      during their routine office follow-up visit. Informed consent will be obtained. Subjects will&#xD;
      be randomized on a 1:1 ratio to rehabilitation with or without static progressive splinting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will have a standard rehabilitation program including physical or occupational&#xD;
      therapy and home exercises throughout the study. The static progressive splint will be&#xD;
      prescribed according to the randomization sequence. Upon receipt of the splint, subjects will&#xD;
      be instructed in proper application and use by their treating therapist or a representative&#xD;
      of the company. Subjects will be instructed to follow the daily splint wearing protocol&#xD;
      provided by the device manufacturer. Use of the splints will be discontinued at the patient's&#xD;
      discretion or when a plateau phase in active range of motion is achieved (defined as no&#xD;
      measurable gains in active range of motion achieved in a 30-day period).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon enrollment, a form containing demographic and injury-related information will be&#xD;
      completed, and the subjects will fill out the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand&#xD;
      (DASH) questionnaire. Subjects will be evaluated for negative pain thoughts, pain anxiety,&#xD;
      and depression. Study staff will supervise and assist with the questionnaires. Subjects will&#xD;
      be evaluated at 2 and 6 months after enrollment during their routine office visits. The DASH&#xD;
      questionnaire will be filled out and active wrist motion will be measured using a standard&#xD;
      goniometer by a research assistant who will not be involved in the care of the patient. The&#xD;
      number of physical/occupational therapy visits, additional surgeries, ease of splint&#xD;
      application and use, and splint protocol compliance will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to study the effectiveness rather than the efficacy of the splint,&#xD;
      which means subjects will be free at all times to pursue an alternative treatment course and&#xD;
      discontinue splint wear. The investigators will use intention to treat analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographs and other diagnostic studies will be obtained at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      surgeon and will not differ from routine clinical care.&#xD;
