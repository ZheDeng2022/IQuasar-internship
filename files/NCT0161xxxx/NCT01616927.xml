  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by progressive cyst&#xD;
      formation in both kidneys, in most patients leading to end stage renal disease. It is the&#xD;
      most common hereditary renal disease with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 1,000 persons.&#xD;
      The majority of patients also have progressive cyst formation in the liver, leading to pain,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal discomfort and sometimes the need for liver transplantation. At present&#xD;
      there is no proven therapeutic intervention to slow the rate of disease progression in human&#xD;
      ADPKD. The development of renoprotective treatments that are well tolerated, is therefore of&#xD;
      major importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this respect, somatostatin analogues are promising for especially polycystic liver&#xD;
      disease, but also for the renal phenotype. However, the studies that have been performed thus&#xD;
      far with these agents, were underpowered and of too short duration to reach a definitive&#xD;
      conclusion on the potential reno- and hepatoprotective efficacy of somatostatin analogues.&#xD;
      Therefore, the present study is designed as a randomised clinical trial with sufficient&#xD;
      duration of follow-up to investigate whether the somatostatin analogue Lanreotide slows&#xD;
      progression of polycystic kidney and liver disease in ADPKD-patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, 300 ADPKD patients, aged 18-60years, with an eGFR 30-60 ml/min/1.73 m2) will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to standard care or monthly subcutaneous lanreotide injections on top off&#xD;
      standard care. These 300 subjects will go through 15 study visits in 3 years and 1 follow up&#xD;
      visit. During these visits, questionnaires will be filled in, physical examinations will be&#xD;
      performed, blood will be drawn and urine collected. After study completion, rate of renal&#xD;
      function decline in lanreotide treated subjects will be compared to that of subject who&#xD;
      received standard care.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, to determine whether Lanreotide attenuates progression of the renal phenotype in ADPKD&#xD;
      patients as measured by change in rate of renal function decline and change in renal volume&#xD;
      growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, to determine whether Lanreotide modifies progression of the liver phenotype in the&#xD;
      subset of ADPKD patients with moderate to severe polycystic liver disease as measured by&#xD;
      change in liver volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator driven, randomized, multi-center, controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      300 subjects, diagnosed with ADPKD, based on the revised Ravine criteria, with advanced&#xD;
      disease and high likelihood of rapid disease progression (eGFR between 30 and 60 ml/min/1.73&#xD;
      m2 and age between 18 and 60 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized (1:1) into two groups. One group will receive a dose of&#xD;
      Lanreotide 120 mg sc every 28 days for 30 months. The dose of Lanreotide will be eGFR (BSA&#xD;
      unadjusted) dependent. Subjects that reach an eGFR &lt;30ml/min during the study will receive&#xD;
      Lanreotide 90 mg sc every 28 days. Down-titration will also occur in case of dose related&#xD;
      side effects. The other group of patients will receive standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in renal function in Lanreotide versus not treated patients, as assessed as slope&#xD;
      through serial eGFR measurements over time during the treatment phase of the trial, with the&#xD;
      value obtained at month 3 as first eGFR value for slope analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main secondary outcome variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine whether Lanreotide modifies ADPKD progression as measured by change in&#xD;
           renal volume in the overall study population,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine whether Lanreotide modifies ADPKD progression as measured by change in&#xD;
           liver volume in the subset of ADPKD patients with moderate to severe polycystic liver&#xD;
           disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine whether Lanreotide changes the quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine whether Lanreotide is well tolerated&#xD;
