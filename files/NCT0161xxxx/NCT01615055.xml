  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many cancer survivors are experiencing problems with memory and other cognitive abilities&#xD;
      following cancer treatment. Little is known concerning the contributions of potentially&#xD;
      preventive therapies on cognitive function, but animal studies have pointed to the potential&#xD;
      value of the medication fluoxetine in this context. We aim to determine whether six months of&#xD;
      fluoxetine therapy can preserve brain function in patients who have undergone chemotherapy,&#xD;
      and examine potential biological mechanisms for its protective effects in humans. If use of&#xD;
      fluoxetine in cancer patients can be validated in this manner, it will represent the first&#xD;
      drug demonstrated to prevent cerebral dysfunction associated with exposure to chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Moreover, as this involves an agent that is already FDA-cleared for other indications, widely&#xD;
      commercially available throughout the U.S. and other parts of the world, and relatively&#xD;
      inexpensive since it is obtainable in generic formulations, it would represent a&#xD;
      pharmacologic approach that is amenable to rapid translation to the clinical setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systematic studies of adverse cognitive and neurobiological changes subsequent to&#xD;
      chemotherapy for lymphoma, breast, and other cancers have attracted substantial interest in&#xD;
      the past decade. Little is known, however, concerning the feasibility and effects of&#xD;
      potentially protective therapies on cerebral function in patients undergoing chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Animal models have recently proved useful in examining some of the toxic effects of&#xD;
      chemotherapy agents on working memory and other abilities, as well as on biological&#xD;
      properties such as proliferation and survival of neuronal precursors involved in hippocampal&#xD;
      neurogenesis. Such models have also proved useful for testing potential neuroprotective&#xD;
      properties of agents given before, during and/or after chemotherapy. For example, impairment&#xD;
      in spatial working memory and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis is induced in rats by the&#xD;
      chemotherapy agent methotrexate, but co-administration of the (FDA-cleared and commercially&#xD;
      available) drug fluoxetine has been shown to counteract the negative long-term effects on&#xD;
      memory and hippocampal neurogenesis otherwise occurring after methotrexate administration. To&#xD;
      determine whether such a strategy could be effective in counteracting effects that&#xD;
      chemotherapy may have on cerebral function in humans, well-controlled experimental data&#xD;
      obtained with cancer patients is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation will employ a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      design, to provide a rigorous test of whether fluoxetine, a drug with a long-standing&#xD;
      excellent safety profile in humans most commonly marketed as an antidepressant, can offer&#xD;
      protection to breast cancer or lymphoma patients against changes in cerebral function&#xD;
      occurring after chemotherapy (Specific Aim 1). It will further provide a test of the&#xD;
      durability of any protective effects beyond the period during which fluoxetine is used, by&#xD;
      re-assessing function approximately 6 months after completion of the regimen (Specific Aim&#xD;
      2). Cerebral function will be assessed by determining distributions of regional cerebral&#xD;
      metabolism, previously demonstrated to sensitively detect functional alterations and closely&#xD;
      reflect diminished cognitive abilities with high statistical power, using positron emission&#xD;
      tomography with the glucose analog radiotracer [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose. Neuropsychologic&#xD;
      testing will be conducted in parallel with neuroimaging studies and, as a step towards&#xD;
      understanding mechanisms underlying neurotoxic effects of chemotherapy and potentially&#xD;
      related to protective effects of fluoxetine, peripheral markers of inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      will be measured in blood samples drawn at the time of neuroimaging (Specific Aim 3). If use&#xD;
      of fluoxetine in cancer patients can be validated in this manner and lead to its adoption in&#xD;
      the clinical setting, it will constitute the first drug with demonstrated utility for the&#xD;
      prevention of cerebral dysfunction associated with exposure to chemotherapy. Moreover, as&#xD;
      this involves an agent that is already FDA-cleared for other indications, widely commercially&#xD;
      available throughout the U.S. and other parts of the world, and relatively inexpensive since&#xD;
      it is obtainable in generic formulations, it would represent a pharmacologic approach that is&#xD;
      amenable to rapid translation to the clinical setting.&#xD;
