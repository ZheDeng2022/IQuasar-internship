  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to better understand the different ways our bodies burn fat&#xD;
      which may be important for obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will examine the hypothesis that overweight/obese individuals&#xD;
      that are unable to meet target weight loss goals on a low calorie diet (LCD) are&#xD;
      intrinsically less metabolically flexible than their weight-losing counterparts. The&#xD;
      investigators expect that this 'inflexibility' will be characterized by impaired fat&#xD;
      oxidation (as determined by indirect calorimetry) in response to caloric restriction. If this&#xD;
      were the case, these subjects may represent a population of 'super-responders' likely to&#xD;
      demonstrate a robust response to approaches to increase fat oxidation. The investigators will&#xD;
      also measure lipid concentrations in skeletal muscle and liver by hydrogen 1 magnetic&#xD;
      resonance (1H-MRS) to determine both the stability of these measurements as well as the&#xD;
      magnitude of changes that can be seen during LCD.&#xD;

Protection Against Risk:&#xD;
Prior to administering any phentermine, a history and physical including EKG will be conducted (at the screening visit) and will be used to determine whether the participant is clear to receive the medication.&#xD;
Participants will see the study doctor or nurse practitioner at every study visit after the drug is initiated.</description>

          <description>After screening, obese subjects (BMI &gt;27- ≤40.0) subjects will be started on a low calorie diet (approximately 900-1000 kcal/d) until a target weight loss is achieved. Individuals not on track to achieve their target weight by four weeks will receive the drug Phentermine to promote weight loss. Then, following eight weeks LCD (or four weeks LCD + four weeks LCD+Phentermine), in the event that they did not achieve the target weight loss, subjects will be given the option to continue with the LCD + Phentermine for up to an additional 12 weeks, under a doctor's supervision.&#xD;

          <description>After screening, obese subjects (BMI &gt;27 - ≤40.0) subjects will be started on a low calorie diet (approximately 900-1000 kcal/d) until a target weight loss is achieved. Individuals not on track to achieve their target weight by four weeks will receive the drug Phentermine to promote weight loss. Then, following eight weeks LCD (or four weeks LCD + four weeks LCD+Phentermine), in the event that they did not achieve the target weight loss, subjects will be given the option to continue with the LCD + Phentermine for up to an additional 12 weeks, under a doctor's supervision.&#xD;
