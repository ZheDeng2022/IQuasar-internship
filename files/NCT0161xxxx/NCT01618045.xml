    <textblock>
      Fermented Papaya Preparation (FPP) is a sweet and granular substance available over the&#xD;
      counter. FPP possesses antioxidant properties, which provide benefit against age-related&#xD;
      complications, and is also known to protect red blood cells (RBCs) against oxidative damage&#xD;
      and to help protect against severe forms of thalassemia. The investigators recently showed&#xD;
      that ex vivo supplementation of FPP can correct respiratory burst performance of diabetic&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) via a Sp-1 dependant pathway. Based on these&#xD;
      observations, the investigators propose to study the outcome that FPP supplementation has in&#xD;
      patients with diabetes.&#xD;

      Fermented Papaya Preparation (FPP) possesses antioxidant properties, which provide benefit&#xD;
      against age-related complications. FPP is also known to protect red blood cells (RBCs)&#xD;
      against oxidative damage and to help protect against severe forms of thalassemia. Several&#xD;
      independent observations convergently point toward the hypothesis that treatment with papaya&#xD;
      preparations may facilitate wound healing responses. Chronic wounds in patients with diabetes&#xD;
      represent a major public health problem. Previous studies from the investigators have&#xD;
      demonstrated that wound-site macrophages from patients with diabetes are compromised in their&#xD;
      ability to support wound healing. Recently, our laboratory reported the first evidence&#xD;
      demonstrating that FPP may improve diabetic wound outcomes by specifically influencing the&#xD;
      response of wound-site macrophages and the subsequent angiogenic response. FPP has a long&#xD;
      track record of safe human consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the current study is to determine whether FPP is able to improve inducible&#xD;
      respiratory burst outcomes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of participants with&#xD;
      diabetes. Our investigators have recently reported that supplementation with standardized&#xD;
      fermented papaya preparation (FPP) in adult diabetic mice improves dermal wound healing&#xD;
      outcomes. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by type 2 diabetics (T2DM) PBMC is&#xD;
      markedly inhibited compared to that of the PBMC from non-diabetic donors. We observed that ex&#xD;
      vivo FPP supplementation corrected such inhibition in ROS production by PBMC from T2DM&#xD;
      donors. Therefore, based on these observations, the investigators propose to study the&#xD;
      outcome that FPP supplementation has in patients with diabetes.&#xD;
