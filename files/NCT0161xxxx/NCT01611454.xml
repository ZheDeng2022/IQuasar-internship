      The PREFER II trial has three main objectives. The primary objective of the trial is to show&#xD;
      how much radiation attenuation is provided by XPF thyroid collars in absolute and relative&#xD;
      terms. The secondary objective of the study is to measure and compare the amount of radiation&#xD;
      that interventional radiologists are exposed to per case in an interventional suite setting&#xD;
      using FDA approved XPF thyroid collars or standard 0.5 mm Pb equivalent thyroid collars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third objective is to assess the operator comfort wearing the XPF protection devices. In&#xD;
      order to achieve these objectives, measurements will be performed in 150 consecutive&#xD;
      interventional procedures requiring C-arm fluoroscopy performed at BCVI. A prospective&#xD;
      randomization will be performed, assigning participants to wear their own standard 0.5 mm Pb&#xD;
      equivalent thyroid collar or to wear the FDA approved XPF thyroid collar. Radiation exposure&#xD;
      will be monitored with 2 radiation detectors (TLDs, one inside and one outside the thyroid&#xD;
      collar) which the participant is required to wear. After each procedure the participant will&#xD;
      be asked to rate the comfort of wearing the devices on a scale from 1 to 100.&#xD;

    <description>Radiation attenuation. The null hypothesis is that the XPF thyroid collar is equal to the standard 0.5mm Pb lead equivalent thyroid collar with regard to radiation attenuation/transmission in relative (%) terms. The alternative hypothesis is that the XPF thyroid collar is superior or inferior to the standard thyroid collar. Based on our results obtained during the 60 procedures (PREFER trial), 150 procedures are required to demonstrate a significant difference with an alpha level of 5% and a power of 80%. Radiation attenuation percentage is measure by interrogation of the lead attenuates X-rays counter required to be used in all interventional radiology clinical procedures by each physician operator. The interrogation is done by measuring the energy imparted per unit mass in the counter wore by ionizing radiation to matter at the specified point. The International System of Units (SI) unit of absorbed dose is the joule per kilogram.</description>

    <description>Operators are asked directly after each procedure to rate the wearing comfort, graded worst to best. 0 means low comfort (worse outcome) and 100 is the best comfort level (best outcome) with wearing the collar.</description>

    <description>(day 1) Operators are asked directly after each procedure to rate the wearing comfort Radiation exposure will be monitored with radiation detectors (TLDs, 2 attached to the collar) which the participant is required to wear. Exposure is measured as the energy imparted per unit mass by ionizing radiation to the matter at the specified time of the procedure. The International System of Units (SI) unit of absorbed dose is the joule per kilogram. The special name for this unit is the gray (Gy). For purposes of radiation protection and assessing dose or risk to humans in general terms, the quantity normally calculated is the mean absorbed dose in an organ or tissue.</description>

        <description>(day 1) Operators are asked directly after each procedure to rate the wearing comfort Radiation exposure will be monitored with radiation detectors (TLDs, 2 attached to the collar) which the participant is required to wear. Exposure is measured as the energy imparted per unit mass by ionizing radiation to the matter at the specified time of the procedure. The International System of Units (SI) unit of absorbed dose is the joule per kilogram. The special name for this unit is the gray (Gy). For purposes of radiation protection and assessing dose or risk to humans in general terms, the quantity normally calculated is the mean absorbed dose in an organ or tissue.</description>
