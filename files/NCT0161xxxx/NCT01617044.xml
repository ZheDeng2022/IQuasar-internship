      A double-blind randomized controlled trial comparing iron plus vitamin C plus probiotic&#xD;
      (lactobacillus plantarum 299) to iron plus vitamin C plus placebo in correcting the iron&#xD;
      deficiency in children with Restless leg syndrome (RLS) and iron deficiency. One hundred&#xD;
      children with diagnosis of RLS will be recruited over a two- year period.&#xD;

      Project Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency in the world and is associated&#xD;
      with significant adverse health effects including: cognitive deficits, immune deficiency,&#xD;
      anemia, fatigue, and increased mortality. RLS affects 5 to 10% of adults in the United States&#xD;
      and 2% of children. The prevalence of RLS in children with attention deficit hyperactivity&#xD;
      disorder (ADHD) is estimated to be 12 to 35%. Iron deficiency has been recognized as an&#xD;
      important factor in RLS, and the current recommendation for adults and children with RLS is&#xD;
      to maintain serum ferritin level above 50 mcg/l. A common problem in the treatment of iron&#xD;
      deficiency is that oral iron is poorly absorbed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotics are a group of microorganisms that benefit the host and are available naturally in&#xD;
      fermented foods or as oral supplements. Naturally occurring probiotics, such as yogurt have&#xD;
      been used to promote human health for millennia. Probiotic oral supplements have been proven&#xD;
      effective and are currently approved for use in pediatrics in the treatment of: acute&#xD;
      diarrhea, antibiotic associated diarrhea, and atopy associated with cow milk allergy; and&#xD;
      there is some evidence that probiotics may be useful in the treatment of irritable bowel&#xD;
      syndrome and necrotizing enterocolitis. In studies in adults, and in cell culture&#xD;
      experiments, probiotics have improved iron absorption, but this question has never been&#xD;
      studied in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to compare the standard treatment for iron deficiency in children&#xD;
      (supplemental iron plus vitamin C) with RLS; to supplemental iron plus vitamin C plus&#xD;
      probiotics in a randomized, double-blind randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To improve the treatment of iron deficiency using oral iron, vitamin C, and probiotics&#xD;
           in children with RLS and iron deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the safety and monitor for adverse side effects during treatment with&#xD;
           probiotics in children with RLS and iron deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research question that this study will address is whether the addition of a specific&#xD;
      strain of probiotics (lactobacillus plantarum 299) to the standard treatment of iron&#xD;
      deficiency (supplemental iron + Vitamin C) will improve the treatment of iron deficiency.&#xD;
      Children with RLS are the study population because RLS is a common diagnosis seen in our&#xD;
      sleep center, iron deficiency is a known trigger for RLS, and the current standard of care in&#xD;
      the evaluation of patients with RLS is to check serum ferritin level at the time of diagnosis&#xD;
      and to treat with supplemental iron if the serum ferritin is &lt; 50 mcg/l. However, the&#xD;
      implications of this study go far beyond the treatment of children with RLS and iron&#xD;
      deficiency.&#xD;
