      The overall objective of the CHANGE initiative is to change the delivery of care in primary&#xD;
      care clinics to treat disease by reducing reliance on drugs and hospitals through the&#xD;
      promotion of scientifically validated nutritional concepts and exercise. Specifically, the&#xD;
      objective is to identify patients from primary care clinics with metabolic syndrome who are&#xD;
      not morbidly obese and use diet and exercise interventions to reverse the changes, reduce&#xD;
      reliance on pharmacotherapy and prevent progression to diabetes and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension, cardiovascular disease, strokes, diabetes and their complications including&#xD;
      renal failure and neuropathy are major contributors to healthcare costs1. Metabolic Syndrome,&#xD;
      a widespread genetic trait refers to a group of factors that increase risk for these&#xD;
      diseases. Progression of the components of the metabolic syndrome can be significantly&#xD;
      reduced by dietary manipulation and exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aging population, with both metabolic syndrome and muscular weakness, is going to result&#xD;
      in an enormous social and financial burden not only for medical care but also for families&#xD;
      caring for such patients. Existing knowledge would suggest that dietary modification and&#xD;
      exercise training would substantially reduce the costs and complications of these medical&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Canadian Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cardiometabolic risk identify&#xD;
      patients with metabolic syndrome who have an increased risk of cardiac and vascular disease&#xD;
      and diabetes but the application of these results to prevent disease has been a dismal&#xD;
      failure in general and in particular, in our country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current model of advice about preventive care is through family doctors (FD) in the&#xD;
      primary care setting. FDs tend not to advise their patients about diet and exercise for a&#xD;
      variety of reasons including a lack of education about these modalities, a lack of support&#xD;
      from professionals qualified to assess and advise about diet and exercise, the belief that&#xD;
      drugs are better, lack of time and a lack of reimbursement in addition to patient barriers to&#xD;
      adoption. Although other factors, such has smoking, hypercoagulability and increased&#xD;
      expression of proinflammatory cytokines increase cardiometabolic risk, these changes are&#xD;
      closely related to the metabolic syndrome. &quot;Health behavior interventions&quot; are identified as&#xD;
      critical to preventing the occurrence of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. These&#xD;
      interventions can be associated with appropriate pharmacotherapy where required. The&#xD;
      guidelines recommend a multidisciplinary team to manage these interventions. In addition it&#xD;
      is also recommended that ethnicity be considered in these interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The various traits associated with the metabolic syndrome are strongly influenced by genetic&#xD;
      factors, i.e. the heritability of abdominal obesity and insulin resistance are estimated to&#xD;
      be as high as 70%. Accordingly, the investigators propose to examine numerous genetic&#xD;
      polymorphisms (also referred to as markers) that have been linked to the various traits&#xD;
      associated with metabolic syndrome in a sub study. It is hypothesized that these markers can&#xD;
      be used as a means to better predict the variable responses observed in individuals following&#xD;
      a lifestyle intervention. Several companies have begun to commercialize direct-to-consumer&#xD;
      genetic-testing to provide nutritional counseling to individuals based on the analysis of a&#xD;
      small subset of polymorphisms11; however, there is an absence of scientific research to&#xD;
      either support or refute the value of genetic markers for predicting an individual's&#xD;
      response. Considering common genetic markers in a lifestyle intervention study will enable us&#xD;
      to assess their value for predicting response.&#xD;

    <description>Metabolic syndrome risk score is a composite continuous score that measures the severity of metabolic syndrome as a continuous variable rather than dichotomized with arbitrary cut-points . The score is the principal component of waist circumference, glucose, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides. It has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 with higher score meaning greater risk.

          <description>The HEI-Canadian measures the adequacy of diet and the moderation of diet according to Canada's Food Guide on a scale of 0-100 points. Adequacy of diet ranges from a scale of 0-60 points; 0 points are assigned for a minimum or less, 5 or 10 points for maximum or more, and proportional for amounts between minimum and maximum. Moderation of diet ranges from a score of 0-40 points; 10 or 20 points are assigned for minimum or less, 0 points are assigned for maximum or more, and proportional for amounts between minimum and maximum. A higher HEI-Canadian score indicates a higher diet quality.</description>

        <title>Changes in Continuous Metabolic Syndrome Risk Score</title>
        <description>Metabolic syndrome risk score is a composite continuous score that measures the severity of metabolic syndrome as a continuous variable rather than dichotomized with arbitrary cut-points . The score is the principal component of waist circumference, glucose, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides. It has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 with higher score meaning greater risk.
