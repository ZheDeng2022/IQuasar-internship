  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether 6% hypertonic saline (HS) is a safe and&#xD;
      effective preventive therapy in newborns and infants with cystic fibrosis (CF).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) remains one of the most common lethal genetic diseases in Europe and&#xD;
      North America. Despite a substantial increase in life expectancy over the past decades, many&#xD;
      CF patients still die during young adulthood due to chronic progressive CF lung disease that&#xD;
      is caused by defective fluid transport by airway epithelia causing dehydration of airway&#xD;
      surfaces, which in turn leads to impaired mucociliary clearance, chronic airway mucus&#xD;
      obstruction, inflammation and infection. Recent evidence from studies in a mouse model of CF&#xD;
      lung disease suggest that preventive improvement of airway surface hydration may be an&#xD;
      effective treatment of early and reversible mucus obstruction and inflammation, and thus&#xD;
      delay or ameliorate progressive damage in lungs of CF patients. Hypertonic saline (HS) is an&#xD;
      osmotic agent that improves airway surface hydration, and inhalation of 6% HS is already an&#xD;
      established, safe, and effective maintenance therapy that improves mucociliary clearance and&#xD;
      lung function, and reduces pulmonary exacerbations in older children (&gt; 6 years) and adults&#xD;
      with chronic CF lung disease and fixed lung damage. However, the effect of HS as a preventive&#xD;
      therapy has not been studied, and no other therapies are available for preventive improvement&#xD;
      of airway dehydration and mucociliary dysfunction in CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigator initiated clinical trial is a monocentric, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      controlled pilot study on safety and efficacy of a preventive and early inhalation with HS in&#xD;
      newborns and infants with CF who are diagnosed in the newborn period either by CF newborn&#xD;
      screening (CF-NBS) or for another reason (e.g. meconium ileus) and are younger than 4 months&#xD;
      of age at the time of enrolment. Participating patients will be randomized to 6% HS or 0.9%&#xD;
      isotonic saline (IS) as active comparator. In both groups, patients will inhale their study&#xD;
      solution twice daily over 52 weeks. At the beginning, during and at the end of the study,&#xD;
      different measurements will be undertaken to determine effects of HS on safety, radiologic&#xD;
      and/or functional alterations of the lung, number of exacerbations, time to first detection&#xD;
      of a CF pathogen, and health-related quality of life. We expect that the results of this&#xD;
      study will provide first evidence on the safety and efficacy of a preventive therapy that&#xD;
      improves airway surface hydration and targets a CF basic defect and may thus delay and/or&#xD;
      ameliorate chronic damage of the lungs of patients with CF.&#xD;
