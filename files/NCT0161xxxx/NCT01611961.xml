    <textblock>
      Docetaxel Lipid Microsphere (DT-LM) is a novel proprietary delivery system of docetaxel&#xD;
      developed by Shenyang Pharmaceutical University. In this Phase I study, the DT-LM was&#xD;
      evaluated for the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in patients&#xD;
      with advance solid tumors. It was also evaluated for pharmacokinetic and anti-tumor effects&#xD;
      of DT-LM compared to commerical docetaxel.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Docetaxel (currently marketed as Taxotere®), given by intravenous or intraperitoneal&#xD;
      injection, has contributed significantly to the treatment of a variety of malignancies, such&#xD;
      as ovarian, breast, gastric, and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as head and neck&#xD;
      cancer and some other cancers. In the preclinical, DT-LM showed reduced toxicity (especially&#xD;
      myelosuppression）and comparable therapeutic efficacy. In clinic, it is believed that DT-LM&#xD;
      will offer fewer side effects to the patient at similar doses, and possibly greater&#xD;
      effectiveness when used at higher doses. DT-LM could not only avoid the serious&#xD;
      hypersensitivity reactions caused by Tween 80, but also be stable, safe and convenient for&#xD;
      clinical administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to determine the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of DT-LM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel following intravenous administration of DT-LM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any anti-tumor effects of DT-LM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controlled trial is also carrying out to reveal the differences in safety, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamics between DT-LM and Taxotere.&#xD;

    <description>This Phase I, open-label, control,dose-escalation study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of DT-LM in patients with advanced cancer. DT-LM was administered by intravenous infusion, over 1 hour, once every 21 days until occurrence of disease progression or toxicity requiring early treatment discontinuation. Dose escalation was not done until the safety and tolerability at a given dose level has been confirmed.</description>
