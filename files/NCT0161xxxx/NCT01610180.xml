      With conventional treatments (i.e. iv Ig, steroids) the overall response rate of ITP&#xD;
      secondary to LPD is generally lower than in primary ITP, and usually not higher than 50% (95%&#xD;
      CI 27-72). Eltrombopag which has proved very effective in primary ITP could be effective also&#xD;
      in ITP secondary to LPDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This novel ITP specific treatment might spare these patients not only from bleeding risk but&#xD;
      also from toxic or inappropriate cytotoxic therapies, not otherwise demanded by the burden of&#xD;
      the underlying disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The denomination of Chronic Lymphoproliferative Disorders (LPD) encompasses a variety of&#xD;
      indolent lymphomas grouped into a single clinical category and, as such, this terminology is&#xD;
      not included in the current WHO classification. With indolent lymphomas clinicians refer to&#xD;
      those lymphomas not associated with an aggressive clinical course and in which often&#xD;
      treatment can be delayed. Specifically the following lymphomas by the WHO classification will&#xD;
      be considered among indolent lymphomas: small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
      leukemia, follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma,&#xD;
      lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, hairy-cell leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma. In 1 to 5% of the&#xD;
      different LPDs (lowest in follicular lymphoma, highest in chronic lymphocytic leukemia) a&#xD;
      clinically relevant thrombocytopenia, often complicated by bleeding symptoms, may complicate&#xD;
      the clinical course, frequently still when the tumor burden is low and not demanding&#xD;
      treatment. This thrombocytopenia, when not accompanied by massive bone marrow tumor&#xD;
      infiltration or not secondary to chemotherapeutic treatment, is thought to share an immune&#xD;
      pathogenic mechanism similar to primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With conventional treatments (i.e. iv Ig, steroids) the overall response rate of ITP&#xD;
      secondary to LPD is generally lower than in primary ITP, and usually not higher than 50% (95%&#xD;
      CI 27-72). Therefore, any new treatment having a response rate above 50% but not inferior&#xD;
      than 20% could be considered a promising treatment for ITP secondary to LPD. Furthermore, no&#xD;
      significant platelet increase is expected without treatment in ITP secondary to LPD.&#xD;
      Eltrombopag which has proved very effective in primary ITP could be effective also in ITP&#xD;
      secondary to LPDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This novel ITP specific treatment might spare these patients not only from bleeding risk but&#xD;
      also from toxic or inappropriate cytotoxic therapies, not otherwise demanded by the burden of&#xD;
      the underlying disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2, single arm, open-label, prospective, multicenter, safety/efficacy study.&#xD;
