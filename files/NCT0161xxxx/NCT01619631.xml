  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) that&#xD;
      provides the feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy data required to design a large&#xD;
      scale trial evaluating Tai Chi for Chinese Americans with major depressive disorder (MDD) who&#xD;
      are not on antidepressant medications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim #1: To evaluate the feasibility and safety of conducting a RCT of Tai Chi for Chinese&#xD;
      American adults with MDD who are not on antidepressant medications. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that: a) the investigators can develop a Tai Chi intervention and&#xD;
      depression-related measurement protocol for Chinese Americans with MDD; b) the investigators&#xD;
      will be able to recruit non-pharmacologically treated Chinese Americans with MDD to&#xD;
      participate in a randomized controlled Tai Chi study; c) participants will be compliant with&#xD;
      the Tai Chi intervention and all testing protocols; d) the Tai Chi intervention will be safe&#xD;
      and study staff will be able to effectively monitor participants' depressive symptoms and&#xD;
      assure their safety during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #2: To collect preliminary data on the efficacy of a 12-week Tai Chi group intervention&#xD;
      for Chinese Americans with MDD who are not on antidepressant medications to determine the&#xD;
      effect size needed for a definitive RCT. The investigators hypothesize that at the conclusion&#xD;
      of 12-weeks, Tai Chi participants, as compared to control subjects, will demonstrate a)&#xD;
      greater improvement in depressive symptoms (Hamilton Depression Severity Index-17, Beck&#xD;
      Depression Inventory), b) greater improvement in functional status, general health, and well&#xD;
      being (Clinical Global Impressions Scale, The SF-36 Health Survey (SF-36®) for social&#xD;
      functioning, Exercise Self-Efficacy, Mindfulness), and c) greater social support&#xD;
      (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #3: To characterize participants' experience in a trial of Tai Chi for Chinese Americans&#xD;
      with MDD in order to optimally design a subsequent, more definitive study. Using mixed&#xD;
      methods (qualitative and quantitative analyses), the investigators will identify the&#xD;
      ethnocultural experience of Tai Chi among Chinese Americans with MDD, assess whether they&#xD;
      view Tai Chi a more culturally acceptable alternative to conventional antidepressant therapy,&#xD;
      explore the facilitators and barriers to adherence to the Tai Chi training protocol, identify&#xD;
      characteristics of responders and non-responders to the Tai Chi intervention, and assess&#xD;
      participants' willingness/intention to continue practice of Tai Chi beyond the study period.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a) characteristics such as severity of illness, age,&#xD;
      co-morbidities, and education level may distinguish responders from non-responders; b)&#xD;
      participants with greater levels of class attendance and home practice will exhibit greater&#xD;
      improvements in depressive symptoms; and c) participants who continue to practice Tai Chi&#xD;
      after the 12-week training will maintain clinical improvements in depressive symptoms and a&#xD;
      lower rate of relapse at the end of 3 additional months of follow-up compared to those who do&#xD;
      not continue Tai Chi practice.&#xD;
