  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is recognized that endothelial dysfunction is a major factor contributing to the&#xD;
      atherogenic process. Abnormal function of the endothelium is detectable prior to obvious&#xD;
      intimal lesions in patients with risk factors for atherosclerosis. Endothelial dysfunction is&#xD;
      a systemic disorder and a key variable in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and its&#xD;
      complications. Measurement of peripheral vasodilator response with fingertip peripheral&#xD;
      arterial tonometry (PAT) technology (EndoPAT; Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel) is emerging&#xD;
      as a useful method for assessing vascular function. EndoPAT may be a potential valid test&#xD;
      increasing the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for detection of subjects to chest pain&#xD;
      unit (CPU) with chest pain but no obvious coronary artery disease (CAD). This is a relatively&#xD;
      fast non-invasive bedside test, relatively low-cost and has no side effects. Therefore, the&#xD;
      primary objective of the study is to test the hypothesis that abnormal endothelial function&#xD;
      as assessed by EndoPAT testing will increase the prediction of the short (in-hospital) and&#xD;
      long-term (1-year) outcome of patients presenting to the chest pain unit.&#xD;

      All subjects admitted to the CPU with low to moderate probability for CAD and negative&#xD;
      troponin, will undergo the following tests upon arrival following clinical evaluation and&#xD;
      their consenting to the study: resting ECG, EndoPAT testing and then after stress nuclear&#xD;
      imaging or stress echocardiography. Except for EndoPAT testing, all other tests will be&#xD;
      conducted according to the routine CPU protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the EndoPAT will be blinded to the treating physician until the end of the&#xD;
      study and all patients will be managed according to the current CPU protocol, including 24-h&#xD;
      Holter monitoring, repeat resting ECG and exercise tests (nuclear SPECT imaging or stress&#xD;
      echocardiography, whichever is available) in addition to repeat clinical and troponin tests&#xD;
      evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical data of the recruited subjects the will be recorded and evaluated after&#xD;
      completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term clinical follow-up All patients will be followed by telephone contact after 6 and&#xD;
      12 months for combined major adverse cardiovascular end-points (MACE) which include all-cause&#xD;
      mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure or angina&#xD;
      pectoris, stroke, coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary interventions, by&#xD;
      physicians who will be blinded to the patients' baseline clinical status and endothelial&#xD;
      function (assessed by EndoPAT) results. All MACE will be validated by review of medical&#xD;
      records by senior cardiologists blinded to the endothelial function results. In addition,&#xD;
      on-line access to this information will facilitate verification and safe documentation of all&#xD;
      events. In addition, written medical records will be reviewed by cardiologists in the event&#xD;
      of any death, hospitalization and/or angina pectoris.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study the cost effectiveness on prediction of short (in-hospital) and long&#xD;
      (6 months, and 1 year) of EndoPAT will be assessed and will be compared to the stress tests&#xD;
      (nuclear imaging and/or echocardiography).&#xD;
