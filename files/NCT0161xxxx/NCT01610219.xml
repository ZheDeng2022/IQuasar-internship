    <textblock>
      The number of youth with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is rising in the population, which is a&#xD;
      concerning public health trend. There has been little research testing ways to prevent the&#xD;
      development of this disease in children who are at increased risk to develop T2D. This study&#xD;
      tests a family treatment program that treats 4-8 year old children who are at risk for T2D&#xD;
      because they are overweight and have a family history of the disease. Sixty at risk children&#xD;
      and their parents were assigned to one of 2 treatment conditions. Half of the families&#xD;
      (randomly determined) received an intensive family treatment program that trains parents in&#xD;
      how to increase healthier foods choices and physical activity for themselves and their&#xD;
      children using &quot;behavior modification&quot; strategies. Children receiving this treatment were&#xD;
      allowed to taste new fruits and vegetables used a pedometer to record how far they walked&#xD;
      every day, and were given a &quot;tool box&quot; of toys and interactive games which promoted physical&#xD;
      activity. The other half of the families only received instruction about healthier choices,&#xD;
      but received no behavioral modification strategies or physical activity promotion tools.&#xD;
      Improvements in children's body weight, blood measures, and behavior patterns were measured&#xD;
      after treatment ended (6 months) and then again after 12 months. The results may lead to a&#xD;
      better understanding of how family members can positively influence young children's&#xD;
      behaviors to help prevent T2D. The objective of proposed study was to test a family-based&#xD;
      intervention designed to reduce excess body weight, improve metabolic and cardiovascular&#xD;
      profile, and improve diet and physical activity levels in 4 - 8 year old youth who are &quot;at&#xD;
      risk&quot; for T2D. This intervention was tested in a 2-arm randomized controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compared to children receiving NPA, children receiving LMDP will show greater reductions&#xD;
           in excess body weight, greater improvements in metabolic and cardiovascular measures,&#xD;
           improved diet, increased physical activity, and reduced television viewing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Greater reductions in child excess body weight will be associated with greater&#xD;
           improvements in metabolic and cardiovascular measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compared to parents receiving the NPA intervention, parents receiving the LMDP&#xD;
           intervention will show greater reductions in BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Greater improvements in parent BMI will be associated with greater improvements in child&#xD;
           body composition, metabolic and cardiovascular measures, and behavioral outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compared to families receiving the NPA intervention, families receiving the LMDP&#xD;
           intervention will show an increase in the number of fruits and vegetables and lower&#xD;
           energy density foods stored at home.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is mounting concern about the development of Type 2 diabetes (T2D) in youth, especially&#xD;
      in light of rising childhood obesity rates at younger ages. The health costs of T2D are&#xD;
      notable both for the individual and society, and so interventions that can help prevent the&#xD;
      development of T2D in early life are needed. Fortunately, there is promising evidence from&#xD;
      the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and other randomized trials with adults that the onset&#xD;
      of T2D can be prevented through sustainable lifestyle changes. However, intervention programs&#xD;
      have not been tested in young children who are &quot;at risk&quot; for developing the disease, even&#xD;
      though this may be a critical period for obesity onset and for the formation of early eating&#xD;
      and physical activity habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the proposed study was to test a family-based intervention that targets&#xD;
      improvements in excess weight gain, metabolic and cardiovascular profile, and diet and&#xD;
      physical activity in 4 - 8 year old children who are &quot;at risk&quot; for T2D. Specifically, 60&#xD;
      families were randomized either to one of two treatments: Lifestyle Modification for Diabetes&#xD;
      Prevention (LMDP, N= 30) or Nutrition and Physical Activity Information (NPA, N= 30). The&#xD;
      LMDP intervention trained families in behavioral strategies to increase parent and child&#xD;
      intake of fruits, vegetables, and high fiber foods, to limit intake of energy-dense foods,&#xD;
      and to increase daily physical activity. A physical activity &quot;tool kit&quot; for the home&#xD;
      environment was provided to families. Supporting information about T2D and obesity, as well&#xD;
      as nutrition and physical activity, also were provided. Besides the participating&#xD;
      parent-child pair, other adult family members with T2D (eg, grandparents, aunts, uncles) were&#xD;
      encouraged to participate. The LMDP activities were intended to reduce children's excess body&#xD;
      weight and improve their metabolic and cardiovascular measures, to help prevent the onset of&#xD;
      insulin resistance. The NPA intervention only received basic information on T2D and obesity,&#xD;
      and nutrition and physical activity recommendations. Changes in child body composition,&#xD;
      metabolic and cardiovascular measures, and behavioral outcomes were evaluated at 6 months&#xD;
      (ie, end-of-treatment) and 12 months (ie, follow up). Changes in parent weight status and the&#xD;
      home food environment were secondary outcomes and were assessed as potential mediators of&#xD;
      child outcomes.&#xD;
