  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Between 1994-98 5 hospitals in Stockholm investigated calcaneal fractures in a randomised&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      82 patients were included and randomized either to non-surgical treatment or surgical&#xD;
      management with extensile lateral approach and reduction with Internal fixation (ORIF) The&#xD;
      patients were followed and investigated at fixed intervals 2 weeks, 8 weeks, 3 months and 6&#xD;
      months for clinical review. At 1 year and 8-12 years (mean 10 years) post-injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both clinical radiological data were collected and several scores were used. The primary&#xD;
      outcomes scores used were SF-36 and VAS score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results after 1 year and mean 10 years are presented.&#xD;

      The study was approved by the local ethical committee. Seven trauma orthopaedic surgeons in&#xD;
      five hospitals in Stockholm were recruited in this RCT, which was conducted between 1994 and&#xD;
      1998. Patients presented with &gt; 2mm DIACFs verified by axial and coronal computerized&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scan were considered for inclusion. Exclusion criteria included peripheral&#xD;
      neuro-vascular disease (signs and symptoms of ischemia or neuropathy), open fractures,&#xD;
      uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and medical contra-indications to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All centers used the same study protocol. Demographic data were obtained from the patients,&#xD;
      as they deemed eligible to participate in the study. Informed consent was obtained from each&#xD;
      patient. Randomization was carried out by sealed opaque envelope to choose surgical vs.&#xD;
      conservative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical treatment was carried out within 2 weeks post-injury when the local soft tissue&#xD;
      swelling subsided. Surgery included open reduction using the lateral extensile approach&#xD;
      according to Benirschke (ref) and manipulation of the fragments as described by Soeur and&#xD;
      Remy (ref) to achieve anatomical reduction, which then was fixed by screws, reconstruction&#xD;
      plates or calcaneal plates. Using bone grafts was left to the judgment of the surgeon.&#xD;
      Postoperatively, plain X-ray and CT scan were used to evaluate the quality of fracture&#xD;
      reduction. Sex week's non-weight bearing was advocated for all patients. Range-of-motion&#xD;
      exercises were allowed during this period. Thereafter, the patients had a standardized&#xD;
      physiotherapy regimen with full weight bearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conservative treatment included rest, elevation and non-weight bearing. Early&#xD;
      range-of-motion exercises were encouraged as tolerated. After 6-8 weeks weight bearing was&#xD;
      allowed and shoe modification was provided to those who had hind foot deformities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No patients were managed with impulse compression therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of both groups were followed-up by treating surgeons at 2 weeks, 8 weeks, 3 months&#xD;
      and 6 months for clinical review. At 1 year and 8-12 years (mean 10 years) post-injury, all&#xD;
      patients were evaluated by unbiased surgeons who were not involved in the treatment of the&#xD;
      patients and they completed the following questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary outcome measures: visual analogue scale (VAS) scoring devised and tested by&#xD;
           Hildebrand et al (ref) and a self-administrated general health outcome form (SF-36) for&#xD;
           physical and mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary outcome measures: VAS at rest and on weight bearing (0-10), the American&#xD;
           Orthopaedic Foot &amp; Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot scale and the Olerud-Molander (OM)&#xD;
           score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators divided each group into two subgroups, younger and older than 50 years to&#xD;
      determine if the results of the outcome measures at 1 year would differ according to the age&#xD;
      of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During controls, clinical evaluation was carried out to measure the ankle joint and subtalar&#xD;
      joint range of motion and the length and width of the hind foot. The contra-lateral&#xD;
      non-fractured foot was used for comparison. Shoe problems, the outcome of any eventual&#xD;
      postoperative/post-injury complications and workersÂ´ compensation were documented.&#xD;
      Radiological follow-up with axial and coronal CT scan was done at the 1 year and 3 years&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The SPSS program version 18.0 for personal computers (Chicago, Illinois)&#xD;
      was used for data analysis. The variables of interests were analyzed to determine the&#xD;
      differences using bivariate comparisons. The means with standard deviation (SD) were&#xD;
      measured. The Mann-Whitney test was used for non-parametric data while two-sample t-test was&#xD;
      used for parametric data. A p value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant.&#xD;
