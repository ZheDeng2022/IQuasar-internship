  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amphetamines have been shown to improve cognition but its use is limited due to its side&#xD;
      effects. Lisdexamfetamine is an amphetamine pro-drug, minimizing these effects and has been&#xD;
      safely used in children and adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that lisdexamfetamine may improve cognitive abilities in MS&#xD;
      patients with documented cognitive dysfunction. Because lisdexamfetamine is a stimulant its&#xD;
      positive effects should be observed primarily in the domains of processing speed and working&#xD;
      memory. The investigators therefore propose a study in which the primary objective will be to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of lisdexamfetamine in improving attention and processing speed in MS.&#xD;
      The secondary objectives will be (a) the assessment of the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      lisdexamfetamine in the MS population, and (b) to test for effects of the drug on other&#xD;
      cognitive domains, depression, and self and informant reports of cognitive and executive&#xD;
      function demanding activities and behaviors.&#xD;
