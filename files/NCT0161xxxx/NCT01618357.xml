      The investigators' primary aim is to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (within 50 - 200mg/BID dose range) when combining veliparib and radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' exploratory aim is to serially assess apoptosis/proliferation biomarkers,&#xD;
      and gene and protein expression profiles for correlation with tumor response to POPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be a standard 3+3 dose finding trial in which the MTD will be defined as the dose&#xD;
      below the level at which &gt;1 DLT is observed in 3-6 patients. Women with node positive disease&#xD;
      prior to NAC and &gt;1.0 cm residual breast disease and/or clinically positive nodal disease&#xD;
      after NAC will be offered participation in the research phase of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with residual disease &gt;1cm or +/-LN after NAC (Med Onc's choice) will be offered&#xD;
      pre-operative Veliparib and concurrent whole breast and regional nodal irradiation. Four (4)&#xD;
      dose levels of Veliparib will be evaluated with concurrent whole breast and regional nodal&#xD;
      irradiation (WB/RNI). The starting dose of Veliparib will be 50 mg BID, will increase in 50&#xD;
      mg increments to a maximum of 200 mg BID and be delivered concurrently with 235 cGy QD x 16&#xD;
      to the breast and SCV/Axilla.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neo adjuvant (Primary) chemotherapy has revolutionized the management of locally advanced&#xD;
      breast. Two large prospective American studies have shown that NAC provides in vivo&#xD;
      chemo-sensitivity information, and allows a greater percentage of women to have breast&#xD;
      conserving therapy. Additionally and importantly, these two trials also showed that 20-30% of&#xD;
      the women treated with NAC achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR) and have a better&#xD;
      disease free and overall survival than those women who did not achieve pCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, 70-80% of patients receiving NAC do not achieve a pCR and many still must&#xD;
      undergo a mastectomy due to an insufficient partial response. Researchers have attempted to&#xD;
      increase the rate of pCR by adding radiation to NAC with mixed response rates. The varying&#xD;
      rates of pCR in the above studies are likely due to the various chemotherapeutic agents used&#xD;
      and timing of therapies yet also may represent the limitation of efficacy in combining these&#xD;
      chemotherapy agents with radiation. What is needed is a better agent that can potentiate the&#xD;
      effects of preoperative radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One possible agent that may potentiate the effects of radiation is an inhibitor of&#xD;
      Poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP). PARP is a nuclear enzyme that recognizes deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
      acid (DNA) damage and facilitates DNA repair. Cancer cells are often deficient in DNA repair.&#xD;
      Deficiencies in DNA repair make these cancers more dependent on PARP. An inhibitor of PARP&#xD;
      would further hamper the cancer cell's DNA repair capability. So theoretically, the efficacy&#xD;
      of DNA damaging agents, such as radiation and chemotherapy, should be potentiated when these&#xD;
      therapeutic modalities are combined with PARP inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, as expected, PARP inhibitors (PARPi), such as Veliparib, have been shown in&#xD;
      pre-clinical studies to potentiate the effects of radiation and chemotherapy in several&#xD;
      malignancies. Thus, we hypothesize that concurrent Veliparib and pre-operative breast&#xD;
      irradiation, in women who have residual disease after NAC, will result in an increased tumor&#xD;
      response rate. This improved tumor response will not only increase the rate of BCT, but&#xD;
      possibly, by increasing the rate of pCRs, also improve overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, before this hypothesis can be adequately tested, one must assess the safety of&#xD;
      combining radiation and Veliparib. Consequently we propose a trial of Pre-Operative PARPi and&#xD;
      Irradiation (POPI) in women with an incomplete response to NAC. It will be a standard 3+3&#xD;
      dose finding trial in which the MTD will be defined as the dose below the level at which &gt;1&#xD;
      DLT is observed in 3-6 patients. Women with node positive disease prior to NAC and &gt;1.0 cm&#xD;
      residual breast disease and/or clinically positive nodal disease after NAC will be offered&#xD;
      participation in this study. Four (4) dose levels of Veliparib will be evaluated with&#xD;
      concurrent whole breast and regional nodal irradiation (WB/RNI). The starting dose of&#xD;
      Veliparib will be 50 mg BID, will increase in 50 mg increments to a maximum of 200 mg BID and&#xD;
      be delivered concurrently with 235 cGy QD x 16 to the breast and SCV/Axilla.&#xD;
