  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether practicing primary care providers (PCPs) can be trained to&#xD;
      support patient self-care of depression and co-existing diabetes during office visits, and&#xD;
      begin to explore whether this might improve depression and diabetes outcomes, and whether the&#xD;
      effects of the training generalize to patients with health conditions other than depression&#xD;
      and diabetes. This is important because most patients with chronic conditions struggle with&#xD;
      self-care and are seen in primary care, yet PCPs are seldom trained to support self-care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many primary care patients struggle with health behaviors that can reduce depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, such as adhering to prescribed treatments. Bolstering patient self-efficacy can&#xD;
      improve health behaviors and outcomes, including those related to depression. However,&#xD;
      current self-efficacy interventions are provided outside of primary care, and so cannot&#xD;
      harness the power of therapeutic primary care provider (PCP)-patient relationships. Teaching&#xD;
      PCPs to employ self-efficacy enhancing interviewing techniques (SEE IT) with patients would&#xD;
      build upon existing therapeutic relationships, greatly increasing the reach of self-efficacy&#xD;
      enhancement. The randomized controlled trial (RCT) in this proposal will examine whether, as&#xD;
      compared with an attention control condition, a brief (&lt; 1 hour) office-based intervention&#xD;
      for practicing PCPs will lead to significantly greater use of SEE IT during unannounced&#xD;
      follow-up SP encounters (postintervention and 3 months). The interventions will be delivered&#xD;
      to PCPs during their regular office hours by standardized patient (SP) instructors. All study&#xD;
      SPs will portray patients with both depression and diabetes, since these conditions commonly&#xD;
      co-occur and entail a heavy burden of health-enhancing behaviors. Exploratory (due to limited&#xD;
      statistical power) analyses will explore intervention effects on the following outcomes among&#xD;
      real patients with co-occurring depression and diabetes: self-efficacy for depression and&#xD;
      diabetes self-care, actual self-care behaviors (e.g. medication adherence), symptom severity,&#xD;
      and health status. Further exploratory (due to limited statistical power) analyses will&#xD;
      explore intervention effects on the following outcomes among real patients with various&#xD;
      chronic conditions (ie, not limited to depression and diabetes): self-care self-efficacy,&#xD;
      actual self-care behaviors, symptom severity, and health status. Pre- and post-RCT focus&#xD;
      groups with stakeholders (PCPs, office staff, patients, and SP instructors) will guide&#xD;
      refinement of the SEE IT intervention. The proposed research activities will inform the&#xD;
      design (e.g. sample size) and conduct of a future R01-funded, multi-center, cluster RCT of&#xD;
      the finalized intervention, adequately powered to examine effects on a range of patient&#xD;
      outcomes; sustainability of effects on PCP interviewing over time; and generalizability to&#xD;
      other practice settings and common co-morbid mental health and physical illness clusters. The&#xD;
      SEE IT intervention begins to address the broader health needs of individuals with depression&#xD;
      in primary care, and has unique potential to reduce the tremendous burden of mental illness&#xD;
      related morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
