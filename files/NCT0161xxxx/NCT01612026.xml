  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the investigators vascular practice, either fluoroscopic- or ultrasound-guided technique&#xD;
      is routinely used to obtain femoral arterial access. Ultrasound-guidance is frequently used&#xD;
      in patients with weak or absent pulses, known abnormal vascular anatomy, need for bypass&#xD;
      graft puncture, and to ensure accurate arterial puncture in patients expected to receive&#xD;
      large doses of blood-thinning medications during or after the procedure. For those&#xD;
      practitioners experienced with ultrasound-guided access techniques, it is considered highly&#xD;
      accurate and easy to use; thus, some physicians routinely use this tool. A well-designed&#xD;
      study is needed to truly assess the accuracy of the ultrasound technique and to determine&#xD;
      whether it may reduce complications of arterial access in vascular patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By demonstrating the safest, most accurate and efficient technique for obtaining arterial&#xD;
      access during catheter-based procedures, the investigators could significantly reduce&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality associated with complications of arterial puncture. Length of&#xD;
      hospital stay, management costs and patient discomfort could be reduced by minimizing&#xD;
      complication rates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arterial access accounts for the highest frequency of complications in catheter-based&#xD;
      procedures in the U.S. In our vascular practice, ultrasound-guidance is frequently used in&#xD;
      patients with weak or absent pulses, known aberrant vascular anatomy, need for graft&#xD;
      puncture, and to ensure accurate arterial puncture in patients expected to receive large&#xD;
      doses of anti-thrombotic medications. Some practitioners routinely use this modality. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine whether real-time ultrasound guidance is superior to&#xD;
      fluoroscopic guidance in obtaining successful arterial cannulation during diagnostic and&#xD;
      interventional catheter-based procedures in a primarily non-cardiac vascular patient&#xD;
      population. Patients will be randomized to receive either real-time ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      arterial access or fluoroscopic-guided access. Baseline patient demographics, co-morbidities,&#xD;
      medications, pertinent laboratory data, and indications for procedure will be recorded.&#xD;
      Procedural data recorded will include procedure type, type of access, operator, pulse&#xD;
      quality, sheath size, closure device, angiographic data for access artery, antithrombotic&#xD;
      medications used, and intra-procedural activated clotting times. Primary endpoint will be&#xD;
      successful arterial cannulation by angiographic imaging. Secondary end points will be time to&#xD;
      access, number of attempts, accidental venipunctures, first pass success, complication rates&#xD;
      and hospital length of stay. Data regarding complications (patient history, examination,&#xD;
      laboratory or imaging studies) will be included for a period of 90 days after the procedure.&#xD;
