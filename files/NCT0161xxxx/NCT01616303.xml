  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 randomized study with two treatment arms to compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      oregovomab (a murine monoclonal antibody directed against cancer antigen 125 (CA125)) when&#xD;
      combined with first-line chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) to first-line chemotherapy&#xD;
      (carboplatin and paclitaxel alone) in female patients with advanced ovarian cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oregovomab is an investigational drug previously used in clinical trials as an&#xD;
      immunotherapeutic treatment of ovarian cancer patients whose tumor cells express the tumor&#xD;
      associated antigen, CA125. The active component of oregovomab is the activated murine&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody B43.13, an immunoglobulin G1k (IgG1k) subclass immunoglobulin that binds&#xD;
      with high affinity (1.16E10/M) to CA125.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CA125 is a surface glycoprotein antigen that is expressed on more than 80% of all&#xD;
      non-mucinous epithelial ovarian carcinomas where it occurs at elevated levels in the serum of&#xD;
      patients with ovarian cancer. Little is known about its biological function. CA125 is&#xD;
      associated with a large molecular weight mucin-like glycoprotein complex of 200-250&#xD;
      kilodaltons (kDa) and its genetic structure has recently been elucidated. There is good&#xD;
      evidence to suggest that CA125 is a relevant target antigen for antigen-mediated&#xD;
      immunotherapy of ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will compare the effectiveness of oregovomab (a murine monoclonal antibody directed&#xD;
      against cancer antigen 125 (CA125)) when combined with first-line chemotherapy (carboplatin&#xD;
      and paclitaxel) to first-line chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel alone) in female&#xD;
      patients with advanced ovarian cancer.&#xD;
