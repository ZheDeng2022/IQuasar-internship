      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Research shows that both genes and the environment influence a person s risk for getting&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis (MS). However, it is not possible to accurately predict who will develop&#xD;
      MS. Researchers want to study people with MS and their family members. They have developed a&#xD;
      Genetic and Environmental Risk Score for MS. This score combines information from a person's&#xD;
      medical history and genes. It also includes environmental factors that may be related to&#xD;
      developing MS. This study will test this risk score to see if it can help predict who will&#xD;
      develop MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate a score for genetic and environmental risk factors that may help predict&#xD;
      whether a person will develop MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 18 to 50 years of age who are the parent, brother, sister, or child&#xD;
           of a person with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People with MS will allow researchers to look at their personal and medical data. These&#xD;
           data will have been collected in other MS-related studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relatives of people with MS will fill out a questionnaire and give blood and saliva&#xD;
           samples. They will fill out the questionnaire again one year later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some relatives will have additional optional testing. These tests will include a&#xD;
           physical exam and imaging studies. There may also be other tests. These tests may be&#xD;
           repeated every 1 to 5 years for 20 years.&#xD;

      Objective. The overall objective of this study is to investigate the genetic, immune, and&#xD;
      neuroimaging profiles that may increase a person s risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS)&#xD;
      in order to identify and validate predictive biomarkers in populations at risk for this&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population. There will be three study populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Individuals at risk for developing MS As part of the Genes and Environment in Multiple&#xD;
           Sclerosis (GEMS) study, we plan to recruit up to 1000 first-degree relatives of MS&#xD;
           patients. GEMS is a study aiming to recruit 5000 individuals that is being led by our&#xD;
           collaborators at Columbia University Medical Center. For the purposes of this study, a&#xD;
           first-degree relative may be a parent, sibling, or child between 18 and 50 years of age&#xD;
           but must not carry a diagnosis of MS. The first-degree relative must have the ability to&#xD;
           provide consent and be willing to participate in the study. Two potentially overlapping&#xD;
           subsets of these individuals will undergo detailed testing at the NIH:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The cross-sectional subcohort will consist of up to 150 participants with combined&#xD;
                genetic and environmental risk scores (GERS), defined in the protocol, in the&#xD;
                highest and lowest 20 percent of the entire study population. Selected participants&#xD;
                may be invited for follow-up studies based on data obtained at baseline if symptoms&#xD;
                develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The NINDS longitudinal subcohort will consist of up to 10 participants, ages 18 to&#xD;
                40,who express willingness to be followed for 20 years at the NIH, whose GERS falls&#xD;
                in the top 20 percent of the entire study population, and who have a first-degree&#xD;
                relative with MS who is participatipate&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MS patients - We plan to recruit up to 1000 MS patients whose first-degree relatives are&#xD;
           enrolled this study. These participants either: (A) will be evaluated under other&#xD;
           Neuroimmunology Branch Clinic protocols and will not undergo separate evaluation under&#xD;
           this protocol; or (B) will send us medical records confirming their MS diagnosis via&#xD;
           mail/fax/secure email, without the requirement to participate in another NIH protocol.&#xD;
           The purpose of including this cohort in the current study is to allow access to their&#xD;
           clinical, biological, and imaging data for comparison with first-degree relatives, if&#xD;
           available, and to confirm that existing GEMS participants have a first-degree relative&#xD;
           diagnosed with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Healthy volunteers - We plan to recruit up to 80 healthy volunteers, ages 18-50, who do&#xD;
           not have a known first-degree relative with MS. The purpose of including this cohort in&#xD;
           the current study is to allow quantification of the degree and extent of abnormalities,&#xD;
           including abnormalities of the blood-brain barrier, in individuals at risk for&#xD;
           developing MS. Without imaging data obtained from healthy volunteers, there is no way to&#xD;
           determine whether subtle clinical and neuroimaging findings in the at-risk cohort are&#xD;
           truly abnormal, or to correctly threshold and quantify the observed abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. This is a prospective cohort natural-history study. All GEMS participants will&#xD;
      complete the following study procedures, which can be performed offsite: informed consent;&#xD;
      study questionnaire; saliva sample; and blood draw. The questionnaire will be repeated 1 year&#xD;
      after enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will two additional substudies conducted at NIH: a cross-sectional substudy and a&#xD;
      longitudinal substudy. Participants in these substudies will be evaluated with clinical,&#xD;
      radiological, and laboratory procedures. Participants in the cross-sectional cohort will&#xD;
      undergo evaluation at the NIH at a single time point (with optional longitudinal follow up),&#xD;
      whereas participants in the longitudinal cohort will undergo evaluation at the NIH for 20&#xD;
      years. There will be an interim analysis 5 years after the 50th participant is recruited to&#xD;
      the longitudinal cohort, and the study of this cohort may be terminated if we have not&#xD;
      observed the development of MS-related radiological or laboratory abnormalities in any of the&#xD;
      participants. Participants with MS will provide informed consent to allow access to their own&#xD;
      research data, but the data themselves will be (or will have already been) collected under&#xD;
      other Neuroimmunology Clinic clinical protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIH is a unique site within the overall GEMS study, for the following reasons: (1) It is the&#xD;
      only site at which imaging is being performed, as part of the cross-sectional and&#xD;
      longitudinal substudies; (2) GEMS participants seen at NIH may undergo additional procedures&#xD;
      that are not part of the overall GEMS study; (3) Data from participants in the NIH substudy&#xD;
      will be directly linked to data from their own relatives with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures. For participants in the overall GEMS study, the primary outcome measure is&#xD;
      the GERS itself, as most participants in this cohort will not undergo further testing. For&#xD;
      participants in the cross-sectional cohort, which consists of individuals at highest and&#xD;
      lowest risk for MS, the primary outcome measure is the presence or absence of lesions on&#xD;
      T2-weighted brain MRI that meet the 2010 MRI criteria for dissemination in space - a finding&#xD;
      that, in this population, may well be related to MS. For participants in the longitudinal&#xD;
      cohort, the study endpoint is a clinical diagnosis of MS according to the same 2010 criteria.&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures include: (1) The age at which participants develop MS-related&#xD;
      abnormalities on brain imaging studies, abnormalities on laboratory testing, and clinical&#xD;
      symptoms and signs; (2) The time lag between defined exposures (for example, infectious&#xD;
      mononucleosis) and the appearance of MS-related radiological, laboratory, and clinical&#xD;
      abnormalities; (3) The time lag between the appearance of asymptomatic radiological and&#xD;
      laboratory abnormalities and the onset of clinical symptoms; and (4) Additional exploratory&#xD;
      clinical, imaging, and biological data in the crosssectional that may suggest subclinical MS&#xD;
      disease activity.&#xD;
