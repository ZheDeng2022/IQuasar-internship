    <textblock>
      Patients with stage II-III breast cancer who do not achieve a pathologic complete response to&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy at the time of surgery will be treated with oral low dose continuous&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide and methotrexate (CM) in combination with aspirin following surgery and&#xD;
      radiotherapy. The primary endpoint is to assess toxicity and safety with secondary endpoints&#xD;
      of cytokine correlates and relapse free survival (RFS) at 2 years. The investigators design&#xD;
      tests the null hypothesis (H0) that the true primary toxicity event rate will be 5% or less,&#xD;
      against an alternative hypothesis (HA) event rate of 25% or more.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is toxicity and safety. Serious adverse events, grade 3 and 4 nonhematologic toxicity, and hematologic toxicity requiring removal of the patient from study treatment will be reviewed. A fixed sample size design to test for primary toxicity events will be conducted. Sample size was selected based upon a null hypothesis that the toxicity rate will be 5% or less and that the alternative hypothesis toxicity rate will be 25% or more.</description>

    <description>Cytokine and LVEF data will be examined using a pre-post analysis implemented using an analysis of covariance model where the pre-value serves as the baseline covariate and the post-value serves as the dependent variable of interest. Pre-post changes for each of these measures will also described in terms of 95% confidence intervals for absolute and relative changes. Other covariates may be included to examine any mediating influences on these changes dependent upon exploratory model building results.</description>

             positive or negative. Margins must be negative, with the following exception:&#xD;
             microscopic positive anterior margin adjacent to skin is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must receive chemotherapy prior to definitive surgery. Any preoperative&#xD;

             therapy, if given, should start 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment in&#xD;
             order to avoid a confounding effect on the correlative studies.&#xD;

                  symptomatic congestive heart failure, or coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft&#xD;

             are chemotherapeutic agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient&#xD;
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with aspirin, cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
             methotrexate, breastfeeding should not occur during study treatment. These potential&#xD;
             risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior history of breast cancer, or any other malignancy other than&#xD;
             non-melanoma skin cancer within the past five years, are excluded because recurrence&#xD;
             of these cancers could affect the exploratory secondary endpoint of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positive patients are excluded because they are at increased risk of lethal&#xD;
             infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
