  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Ghana the level of malnutrition is high among children below five years of age,&#xD;
      particularly in rural areas. The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of an&#xD;
      education intervention aimed at addressing poor complementary feeding (CF) practices on the&#xD;
      food intakes and growth of young children in the Upper Manya Krobo district of Ghana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews and focus group discussions involving community health and agricultural workers,&#xD;
      as well as caregivers of children 6-24 months old were conducted to investigate the&#xD;
      facilitators and challenges to optimal CF practices and education on CF. The trials of&#xD;
      improved practices (TIPs) method was used to test the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      potential education messages among mothers of young children (6-24 months) living in the&#xD;
      study area. Child welfare clinic centers in the area were randomly assigned to one of three&#xD;
      groups which were control, nutrition education and integrated education. Mothers of children&#xD;
      6-24 months in the integrated education group received monthly nutrition education from&#xD;
      community health volunteers and agricultural education from agricultural extension agents for&#xD;
      six months in addition to standard monthly child growth monitoring services from community&#xD;
      health nurses. Mothers in the nutrition education group received monthly nutrition education&#xD;
      from community health volunteers for six months in addition to standard care. Mothers of 6-24&#xD;
      months in the control group received only the standard monthly child monitoring services. The&#xD;
      effects of the educational intervention on maternal knowledge on optimal complementary&#xD;
      feeding, as well as food intakes and growth of young children were determined among 367&#xD;
      mother-child dyads over a period of at least six months. The study hypothesised that mothers&#xD;
      receiving the education would have improved knowledge on good complementary feeding practices&#xD;
      compared to those in the control group. The study also hypothesised that young children in&#xD;
      the integrated education would have better nutrient intakes and growth compared those in the&#xD;
      nutrition education and control groups, and those in the nutrition education group would have&#xD;
      better nutrient intakes and growth than the children in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the interviews and focus group discussions, reported initiation of CF was satisfactory,&#xD;
      while other reported practices such as the addition of animal source foods, vegetables and&#xD;
      fruits to young children's diet were found to be sub-optimal. Poverty and maternal time&#xD;
      constraints were identified as the main challenges of optimal complementary feeding, while&#xD;
      farming was seen as a facilitator. Lack of education materials, language barrier, maternal&#xD;
      time constraints and lack of in-service training for health workers were the main challenges&#xD;
      to education on complementary feeding. From the TIPS study, mothers expressed their&#xD;
      willingness to improve the diets of their 6-24 months old children by adding or increasing&#xD;
      the amount of animal source foods, dark-green leafy vegetables and fruits, as well as&#xD;
      increasing feeding frequency daily. However, availability and affordability of protein-rich&#xD;
      foods like animal source foods, groundnut paste and soya beans powder was a challenge for&#xD;
      some mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention did not lead to a significant improvement in maternal knowledge on&#xD;
      complementary feeding practices. However, it showed a tendency to reverse a general&#xD;
      decreasing trend in knowledge among mothers on appropriate complementary feeding practices in&#xD;
      the study area. Significantly more children in the integrated education group consumed animal&#xD;
      source foods compared those in the other two groups when compared at nine months after&#xD;
      baseline. However, the intervention did not improve the general nutrient intakes and growth&#xD;
      of the young children in the study area.&#xD;
