      PSOBIOTEQ is a national multicentric prospective cohort of cutaneous psoriasis patients&#xD;
      receiving systemic treatment (biotherapy or DMARDs) for moderate to severe cutaneous&#xD;
      psoriasis. It is resulting from the merging of two studies that share the same study&#xD;
      population but address different objectives: PSOBIO, developed by academic dermatologists and&#xD;
      epidemiologists and supported by the National Drug Agency (AGENCE NATIONALE DE SECURITE DU&#xD;
      MEDICAMENT ET DES PRODUITS DE SANTE,ANSM) and the ministry of health (PHRC 2009) focusing on&#xD;
      safety issues, and Pso-TEQ, developed by industrials at the request of the French&#xD;
      Transparency Commission (HAUTE AUTORITE DE SANTE) focusing on utilisation issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall general objective of PSOBIO is to assess &quot;in real life&quot; the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of biotherapies in the treatment of cutaneous psoriasis in comparison with major conventional&#xD;
      systemic therapy while Pso-TEQ has a descriptive objective concerning the modalities of use&#xD;
      of biological therapies &quot;in real life&quot; and long-term benefit.&#xD;

      PSOBIOTEQ is a national multicentric prospective cohort, including patients receiving&#xD;
      systemic treatment (biotherapy or DMARDs) for moderate to severe cutaneous psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exposure of interest is the exposure to a biological therapy: infliximab, adalimumab,&#xD;
      etanercept, ustekinumab and other biotherapy entering the market.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nature of the systemic treatment as well as its administration modalities are defined by&#xD;
      the investigator according to usual practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All dermatology departments located in the French metropolitan area and using biotherapies as&#xD;
      treatment of cutaneous psoriasis will be solicited for participation to the cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion will last at least 3 years with a follow-up of at least 5 years for each&#xD;
      patient (8 years maximum), with a 6 month periodicity for the data collection (complying with&#xD;
      good clinical practice for these patients). Follow-up duration may be extended in the case of&#xD;
      the identification of safety signals in the early years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study within the cohort has its specific endpoints according to its specific objectives&#xD;
      but the whole data required will be collected at the same time for both studies then&#xD;
      registered in a single database (eCRF). The statistical analyses will be performed by the&#xD;
      clinical investigation and epidemiology center (INSERM CIE 801) of BICHAT hospital's&#xD;
      department of epidemiology and clinical research&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 636 patients will be included with the following distribution:.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-exposed group: 1200 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exposed group: 1436 patients (naive or not) with at least 1200 patients naive for&#xD;
           biotherapy.&#xD;
