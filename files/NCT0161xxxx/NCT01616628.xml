    <textblock>
      Identifying effective strategies for improving healthier eating for low- income populations&#xD;
      is both a clinical challenge and a public health priority. Approximately one-fifth of the&#xD;
      children in the United States are either overweight or obese. Obesity is even more common in&#xD;
      low- income populations as are other related health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension&#xD;
      and cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consumption of fruits and vegetables is strongly associated with the prevention and&#xD;
      management of obesity and diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Overall, only about 38% of&#xD;
      Americans consume the recommended servings of vegetables and only 23% consume the suggested&#xD;
      amount of fruit. Close to 20% of low- income households do not purchase fruits and vegetables&#xD;
      at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research offers an opportunity to investigate a different approach to incentives&#xD;
      for healthier eating in a low-income urban population. Specifically, this study will examine&#xD;
      a rewards-based incentive for fruit and vegetable purchases with rewards based on cumulative&#xD;
      purchases. Previous studies have shown that incentives may be an effective means of promoting&#xD;
      behavior change. The proposed study will provide essential data about the impact of targeted&#xD;
      incentives to promote acquisition of fruits and vegetables by individuals living in&#xD;
      households with young children. The investigators plan to design a subsequent, larger study&#xD;
      based on the results of this study. In the proposed study, the investigators will&#xD;
      specifically contribute to this knowledge by investigating the effects of rewards-based&#xD;
      incentives that provide delayed reinforcement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS AND STUDY HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to investigate whether incentives to low-income families to&#xD;
      encourage purchase of healthier foods can be used to help stem the tide of childhood obesity.&#xD;
      Although this study is a randomized trial, a major function is collecting data to be used in&#xD;
      the design of a larger randomized controlled trial comparing two different interventions&#xD;
      using incentives to promote healthier eating in low-income communities. The investigators&#xD;
      will test a supermarket &quot;gift card&quot; with rewards based on purchases of fruits and vegetables&#xD;
      during the intervention periods. The specific objective is to determine whether that&#xD;
      incentive system-(where the rewards can be used to purchase anything in that supermarket)&#xD;
      increases healthier food purchasing practices by low-income families. The primary outcomes&#xD;
      are: number of servings, and percent of total food dollars spent on fruits and vegetables&#xD;
      (fresh and frozen). The primary hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Households in the intervention group will purchase more fruits and vegetables than&#xD;
           controls per week, both during: a) each intervention phase as compared to the baseline&#xD;
           period and b) in the follow up phase compared to the baseline period. (Between group&#xD;
           comparisons over time of intervention versus control group)&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Households in the intervention group will purchase more fruits and vegetables per week&#xD;
           both during: a) each intervention phase as compared to the baseline period and b) in the&#xD;
           follow up phase compared to baseline. (Within group comparisons over time)&#xD;
