  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ASLAN001 has an effect in patients with&#xD;
      recurrent or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach, gastrooesophageal junction, or lower&#xD;
      third of the oesophagus whose tumours over-express HER-1 and HER-2, or whose tumours are&#xD;
      HER-2 gene-amplified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum of 26 patients will participate in South Korea and the patients will be assigned to&#xD;
      either group A or group B according to the results of tests done on tumor tissue obtained by&#xD;
      biopsy to determine HER-1 and HER-2 status.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      About 1 million new cases of gastric cancer were estimated to have occurred in 2008 (988,000&#xD;
      cases, 7.8% of the total), making it currently the fourth most common malignancy in the&#xD;
      world, behind cancers of the lung, breast, and colo-rectum. Gastric cancer is also the second&#xD;
      leading cause of cancer-related death in both sexes worldwide with 700,000 deaths occurring&#xD;
      annually. The incidence and mortality rates for gastric cancer vary widely in different&#xD;
      regions of the world. The incidence has dramatically declined in the United States where it&#xD;
      ranks seventh as a cause of cancer- related deaths. In the Asia-Pacific region, the highest&#xD;
      incidences of gastric cancer can be found in China, Japan, and Korea, where the age&#xD;
      standardized incidence rate (ASR) is greater than 20 per 100,000 populations. Intermediate&#xD;
      risk countries (ASR 11-19/100,000 population) include Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan, while&#xD;
      low-risk countries (ASR &lt; 10/100,000 population) include Australia, New Zealand, India, and&#xD;
      Thailand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 95% of all malignant gastric neoplasms are adenocarcinomas. One of the most&#xD;
      striking epidemiologic observations has been the increasing incidence of adenocarcinomas&#xD;
      involving the proximal stomach and distal oesophagus including the oesophagogastric junction.&#xD;
      These tumours are thought to have different etiologic factors; gastric body and antral&#xD;
      lesions are associated with low acid production and Helicobacter pylori infection, whereas&#xD;
      cardiac lesions are not associated with either.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment for advanced and un-resectable disease has remained essentially unchanged for&#xD;
      the past 2 decades, with platinum and fluoro-pyridine-based combination chemotherapy being&#xD;
      the mainstay of therapy. The molecular biology responsible for carcinogenesis, tumour&#xD;
      biology, and response to therapy in gastric cancer are active areas of investigation.&#xD;
      Amplification and/or over-expression of epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER 2) have been&#xD;
      found to promote tumourigenesis and to be involved in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer.&#xD;
      Recently, data from randomised studies of trastuzumab (Herceptin®) in patients with HER 2&#xD;
      amplification demonstrated significant improvement in outcome in comparison to chemotherapy&#xD;
      alone. Studies on a number other molecularly targeted agents used alone or in combination&#xD;
      with chemotherapy have been undertaken, or are ongoing. Translational research, undertaken as&#xD;
      part of these studies, demonstrates the great molecular heterogeneity of the disease, with&#xD;
      multiple growth factor and survival pathways being implicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of this, successful therapeutic intervention is likely to require both the&#xD;
      identification of molecularly defined subsets of disease, and the evaluation of&#xD;
      rationally-selected combinations of targeted agents.&#xD;
