  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2011, there was an estimated 233,000 cases of invasive breast cancer, and 39,970 deaths&#xD;
      from breast cancer in the United States. The vast majority of patients are diagnosed with&#xD;
      Stage I-III resectable and potentially curable disease, and for these patients, the most&#xD;
      pressing questions are whether adjuvant endocrine or chemotherapy are indicated, and if so,&#xD;
      how to determine whether these treatments are working. Adjuvant systemic therapy reduces&#xD;
      relative recurrence rates by 30-50%, depending on the age of the patient and tumor&#xD;
      characteristics. However, patients with early stage disease often do not bear measurable&#xD;
      markers of disease such as an elevated cancer antigen 27-29 (CA27.29) or circulating tumor&#xD;
      cells. Patients with early stage breast cancer are typically treated with adjuvant therapy&#xD;
      based on historical evidence showing that such therapy prolongs survival in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung cancer is the most common malignancy and the leading cause of cancer-related death in&#xD;
      the U.S. Approximately 220,000 new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed in the U.S. every year.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, lung cancers are often diagnosed at later stages than breast cancer, due in&#xD;
      part to little/no effective screening for lung cancer. As with breast cancer, patients are&#xD;
      commonly treated with chemotherapeutic agents, but treatment regimens can take several weeks&#xD;
      to months to elicit clinically detectable anti-tumor effects. A biomarker to assess early&#xD;
      tumor response to therapy would benefit this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contents of dying tumor cells can be detected in the bloodstream, and this may be&#xD;
      enhanced by the leaky vasculature of solid tumors. Protein biomarkers of tumor cell death are&#xD;
      difficult to detect due to the complex nature of plasma and the lack of technical&#xD;
      sensitivity. In contrast, DNA is easier to detect through polymerase chain reaction (PCR)&#xD;
      amplification. Indeed, circulating tumor DNA has been detected in plasma from patients with&#xD;
      osteosarcoma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. Until recently, it was impractical to&#xD;
      develop an assay to routinely quantify circulating tumor DNA due to heterogeneity between&#xD;
      patients and tumors. Advances in genomic technology now permit sequencing a tumor genome to&#xD;
      identify patient-specific genomic aberrations. Major genomic alterations (i.e., insertions,&#xD;
      amplifications, deletions, inversions, translocations) can be readily detected using PCR&#xD;
      primers which will recognize tumor DNA but not normal DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While this strategy may be generally applicable to diverse types of solid tumors, two issues&#xD;
      are apparent in breast cancer. Firstly, the incidence of chromosomal rearrangements varies&#xD;
      widely. Whole-genome sequencing of 15 breast tumors revealed a range of 1-231 major genomic&#xD;
      alterations (mean= 68), where 2 tumors had 1 alteration, and 9 tumors had &gt; 20 alterations.&#xD;
      Single-base point mutations are more common but difficult to reliably detect using PCR.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators must consider that a small subset of patients may have a limited&#xD;
      number of genomic alterations available for this assay. Secondly, intratumoral heterogeneity&#xD;
      may mean that some genomic alterations are not present in every tumor cell. Such&#xD;
      heterogeneity has been inferred from FISH and immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies for many&#xD;
      years, and is now being verified at the genomic level. The investigators must consider that&#xD;
      only a subpopulation of tumor cells may be sensitive to cytotoxic therapy, so changes in the&#xD;
      levels of circulating tumor DNA may only be reflected with analysis of genomic alterations&#xD;
      specific to the sensitive cells.&#xD;
