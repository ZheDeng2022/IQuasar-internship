      Diabetic foot ulcers often progresses after many years of diabetes where the patients system&#xD;
      is so damaged that normal heeling of ulcers cannot happen. The physician at the clinic&#xD;
      examines the foot, measuring its circulation and sensitivity. The measures are the blood&#xD;
      pressure in comparison between foot and upper arm and oxygen level in the foot. The&#xD;
      measurements have a direct connection to the blood circulation, but it doesn't visualize the&#xD;
      blood circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of MR methods without the use of contrast agents have become so good that images&#xD;
      of the blood veins can be used in treatment. This means that the MR images provide important&#xD;
      information about the patient vessel wall stiffness and blood circulation without the use of&#xD;
      the damaging substances. Hence the physician can perform the MR examination and in comparison&#xD;
      with the test performed at the clinic he can make an improved and without risk diagnose.&#xD;
      Using MR at a lot earlier stage in the treatment is expected to reduce the number of&#xD;
      amputations. This is not only an economic advantage, but also an improvement of the patient&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to investigate type 1 diabetics oxygen level, vessel wall&#xD;
      stiffness, blood circulation, tissue contribution and blood pressure in the foot with the use&#xD;
      of conventional measurements in their treatment and with the added use of MR methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will provide the physician with valuable information of the patient illness and is&#xD;
      expected to play an important role in the prevention of diabetic foot ulcers. We expect that&#xD;
      MR research leads to a much improved prevention and treatment of aggressive and destructive&#xD;
      diabetic foot ulcers. This will increase the general quality of life and reduce the large&#xD;
      number of amputations performed every year.&#xD;

      NON-ENHANCED MAGNETIC RESONANCE ANGIOGRAPHY OF DIABETIC ISCHEMIC LOWER LIMBS&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic foot ulcers often progresses after many years of diabetes where the patients system&#xD;
      is so damaged that normal heeling of ulcers cannot happen. The patient seeks a doctor and he&#xD;
      sends the patient to the ulcer clinic or an ulcer specialist. The physician at the clinic&#xD;
      examines the foot, measuring its circulation and sensitivity. The measures are the blood&#xD;
      pressure in comparison between foot and upper arm and oxygen level in the foot. The&#xD;
      measurements have a direct connection to the blood circulation, but it doesn't visualize the&#xD;
      blood circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visualization of the circulation is often achieved with medical imaging methods such as x-ray&#xD;
      and MR. The problem with the current use of these methods is the added use of contrast agent.&#xD;
      This is especially a problem with the diabetics who have reduced kidney function, where to&#xD;
      this method is poisonous to the kidneys. That is why the methods often are only used right&#xD;
      before a scheduled amputation, so the surgeon can plan the amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of MR methods without the use of contrast agents have become so good that images&#xD;
      of the blood veins can be used in treatment. This means that the MR images provide important&#xD;
      information about the patient vessel wall stiffness and blood circulation without the use of&#xD;
      the damaging substances. Hence the physician can perform the MR examination and in comparison&#xD;
      with the test performed at the clinic he can make an improved and without risk diagnose.&#xD;
      Using MR at a lot earlier stage in the treatment is expected to reduce the number of&#xD;
      amputations. This is not only an economic advantage, but also an improvement of the patient&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of MR technique will furthermore provide the physician with the possibility to create&#xD;
      a 3D model of the foot, with segmentation of the different types of tissue in the foot. This&#xD;
      makes a single MR scan provide the physician with important information of the physiology&#xD;
      (how the foot works), the placement of the ulcer, shape, depth and tissue contribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INVESTIGATOR, SPONSOR AND TRAIL SETTING&#xD;
&#xD;
      Michael Vaeggemose is the investigator and will perform the conventional test at the&#xD;
      Department of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Nørreborgade&#xD;
      44, 8000 Aarhus, Denmark. Furthermore Michael will perform the MR scans at the MR Centre,&#xD;
      Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby, 8200 Aarhus N, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood test which is included in the project will be performed by a laboratory technician&#xD;
      at the Department of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine. The test is used to determine blood&#xD;
      glucose (the sugar level of the blood) and will be destroyed after the examination. There&#xD;
      will not be established a biological bank in this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physician Niels Ejskjaer from the Department of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine is&#xD;
      attached to project as responsible physician. Niels Ejskjaer will furthermore work as&#xD;
      supervisor of the investigator and is the sponsor of this research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to investigate type 1 diabetics oxygen level, vessel wall&#xD;
      stiffness, blood circulation, tissue contribution and blood pressure in the foot with the use&#xD;
      of conventional measurements in their treatment and with the added use of MR methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an investigation of MR methods in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. The&#xD;
      trial consists of 5 physiological examinations and a blood test. To make sure that all the&#xD;
      test subjects (diabetics and healthy controls) receive the same treatment is the test&#xD;
      performed by the same investigator, with an exception of the blood test which will be&#xD;
      performed by the laboratory technician. The 4 test are known to the diabetic patients from&#xD;
      earlier clinical trials performed in relation to the treatment of their ulcers, alas they&#xD;
      will have to be performed again. Due to logistics the participants can experience more than&#xD;
      one day of trail, since the MR clinical and the Department of Endocrinology and Internal&#xD;
      Medicine is not placed in the same part of town.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood test is used to determine the subjects' blood glucose (the level of sugar in the&#xD;
      blood) and will after use be destroyed. Blood glucose level gives a well-defined measure of&#xD;
      diabetes. Therefore it is an important measure in the comparison between the conventional&#xD;
      test and the MR imaging. Do the blood glucose levels correlate with the findings of the 5&#xD;
      tests then the results of the statistics are plausible and significant results are accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tree of the test are made in regard to the pulse in the foot. The pulse is measured several&#xD;
      places by placing the finger on one of the blood veins in the foot and then count the number&#xD;
      of pulse ripples each minute. This is a very simple measurement but effective in estimating&#xD;
      the condition of the circulation in the foot. The trails include a more advanced method to&#xD;
      measure the pulse at the ankle, middle foot and in the toes compared with the pressure in the&#xD;
      arm give an indication of reduced circulation in the specific areas. The measurements are&#xD;
      performed with ultrasound and pressure sensitive sensors placed on the pulsating veins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fourth examination measures the oxygen level in the foot. Diabetics with foot ulcers&#xD;
      often have reduced oxygen level in the feet, which makes the heeling slow and troublesome.&#xD;
      This makes the oxygen levels an important measure which is measured in a device connected to&#xD;
      the patient with electrodes. The first 4 measurements are all conventional measurements used&#xD;
      and performed in the clinic doing the normal treatment of their ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MR measurement is used to determine the anatomy and function of the foot. De different&#xD;
      scan sequences makes it possible to visualize blood vessels, tissue contribution, oxygen&#xD;
      levels and through data processing vessel wall stiffness. Several of the scan sequences are&#xD;
      recorded in synchrony with the heart rhythm. The rhythm is recorded wireless with and ECG&#xD;
      device after placing of 3 electrodes. The scan time can vary, due to the subjects different&#xD;
      heart rates in practice this means that the MR scans takes from 30 min to 60 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity and specificity of the MR methods will be evaluated I relationship to the&#xD;
      conventional applied methods (pulse and oxygen level measurements) which will be performed at&#xD;
      the Department of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine. From a McNemar's test with a&#xD;
      significant level of 5% a power calculation were performed giving a needed sample size of 40&#xD;
      type-1 diabetic patients and 10 healthy control subjects. To perform the statistical&#xD;
      calculations assumptions of the sensitivity and specificity have been made. Due to the&#xD;
      assumptions a pilot study will be performed with 5 diabetic patients showing if the MR method&#xD;
      produces enough signal to make the need examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VOLUNTEERS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trails consist of 10 healthy (don't use prescribed medicine) and 40 type-1 diabetic foot&#xD;
      ulcer patients. Subjects from both groups are at least 18years old and have received oral and&#xD;
      written information regarding the project and afterward given informed consent of&#xD;
      participation in the project. Furthermore a requirement of the diabetic foot ulcers is that&#xD;
      the ulcer must have a reduced oxygen level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be excluded if they have metal in the body or are scheduled to have an&#xD;
      amputation as part of their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIDE EFFECTS, RISK AND DISADVANTAGES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxygen level and pulse examinations meet the requirements of patient safety and are used in a&#xD;
      large number of examinations. There are no known risks in the used methods but should there&#xD;
      be an unpleasantness or problems from regarding the participation the patient must contact&#xD;
      the investigator at once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR scans is also not connected to any known risks and the patients ears will be protected&#xD;
      with soundproofing earplugs or headphones to avoid the discomfort in relation to the high&#xD;
      sound the scanner makes during the scans. The patient will be placed outside the scanner,&#xD;
      with the feet sticking into the scanner, removing the risk of making the patient feel&#xD;
      claustrophobic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood test can be connected to slight discomfort and a small risk of developing&#xD;
      accumulation of blood and infection at the needle injection site. If any sign of infection&#xD;
      (rash, heating, tenderness, swelling) the subject must seek the investigator or the emergency&#xD;
      room. Det combined blood loss in connection to the blood test will not exceed 250ml, which is&#xD;
      a lot less than a blood donation includes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood test is analysed and destroyed after. A biobank will not be established in this&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECONOMIC CONDITIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expenses in connection to the project are covered by the involved departments. The&#xD;
      researchers have no economic conflict of interest in the project. Transport expenses in&#xD;
      connection to oral information and examination is refunded in regard to the guidelines used&#xD;
      at the departments. In regard to national guidelines the subjects will be paid compensation&#xD;
      for their partition in the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PUBLICATION OF RESULTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be published in a recognized international paper regardless of the results&#xD;
      are positive, negative or if the method is not good enough to determine a statistical&#xD;
      significant difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Do the subjects wish information about the project results they can inform the investigator&#xD;
      and he will send the information to the interested subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NATIONAL ETHICAL COMMITTEE REVIEW&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is reported and approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (nr. 2007-58-0010),&#xD;
      Danish National Committee on Health Research Ethics (nr. 2012-33818) and the department&#xD;
      legislations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VOLUNTEER RECRUITMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic subjects with foot ulcers will be asked of interest to participate in the study,&#xD;
      when visiting the clinic in connection to their regular treatment at the clinic. Staff&#xD;
      physician Niels Ejskjaer is treating a large part of the patients and will after their visit&#xD;
      at the clinic ask the patients of participation, with stretch on that it's voluntary and it&#xD;
      has not effect of their regular treatment. If a patient agree to participate he/she will&#xD;
      receive information of the project and information of participation in research projects&#xD;
      (Forsøgspersonernes rettigheder i et sundhedsvidenskabeligt forskningsprojekt) written by the&#xD;
      Danish National Committee on Health Research Ethics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Latest a week after receiving the information investigator Michael Vaeggemose will contact&#xD;
      the subject and ask if he/she still wishes to participate and would like to hear more about&#xD;
      the aspects of the project. Furthermore the patient will be invited to a personal&#xD;
      conversation with the possibility to have a trusted friend in the room that can help the&#xD;
      patient in the choice of participating in the project. The healthy control subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited from posters calling for participants to contact the investigator on phone or mail.&#xD;
      The posters will have information about the project but information on the phone and&#xD;
      invitation to a personal conversation with a trusted friend will be offered, as it is to the&#xD;
      diabetic patients. The conversations (diabetic and control) will be held undisturbed in one&#xD;
      of the department rooms. At the conversations it will be stretched that participating is&#xD;
      volunteer and as a volunteer you can chose to stop you participation at any point in the&#xD;
      project, without it having any effect on their following treatment. During the conversation&#xD;
      the patient is given the written consent document which must be signed before the trails can&#xD;
      begin. The patient has a week to evaluate the project from this point and will then receive a&#xD;
      call from the investigator regarding the final decision of participating in the project.&#xD;
