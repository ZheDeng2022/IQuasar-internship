  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be screened and will enter a placebo-only 2-week run-in period during which&#xD;
      constipation symptoms will be evaluated and any disallowed products (e.g. probiotics) must be&#xD;
      discontinued. Following successful completion of the run-in period, subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to probiotic (high or low-dose groups) or placebo. Subjects will then consume&#xD;
      their assigned product daily for 6 weeks. Subjects will undergo abdominal x-rays on study&#xD;
      days 0 and 42 to assess transit time with each examination preceded by 6 days of radiopaque&#xD;
      Sitz marker ingestion. Subject diaries will be used to collect bowel movement frequency,&#xD;
      stool consistency, concomitant medications, and adverse events each day during the trial.&#xD;
      Stool samples will be collected at baseline and end of study to assess fecal probiotic count.&#xD;
      PAC-QOL, WCS, and GSRS questionnaires will be administered at baseline and day 42. 24-hour&#xD;
      food recalls will be administered at day 0 and 42 and the following parameters will be&#xD;
      assessed: total calories, carbohydrate, fat, protein, fiber, and liquid intake. Weekly&#xD;
      physical activity recalls will be completed.&#xD;

      Primary Endpoint: Whole gut transit time&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this clinical trial is whole gut transit time, which will be assessed&#xD;
      using abdominal x-rays (supine anteroposterior kidney-ureter-bladder, KUB) on days 0 and 42.&#xD;
      Each subject will ingest 24 radiopaque Sitz markers each day for 6 consecutive days at the&#xD;
      same time of the day prior to abdominal x-rays on days 0 and 42, also taken at the same time&#xD;
      of the day that the markers were taken. The number of markers present in the right, left, and&#xD;
      rectosigmoid colon will be summed to yield a total marker count. Whole gut transit time will&#xD;
      be calculated using the classic film estimate as described in the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      WGTT = ni x (t/N) 19, 20&#xD;
&#xD;
      where ni is the number of markers observed on x-ray, t is the time between marker ingestions&#xD;
      in hours, and N is the total number of markers ingested each day. Thus, in this study, t/N&#xD;
      equals 1 (24 markers per capsule/24 hours between marker ingestions), and WGTT is, therefore,&#xD;
      equal to the total marker count 19, 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Marker counts will be identified by a single radiologist at each site who will remain blinded&#xD;
      to subject treatment assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology above is safe, noninvasive, and the two abdominal x-rays required for this&#xD;
      study collectively expose each subject to radiation doses of approximately 140 millirem&#xD;
      (equivalent to 1.4 millisievert). The overall lifetime risk that this radiation dosage may&#xD;
      cause cancer is approximately 1 in 4,000 for women aged 18 years, 1 in 6,000 for men aged 18&#xD;
      years, 1 in 20,000 for women aged 70 years, and 1 in 25,000 for men aged 70 years. Similar&#xD;
      abdominal x-ray methodology has been utilized in similar studies in adults aged 18 years and&#xD;
      older 21, 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint: Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QoL) The PAC-QoL&#xD;
      (Appendix A) is a 28-question survey that measures the impact that constipation has on daily&#xD;
      life over the past 2 weeks. The questions are comprised of four subscales (worries and&#xD;
      concerns, physical discomfort, psychosocial discomfort, and satisfaction) and an overall&#xD;
      scale. Multinational studies have demonstrated that the PAC-QoL is internally consistent,&#xD;
      reproducible, valid, and responsive to improvements over time 23. Subjects will complete the&#xD;
      PAC-QoL at days 0 and 42.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint: Wexner Constipation Score (WCS) The Wexner Constipation Score (WCS)&#xD;
      (Appendix B) is an 8-question survey that assesses frequency of bowel movements, straining,&#xD;
      incomplete evacuation, abdominal pain, time needed for defecation, assistance for defecation,&#xD;
      unsuccessful attempts, and duration of constipation. The WCS is a validated questionnaire&#xD;
      since WCS scores correlate well with objective physiologic findings in constipated patients&#xD;
      24. Subjects will complete the WCS at days 0 and 42.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint: Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) The GSRS (Appendix C) is a&#xD;
      15-item instrument designed to assess common GI symptoms 25. It has five subscales (reflux,&#xD;
      diarrhea, constipation, indigestion, and abdominal pain) with subscale scores ranging from 1&#xD;
      (no discomfort) to 7 (severe discomfort). Higher scores represent higher symptom burden.&#xD;
      Subjects will complete the GSRS at days 0 and 42.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint: Stool frequency Throughout the study, subjects will record the number of&#xD;
      defecations per day in a diary throughout the study. The stool frequency endpoint will be the&#xD;
      absolute change in weekly stools in each group from the second week of the run-in period to&#xD;
      the sixth study week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint: Stool Consistency Stool consistency will be rated with the Bristol Stool&#xD;
      Scale Form 26 (Appendix D). Subjects will grade each stool using a daily diary throughout the&#xD;
      study. The stool consistency endpoint will be the mean change in each group from the second&#xD;
      week of the run-in period to the sixth study week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint: Fecal Probiotic Count Stool samples will be collected at baseline and end&#xD;
      of study to assess fecal probiotic count via live culture, which will include total&#xD;
      lactobacillis count and total bifidobacterium count. At the Day 0 visit following&#xD;
      randomization, subjects will be provided two separate stool collection kits-one to be used at&#xD;
      baseline and one to be used at the end of the supplementation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receipt of the kits, subjects must provide the first stool sample before taking the&#xD;
      first dose of study product, regardless of the length of time needed to have a bowel&#xD;
      movement. The stool sample can be provided at the study site on Day 0 or the subject may&#xD;
      collect their first stool thereafter and ship the sample in a provided refrigerated container&#xD;
      to the laboratory for analysis. Once the first stool sample is provided, the subject may then&#xD;
      begin consuming study product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the final 3 days of the supplementation period (i.e. Day 40, 41, or 42), subjects must&#xD;
      provide another stool sample and ship the sample in a provided refrigerated container to the&#xD;
      laboratory for analysis. This must be completed before returning to the site for the Day 42&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint: Adverse Events Adverse events (AEs) will be assessed throughout this&#xD;
      clinical study. The main safety endpoint will be the proportion of subjects in each group&#xD;
      that report one of more AEs at any time during the study. Please see Section 6 for additional&#xD;
      details on the AE assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ancillary Outcome: International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)-short version The&#xD;
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)-short version is a validated&#xD;
      questionnaire suitable for quantifying physical activity levels in adults (Appendix E) 27.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ancillary Outcome: 24-hour Food Recall A 24-hour food recall will be completed in order to&#xD;
      quantify total calories, carbohydrate (g), fat (g), protein (g), fiber (g), and liquid intake&#xD;
      (ml). The food recall must take place on a weekday (Monday through Thursday). Subjects must&#xD;
      record all foods and beverages consumed as well as the quantity of each (recorded as weight&#xD;
      or volume).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ancillary Outcome: Concomitant medication use Throughout the study, subjects will record use&#xD;
      of any concomitant medication and, if required, the need for rescue medication each day in a&#xD;
      diary.&#xD;
