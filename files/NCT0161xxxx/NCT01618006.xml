  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac bypass surgery is an important treatment for patients with severely blocked arteries&#xD;
      (tubes that delivery oxygen and nutrients to the heart). Hundreds of thousands of these&#xD;
      operations are done each year to help relieve patients' chest pain and to prevent future&#xD;
      heart attacks. The surgery is done by &quot;bypassing&quot; blood flow around badly clogged arteries by&#xD;
      sewing on healthy vessels from another part of the body (usually from the leg or the chest).&#xD;
      Aspirin (a blood thinner) is given to patients once a day after their surgery because it&#xD;
      stops &quot;sticky&quot; cells in the blood (platelets) from blocking these new vessels (which may lead&#xD;
      to a future heart attack).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has shown that aspirin does not work as well in people after they have bypass&#xD;
      surgery as the investigators might expect (for reasons that are not fully understood). One&#xD;
      reason aspirin may not work as well after surgery is because the body makes many more&#xD;
      platelets after surgery than it would under normal circumstances. All of these new platelets&#xD;
      overwhelm the aspirin and continue to be &quot;sticky&quot; and ready to block off arteries. The&#xD;
      investigators believe that giving multiple daily doses of aspirin following bypass surgery is&#xD;
      more effective than giving aspirin once daily at blocking platelet activity.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease caused by athero-thrombosis is the number one cause of long-term&#xD;
      morbidity and death worldwide. Many patients with advanced coronary disease benefit from&#xD;
      Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) by improving symptoms and increasing their longevity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the benefits of CABG surgery are attenuated by early graft failure. The&#xD;
      administration of aspirin in the post-operative period has been shown in randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials (RCT) to reduce the risk of graft occlusion, although rates remain&#xD;
      unacceptably high. Patients undergoing CABG surgery transiently develop aspirin resistance,&#xD;
      which likely contributes to vein graft failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe the aspirin resistance is a consequence of rapid platelet turnover&#xD;
      in the early postoperative period, resulting in a large number of platelets unexposed to&#xD;
      aspirin (due to its short half life). The investigators hypothesize that by increasing the&#xD;
      frequency of aspirin dosing, the investigators can reverse the aspirin resistance encountered&#xD;
      post CABG surgery. The investigators are proposing a RCT comparing two different doses of&#xD;
      aspirin (81mg and 325mg daily) to 81mg qid to determine whether multiple daily dosing can&#xD;
      overcome aspirin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1)Given that platelet production is increased many-fold after CABG surgery (and the short&#xD;
      half-life of aspirin), the investigators hypothesize that increasing the frequency of aspirin&#xD;
      dosing will lead to the acetylation of a greater number of platelets over the course of the&#xD;
      day leading to an improved antiplatelet effect (as measured by serum thromboxane and platelet&#xD;
      aggregation assays); (2) The investigators will examine three platelet-related single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that have been implicated in aspirin hyporesponsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are proposing a single centre, randomized, open-label, RCT in 60 patients&#xD;
      undergoing elective or urgent CABG surgery, to receive ASA 81mg daily, 325mg daily or 81 mg&#xD;
      qid starting day 1 post-operatively. All patients will receive 325mg 6hrs following the&#xD;
      procedure (day of operation) as long as there is no contraindication for antiplatelet therapy&#xD;
      (ie significant bleeding) - as per the investigators centre's standard clinical practice.&#xD;
      Further details on aspirin administration and outcome measurements are reported below.&#xD;
