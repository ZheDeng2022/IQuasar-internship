    <textblock>
      The osteotome sinus floor elevation (OSFE) technique has been proved to be a predictable&#xD;
      procedure for successful implant placement in posterior maxillae with limited bone height&#xD;
      under sinus. OSFE is considered to be minimal invasive and minimal traumatic while having a&#xD;
      limitation with regard to the residual bone height. According to the consensus conference in&#xD;
      1996, OSFE technique without bone grafting should be limited to RBH ranging from 7mm to 9mm.&#xD;
      However, recent studies reported favorable results even with RBH of around 4mm. Moreover,&#xD;
      there is still controversy regarding the necessity of a grafting material in order to&#xD;
      maintain the space for new bone formation. Spontaneous bone formation was observed for OSFE&#xD;
      without grafting by some researches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the lack of randomized controlled trial (RCTs), there is still no clear guideline for&#xD;
      implant therapy in posterior maxillae with limited bone height. Neither is there any evidence&#xD;
      to recommend or contraindicate the application of grafting materials in combination with&#xD;
      OSFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present RCT is aimed to evaluate the clinical success of OSFE with RBH of 2mm to 8 mm and&#xD;
      to study whether the application of grafting material in combination with OSFE will be more&#xD;
      favorable. The hypothesis is that the application of simultaneous grafting has no significant&#xD;
      advantage in terms of clinical success. Spontaneous bone formation can be observed with&#xD;
      implants placed using OSFE without grafting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      45 systemically healthy adults consecutively admitted for oral implant therapy will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to 2 test groups. Only one implant system will be used to minimize the&#xD;
      implant-originated influencing factors. Bio-Oss® will be chosen as the bone substitute as it&#xD;
      is currently the typical xenograft available. Autogenous bone will be also used as it is&#xD;
      deemed as 'gold standard' for bone graft materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A panoramic radiograph and cone-beam CT should be taken to assess the pretreatment bone&#xD;
      height under sinus. For T1 group, the autogenous bone chips harvested during the drilling&#xD;
      procedure will be mixed up with Bio-Oss®. And the mixture is placed into the 'socket' by&#xD;
      osteotomes when elevating the sinus membrane until the final depth. For T2 group, no grafting&#xD;
      materials will be used. The subjects will be recalled for follow-up visits at 3 months, 6&#xD;
      months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years,5years and 10 years after surgery for clinical and&#xD;
      radiographic examination. Implant protrusion length, endo-sinus bone gain and crestal bone&#xD;
      level will be measured on the radiographs using specialized software. ANOVA will be performed&#xD;
      for the success rates of the 2 groups. Descriptive statistics will be used for the&#xD;
      radiographic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is aimed to provide preliminary evidence for an important clinical question&#xD;
      that whether OSFE is predictable and reliable with RBH of less than 6mm and whether the&#xD;
      application of grafting materials is necessary for this indication.&#xD;

      1. Specific aims&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To evaluate the clinical success of implants placed in posterior maxillae with&#xD;
                limited residual bone height (2mm to 8 mm) using OSFE with or without simultaneous&#xD;
                grafting&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To study the influence of simultaneous grafting on the clinical success of dental&#xD;
                implants in posterior maxillae using OSFE&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. To observe the bone changes in the elevated space under sinus with or without&#xD;
                grafting.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The null hypothesis is that the application of simultaneous grafting has no significant&#xD;
           advantage in terms of clinical success. Spontaneous bone formation can be observed with&#xD;
           implants placed using OSFE without grafting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background and significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Posterior maxillae commonly pose a challenge for successful dental implants due to the poor&#xD;
      bone quality and insufficient bone quantity. Efforts have been made to allow successful&#xD;
      implant placement in the posterior maxilla subject to limited bone height under the sinus.&#xD;
      Approaches available now include the application of tilting implants, short implants, sinus&#xD;
      floor elevation technique, etc. The osteotome sinus floor elevation (OSFE) technique, first&#xD;
      introduced by Tatum in 1986, has been proved to be a predictable procedure. For OSFE, access&#xD;
      to the sinus membrane is achieved through a crestal approach. Therefore, compared with window&#xD;
      technique, OSFE is considered to be less invasive and less traumatic while having a&#xD;
      limitation with regard to the residual bone height. According to the consensus conference in&#xD;
      1996, OSFE technique should be limited to RBH ranging from 7mm to 9mm. However, with the&#xD;
      improvement of implant design and surgical technique, the high predictability of implant&#xD;
      therapy has encouraged re-evaluation of this limitation. Favorable results have been reported&#xD;
      with more compromised sites even with RBH of around 4mm. Moreover, there is controversy&#xD;
      regarding the necessity of a grafting material in order to maintain the space for new bone&#xD;
      formation. In a previous pilot study, 42 implants was placed in posterior maxillae with OSFE&#xD;
      without bone grafting materials. The RBH ranged from 4mm to 8mm (average 6.36mm). The 5-month&#xD;
      result also demonstrated predictable results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But to date, there is still insufficient data regarding the clinical results of the implants&#xD;
      in posterior maxilla with OSFE technique without grafting and it still remains to be&#xD;
      elucidated the necessity of grafting with OSFE. And the lack of well-designed RCTs makes the&#xD;
      level of evidence relatively low. In this context, therefore, the applicants attempt to&#xD;
      assess the clinical success of dental implants placed in posterior maxillae using OSFE with&#xD;
      or without grafting and to observe the endo-sinus bone changes specially for RBH of only 2mm&#xD;
      to 8 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Subjects will be allocated to the two groups using the random numbers table.&#xD;
      Allocation will be equalized every 20 cases. One research assistant will perform the&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits and procedures Pretreatment Assessment (Baseline) History-taking and consent&#xD;
      taking: A detailed examination should be taken to make sure that the subject should fulfill&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria. The subject will read through and sign the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination: A detailed dental examination should be performed to assess the intended implant&#xD;
      site, which should include the dimension of the edentulous site, the status of mucosa and the&#xD;
      status of adjacent teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline: A panoramic radiograph and an cone-beam CT should be taken to assess the&#xD;
      pretreatment bone height under sinus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure (Surgical Day):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local infiltration anesthesia is used for all the subjects. A midcrestal incision, with&#xD;
      mesial and distal releasing incisions extending well up into the buccal fold is performed and&#xD;
      a full-thickness muco-periosteal flap is reflected. A round bur (Φ2.3 mm) is first used to&#xD;
      mark the implant positions. Then, a minimal pilot drilling (Φ2.2mm) is performed to the depth&#xD;
      approximately1 mm away from the sinus floor boundary according to the depth taken from the&#xD;
      panoramic radiograph or CT scan. The cortical part of the implant bed is further widened to&#xD;
      either Φ3.5mm forΦ4.1mm implants or Φ 4.2mm for Φ4.8mm implants. At this stage, the integrity&#xD;
      of the sinus membrane is examined using the Valsava manoeuvre. Then the elevation of the&#xD;
      maxillary sinus is achieved using Φ2.8mm osteotome by light malleting to achieve the initial&#xD;
      sinus upfracture and is developed with osteotomes of increasing diameters gradually till the&#xD;
      final depth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For group1 , the autogenous bone chips harvested during the drilling procedure was mixed up&#xD;
      with Bio- Oss®. And the mixture is placed into the 'socket' by osteotomes when elevating the&#xD;
      sinus membrane until the final depth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No grafting materials will be used for group2. No profile drill is used for any of the cases.&#xD;
      The implants are placed in the prepared osteotomy site using a hand ratchet without tapping.&#xD;
      All implants are placed in sites using a nonsubmerged technique and in a one stage procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative treatment Amoxicillin (Xinya Co., Shanghai, China, 500mg, 4 times a day for 7&#xD;
      days) and metronidazole (Xinyiwanxiang, Shanghai, China, 400mg, 3 times a day for 7 days)&#xD;
      will be used. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents are prescribed for post-surgical&#xD;
      analgesia. 0.12% chlorhexidine oral rinse was prescribed for 60 seconds 5-6 times a day for&#xD;
      14 days. Sutures were removed after 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were not allowed to use any removable prostheses during healing period. Patients&#xD;
      should avoid blowing the nose during the healing period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prosthetic Procedure (Prosthetic Day) The implants are allowed to heal for 6 months.&#xD;
      Porcelain-fused-to-gold prostheses are attached to the implants 7 to 10 days after impression&#xD;
      taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-ups The subjects will be recalled for follow-up visits at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year,&#xD;
      2 years, 3 years, 5years and 10 years after surgery for clinical and radiographic&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters examined&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline: Pretreatment bone height under sinus at the implant site (mesial and distal)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Surgical Day: Implant protrusion length (mesial and distal)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Prosthetic Day and Follow-ups: Endo-sinus bone gain (mesial and distal)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Prosthetic Day and Follow-ups: Crestal bone level (mesial and distal)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Surgical day: Schneiderian membrane integrity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Follow-ups: Post-operative complications (e.g. nose bleeding, infection)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow-ups: Implant mobility&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Follow-ups: Probing depth Data collection Radiographic data: A panoramic and intra-oral&#xD;
           radiograph will be taken at follow-up visits. For intra-oral radiograph, parallel&#xD;
           technique will be applied. One experienced staff at the department of radiology will be&#xD;
           responsible for taking these radiographs. The parameters will be measured using the&#xD;
           specialized software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data: Dr. Huan-Huan Jiang and Dr. Shi-Chong Qiao, who are blind to which group the&#xD;
      subjects belong to, will be responsible for clinical data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis ANOVA will be performed for the success rates of the 3 groups. The&#xD;
      criterion for significance was set at α=0.05 and β=0.20. The ANOVA is non-directional.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used for the radiographic parameters.&#xD;
