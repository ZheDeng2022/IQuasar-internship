  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Onset of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, typically occurs during late adolescence&#xD;
      or early adulthood often resulting in chronic social and occupational disability. Deficits in&#xD;
      cognition and functional outcome often precede the onset of full-blown psychosis although to&#xD;
      a lesser degree than observed in schizophrenia. Recent progress in risk identification&#xD;
      methodology has enabled reliable detection of persons who appear to be putatively prodromal&#xD;
      for psychosis, that is, at clinical high risk (CHR) of developing a psychotic disorder. Since&#xD;
      these CHR individuals already evidence cognitive deficits, which increase around the time of&#xD;
      conversion, cognition is an excellent treatment target. Furthermore, there is clear evidence,&#xD;
      in schizophrenia and in CHR samples, that deficits in cognition are related to poor&#xD;
      functional outcome. Thus, treatments targeting cognition may consequently improve functional&#xD;
      outcome. The primary aim of the project is to reduce cognitive deterioration and improve&#xD;
      cognition among youths at CHR using cognitive remediation and to test the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      new cognitive remediation program, the Brain Fitness program, in improving cognition of CHR&#xD;
      individuals. A control treatment consisting of video games (VG) will be used. The primary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the BF group will have improved cognition at the end of treatment and 12&#xD;
      months post baseline compared to the VG group. A secondary hypothesis is that improved&#xD;
      cognition will be associated with improved functioning. This is a longitudinal, single blind,&#xD;
      placebo controlled pilot trial of cognitive remediation in 36 CHR persons. Participants will&#xD;
      be randomised to either the BF or VG program, which will be administered over a period of 3&#xD;
      months. Assessments will occur at baseline, post treatment (3 months) and at 12 months after&#xD;
      baseline. All subjects will be recruited in year 1 of the project and treatment will be&#xD;
      completed by 15 months. The 40 hours of training will occur 4 days a week, for an hour each&#xD;
      day, over a period of 10 -12 weeks.&#xD;

      Participants were randomised to either the BFP or a control treatment consisting of&#xD;
      commercial computer games (CG). Participants were not blind to group allocation but all&#xD;
      cognitive and symptom raters were. The 40 hours of BFP or computer game activity was expected&#xD;
      to occur 4 days a week, for an hour each day, over a period of 10-12 weeks. The primary&#xD;
      outcome was cognitive function assessed using the MATRICS consensus cognitive battery MCCB)&#xD;
      (Nuechterlein and others 2008). The secondary outcome was social and role functioning&#xD;
      assessed with Global Functioning: Social and Role scales. All clinical and cognitive&#xD;
      assessments using symptom, functioning and cognitive measures were performed at baseline,&#xD;
      post-treatment (at 3 months) and at 9-month follow-up (i.e. 9 months post baseline or 6&#xD;
      months after post-treatment assessment).&#xD;

             demonstrated that the diagnostic prodromal criteria were present prior to the&#xD;
             antipsychotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Impaired intellectual functioning (i.e IQ&lt;70); however those with an IQ in the 65-69&#xD;
             range will be included if the WRAT reading &gt;75.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Past or current history of a clinically significant central nervous system disorder&#xD;
             that may contribute to prodromal symptoms or confound their assessment.&#xD;

          5. Traumatic Brain Injury that is rated as 7 or above on the Traumatic Brain Injury&#xD;
             screening instrument.&#xD;

             disorder, major depression, anxiety disorders, Axis II Disorders), as long as the&#xD;
             disorder does not account for the diagnosis of prodromal symptoms.&#xD;
