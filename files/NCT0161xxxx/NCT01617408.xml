      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The brain has two systems for recognizing objects. One system recognizes what an object is,&#xD;
      and the other system recognizes where the object is located. However, there is much about how&#xD;
      the brain handles and interprets the information from these two systems that is still&#xD;
      unclear. Researchers want to study the parts of the brain that are involved in how vision is&#xD;
      processed. They will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (TMS) on the brain. MRI measures what parts of the brain become more active when&#xD;
      tasks are performed. TMS uses magnetic pulses to temporarily change the activity in parts of&#xD;
      the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To better understand how people visually recognize different types of objects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study includes many different experiments on vision. Each experiment may combine&#xD;
           visual tasks, MRI scans, and TMS. Participants may be asked to have several different&#xD;
           tests. Each test will require a separate visit to the National Institutes of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will have a&#xD;
           baseline brain scan at the first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may do visual tasks alone, with MRI only, with TMS only, or with MRI and&#xD;
           TMS combined. For the visual tasks, they will look at pictures of objects on a computer&#xD;
           screen. Sometimes the images will appear very briefly (less than one-tenth of a second).&#xD;
           Sometimes they will appear for up to 5 seconds. These images will be of things like&#xD;
           faces, bodies, tools, and scenes. Participants will be asked to respond in different&#xD;
           ways to the pictures. They may respond by typing on a computer keyboard or by pressing a&#xD;
           button. Participants will have time to practice the tasks before the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will remain on the study for up to 3 years....&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      An influential model of cortical organization proposes that the primate visual system is&#xD;
      divided into two functionally distinct pathways (Ungerleider &amp; Mishkin, 1982). The ventral or&#xD;
      what visual pathway, which projects from occipital cortex into the ventral temporal cortex,&#xD;
      is principally used for object recognition and identification. The dorsal or where pathway,&#xD;
      which projects from occipital cortex into the parietal cortex, is principally used for&#xD;
      locating the position of objects in the visual field and for action planning (Milner &amp;&#xD;
      Goodale, 1995; Kravitz et al., 2011). In the proposed series of experiments we will&#xD;
      investigate how neural representations in the ventral and dorsal pathways contribute to a&#xD;
      range of cognitive tasks including object and scene recognition, attentional selection and&#xD;
      face processing. These experiments will principally use transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (TMS) in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS provides a unique experimental tool for studies of human cognitive function because it&#xD;
      can be used to transiently and safely disrupt the neural processing in a targeted cortical&#xD;
      region while subjects perform concurrent behavioral tasks that depend on the operations of&#xD;
      that region. Furthermore TMS can be combined with neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI to&#xD;
      examine the remote effects of the induced neural disruption in other task-dependent regions&#xD;
      distributed across cortex. We plan to use TMS to address unanswered questions concerning the&#xD;
      functioning of the distributed neural networks for different categories of object recognition&#xD;
      and in the attention network of the human brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to test 320 neurologically normal subjects aged between 18 and 50 years old. Subjects&#xD;
      will also take part in an fMRI experiment prior to any subsequent TMS experiments in order to&#xD;
      localize the stimulation sites of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the proposed series of experiments is to examine the effects of the TMS induced&#xD;
      neural disruption on behavioral task performance and the neural correlates of the impaired&#xD;
      performance as measured with fMRI. Broadly these experiments can be divided into studies that&#xD;
      use online and offline TMS. In on-line experiments, TMS will be applied during behavioral&#xD;
      tasks. In off-line experiments, theta burst stimulation (TBS) will be delivered before the&#xD;
      experimental task and off-line experiments may combine TBS with fMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - TMS target site localization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to both online and offline studies subjects will take part in an fMRI experiment&#xD;
      designed to localize particular cortical regions of interest (ROIs). The fMRI experiment will&#xD;
      require the subject to view either a series of different object categories (e.g. faces,&#xD;
      bodies, scenes) or flickering sections of black and white checkerboards in the fMRI scanner.&#xD;
      The results of these fMRI experiments will be used to identify regions of cortex that will&#xD;
      then be targeted with TMS. We will identify TMS target sites using the stereotaxic Brainsight&#xD;
      co-registration software and the scalp location will be marked individually on each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Online behavioral TMS experiments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Online TMS experiments are designed to address the direct effects of the induced neural&#xD;
      disruption on the targeted TMS site only. TMS is delivered during every trial to assess the&#xD;
      effects on concurrent task performance. Subjects will perform a range of visual behavioral&#xD;
      tasks while online TMS is delivered over the cortical region of interest or over control&#xD;
      sites (e.g. vertex). Repetitive TMS will be delivered at a frequency of 10Hz for 500ms. In&#xD;
      some experiments we will alternatively deliver double-pulse TMS at different latencies after&#xD;
      stimulus onset to assess when the targeted region is likely to be involved in task&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Offline TBS experiments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Offline thetaburst (TBS) experiments are also designed to assess the effects of the induced&#xD;
      disruption in the stimulated region. However, rather than delivering TMS during every&#xD;
      experimental trial Thetaburst TMS (TBS) is delivered over the targeted region of interest&#xD;
      (ROI) for latencies up to 60 seconds prior to the subject performing any behavioral task. The&#xD;
      neural effects of this induced disruption have then been shown to last for up to 30 minutes&#xD;
      (Huang et al., 2005). In the offline TBS experiments we propose to deliver 60 seconds of the&#xD;
      TBS over the stimulated ROI. In some of the proposed experiment participants will then be&#xD;
      placed in an fMRI scanner before and after TBS stimulation. During both fMRI sessions&#xD;
      subjects will perform a series of visual discrimination tasks to assess the effects of TBS&#xD;
      disruption both on their behavior and on activity in remote cortical areas as measured with&#xD;
      BOLD activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dependent variables in the online behavioral TMS experiments will be performance&#xD;
      accuracy, sensitivity (d ) and reaction time (RT) measures collected during the concurrently&#xD;
      performed behavioral tasks. Dependent variables in the offline fMRI TBS experiments will be&#xD;
      task performance as well as reduced neuronal activity as measured by decreased BOLD&#xD;
      activation in the targeted and remote ROIs.&#xD;
