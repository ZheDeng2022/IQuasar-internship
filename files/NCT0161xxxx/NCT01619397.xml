  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Clinical Investigation is designed to provide tolerance, acceptability and safety data&#xD;
      of a new condom coating, in its intended use to support future application for CE Mark.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Investigational Device is a standard Natural Rubber Latex (NRL) condom with a coating on&#xD;
      the inside and outside. The Investigational Device is dry to the touch on removal from the&#xD;
      foil. When the coated condom comes into contact with body fluids upon penetration it absorbs&#xD;
      the moisture and forms a lubricious (slippery) layer on the condom. From this point, the&#xD;
      coating and the standard NRL condom feel and behave like a standard pre lubricated condom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condoms are a widely used, cheap and effective contraceptive and an important primary&#xD;
      prevention strategy that can substantially reduce the likelihood of transmitting sexually&#xD;
      transmitted infections (STI's) (Holmes et al, 2004). Consumer studies have revealed that the&#xD;
      'messiness' associated with pre lubricated condoms can be off putting to the consumer and&#xD;
      possibly deter use completely. It is thought that as the condom coating is initially dry to&#xD;
      the touch this may remove the 'messiness'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the Investigation is 3 days. In that time subjects will attend the clinic 3&#xD;
      times, (Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3) for baseline assessments and subsequent Clinical Assessments.&#xD;
      Clinical Assessments will include an examination of the external genitals (both male and&#xD;
      female subjects) and internal genitals (female subjects only) in order to make an assessment&#xD;
      of dermal tolerance of the area when exposed to a Project Unusual Condom in-use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Couples will be provided with Investigation Device at visit 1 and Visit 2. There is a 24 hour&#xD;
      period after receipt of Investigational Device in which couples are asked to use the condom&#xD;
      for 1 act of vaginal intercourse, recording compliance and their experience of the&#xD;
      Investigational Device in a Diary Card and questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments of tolerance will be made by the PI throughout the Investigation. The PI is a&#xD;
      Physician with extensive Dermatology training. Assessments of dermal tolerance will include&#xD;
      scoring particular sites according to a Total Irritancy score, providing a Global Assessment&#xD;
      of Tolerance and at the end of the Clinical Investigation the Investigator will make an&#xD;
      Overall Tolerance Rating Statement.&#xD;
