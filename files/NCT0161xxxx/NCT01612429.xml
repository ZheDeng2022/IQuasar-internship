      This is a pilot study to evaluate the effects of amino acid supplementation on the structure&#xD;
      of certain proteins in the blood of dialysis patients. Patients with end stage renal disease&#xD;
      (ESRD) usually have high levels of urea that may interact with blood proteins and change&#xD;
      their structure by a process known as carbamylation. The investigators are interested in&#xD;
      determining whether carbamylation is linked to adverse outcomes in dialysis patients and have&#xD;
      hypothesized that supplementation with a balanced formulation of amino acids can reduce the&#xD;
      amount of carbamylation that occurs. In this study, dialysis patients (n= up to 30) will&#xD;
      receive intravenous supplementation with an FDA-approved amino acid solution (NephrAmine®,&#xD;
      5.4% amino acids) during regular dialysis sessions (3 times weekly for 6 weeks). During the 6&#xD;
      weeks of therapy and for 2 weeks of follow-up, blood will be drawn from patients' existing&#xD;
      hemodialysis access ports (~60 ml total per month) to measure levels of carbamylated albumin,&#xD;
      amino acids, and standard laboratory values. Patients will be closely monitored for safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of the amino acid therapy. For each treated subject, we will follow an&#xD;
      additional individual that is not receiving treatment to serve as a control (no&#xD;
      intervention).&#xD;

      As human kidney function declines so does the ability to excrete urea, the chief end product&#xD;
      of nitrogen metabolism. Though elevated blood urea levels denote a loss of kidney function,&#xD;
      they may also serve as a source for the pathophysiological consequences of kidney failure.&#xD;
      Urea spontaneously dissociates to form cyanate, which in its unprotonated form can react with&#xD;
      protein amino groups in a process known as carbamylation. Carbamylation-induced protein&#xD;
      alterations may be involved in the progression of various diseases by changing the structure,&#xD;
      charge, and function of enzymes, hormones, receptors, and amino acids. For example, proteins&#xD;
      as diverse as collagen and low density lipoproteins (LDLs), are shown to induce the&#xD;
      characteristic biochemical events of atherosclerosis progression when carbamylated. Our&#xD;
      research seeks to examine how protein carbamylation contributes to the pathological sequelae&#xD;
      of end stage renal disease (ESRD) and determine if novel therapeutics can attenuate this&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percent carbamylated albumin level can be used as a measure of overall carbamylation burden.&#xD;
      Our preliminary work shows a negative correlation between subjects' percent carbamylated&#xD;
      albumin level and circulating amino acids, suggesting that free amino acids may be active&#xD;
      scavengers for reactive isocyanate. Furthermore, ex vivo studies show that amino acid&#xD;
      supplementation attenuates the carbamylation reaction from occurring. To better assess the&#xD;
      biologic pathways affecting carbamylation in dialysis patients and to bring discoveries&#xD;
      closer to clinical and therapeutic application, we aim to conduct a pilot study evaluating&#xD;
      the effect of amino acid supplementation on carbamylation in participants with ESRD&#xD;
      undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. We believe elevated urea and amino acid deficiencies may&#xD;
      play dominant roles in the carbamylation of proteins in ESRD and protein carbamylation may be&#xD;
      modifiable by amino acid therapy. The proposed pilot study will directly assess this concept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the study are to evaluate the effect of amino acid supplementation on&#xD;
      carbamylation in ESRD patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis: (1) by evaluating safe&#xD;
      and optimal amino acid supplement dosing and (2) by investigating the effect of amino acid&#xD;
      supplementation on plasma carbamylated albumin levels.&#xD;
