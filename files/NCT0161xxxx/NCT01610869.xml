  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to explore the efficacy and safety of an all oral combination of&#xD;
      BIBF 1120 (an inhibitor of angiogenic signalling) and metronomic cyclophosphamide in patients&#xD;
      with multiply-relapsed advanced ovarian cancer, who have completed a minimum of two lines of&#xD;
      previous chemotherapy and who for any reason are not suitable for further 'standard'&#xD;
      intravenous chemotherapy treatments.&#xD;

      A randomised placebo controlled double blind multi-centre phase II trial: BIBF 1120 200mg bd&#xD;
      plus 100mg daily of oral cyclophosphamide (experimental arm) or oral cyclophosphamide 100mg&#xD;
      daily plus placebo (control arm). Patients will receive oral BIBF 1120 and cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      or cyclophosphamide and placebo continuously until disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
