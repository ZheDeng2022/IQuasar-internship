      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • The investigators aim to conduct a questionnaire survey in a South-East Asian tertiary&#xD;
      institution, to assess whether breast cancer patients and their physicians would consider the&#xD;
      use of three different kinds of genetic tests currently available to breast cancer patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BRCA1/2 germline testing,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CYP2D6 genotyping and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oncotype DX® testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore factors which might influence their decisions on genetic testing, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Acceptability of the tests and anti-cancer management based on the test results&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reliability and affordability of the test&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ability of the test to influence treatment decisions&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Broader implications of the test, e.g., psychosocial, financial impact Study design:&#xD;
           Cross-sectional study, Survey Questionnaires were developed for 3 categories of&#xD;
           individuals:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with early stage breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Healthcare professionals caring for breast cancer patients&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical students /cancer researchers The questionnaires for patients and medical&#xD;
                students/cancer researchers are similar. The questionnaires contain a brief section&#xD;
                on demographic information, interest in and past experience with genetic testing.&#xD;
                Three hypothetical situations are described to determine if participants will agree&#xD;
                to BRCA1/2 testing, CYP2D6 genotyping and Oncotype DX® testing, respectively. 18&#xD;
                categorical 'yes'/ 'no' questions explore reasons for their decisions. Each&#xD;
                scenario requires a short, hand-written response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire for healthcare professionals contains a brief section on demographics and&#xD;
      past experience with genetic testing. Three hypothetical situations are described to&#xD;
      determine if healthcare professionals will recommend their patients for BRCA1/2 testing,&#xD;
      CYP2D6 genotyping and Oncotype DX® testing, respectively. 12 categorical questions explore&#xD;
      the reasons for their decision, and physicians are required to rank these in order of&#xD;
      importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distribution of questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires will be handed out to agreeable participants on the following occasions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients- National University Health System Cancer Centre Level 3 amp; 4 waiting areas&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medical students - before or after lectures, or at personal contact&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cancer researchers - before or after lectures, or at personal contact&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Healthcare professionals - before or after NUHS breast tumour board, or at personal&#xD;
           contact Due caution will be exercised to ensure that the questionnaire is only handed&#xD;
           out to subjects who are aged 21 years and above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No subject identity will be collected for these questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale and Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BRCA1/2 germline testing, CYP2D6 genotyping and Oncotype DX® testing have all been approved&#xD;
      for use in clinical practice, but controversy still exists surrounding their utility, and&#xD;
      apart from BRCA1/2 mutation testing in high-risk individuals, genetic tests are not routinely&#xD;
      performed in Singapore. BRCA1/2 germline mutation testing is performed in individuals at high&#xD;
      risk for hereditary cancer. CYP2D6 genotype testing predicts the benefit of adjuvant&#xD;
      tamoxifen therapy; poor and intermediate metabolisers of tamoxifen may have a higher risk of&#xD;
      breast cancer recurrence due to lower efficacy of tamoxifen because of less efficient&#xD;
      conversion of tamoxifen to endoxifen, the active metabolite of tamoxifen. Oncotype DX®&#xD;
      testing is a gene-expression profiling test performed on a formalin-fixed paraffin embedded&#xD;
      tumour specimen, to predict the risk of breast cancer recurrence and guide decisions on&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy. Understanding the attitudes of patients and medical professionals&#xD;
      toward these genetic tests may help to guide medical oncologists in their clinical&#xD;
      recommendations and utilization of these tests in breast cancer patients.&#xD;
