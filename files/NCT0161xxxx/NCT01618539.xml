  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General Anesthesia is usually produced by an intravenous agent and then maintained with a&#xD;
      breathing agent till the surgery is completed. However, there is a recent trend to produce&#xD;
      and maintain general anesthesia solely with an intravenous agent, such as propofol, in view&#xD;
      of its advantages. This delivery method is called Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA). The&#xD;
      depth of general anesthesia can be measured by an anesthetic depth monitoring device called&#xD;
      Bispectral Index (BIS). The use of BIS to determine the depth of anesthesia has been well&#xD;
      established whenever a breathing agent is used to maintain general anesthesia. However, the&#xD;
      validity of using BIS with TIVA has not been adequately investigated. This study will compare&#xD;
      the BIS values at different doses of TIVA in order to establish any correlation between the&#xD;
      two. If such a correlation is established, BIS monitoring can safely be recommended to&#xD;
      determine anesthetic depth under TIVA.&#xD;

      Pre-anesthetic Management: This research will be initiated after receiving an approval from&#xD;
      the Institution Review Board, and an informed written consent will be obtained from each&#xD;
      patient. Forty patients in the age range 18-65 years and presenting for elective orthopedic&#xD;
      or gynecological procedures will be recruited. Both male and female patients will be&#xD;
      considered. Only patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I,&#xD;
      II and III will be included. Patients who are pregnant and those with uncontrolled&#xD;
      hypertension with BP above 180/100, unstable angina, chronic obstructive lung disease&#xD;
      requiring oxygen therapy at home, and end-stage liver and kidney diseases will be excluded.&#xD;
      In addition, orthopedic surgery that needs the patient in prone position will not be eligible&#xD;
      for this investigation. Patients who have a medication allergy to propofol and food allergy&#xD;
      to egg and soy, since egg lecithin and soy milk are constituents of propofol preparation,&#xD;
      will be excluded. In order to have a complete data collection, only surgical procedures&#xD;
      scheduled to last more than three hours will be considered for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic Management: Routine anesthetic care, such as intravenous line placement and&#xD;
      American Society of Anesthesiologists' standard monitoring, will be applied to all patients.&#xD;
      In addition, a non-invasive Bispectral Index (BIS) sensor will be placed on patient's&#xD;
      forehead and connected to its monitor. Midazolam (25mcg/kg) and fentanyl (1mcg/kg) will be&#xD;
      administered to establish preanesthetic sedation and analgesia, respectively. Lidocaine 40mg&#xD;
      will be given to attenuate propofol-induced injection pain. Thereafter, Total Intravenous&#xD;
      Anesthesia (TIVA) will be induced with propofol (2mg/kg), and tracheal intubation facilitated&#xD;
      with a neuromuscular blocking agent chosen by the attending anesthesiologist. The skeletal&#xD;
      muscle relaxation will be maintained as needed for the surgical procedure. The TIVA will be&#xD;
      maintained with propofol infusion, for approximately half-hour, at 160mcg/kg/min with minor&#xD;
      adjustment, as needed, to maintain patient's vital signs within ± 20% of the baseline. Once a&#xD;
      steady state is established, propofol infusion rate will be reduced to 140mcg/kg/min and&#xD;
      maintained for approximately 15-30 min, following which the infusion rate will be increased&#xD;
      to 180mcg/kg/min and maintained for the same period of time. Thereafter, the propofol&#xD;
      infusion rate will be returned to 160mcg/kg/min. This exercise will be repeated at&#xD;
      120mcg/kg/min and 200mcg/kg/min if patient's vital signs permit. In addition, remifentanil at&#xD;
      an infusion rate of 0.02 - 0.2mcg/kg/min will be administered to provide surgical analgesia&#xD;
      during the general anesthetic period. The infusion rate of remifentanil will be tailored to&#xD;
      the demands of the surgical stimulation. During the study period, the attending&#xD;
      anesthesiologist will have the option to deviate from the study protocol and adjust the&#xD;
      propofol infusion rate, as needed, to maintain patient's vital signs within ± 20% of the&#xD;
      baseline if such a need arises. An independent observer will continuously monitor the BIS&#xD;
      values at all time frames. Following the study period needed to collect the required data,&#xD;
      the attending anesthesiologist will have the option to continue general anesthesia with&#xD;
      either TIVA or with the traditional inhalational anesthetic. The reversal of the&#xD;
      neuromuscular blockade and subsequent tracheal extubation, at the conclusion of surgery, will&#xD;
      be performed using the customary criteria employed in anesthetic practice. In addition, the&#xD;
      routine protocols used for surgical infection prevention and attenuation of postoperative&#xD;
      pain and vomiting will be followed.&#xD;
