      The purpose of this study is to determine if changes in blood vessel health lead to the&#xD;
      menstrual irregularities that women with PCOS experience. This research study will help&#xD;
      determine if women with PCOS have early changes in their blood vessels called &quot;endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction,&quot; and if the number of progenitor cells (cells that in a healthy person repair&#xD;
      blood vessel damage) are related to these blood vessel changes. To do so, we will compare&#xD;
      ultrasound (soundwave) pictures of a large blood vessel in the arm and the results of blood&#xD;
      tests between women with PCOS and other healthy women with normal menstrual periods.&#xD;

      Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although adult women with PCOS demonstrate evidence of endothelial dysfunction, little is&#xD;
      known regarding alterations in the number of pro-inflammatory monocytes, CEC, CPC, and ECFC&#xD;
      (endothelial injury/repair profile) among affected women. For many women, the clinical&#xD;
      manifestations of PCOS emerge during adolescence. Based on studies documenting the increased&#xD;
      prevalence of MetS and inflammatory markers in adolescent girls with PCOS, and non-invasive&#xD;
      studies documenting the presence of endothelial dysfunction in children with traditional&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors, it is likely adolescent girls with PCOS already manifest&#xD;
      evidence of early vascular dysfunction, which may in turn impair follicular development and&#xD;
      contribute to the development of infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, we hypothesize that perturbations in the balance between circulating&#xD;
      inflammatory and progenitor cells contribute to the endothelial dysfunction observed in adult&#xD;
      women with PCOS. Specifically, we anticipate that PCOS women will manifest greater evidence&#xD;
      of vascular injury (increased numbers of inflammatory monocytes, CEC, and ECFC) and impaired&#xD;
      endothelial repair (decreased levels of CPC) compared with control women. Moreover, we&#xD;
      propose that, in adolescent girls with PCOS, endothelial dysfunction and corresponding&#xD;
      alterations in the endothelial injury/repair profile are already present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Determine if the endothelial injury/repair profile (inflammatory monocytes,&#xD;
      CEC, CPC, and ECFC) assessed by flow cytometry (PFC) and endothelial function (assessed by&#xD;
      flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) of the brachial artery) are altered in treatment-naïve adult&#xD;
      (18-40 years of age) women with PCOS (n=15) compared with age and body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI)-matched control women (n=15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Determine if the endothelial injury/repair profile assessed by PFC, AGE&#xD;
      levels, and endothelial function (assessed by FMD of the brachial artery) are altered in&#xD;
      treatment-naïve adolescents (14-17 years of age) with PCOS (n=15) compared with age and&#xD;
      BMI-Z-score-matched control girls (n=15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Determine if observed alterations in the endothelial injury/repair profile&#xD;
      (pro-inflammatory monocytes, CEC, CPC and ECFC) or levels of AGE correlate with endothelial&#xD;
      function (assessed by FMD of the brachial artery) in adolescent and adult women with (n=30)&#xD;
      and without PCOS (n=30), and whether androgens, insulin resistance, or other cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factors influence these relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross-sectional study design involving 30 post-menarchal adolescents and 30 adult&#xD;
      female subjects. Specifically, the adolescent population will include 15 treatment-naïve&#xD;
      adolescent females (ages 14-17 years) with PCOS and 15 age- and BMI-percentile-matched&#xD;
      control adolescent subjects. Similarly, the adult study population will include 15&#xD;
      treatment-naïve adult females (ages 18-40 years) with PCOS and 15 age- and BMI-matched&#xD;
      control women. All study procedures will be conducted at the Clinical Research Services Unit&#xD;
      (CRSU) at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) during a single visit (~3.5 hrs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRSU Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted to the CRSU after a 12-hour overnight fast. Subjects will also be&#xD;
      instructed to refrain from vigorous physical activity for 24 hours prior to the visit. All&#xD;
      participants will undergo a detailed medical history (including a menstrual history) and a&#xD;
      complete physical examination (including assessments of Tanner Staging for breast and pubic&#xD;
      hair development). Hirsutism will be assessed using the modified Ferriman-Gallwey scoring&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the study visit, the following anthropometric measurements with be performed on all&#xD;
      subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure obtained in left arm - 3 readings at 5 minute intervals&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temperature&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height (2 measurements)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight (2 measurements)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Waist/umbilicus/hip circumference measurements (2 measurements)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bioimpedence&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the study visit a resting electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained for all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the study visit, the following labs will be obtained on all subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comprehensive metabolic panel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipid panel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TSH*&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prolactin*&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  17-hydroxyprogesterone*&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testosterone* *These analyses are to be performed only when additional eligibility&#xD;
           screening is needed and only at PI request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo measurement of brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD).&#xD;
      FMD testing will be performed by the PI or Co-Investigator in the CRSU Peripheral Vascular&#xD;
      Lab with the assistance of a trained technician using an ultrasound peripheral vascular&#xD;
      imaging system. Adult subjects only will also undergo brachial artery reactivity testing for&#xD;
      the assessment of non-endothelial dependent (NED) vessel dilation following the&#xD;
      administration of nitroglycerin. NED testing will be performed following a rest period of at&#xD;
      least 15 minutes from completion of the FMD testing. 400 μg of nitroglycerin will be&#xD;
      administered sublingually, and images will be recorded for at least 3 minutes following the&#xD;
      administration of nitroglycerin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the FMD testing (allow 30 minute interval), all subjects are to undergo a 2-hour 75&#xD;
      g oral glucose tolerance test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Samples collected at baseline (-15 and 0) and 30 minute intervals for glucose, insulin&#xD;

    <description>A blood pressure cuff is placed on right forearm. A 7-12MHz linear array ultrasound transducer is placed on upper arm. 2-D and Doppler images are acquired. Forearm cuff is inflated to ~ 50 mmHg above resting systolic blood pressure (max 300 mmHg) for 4.5 minutes, then deflated. Blood flow velocity via Doppler is recorded for 15 seconds; 2D-images of the brachial artery are collected for 3 minutes. Brachial artery diameter is measured at end diastole (R-wave on ECG).FMD is determined: %FMD=(LDp-LDb)/LDbx100, where LDp=luminal diameter after inflation and LDb=luminal diameter at baseline</description>
