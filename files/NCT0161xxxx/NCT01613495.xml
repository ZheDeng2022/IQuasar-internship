  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about how octreotide (Sandostatin LAR速 Depot)&#xD;
      affects levels of ghrelin, hunger, and body weight in people with Prader-Willi Syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After baseline tests, a nurse will administer monthly injections of Sandostatin LAR速 or&#xD;
      placebo for 6 months. At the end of this initial 6-month treatment period and a 4-month&#xD;
      washout period, study subjects will then crossover to receive the alternative therapy&#xD;
      (placebo or octreotide) for an additional 6 months. Subjects will be followed for 16 months&#xD;
      total at scheduled visits: 0, 2, 6, 10, 12, and 16 months (Table 2).&#xD;

    <description>They will be admitted to the inpatient unit of the OCTRI for testing six times. During each of these visits, testing will include measuring how well glucose (sugar) is processed, how much energy is burned off as heat, their amount of body fat, levels of the hormone ghrelin, and how much food is eaten at a meal. After the first study visit, subjects will begin monthly treatment with either the study drug or a placebo (an inactive substance), which will be continued for the first six months of the study. For the last six months of the study, subjects will be switched to the opposite treatment. During these study periods participants will return monthly for administration of study medication, physical examination, and blood draw to check liver enzymes.</description>
