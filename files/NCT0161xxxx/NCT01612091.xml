    <textblock>
      The Mobile Messenger is a unified, portable and intelligent device that integrates&#xD;
      information from multiple patient monitors, mechanical ventilators, infusion pumps and&#xD;
      clinical information systems on a mobile platform. It will allow nurses, respiratory&#xD;
      therapists and physicians to continuously monitor and coordinate care of critically ill&#xD;
      patients. This study will use a participatory design process to guide the design of an&#xD;
      integrated mobile device. Next, we will evaluate the proposed device in a simulated ICU&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are a limited number of nurses, respiratory therapists and physicians in an ICU at a&#xD;
      given time. To make decisions and plan therapies, these clinicians need to observe,&#xD;
      assimilate and interpret a vast array of information originating from various devices located&#xD;
      on the bedsides of multiple patients. Several shortcomings in existing technology limit their&#xD;
      abilities: a) the fixed location of monitoring devices at the bedside; b) information&#xD;
      overload from a multitude of devices, each with its own display; c) the lack of integration&#xD;
      and interaction between these devices; d) the use of visually cumbersome displays, which were&#xD;
      historically created for monitoring during anesthesia but never optimized for users in the&#xD;
      ICU; and e) lack of context specific information (such as historical trends) to support&#xD;
      patient data interpretation and clinical decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project proposes to address these challenges in ICU monitoring by developing a unified,&#xD;
      portable, and intelligent device: the Monitoring Messenger. By integrating information from&#xD;
      multiple monitoring devices, mechanical ventilators, infusion pumps and clinical information&#xD;
      systems on a mobile device (tablet PC or smart phone); the Monitoring Messenger will allow&#xD;
      nurses, respiratory therapists and physicians on or off-site, to continuously monitor&#xD;
      critically ill patients, thereby increasing patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed experiment will have two parts: Part I - Participatory design and Part II -&#xD;
      Simulation Experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part I - Participatory Design. Participatory design an inter-professional team of nurses,&#xD;
      physicians, designers, engineers, and human factors experts will follow a user-centered&#xD;
      design process to obtain the system requirements, and obtain feedback during the rapid&#xD;
      prototyping phase of prototype development. While we expect the resulting prototype to be&#xD;
      easy to use, support decision making, improve awareness of the patient's condition by health&#xD;
      care providers and reduce mental workload, this methodology is not hypothesis driven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II - Simulation Experiment. In simulated ICU scenarios, the critical care physicians,&#xD;
      nurses, and respiratory therapists will prioritize the care of critically ill patients. We&#xD;
      expect them to do so more accurately with the use of Monitoring Messenger than with their&#xD;
      regular tool (monitors, paper records etc). A potential outcome would be a decrease in mental&#xD;
      workload as well as an increase in situational awareness.&#xD;
