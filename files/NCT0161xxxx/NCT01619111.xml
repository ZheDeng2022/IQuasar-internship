  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HER2 status in breast cancer patients may change during the course of the disease. In 30%&#xD;
      of initially HER2-negative patients with circulating tumor cells (CTC), HER2-positive CTCs&#xD;
      can be detected in peripheral blood samples(1). At present, it is unclear if therapy based on&#xD;
      the HER2 status of CTC offers a clinical benefit for these patients. The DETECT III - trial&#xD;
      compares lapatinib, as HER2-targeted therapy in combination with standard therapy versus&#xD;
      standard therapy alone in those patients, with initially HER2-negative metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer and HER2-positive circulating tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As one of the first interventional trials based on the assessment of CTC phenotypes, the&#xD;
      DETECT III - trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of HER2-targeted therapy in patients with&#xD;
      MBC and HER2-positive CTCs as well as the significance of CTC as an early predictive marker&#xD;
      for treatment response.&#xD;
