  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DTRAX Graft is used to relieve nerve pressure in the neck in order to provide relief for&#xD;
      Cervical Degenerative Disc Disease. This study is being conducted to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the graft, and to find out whether or not it provides better results or&#xD;
      faster healing than traditional ways of performing surgery for Cervical Degenerative Disc&#xD;
      Disease.&#xD;
