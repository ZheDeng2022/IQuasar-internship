    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy, preferably combined with chemotherapy, is the treatment standard for locally&#xD;
      advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The tumor response to different&#xD;
      therapy protocols is variable, with hypoxia known to be a major factor that negatively&#xD;
      influences treatment effectiveness. Visualisation of tumor hypoxia prior to the use of modern&#xD;
      radiation therapy strategies, such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), might&#xD;
      allow higher dose applications to the target volume, leading to improvement of therapy&#xD;
      outcome. 18F-fluoromisonidazole dynamic positron emission tomography and computed tomography&#xD;
      (18F-FMISO dPET-CT) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (functional MRI) are attractive&#xD;
      strategies for imaging tumor hypoxia. The HIL trial is a single centre pilot study combining&#xD;
      multimodal hypoxia imaging with 18F-FMISO dPET-CT and functional MRI and intensity modulated&#xD;
      radiation therapy (IMRT) in patients with inoperable stage III NSCLC. 15 patients are&#xD;
      recruited in the study. All patients undergo serial 18F-FMISO dPET-CT and functional MRI&#xD;
      before treatment, at week 5 of radiotherapy and 6 weeks post treatment. Radiation therapy is&#xD;
      performed as inversely planned IMRT after four dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT) based&#xD;
      target volume definition. Hypoxia imaging is not included in target volume definition or IMRT&#xD;
      dose prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the trial are to characterize the correlation of 18F-FMISO dPET-CT and&#xD;
      functional MRI for tumor hypoxia imaging in NSCLC and evaluate possible effects of radiation&#xD;
      therapy on tumor re-oxygenation. Further objectives include the generation of data regarding&#xD;
      the prognostic value of 18F-FMISO dPET-CT and functional MRI for locoregional control,&#xD;
      progression free survival and overall survival of NSCLC treated with IMRT, which will form&#xD;
      the basis for larger clinical trials focusing on possible interactions between tumor&#xD;
      oxygenation and radiation outcome.&#xD;

      The HIL-trial has been designed by the study initiators at the Clinical Cooperation Unit&#xD;
      Radiation Oncology at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), the Clinical Cooperation Unit&#xD;
      Nuclear Medicine at DKFZ, the Department of Radiology at DKFZ and the Department of Radiation&#xD;
      Oncology at the University Clinic Heidelberg. The trial is carried out at DKFZ in&#xD;
      co-operation with the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University Clinic Heidelberg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study is to characterize the correlation of 18F-FMISO dPET-CT and functional MRI&#xD;
      for tumor hypoxia imaging in patients with stage III NSCLC, treated with intensity modulated&#xD;
      radiotherapy (IMRT) and evaluate changes in tumor oxygenation during radiation treatment.&#xD;
      Objectives include the evaluation of the prognostic value of multimodal hypoxia imaging for&#xD;
      locoregional control, progression free survival and overall survival of patients with NSCLC&#xD;
      treated with IMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a single centre pilot trial with an accrual of 15 patients with&#xD;
      inoperable stage III NSCLC. Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria are treated with&#xD;
      intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). All patients undergo serial 18F-FMISO dPET-CT&#xD;
      and functional MRI before treatment, at week 5 of radiotherapy and 6 weeks post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients are informed about participation in the trial with possible benefits and&#xD;
      risks, and written informed consent is obtained. Staging is completed through performance of&#xD;
      thoracic CT scan, abdominal ultrasound and 18F-FDG dPET-CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After immobilization in a vacuum mattress a contrast-enhanced thoracic CT scan including four&#xD;
      dimensional respiratory triggering is carried out. CT data are synchronized with the recorded&#xD;
      respiratory signal and four-dimensional reconstructions are performed to evaluate the motion&#xD;
      of the thoracic organs and the tumor during the breathing cycle. Based on the 4D-CT data set,&#xD;
      radiation treatment planning is carried out as inverse planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation therapy is performed as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). A dose of&#xD;
      50-54 Gy is applied to the primary tumor and mediastinal lymph nodes in daily fractions of 5&#xD;
      × 2 Gy. Subsequently, the primary tumor and involved lymph nodes are boosted to a total dose&#xD;
      of 60-72 Gy in daily fractions of 5 × 2 Gy. Tolerance doses of thoracic organs at risk are&#xD;
      not exceeded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment is carried out on an out-patient basis unless the condition of the patient requires&#xD;
      hospital administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-FMISO is provided by Iason (Graz, Austria). 18F-FMISO dPET-CT investigations are&#xD;
      performed prior to radiotherapy, at week 5 of radiation therapy and at 6 weeks post&#xD;
      treatment. dPET-CT examinations are performed after the i.v. injection of 18F-FMISO using an&#xD;
      Biograph mCT S128(Siemens Medical Solutions Co., Erlangen, Germany). The dynamic studies are&#xD;
      acquired with a 28-frame protocol for one hour. Quantification is performed following the&#xD;
      iterative reconstruction of the dPET-CT data using a dedicated software package. Generally,&#xD;
      volumes-of-interest (VOIs) are placed over the tumor and reference regions, followed by a&#xD;
      compartment and non-compartment analysis. A two-tissue compartment model is the model of&#xD;
      choice and five parameters will be obtained. The quantification includes the calculation of&#xD;
      the fractional blood volume, also named as vessel density (VB), the parameters k1 and k2,&#xD;
      which reflect the influx and efflux of FMISO into and out of the cells, and k3 and k4, which&#xD;
      are related to the trapping and re-oxygenation of FMISO. For the input function the mean&#xD;
      value of the VOI data obtained from a large arterial vessel like the descending aorta is&#xD;
      used. Besides the VOI based analysis, parametric images are calculated to assess dedicated&#xD;
      parameters of the FMISO kinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the compartment analysis a non-compartment model based on the fractal dimension is&#xD;
      used. The fractal dimension (FD) is a parameter for the heterogeneity and is calculated for&#xD;
      the time activity data of each individual VOI. The values of the fractal dimension vary from&#xD;
      0 to 2 showing the deterministic or chaotic distribution of the tracer activity. We use a&#xD;
      subdivision of 7x7 and a maximal SUV of 20 for the calculation of FD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional MRI investigations are performed prior to radiation therapy, at week 5 of&#xD;
      radiation therapy and at 6 weeks post treatment. All examinations are performed using a&#xD;
      clinical 1.5-T MRI scanner (Magnetom Avanto, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard protocol comprises a coronal and a transversal breath-hold TrueFISP, T2w&#xD;
      single-shot half-Fourier TSE (HASTE) and T1w 3D-GRE (VIBE) sequence. Afterwards, a navigator&#xD;
      triggered transversal T2w-FatSat sequence (T2-FS BLADE) is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diffusion weighted imaging is performed using an axial single shot echoplanar (EPI) sequence&#xD;
      with and without flow-compensation. A total of ten b-values (0, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300,&#xD;
      400, 500 and 800 s/mm2) is acquired enabling extraction of diffusion and perfusion&#xD;
      parameters. DWI parameters are evaluated based on the Intravoxel Incoherent motion (IVIM)&#xD;
      model, yielding the parameters perfusion fraction f and diffusion constant D, using in house&#xD;
      developed open-source software MITK Diffusion, Version 2011 (downloadable at www.mitk.org).&#xD;
      The parameter estimation is based on the assumption that the diffusion measurement is&#xD;
      influenced by mainly two effects, a perfusion related effect introduced by the molecules&#xD;
      moving in the capillary network (pseudodiffusion coefficient, D*) and extravascular effects&#xD;
      of passive diffusion (D). Since a simultaneous nonlinear fit for all parameters D, D*, and&#xD;
      the weighting coefficient f can be instable, measurement at b-values greater than 200 s/mm²&#xD;
      are used in a first step to estimate f and D as described. D* is then calculated in a second&#xD;
      step by using exhaustive search.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung cancer perfusion is assessed using a spoiled 3D gradient echo sequence after bolus&#xD;
      injection of 0.07 mmol/kg body weight of Gd-DTPA. Ten acquisitions in one expiratory breath&#xD;
      hold (10 x 2.25 s = 22 s) are followed by 50 navigator-triggered acquisitions under free&#xD;
      breathing. After a co-registration of the 3D data sets, a ROI-based visualization of the&#xD;
      signal-time curves is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, a time-resolved echoshared gradient echo sequence (TWIST) is performed for&#xD;
      assessment of three-dimensional tumor motion (240 x 0.5s = TA 2 min). A dynamic 2D-TrueFISP&#xD;
      sequence acquired in coronal orientation crossing the centre of the tumor provides additional&#xD;
      information about lung and tumor motion during the breathing cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrast-enhanced sequences breath hold 3D-GRE sequence (VIBE) complete this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first follow-up is planned 6 weeks post treatment and includes study-related 18F-FMISO&#xD;
      dPET-CT and functional MRI examinations. Further regular follow-up visits are scheduled every&#xD;
      3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for the following 3 years and thereafter&#xD;
      yearly. Individual trial participation is completed three years after patient enrolment or&#xD;
      death of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapeutic efficacy will be evaluated through thoracic CT-scan at follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective and non-randomized trial with inclusion of 15 patients. Repeated&#xD;
      examinations with 18F-FMISO dPET-CT and functional MRI lead to longitudinal data for every&#xD;
      patient. The data consists of maps obtained from both measurement devices. Data are&#xD;
      quantitative measurements but may be dichotomized or categorized into more than two classes.&#xD;
      For all parameters, differences between the site of local relapse and a selected control&#xD;
      region are derived and compaired by paired tests at 5% level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses are exploratory. A sample size calculation cannot be performed because neither&#xD;
      standard deviation of the differences has been estimated before, nor the relevant difference&#xD;
      is known. Therefore, the study is a pilot study to generate hypotheses for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the frame of the radiation therapy planning study, virtual radiation therapy strategies&#xD;
      are compared to the radiation therapy administered to the patient.&#xD;
