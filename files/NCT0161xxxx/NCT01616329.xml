    <textblock>
      Alloantibodies can lead to serious clinical consequences and logistic problems like obtaining&#xD;
      properly and timely matched blood for the patients who do develop these antibodies.&#xD;
      Prevention of such serious events is possible by extended matching and typing of donor's&#xD;
      blood against the patient's for all the possible antigens, but this process is cumbersome and&#xD;
      costly. Identifying a high risk group will be a feasible first target for advanced matching a&#xD;
      big step forward, and the aim of the investigators study. The aim of the project is to&#xD;
      examine the association between clinical, environmental and genetic characteristics of the&#xD;
      recipient of erythrocyte transfusions and the risk or resistance to immunization against&#xD;
      erythrocyte alloantigens that he/she was exposed to during that transfusion episode.&#xD;

      Introduction: Individuals exposed to red blood cell (RBC) alloantigens through transfusion,&#xD;
      pregnancy, or transplantation may produce antibodies against the alloantigens expressed by&#xD;
      RBCs. Although the incidence of these events is debated and ranges between percentages of&#xD;
      1-6% in single transfused patients and up to 30 % in poly-transfused patients (e.g. sickle&#xD;
      cell disease, thalassemia and myelodysplasia), they can pose serious clinical problems such&#xD;
      as delayed haemolytic reactions as well as logistic problems e.g. to obtain timely and&#xD;
      properly matched transfusion blood for patients in which new alloantibodies are detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: It is known that the risk of a recipient to develop antibodies depends on dose and&#xD;
      route of administration and the immunogenicity of the antigen, as well as on genetic or&#xD;
      acquired patient-related factors. The latter factors however are ill defined and therefore we&#xD;
      hypothesize that the particular clinical conditions (e.g. used medication, concomitant&#xD;
      infection, cellular immunity) during which transfusions are given may contribute to the risk&#xD;
      of immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research objective: Examine the association between clinical, environmental and genetic&#xD;
      characteristics of the recipient of erythrocyte transfusions and the risk against&#xD;
      immunization against erythrocyte alloantigens exposed to during that transfusion episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY Study Design and study population We will perform a retrospective matched case-&#xD;
      cohort study at hospitals nationwide from a period January 2005 to December 2011. Large red&#xD;
      blood cell using hospitals will be selected as study bases. The study cohort will comprise of&#xD;
      consecutive red blood cell transfused patients at the study center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases are defined as first time ever irregular red blood cell antibody formers, with no prior&#xD;
      history of red blood cell transfusions and alloimmunization before the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls will be all consecutive transfused patients who had received their first and&#xD;
      subsequent red blood transfusions at the study center with no prior history of red blood cell&#xD;
      transfusions and alloimmunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational studies, if well conducted, are equipped to examine interesting transfusion&#xD;
      research questions. With that in mind, we chose a case- cohort study design for our study.&#xD;
      With the help of such a design, we can compare the cases occurring in a red blood cell&#xD;
      transfused cohort with a randomly selected sample of the cohort. Using such an approach, for&#xD;
      any one given case, we will select 2 controls that have had at least the same number or more&#xD;
      transfusions than the case itself. This approach has following advantages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. This ensures that all the patients in the transfusion cohort with same or higher number&#xD;
           of transfusions have an equal chance of being picked as controls. In essence, any member&#xD;
           of the cohort who has been at a similar transfusion risk (of alloimmunization) at some&#xD;
           point in their transfusion history can be selected as a control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cases also have an equal chance of getting selected as controls for other cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study design minimizes the selection bias, if any. Such a study design allows us to&#xD;
      include a number of patients which is sufficient to detect smaller effects and to adjust for&#xD;
      other risk factors, as well as document potential risk factors extensively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Matching We will take in to account the number of transfusions a particular case received&#xD;
      uptil the antibody forming episode, and match the 2 cases (selected per control) on the same&#xD;
      number of transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To account for inter- hospital differences nationwide, we will also match the cases and&#xD;
      controls on the site/ study center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implicated Period To examine the immunomodulating clinical risk factors surrounding the&#xD;
      transfusions preceding the date of alloantibody formation, we will define a clinical risk&#xD;
      period or an implicated period of alloimmunization during which the case would have formed an&#xD;
      irregular red blood cell antibody. This period would be the time (in days) between the date&#xD;
      of a first ever positive screen for alloantibody to a calendar date 30 days before that&#xD;
      positive screen. We will also introduce a lag period of minimum 7 days between that first&#xD;
      ever positive screen and the last ever transfusion (implicating transfusion) before that&#xD;
      positive screen. (Figure 2) This is to ensure that a patient's immune system has adequate&#xD;
      time to respond to the transfusion exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will define a similar implicated period in the matched controls as well, retrospectively&#xD;
      from the &quot;implicating transfusion&quot; to 30 calendar days back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First time formed alloantibody Our endpoint for cases, or first time formed irregular red&#xD;
      blood cell antibodies is defined as clinically significant antibodies as screened by a three&#xD;
      cell serology panel at 37 degree Celsius. All patients were routinely screened for&#xD;
      alloantibodies, which is repeated at least every 72 hours, if further transfusions as&#xD;
      required. The antibodies are screened for by a three cell panel including an indirect&#xD;
      antiglobulin test (LISS Diamed ID gel system) and subsequently identifies by a standard 11&#xD;
      cell panels in the same gel system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data acquirement, measurements and handling Transfusion cohort data will be acquired from the&#xD;
      hospital blood transfusion services and on site patient records. Second we will use data from&#xD;
      a patient questionnaire. Thirdly, we will determine the patients' racial background from&#xD;
      blood of the included and consenting patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3.1 Patient Medical history and records Potential clinical risk factors include&#xD;
      haematological, oncological, surgical and medicinal data as well as auto- immune diseases and&#xD;
      related conditions at the time of the implicated (likely causal) transfusion. Factors and&#xD;
      conditions that will be actively scored are, infections (including the causal microorganisms)&#xD;
      and active / chronic allergies (including the if known antigens), fever, cytopenia(s),&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory response (a clinical response to a (non)-specific insult of either&#xD;
      infectious or noninfectious origin), peripheral blood progenitor cells transplantation&#xD;
      (autologous or allogenous), multi trauma, splenectomy, solid malignancies, autoimmune&#xD;
      disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1 etc.), chemotherapy,&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs, cytostatics and antibiotics will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire Participants will be asked to fill out a printed questionnaire. The&#xD;
      participants have also the option to fill in a web-based questionnaire, which will be&#xD;
      accessible via a link provided in the information letter. After identification of control&#xD;
      patients a similar mailing will be sent to these controls Environmental and life style&#xD;
      factors like vaccination status, previous pregnancies in case of females, level of education&#xD;
      and current professions (as a proxy for socio- economic status) will be obtained via the&#xD;
      patient information questionnaire. The questionnaire will add to the knowledge to these&#xD;
      possible confounders in cases and controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, many questions will involve &quot;life-time&quot; risk factors and information and are not&#xD;
      particularly targeted at the time of implicated episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Racial confounder Based on the knowledge that different ethnicities have varying frequencies&#xD;
      of erythrocyte antigens, a so- called mismatch between a donor from one particular ethnicity&#xD;
      and the recipient of another ethnicity does play a role in developing immune response to&#xD;
      donor erythrocytes. Therefore, we will also attempt to document racial mismatch leading to&#xD;
      red blood cell alloimmunization. This is attempted by one question in the questionnaire but&#xD;
      will foremost rely on the blood group typing which usually determines the ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood research and sampling To investigate the effect of genetic factors on the risk of the&#xD;
      development of alloantibodies, we will collect blood samples from all participants for&#xD;
      extensively typing the blood to get an antigen profile and to look at genetic markers which&#xD;
      influence immune system and vaccination efficiency. SNP's in candidate genes (e.g. coding for&#xD;
      HLA types) modulating specific and innate immune responses will be assessed. Biomarkers&#xD;
      typical for the activity of the immune response: cytokines and titres of antibodies against&#xD;
      common (vaccinated) antigens can later be determined in the plasma and serum that are stored&#xD;
      as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis We expect to include a total of 500 case patients and 1000 controls.&#xD;
      Logistic regression models will be used to assess the association between the risk to develop&#xD;
      antibodies and potential risk factors, adjusted for other risk factors and for the number of&#xD;
      exposures to the antigen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will examine the association between the risk factor and alloimmunization using logistic&#xD;
      regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also make a selection of all cases and controls on the most frequently found&#xD;
      antibodies and if the relative impact of risk factors and immune modulators on the risk of&#xD;
      all the antibody types( in separate analysis) is in the same direction, we will make a&#xD;
      generalized observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With 1500 patients, and the conventional 80% power and a p-value of 0.05, we will be able to&#xD;
      detect effects (odds ratio) of dichotomized risk factors of 1.35 or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional analysis will be performed along the lines of a &quot;case-crossover&quot; design within&#xD;
      the case patients. The &quot;Hazard Period&quot; (time period right before the detection of a positive&#xD;
      antibody) will be compared to a &quot;Control Component&quot; (a specified time period other than the&#xD;
      Hazard Period) in the case patient's medical history and the risk ratio for the transient&#xD;
      effect risk factors will be calculated.&#xD;
