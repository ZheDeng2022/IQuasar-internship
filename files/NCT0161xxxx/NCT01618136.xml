    <textblock>
      Overall Design: This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1/2 study which will be conducted in&#xD;
      three arms (as described below). Each arm will be conducted in two parts: a Phase 1 part&#xD;
      which will include dose escalation and a Phase 2 part which will include four cohorts in&#xD;
      specific disease indications. Phase 1 will also include a food effect study of E7449 as a&#xD;
      single agent. Once the MTD in the Phase 1 single agent arm and the Phase 1 combination arms&#xD;
      of this study has been achieved, the sponsor will submit the relevant safety information and&#xD;
      recommended Phase 2 dose to the IRB/Health Authorities. Arm 1: E7449 will be administered as&#xD;
      a single agent. Arm 2: E7449 will be administered in combination with TMZ. Arm 3: E7449 will&#xD;
      be administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel&#xD;
