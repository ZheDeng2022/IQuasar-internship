        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to provide informed consent and have signed an approved consent form that&#xD;
             conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Between 18 and 90 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been diagnosed with invasive adenocarcinoma, or high-grade ductal carcinoma&#xD;
             in-situ. If a core or open biopsy is done, it must demonstrate invasive&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma. If only a FNA is done, it must be positive and accompanied by a&#xD;
             positive clinical breast examination and ultrasound or mammography. The tumor must be&#xD;
             operable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically negative lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have had a bilateral mammogram within a year of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The interval between the initial cytologic or histologic diagnosis of breast cancer&#xD;
             and enrollment must be no more than 60 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in whom the diagnosis of breast cancer has been obtained utilizing fine&#xD;
             needle aspiration cytology or core needle biopsy are preferred. However, patients who&#xD;
             are diagnosed by open biopsy procedures are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior excisional biopsy or lumpectomy are eligible for entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior non-breast malignancies are eligible if they have been disease&#xD;
             free for 5 years before enrollment. Patients with squamous or basal cell carcinoma of&#xD;
             the skin that has been effectively treated, carcinoma in situ of the cervix that has&#xD;
             been treated by operation only, or LCIS of the ipsilateral or contralateral breast&#xD;
             treated by surgery only are eligible, even if these conditions were diagnosed within 5&#xD;
             years before enrollment onto this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ulceration, erythema, infiltration of the skin or underlying chest wall (complete&#xD;
             fixation), peau d'orange, or skin edema of any magnitude. (Tethering or dimpling of&#xD;
             the skin or nipple inversion should not be interpreted as skin infiltration. Patients&#xD;
             with these latter to conditions are eligible.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One or more ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes that are positive for tumor on clinical&#xD;
             examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilateral malignancy or a mass in the opposite breast that is suspicious for&#xD;
             malignancy, unless a biopsy proves that the mass is not malignant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous removal of any ipsilateral axillary lymph node.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diffuse tumors or multiple malignant tumors in different quadrants of the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suspicious palpable nodes in the contralateral axilla or palpable supraclavicular or&#xD;
             infraclavicular nodes. Patients with these conditions are considered ineligible unless&#xD;
             there is biopsy evidence that these are not involved with tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any prior breast malignancy other than LCIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment for this breast cancer including irradiation, chemotherapy,&#xD;
             immunotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy to radiocolloid or fluorescein.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to localize SLN drainage basins via lymphatic mapping. (e.g., no basin found&#xD;
             which emits gamma-radiation after injection with technetium -99)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Organic brain syndrome or significant impairment of basal cognitive function or any&#xD;
             psychiatric disorder that might preclude participation in the protocol, or be&#xD;
             exacerbated by therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Breast cancer related operative procedures not corresponding to criteria described in&#xD;
             the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary or secondary immune deficiencies or known significant autoimmune disease which&#xD;
             would pose a risk to the participant based on the physician's judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of organ transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in concurrent experimental protocols or alternative therapies that might&#xD;
             confound the analysis of this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nonmalignant systemic disease (e.g., cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, etc.) that&#xD;
             precludes a patient from being subjected to any of the treatment options or that would&#xD;
             prevent prolonged follow-up based on the physician's judgment.&#xD;
