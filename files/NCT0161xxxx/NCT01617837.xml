  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate if P6 acupressure can reduce postoperative&#xD;
      nausea after craniotomy. Calculation of sample size was based on the assumptions to detect at&#xD;
      difference of 20% between the patients (38% in the control group vs 18% in the acupressure&#xD;
      group) for the primary endpoint; incidence of nausea during the first 24 hours&#xD;
      postoperatively, with a significance level 5% and a power of 80%, guided by an earlier study&#xD;
      with a similar population (Wang et. al. 2010) and the assumption that 38% of our patients&#xD;
      suffer from nausea. These assumptions suggested a sample size of 78 patients (39 patients /&#xD;
      group) that resulted in a sample size of 80 patients for covering attrition. Secondary aims&#xD;
      are to investigate if the frequency of vomiting and the need for antiemetic can be reduced&#xD;
      with P6 acupressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomly assigned into one of two treatment groups using a computer-generated&#xD;
      random number table, either P6 acupressure group or placebo group. Randomization and sealing&#xD;
      of the study envelopes, containing all study material and following the patients all through&#xD;
      the study, are performed by persons from the research department, who is not involved in the&#xD;
      data collection. Information and study protocol are included in the envelope. The&#xD;
      randomization is taking place preoperatively. Sea-Band®, a single-sized elastic acupressure&#xD;
      band with a plastic button placed at P6 to apply pressure is used. One group will receive an&#xD;
      active acupressure band and the other an identical placebo band without any button. Before&#xD;
      entering the operation ward both wrists are marked at the place for P6, performed by staff at&#xD;
      the neurosurgical ward. The active acupressure bands and the placebo bands are administered&#xD;
      at the end of surgery. They are placed unilaterally at the wrist by the nurse anesthetist who&#xD;
      performs the patient's anesthesia. The manufacturer's guidelines of where and how to place&#xD;
      the band are included in the envelope with study material. Both the P6 acupressure bands and&#xD;
      the placebo bands are covered with a bandage to ensure blinding to the patients and the&#xD;
      nursing staff involved in the postoperative care. Both the P6 acupressure bands and the&#xD;
      placebo bands will be removed 48 hours postoperatively. If the bands cause discomfort, they&#xD;
      can be removed for 30 minutes every two hours, performed by staff not involved in the&#xD;
      postoperative care, with instructions to cover the wrist with a cotton roll while airing the&#xD;
      arm, this for ensuring further blinding if the acupressure has caused any betrayal marks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the surgery all patients receive ondansetron 4mg IV. Droperidol IV is&#xD;
      administered as additional perioperative antiemetic if considered necessary. Postoperatively&#xD;
      rescue antiemetics are administrated according to current routines. The administered drugs&#xD;
      are 0,625-1,25mg droperidol and 1-4mg ondansetron, either alone or in combination.&#xD;
      Postoperative opioid administration (morphine and ketobemidone) are also recorded during the&#xD;
      time of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before operation all patients are filling in a health declare formula as a routine in the&#xD;
      anesthetic preparation. This formula includes the four risk factors for PONV, according to&#xD;
      Apfel and colleagues (Apfel et al. 1999). To clarify earlier PONV there is a specific&#xD;
      question about this issue on the formula of written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During 48 hours postoperatively the patients are evaluating their nausea which is registered&#xD;
      on the same formula as the frequencies of vomiting. The first evaluation is taking part when&#xD;
      arriving to the postoperative care unit and then every hour for the first six hours, every&#xD;
      third hour until hour 24 and thereafter every sixth hour from hour 25-48. A Numerical Rating&#xD;
      Scale (NRS) from 0-10 is used, where 0 mean no nausea at all and 10 the worst nausea&#xD;
      possible. The patients are asked about whether they have experienced any nausea within the&#xD;
      previous period of time. Assessment of nausea and registration of the vomiting frequency are&#xD;
      performed by staff unaware of the patient's group in the postoperative care&#xD;
      unit/neurosurgical ward and by the patients themselves when possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge the data from the NRS formula are collected. The patients' journals are&#xD;
      screened for administrated antiemetic and opioids, for potential risk factors for PONV and&#xD;
      for other demographics relevant to the study outcome. All data are saved anonymously in the&#xD;
      software Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall PONV is defined as at least one episode of nausea or vomiting during the observation&#xD;
      time of 48 h. Rescue therapy is defined as at least one dosage of either droperidol or&#xD;
      ondansetron during the observation time of 48 h. Early PONV is defined as PONV occurring up&#xD;
      to 6 hours postoperatively and late PONV 7-48 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
