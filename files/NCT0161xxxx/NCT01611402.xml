      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Tuberculosis (TB) infection is particularly deadly when it happens in people who are also&#xD;
      infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, not much is known about how&#xD;
      these two infections affect each other. Some people who have HIV or TB infections develop&#xD;
      health problems after they start taking either HIV or TB medications or both. These drugs can&#xD;
      improve the body s ability to fight infections, but sometimes this sudden improvement can&#xD;
      make the infected person initially become sicker. Researchers want to study how these&#xD;
      infections affect the immune system and the gene expression of people who have TB and may or&#xD;
      may not have HIV, to see if there is a pattern of gene expression that may predict whether&#xD;
      people starting treatment may get sicker initially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the gene expression and immune systems of people with TB who may or may not also&#xD;
      have HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults at least 18 years of age who have tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be drawn from study sites in the United States and China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be divided into three study groups. The first group will have TB but&#xD;
           not HIV. The second group will have both TB and HIV that have not been treated. The&#xD;
           third group will have both TB and HIV that are currently being treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will have a single study visit. Blood samples will be collected at this&#xD;
           visit. A medical history will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the deadliest infections throughout the world, particularly&#xD;
      in the setting of HIV infection. In China, TB is a frequently diagnosed complication of HIV&#xD;
      infection. The immunopathogenesis of TB remains unclear, and although it is known that HIV&#xD;
      infection increases the risk of developing active TB, either through infection or&#xD;
      reactivation of latent disease, how it does so has yet to be determined. It is also known&#xD;
      that patients co-infected with HIV and TB and na(SqrRoot) ve to antiretroviral therapy (ART)&#xD;
      have a particularly high risk of developing Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome&#xD;
      (IRIS) after ART therapy is initiated, but the immunopathogenesis of this reaction is also&#xD;
      unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of genomics has significantly improved the understanding of disease pathogenesis and&#xD;
      is increasingly being used to predict responses to therapy as well. Recently, blood&#xD;
      transcriptional signatures capable of distinguishing active and latent TB infection have been&#xD;
      identified using highly parallelized analytical platforms capable of simultaneous survey of&#xD;
      transcription of known genes. These signatures have hinted at a complex role for type I&#xD;
      interferons in the development of active TB infection, but this has not yet been studied in&#xD;
      people with HIV and TB co-infection. Further in depth studies are needed to characterize the&#xD;
      spectrum of responses to TB/HIV co-infection, and how these responses correlate with clinical&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a cross-sectional cohort study, to be conducted in both the US and in China, to&#xD;
      identify blood mRNA expression profiles distinguishing TB mono-infected and TB/HIV&#xD;
      co-infected ART-na(SqrRoot) ve patients from treated patients with and without TB-IRIS.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives will include correlating gene expression levels with clinical outcomes&#xD;
      and soluble biomarkers. The study will comprise a test set (in China) of up to 140 patients&#xD;
      divided among the different cohorts and a validation set (in the US) of up to 125 patients&#xD;
      divided among the three groups Participation will involve a single study visit to consist of&#xD;
      small volume phlebotomy (approximately 25 mL for safety labs, transcriptome analysis,&#xD;
      lymphocyte counts, and serum and plasma storage) a urine sample and information gleaned from&#xD;
      the clinical record entered into a coded Case Report Form (CRF). The U.S. cohort will have an&#xD;
      additional 40 mLs of blood collected for mononuclear cells (total of approximately 65mLs).The&#xD;
      study will exclude women who are pregnant or breast-feeding (which can be associated with&#xD;
      immune compromise and changes in markers associated with inflammation), and persons with&#xD;
      anemia (who may be unable to tolerate phlebotomy solely for research purposes).&#xD;
