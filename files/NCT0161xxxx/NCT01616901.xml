    <textblock>
      The decision to extubate a patient after acute respiratory failure is based on clinical&#xD;
      observation and measurement of pulmonary mechanics. Current extubation criteria(tidal volume,&#xD;
      respiratory frequency...) lack of specificity. The best way to evaluate and predict patients&#xD;
      breathing abilities after extubation is to challenge him to a spontaneous breathing trial&#xD;
      (SBT) with endotracheal tube in place immediately before extubation to predict the patient's&#xD;
      ability to breathe spontaneously after extubation. The intention is to approximate, while the&#xD;
      patient is still intubated, the work of breathing that will be required of the patient after&#xD;
      extubation. Different approaches of ventilatory settings are currently used for the&#xD;
      preextubation SBT, whether pressure support ventilation (PSV), continuous positive airway&#xD;
      pressure (CPAP), or spontaneous ventilation through an endotracheal tube (T piece), all&#xD;
      supported by literature with different benefits. To the investigators knowledge, few studies&#xD;
      define which mode of ventilation most closely approximates the work of breathing during&#xD;
      spontaneous respiration after extubation, and none have studied a specific population of&#xD;
      obese patient in respiratory weaning. The main objective of the investigators study is to&#xD;
      determine, between five different SBT, which one is the best to approximate the work of&#xD;
      breathing of obese patient after extubation.&#xD;

      Patients : 20 obese patients (defined by BMI over 30 kg/m2) ongoing for spontaneous breathing&#xD;
      trial and clinically ready for immediate extubation will be enrolled after obtaining their&#xD;
      consents. Material : An oeso-gastric double balloon catheter will be inserted in order to&#xD;
      record oesophageal and gastric pressure and to calculate Work of Breathing and Pressure Time&#xD;
      Product. Pulmonary Volumes will be recorded by a pneumotachograph. Functional Residual&#xD;
      Capacity will be recorded thanks to the azote double dilution technique used by the Engstr√∂m&#xD;
      respiratory care station.Study Protocol : When physicians in charge of the patient decided&#xD;
      that the patient is ready to be weaned and to have a SBT before extubation, the patient will&#xD;
      be included in the study. Before extubation, patients will be placed under 5 different&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing trials conditions in the same order : 7 cm H2O continuous positive&#xD;
      airway pressure, T piece,7 cmH2O of pressure support, 0 cmH20 of pressure support and 7 cm&#xD;
      H2O pressure support ventilation with 7 cmH20 of end expiratory pressure. Each trial will be&#xD;
      performed fo 20 min. Between 2 spontaneous breathing trials, and before extubation, patient&#xD;
      will receive a 10 minutes period of recovery to their respiratory baseline, defined by the&#xD;
      respiratory settings before the spontaneous breathing trials.The last step, after extubation,&#xD;
      will consist in recording the data after 15 minutes, when patient's breathing pattern appears&#xD;
      calm.&#xD;
