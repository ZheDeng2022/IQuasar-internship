  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MOR-NRI like Tapentadol are expected to reduce signs and symptoms of central sensitisation&#xD;
      besides effectively reducing pain intensity in pain. Human pain surrogate models can serve in&#xD;
      this proof-of-concept study to further elucidate this assumption.&#xD;

      To evaluate exploratory the antihyperalgesic effect of a single dose of Palexia® IR&#xD;
      (Tapentadol) in two human experimental models of 1) cold and mechanical (pinprick)&#xD;
      hyperalgesia after topical application of menthol at high-concentration [40%] and 2) of heat&#xD;
      and mechanical (pinprick) hyperalgesia by topical applied capsaicin [0.6%] in comparison to&#xD;
      placebo. Therefore, cold, heat and mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia will be determined&#xD;
      by parameters of the Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST). These parameters are cold and heat&#xD;
      pain thresholds, mechanical pain threshold and sensitivity as well as dynamic mechanical&#xD;
      allodynia. Further, the areas of dynamic mechanical allodynia and pinprick-hyperalgesia will&#xD;
      be determined at each timepoint of QST-assessement.&#xD;
