  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research study aims to determine whether applying the University of Pittsburgh&#xD;
      Medical Center Nurse-Directed Diabetes Management Protocols (NDMPs) leads to improved&#xD;
      clinical outcome and process measures as recommended by American Diabetes Association (ADA),&#xD;
      quality of life, treatment satisfaction and medication adherence for adults with diabetes,&#xD;
      and favorable providers' satisfaction as compared to usual diabetes care. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of performing the NDMPs compared to usual diabetes care in primary care&#xD;
      settings will also be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proposed study is a multi-practice, cluster-design, prospective randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial with a total study intervention period of 12 months. This prospective randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial will assess the effectiveness of performing NDMPs by the registered nurse&#xD;
      supervised by a physician (the intervention group) in comparison with usual diabetes care&#xD;
      (the usual care group) for adults with diabetes in primary care settings. The study&#xD;
      population will be recruited from University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Community Medicine&#xD;
      Inc. (CMI) primary care practices in urban and suburban communities surrounding Pittsburgh,&#xD;
      PA. Among these CMI practices, ten practices receive diabetes education services from&#xD;
      University of Pittsburgh Diabetes Institute and will be the intervention group. These&#xD;
      diabetes education services will be enhanced by the addition of NDMPs intervention. In&#xD;
      addition, we will select another 10 CMI practices to be the usual care group. This group&#xD;
      receives standard diabetes education with no use of NDMPs. One-hundred and fifty participants&#xD;
      will be recruited across practices within each study group (i.e., 300 in total). Outcomes&#xD;
      assessed in this study include clinical outcome and process measures as recommended by ADA,&#xD;
      participants' quality of life, treatment satisfaction, and medication adherence, and&#xD;
      providers' satisfaction, and costs/expenditure. Assessments will be done at baseline, and&#xD;
      three and 12 months after the study entry. Analysis of the study outcomes will be based on&#xD;
      intention-to-treat to determine (1) within-group differences between the baseline and&#xD;
      follow-up visits, and (2) between-group differences between the intervention group and the&#xD;
      usual care group.&#xD;
