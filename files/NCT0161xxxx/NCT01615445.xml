  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous animal studies have found that resveratrol supplementation significantly increased&#xD;
      aerobic capacity. The investigators conducted a randomized placebo-controlled cross-over&#xD;
      study to assess whether resveratrol could provide similar benefits in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants were assigned to two 4-week treatment periods, with a 2 week washout&#xD;
      in-between. During one period, volunteers in received resveratrol and during the other&#xD;
      period, they received identical-appearing placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of interest was change in exercise capacity, as measured by change in&#xD;
      exercise duration on constant load exercise testing and change in aerobic capacity (peak VO2)&#xD;
      on incremental exercise testing. Secondary outcomes were tolerability and side-effects&#xD;
      associated with resveratrol.&#xD;
