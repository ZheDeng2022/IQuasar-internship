    <textblock>
      This is an open Label, randomized, two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence, crossover,&#xD;
      balanced, single dose pivotal study. The purpose of this study is to assess the&#xD;
      bioequivalence between Test Product and the corresponding Reference Product under fed&#xD;
      condition in healthy adult human subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective of this pivotal study was to assess the bioequivalence between Test Product:&#xD;
      Lamotrigine Tablets 25 mg (2 x 25 mg)of M/s Ipca Laboratories Limited, India and the&#xD;
      corresponding Reference Product: LAMICTAL® (Lamotrigine) Tablets 25 mg (2 x 25 mg) of&#xD;
      GlaxoSmithkline, USA, under fed condition in healthy adult human subjects in a randomized&#xD;
      crossover study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted with 28 healthy adult subjects. In each study period, a single 2 X 25&#xD;
      mg dose of either test or reference was administered to the subjects as per the randomization&#xD;
      schedule in each study period with about 240 mL of water at ambient temperature in sitting&#xD;
      position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the clinical phase was approximately 26 days including washout period of at&#xD;
      least 21 days between administrations of study drug in each study period.&#xD;
