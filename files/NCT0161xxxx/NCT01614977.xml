  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nontuberculous mycobacteriae (NTM) are a group of bacteria that typically cause infections of&#xD;
      lymph nodes in the neck and face of otherwise healthy children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently 3 strategies to manage these infections. Yet, all are not &quot;ideal&quot; and&#xD;
      each has downsides.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Surgery: removal of the affected lymph nodes is the most common approach but has the&#xD;
           disadvantages of potential facial nerve paralysis, the possibility of recurrent&#xD;
           infection that would require another operation and resolution with a cosmetically&#xD;
           disturbing scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Antibiotics: The antibiotic courses are prolonged and are associated frequently with&#xD;
           adverse reactions. It is unclear if this treatment has a significant effect on the&#xD;
           &quot;natural&quot; resolution process of the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Observation: follow-up the healing process without intervention. However the resolution&#xD;
           may last a long period of time even more than a year. In almost all cases there will be&#xD;
           spontaneous discharge of pus from the involved lymph nodes onto the skin that may last a&#xD;
           few days. Later on a scar will form that may also be disturbing cosmetically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inflammatory response of the body to infections may occasionally be severe. As a matter&#xD;
      of fact its harmful consequences can be sometimes more serious than those of the bacteria&#xD;
      that cause the infection. Prednisone and other anti inflammatory drugs have properties that&#xD;
      could possibly prevent this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is medical experience in using prednisone and similar drugs in addition to antibiotics&#xD;
      in infectious diseases to decrease the inflammatory response against the infection. One of&#xD;
      these infections is tuberculosis. The tuberculous bacteria have some common features with the&#xD;
      nontuberculous mycobacteria. The investigators believe that the inflammatory process in&#xD;
      infected lymph nodes with nontuberculous mycobacteria is the major cause for the discharge&#xD;
      from the skin which later leads to the formation of a scar and to the prolonged resolution&#xD;
      from the infection. Thus in order to hasten the resolution and to avoid formation of a neck&#xD;
      or facial scar with its cosmetic consequences we suggest the use of prednisone in treating&#xD;
      nontuberculus mycobacteria lymph nodes infections. Since prednisone depresses the&#xD;
      inflammatory process as well as the immunity response, we chose to study the effect of&#xD;
      prednisone combined with antibiotics (as the later will help to overcome the bacteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether the addition of prednisone to antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment of nontuberculous mycobacteria lymph nodes infections in the neck and face of&#xD;
      children can hasten the resolution process and improve its cosmetic results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of nontuberculous mycobacteria lymph node infection will be based on evidence&#xD;
      of bacterial growth in culture or on the presence of DNA of the bacteria in pus obtained from&#xD;
      the involved lymph nodes by fine needle aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally healthy children with evidence of infection will be offered to participate in the&#xD;
      study. They will be randomly assigned into the following 2 groups for 8 weeks treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Antibiotics (2 types) and prednisone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Antibiotics (2 types) and placebo (a material that tastes and look like prednisone but&#xD;
           does not have any medical effect).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prednisone will be given in a dose that will decrease into half twice: after 2 and after four&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits for monitoring the inflammatory process and its resolution as well as&#xD;
      adverse reactions will be done around 2 weeks, 4 weeks 3 months and 6-8 months after&#xD;
      beginning therapy,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests and chest X-rays will be taken prior to the beginning of treatment. Blood tests&#xD;
      will be also taken at the first follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A photo of the face neck and the site of the involved lymph nodes will be taken before&#xD;
      starting therapy and at each of the follow-up visit.&#xD;

      The objective of the study is to compare the effect of antimyocbacterial therapy alone or&#xD;
      combined with corticosteroids for the treatment of NTM lymphadenitis in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted over a 3-year period in the Day Hospitalization Unit and ward C&#xD;
      of the Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel using a double- blind placebo-controlled&#xD;
      design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty children aged 3 months to 20 years treated for laboratory-proven subacute/chronic NTM&#xD;
      lymphadenitis at the Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with any of the following findings will be excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  congenital or acquired immunodeficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  chronic disease, such as diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, chronic liver&#xD;
           disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or chronic arthritis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  immunosuppressive drug use (except inhaled steroids)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  elevated hepatocellular enzyme levels (more than twice the upper limit of normal) ---&#xD;
           clinical suspicion of tuberculosis or a first-degree relative with tuberculosis.&#xD;
