      This study will evaluate Panda, a smartphone-based pain assessment tool. During a child's&#xD;
      recovery from surgery, a Post-Anesthetic Care Unit nurse will assess their pain, which helps&#xD;
      determine what medication they need. Traditionally, this involves asking the child to rate&#xD;
      their pain on a scale from 1 to 10, by moving a slider along a coloured scale or pointing to&#xD;
      one of a series of faces on a piece of card. The Panda uses the same methods, but presents&#xD;
      them on a smartphone screen. Our evaluation will ensure that the Panda gives the same pain&#xD;
      scores as the traditional methods.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to ensure that Panda, a smartphone-based pain assessment tool,&#xD;
      can be used effectively by children after surgery and that the pain scores it obtains agree&#xD;
      with the scores obtained using traditional methods of pain assessment. In particular the aim&#xD;
      is to show agreement (a) between pain scores obtained using Panda and pain scores obtained&#xD;
      using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised for 4-12 year olds and (b) between pain scores obtained&#xD;
      using Panda and pain scores obtained using the Coloured Analogue Scale (CAS) for 5-18 year&#xD;
      olds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit children between 4 and 18 years old, in general good health, who are&#xD;
      scheduled for surgery. We will exclude any child who has a psychiatric diagnosis,&#xD;
      developmental delay or brain injury, significant visual impairment or psychomotor&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is taking place in the Post-anesthetic Care Unit (PACU) at BC Children's Hospital.&#xD;
      We will recruit 200 children in total. The study procedures include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 - pre-clinical usability study: we will conduct a series of participatory design&#xD;
      sessions with nurses in the PACU and with 20 children in the Surgical Day Care Unit (SDCU)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 - clinical validation study: children will be asked to rate their pain using both the&#xD;
      Panda and a traditional tool (which is used first will be decided randomly); during this&#xD;
      stage, children will also be asked their opinion (e.g. which tool they preferred using and&#xD;
      about any problems they experienced using either tool).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All scores will be recorded on the Panda device and extracted at the end of each day. No pain&#xD;
      medication will be administered on the basis of a pain score obtained using the Panda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panda will be compared with the traditional method (FPS-R and CAS) within 3 different age&#xD;
      groups (4-8, 8-12 and 12-18), using the following criteria: practicality, based on failure&#xD;
      rates in obtaining pain scores from Panda compared with traditional method; preference for&#xD;
      Panda compared with traditional method; agreement between the Panda score and the traditional&#xD;
      score.&#xD;
