      In this study, the investigators will perform a retrospective chart analysis of patients that&#xD;
      underwent a bony debridement or amputation in the operating room at Georgetown University&#xD;
      Hospital during 2009-2010 under Drs. Steinberg and Attinger. Chart reviews, medical records&#xD;
      and operative reports via EMR and paper charts will be examined from inpatient records, the&#xD;
      Center for Wound Healing, the Emergency Department as well as other institutions involved in&#xD;
      the care of the subjects to gather data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteomyelitis is present in approximately 20% of cases of foot infection in persons with&#xD;
      diabetes [1, 2] and greatly increases the likelihood that the patient will require a&#xD;
      lower-extremity amputation [3, 4]. Early diagnosis and treatment drastically improves&#xD;
      prognosis. While there are multiple modalities through which osteomyelitis is diagnosed,&#xD;
      unfortunately there is no definitive method. Bone biopsy with histopathological and&#xD;
      microbiological analysis has been deemed the gold standard for diagnosing osteomyelitis [3,&#xD;
      5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteomyelitis is considered proven if one or more pathogens are cultured from a reliably&#xD;
      obtained bone specimen that shows bone death, acute or chronic inflammation and reparative&#xD;
      responses on histological examination. However, histological analysis can also produce&#xD;
      falsely positive results based on sampling error or if there are other causes of inflammation&#xD;
      [6]. Furthermore, a recent study done by Meyr et al. has highlighted a discrepancy amongst&#xD;
      pathologists that leaves the medical community questioning the validity of some pathological&#xD;
      diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological analysis can differ based on specimen processing and is also dependent on&#xD;
      sampling technique. Often results can be falsely negative because of sampling error, prior&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy, or inability to culture fastidious organisms; likewise, they may be&#xD;
      falsely positive because of contamination by wound-colonizing flora [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, cultures of superficial swab samples from diabetic ulcers and sinus tracts may not&#xD;
      adequately identify the true bacteriological characteristics of diabetic foot osteomyelitis&#xD;
      because of bacterial colonization of the wound surfaces with microorganisms that are&#xD;
      typically not considered to be pathogenic (such as enterococci and coagulase-negative&#xD;
      staphylococci) [7]. Senneville et al. attempted to define the true correlation between&#xD;
      cultures of swab samples and cultures of bone biopsy specimens obtained from areas of&#xD;
      osteomyelitis in the diabetic foot. It was found that swab cultures are inaccurate and&#xD;
      unreliable indicators of the pathogenic organism in chronic diabetic foot osteomyelitis and&#xD;
      there was overall poor concordance between the superficial swab culture and bone biopsy&#xD;
      culture results for all microorganisms [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other methods for diagnosing osteomyelitis include radiographic analysis. On plain film,&#xD;
      osteomyelitis is suspected when one or more of the following radiographic signs is observed:&#xD;
      periosteal elevation, cortical disruption, medullary involvement, osteolysis, and sequestra&#xD;
      (segments of necrotic bone separated from living bone by granulation tissue) [9]. Signs of&#xD;
      osteomyelitis only show up on plain film 10-20 days after infection, [10, 11]. Dinh et al, in&#xD;
      their meta-analysis on radiographic modalities, found 54% sensitivity and 68% specificity in&#xD;
      detecting osteomyelitis with plain film versus 90% sensitivity and 79% specificity with MRI&#xD;
      [12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigators' knowledge, there has been no study that compares all these methods to&#xD;
      determine if there is a superior test to determine osteomyelitis.&#xD;
