  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a result of the underlying disease or its therapy, it is common for patients with blood&#xD;
      cancers to have low platelet counts. While platelet transfusions may be beneficial in&#xD;
      preventing or treating bleeding symptoms, in circumstances where the risk of bleeding is low&#xD;
      they may be unnecessary or even harmful. As a blood product, transfusion of platelets may be&#xD;
      associated with infectious or allergic complications, and frequent hospital visits for&#xD;
      transfusion may adversely affect quality of life. Additionally, the potentially overuse of&#xD;
      platelet products places a burden on health care resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit of the current practice of prophylactic platelet transfusions to prevent&#xD;
      hemorrhage is unknown. The randomized data that exists is more than 25 years old and not&#xD;
      informative given methodological limitations and the changing standards of supportive care.&#xD;
      An alternative, therapeutic, strategy involves only administering platelets to control active&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard of practice in inpatients receiving high dose chemotherapy (either for acute&#xD;
      leukemia or as part of stem cell transplantation) is prophylactic platelet transfusions. In&#xD;
      outpatients not receiving high dose chemotherapy, the risk of bleeding is significantly&#xD;
      lower. No randomized trials have examined the optimal platelet transfusion strategy in&#xD;
      outpatients with blood cancers undergoing supportive or palliative therapy. Thus the&#xD;
      potential benefit of prophylactic transfusions in the outpatient setting is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to perform a pilot randomized controlled trial to determine if a&#xD;
      larger trial is possible. The ultimate goal is to determine if a strategy of therapeutic&#xD;
      platelet transfusions is safe and effective in outpatients with blood cancers and low&#xD;
      platelet counts.&#xD;

      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A local study nurse will use a web-based randomization system (permuted random blocks of two&#xD;
      or four patients) to allocate consenting patients. Medical and research staff and&#xD;
      investigators will be blinded to randomization scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration and Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be assigned to either a therapeutic or prophylactic platelet transfusion&#xD;
      for a 6-month period. This period of time will allow us to assess our primary feasibility&#xD;
      outcomes of enrollment, compliance with transfusion protocols, and completion of bleeding&#xD;
      evaluations and quality of life questionnaires by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups will have their CBC measured at least weekly while on study. More&#xD;
      frequent monitoring of the platelet count may be performed at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      physician. The research team will clinically assess patients within 1 week (+/- 3 days) of&#xD;
      randomization, and monthly thereafter. Patients will be asked to report any non-cutaneous&#xD;
      grade 2 or greater bleeding immediately to their treating physicians and the study team. All&#xD;
      the self-assessments of bleeding will be reviewed at each patient visit to ensure that all&#xD;
      clinically relevant bleeding episodes have been captured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients whose platelet count recovers to greater than 20 x 109/L for at least six weeks will&#xD;
      be taken off the weekly platelet count monitoring as reflects clinical practice. They will&#xD;
      continue to be monitored for the duration of the study. If their platelet count falls to 10 x&#xD;
      109/L or below then they will be restarted on the monitoring and previous transfusion&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Data - The following clinical and laboratory data will be collected at the time of&#xD;
      enrolment: (1) demographic data, (2) diagnosis including date and disease stage, (3) prior&#xD;
      chemotherapy, (4) ECOG performance status, (5) comorbidites, (6) previous platelet and red&#xD;
      cell transfusions, (7) red cell transfusion history, (8) prior bleeding events, (9) quality&#xD;
      of life (EQ5D) (10) routine bloodwork&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transfusions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All platelet and red cell transfusions will be recorded including date and number of units.&#xD;
      For platelet transfusions, the type of platelet product (e.g. apheresis or buffy coat) and&#xD;
      ABO compatibility will recorded. Additionally, the indication for all transfusions&#xD;
      (prophylactic or to treat bleeding) will be obtained from the attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleeding Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete a simple bleeding questionnaire on a daily basis which&#xD;
      has been previously tested and used in outpatients with thrombocytopenia. Patients will&#xD;
      receive a short training session and written material on how to complete the form. A bleeding&#xD;
      assessment will be performed at all study follow-up visits (interview, physical exam and&#xD;
      review of daily bleeding forms). Bleeding events will be assigned a bleeding grade by the&#xD;
      study personnel. A final bleeding grade will be assigned by an adjudication panel of 2&#xD;
      blinded physicians who will independently assign bleeding scores. Any discrepancies in&#xD;
      bleeding scores will be resolved by consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life will be measured using the EQ-5D. The EQ-5D is a validated tool for&#xD;
      measurement of health-related quality of life there is a precedent for its use in transfusion&#xD;
      medicine trials. Quality of life assessments will be performed at baseline and at all&#xD;
      subsequent patient visits.&#xD;
