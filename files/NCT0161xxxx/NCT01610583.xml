      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health literacy means being able to understand basic health care information. This&#xD;
           information can include drug labels and prescription instructions. It can also include&#xD;
           doctor s instructions. Better health literacy can help improve a person s health&#xD;
           outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Many minorities have low health literacy. Latinos in particular have both low health&#xD;
           literacy and poor health outcomes. Language barriers such as poor reading skills can&#xD;
           contribute to problems with health literacy. Researchers want to develop a new health&#xD;
           literacy measuring tool. This tool will focus on genetic literacy, which involves&#xD;
           understanding personal risk of health problems. The tool will be written in Spanish. The&#xD;
           study will work with Spanish-speaking Latinos to develop and test this genetic literacy&#xD;
           tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To develop a Spanish-language tool to study genetic literacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Spanish-speaking Latino adults between 18 and 75 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a brief interview. No personal samples will be&#xD;
           needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete the genetic literacy questionnaire. It will be given in&#xD;
           Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The tool will ask about participants personal and family health history. It will also&#xD;
           ask about their understanding of genetic terms and genetic testing. Other personal&#xD;
           information, such as level of education, will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive a gift card for completing the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment or genetic counseling will be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

      The proposed study seeks to better understand genetic literacy in the U.S. Latino&#xD;
&#xD;
      population by developing and validating a Spanish-language measure of genetic literacy and&#xD;
&#xD;
      subsequently exploring the relationships between genetic literacy, personal characteristics,&#xD;
&#xD;
      exposure to genetics, acculturation, and self-efficacy to discuss family health history&#xD;
&#xD;
      information. This study is primarily informed by research in health literacy, which is&#xD;
      defined as&#xD;
&#xD;
      an individual s ability to understand and use health information to make informed decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Past research has modeled the effects of demographic factors, prior experience, and prior&#xD;
&#xD;
      knowledge on health literacy, and in turn to health behaviors and outcomes. These same&#xD;
&#xD;
      domains apply when considering the concept and operationalization of genetic literacy: an&#xD;
&#xD;
      individual s ability to understand and use genetics-related information to make informed&#xD;
&#xD;
      decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous studies have reported the wide prevalence of disparities among minorities in various&#xD;
      areas of healthcare, including use of genetics services, and many of these inequalities have&#xD;
      been related to low health literacy. Latinos represent one group in particular that has been&#xD;
      shown to have both low health literacy and some of the poorest health outcomes. A few studies&#xD;
      have explored the public s knowledge of genetics, and differences in level of understanding&#xD;
      were found amongst minority groups. Given the increasing importance of genetics in healthcare&#xD;
      and the rapidly growing population of Latinos in the U.S., it is of particular importance to&#xD;
      assess this population s genetic literacy. The first aim of this study is to develop a&#xD;
      Spanish-language genetic literacy measure and validate it against an existing&#xD;
      Spanish-language health literacy measure. Then this study will examine the relationship of&#xD;
      genetic literacy in the Latino population to certain demographic characteristics, previous&#xD;
      exposure to genetics, acculturation, and participants self-efficacy to discuss health history&#xD;
      information with family members and providers. Study participants will be recruited through&#xD;
      convenience sampling in three different areas of Maryland with a high percentage of Latinos.&#xD;
      This study will contribute to the limited body of knowledge about genetic literacy in the&#xD;
      Latino population, and expand understanding of how genetic literacy influences individuals&#xD;
      genetics-related self-efficacy.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants eligible for this study will include all Spanish-speaking Latino males&#xD;
             and females between 18 and 75 years of age (self-reported) recruited in the Baltimore,&#xD;
             MD,&#xD;
&#xD;
        Montgomery County, MD, or Prince George s County, MD areas. Individuals do not have to be&#xD;
        Maryland residents, as recruitment for this study will be conducted through convenience&#xD;
        sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Participants must self-report Spanish as their primary language and therefore have limited&#xD;
        English fluency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals over the age of 75 will be excluded because there is a possibility of&#xD;
             confounding between literacy and cognitive decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals under the age of 18 will be excluded because they are likely to have&#xD;
             different genetic literacy levels than their adult counterparts due to different&#xD;
             levels of exposure to genetics in school curriculums.&#xD;
