  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm open label phase II trial to evaluate the oral daily use of BKM 120 in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent unresectable or metastatic cervical cancer after palliative cisplatin&#xD;
      based regimen failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete treatment cycle is defined as a 28 days period.&#xD;

      Inclusion and exclusion criteria should be assessed in the pretreatment visit and the&#xD;
      informed consent must be taken before treatment assignment. The diagnosis and extent of&#xD;
      disease, the medical history, and the current medical condition should be recorded by the&#xD;
      investigator in a pretreatment visit. Adverse events will be recorded including type,&#xD;
      severity, graded by CTCAE V 3.0, seriousness and potential relation to the investigational&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy assessment will be done by MRI and recorded in the patients' clinical chart.&#xD;
      Tumor dimension assessments will be performed at baseline through abdominal/pelvic magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging, to be repeated in 3 months intervals and evaluated according RECIST&#xD;
      criteria. The first cohort, composed by the 06 first patients, will undergo a separate&#xD;
      positron-emission tomography (PET-CT) evaluation at baseline and 90 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory tests (hematology, blood chemistry), ECG and physical examination will be done on&#xD;
      every visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug pharmacokinetics will not be assessed in this study. For the screening Baseline periods,&#xD;
      see chart attached The treatment will be continued until progressive disease or intolerable&#xD;
      toxicity&#xD;
