  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of temsirolimus (Torisel) combined with dexamethasone,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide and etoposide in patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL),&#xD;
      lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) or peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTL).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that mTOR inhibitors (MTI) inhibit growth of pre-B and T-cell ALL cell&#xD;
      lines in vitro and in ALL xenograft models. The MTI temsirolimus was chosen for use in this&#xD;
      study due to its weekly intravenous dosing, its more predictable blood levels, and&#xD;
      availability of a single-agent pediatric MTD and its sustained biologic effect due to&#xD;
      conversion to sirolimus. This study will determine the maximum tolerated dose of temsirolimus&#xD;
      that can given in combination with dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide and etoposide in relapsed&#xD;
      ALL, LL or PTL. A standard 3-patient cohort dose-escalation design will be used. Response to&#xD;
      treatment will be evaluated. Biology tests will be done to evaluate minimal residual disease&#xD;
      (MRD), temsirolimus' effect on glucocorticoid resistance, and mTOR inhibition.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study follows a standard 3+3 patient cohort escalation design, as described below:&#xD;
Three patients are entered at the first dose level&#xD;
If 0/3 experiences DLT at a given dose level, then the dose is escalated to the next higher level, if a higher dose level exists, and three patients are enrolled. If a higher dose level does not exists, up to three more patients are accrued at the same dose level.&#xD;
If 1/3 experiences DLT at current dose, then up to three more patients are accrued at the same dose level.&#xD;
If 2 or more DLTs are observed in a three-patient or six-patient cohort at a given dose level, then the MTD has been exceeded, dose escalation will be stopped, and up to three additional patients will be enrolled at the next lower dose level, if a lower dose level exists (unless six patients have already been treated at that prior dose).</intervention_model_description>

          -  Anticoagulants: Patients who are currently receiving therapeutic anticoagulants&#xD;
             (including aspirin, low molecular weight heparin, and others) are not eligible. At&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors: Patients who are currently receiving&#xD;
             ACE inhibitors are not eligible due to the development of angioneurotic edema-type&#xD;
             reactions in some subjects who received concurrent treatment with temsirolimus + ACE&#xD;
             inhibitors. At least 3 half-lives must have elapsed after the last dose of ACE&#xD;
             inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Calcium Channel Blockers: Patients who are currently receiving Calcium Channel&#xD;
             Blockers are not eligible due to the development of angioneurotic edema-type reactions&#xD;
             in some subjects who received concurrent treatment with temsirolimus + Calcium Channel&#xD;
             Blockers. At least 3 half-lives must have elapsed after the last dose of Calcium&#xD;
             Channel Blockers.&#xD;

             Stabilizing on a non-hepatic inducing metabolizing anti-convulsant (ie: gabapentin or&#xD;
             levetiracetam) prior to study entry is acceptable. At least 3 half-lives must have&#xD;
             elapsed after the last dose of enzyme inducing anti-coagulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving treatment with azoles such as fluconazole or voriconazole which are&#xD;
             potent inhibitors of temsirolimus metabolism. At least 3 half-lives must have elapsed&#xD;
             after the last dose of azoles.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with Burkiett's leukemia and /or lymphoma are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Infection Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are excluded if they have:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive blood culture within 48 hours of study enrollment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fever above 38.2 within 48 hours of study enrollment with clinical signs of infection.&#xD;
             Fever that is determined to be due to tumor burden is allowed if patients have&#xD;
             documented negative blood cultures for at least 48 hours prior to enrollment and no&#xD;
             concurrent signs or symptoms of active infection or hemodynamic instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive fungal culture within 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active fungal, viral, bacterial, or protozoal infection requiring IV treatment.&#xD;
             Chronic prophylaxis therapy to prevent infections is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with Down syndrome and Fanconi Anemia are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded if they have significant concurrent disease, illness, psychiatric&#xD;
        disorder or social issue that would compromise patient safety or compliance with protocol&#xD;
        treatment or required observations, interfere with consent, study participation, follow up,&#xD;
        or interpretation of study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with known optic nerve and/or retinal involvement (because it may not be possible&#xD;
        to safely delay irradiation) are not eligible. Patients presenting with visual disturbances&#xD;
        by history or physical exam should have an ophthalmological exam and, if indicated, an MRI&#xD;
        to determine optic nerve or retinal involvement.&#xD;
