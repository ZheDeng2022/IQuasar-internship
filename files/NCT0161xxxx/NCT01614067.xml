    <textblock>
      In couples with infertility secondary to Diminished Ovarian Reserve, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that a delayed start (7 day) to ovarian stimulation with an GnRH antagonist&#xD;
      (Ganirelix) will improve oocyte maturation and quality, and improve pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past two decades, the success rate of assisted reproductive technology (ART) has&#xD;
      dramatically increased. This increase is attributed to improvements in embryo culture,&#xD;
      laboratory conditions, and optimization of ovarian stimulation protocols. Over the past&#xD;
      years, there has been more interest in altering the ovarian stimulation protocol to improve&#xD;
      outcomes. For example, recently our group found that a modification of ovulation trigger&#xD;
      toward a more physiologic process improves oocyte quality and pregnancy outcomes. Others have&#xD;
      suggested minimal stimulation improves in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to further investigate modifying the ovarian stimulation for women who&#xD;
      have &quot;decreased&quot; ovarian reserve. The investigators propose that a delayed start to ovarian&#xD;
      stimulation will improve oocyte maturation and quality and pregnancy outcomes. No published&#xD;
      studies to date have evaluated if a delayed start to ovarian stimulation improves pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes. However, the investigators hypothesize that the use an antagonist for a delayed&#xD;
      start of stimulation will work by one of two mechanisms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. The partial suppression of FSH will allow for further recruitment of early antral&#xD;
      follicles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. The partial suppression of FSH will allow for further FSH responsiveness in existing&#xD;
      follicles to synchronize the primary cohort, thereby increasing the total number of&#xD;
      follicles.&#xD;
