      This study is for patients undergoing In Vitro Fertilization (IVF). The investigators are&#xD;
      studying the best way to control pain during the egg retrieval process. The egg retrieval&#xD;
      involves passing a needle under ultrasound guidance through the vagina into the ovaries to&#xD;
      remove eggs that are to be later fertilized. Patients often report this as very&#xD;
      uncomfortable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different fertility clinics across the country use different methods of pain control. All&#xD;
      clinics will use intravenous medication to control pain, while some may or may not use local&#xD;
      anaesthetic (freezing) in the vagina. Our goal is to find the best way to control pain. Since&#xD;
      local anaesthetic injection involves multiple needle punctures and may be painful, the&#xD;
      investigators are unsure if local anaesthetic is necessary in addition to the intravenous&#xD;
      pain medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a randomized trial where all patients will receive intravenous&#xD;
      pain medication, but some will receive local anaesthetic injection and some will receive&#xD;
      placebo injection. Patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire on their pain&#xD;
      experience after oocyte retrieval. The investigators will then analyze the data and determine&#xD;
      whether local anaesthetic actually improves pain when patients are already receiving&#xD;
      intravenous pain medications. Through our study, the investigators aim to improve the pain&#xD;
      experience of all women undergoing IVF in the future.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A UK telephone survey (Bokhari, 1999) showed that during TUGOR, 48% of UK fertility centers&#xD;
      were using conscious sedation, 29% general anaesthesia, 12% conscious sedation with regional&#xD;
      anaesthesia (neuraxial block or PCB), and 2% regional anaesthesia alone. A review article&#xD;
      (Blahos 2009) details the many different types of anaesthesia used during TUGOR. These may&#xD;
      include combinations of the following: general anaesthesia, regional anaesthesia, local&#xD;
      anaesthesia, conscious sedation, and alternative methods of anaesthesia (electro-acupuncture,&#xD;
      patient controlled sedation). No recent studies were found detailing the frequency of each of&#xD;
      the various anaesthetic options in use at fertility centers across North American.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, randomized, double-blind and placebo controlled study (Ng, 1999) showed that&#xD;
      paracervical block combined with conscious sedation was superior to conscious sedation alone.&#xD;
      This study used a combination of drugs (mepiridine and diazepam) not used at our center. The&#xD;
      use of fentanyl and midazolam was first described by Harrison in 1992 for conscious sedation.&#xD;
      In 2001 Sephton et al published a cross over audit of patient preferences comparing&#xD;
      mepiridine, diazepam and promethazine to fentanyl and midazolam, showing superiority of&#xD;
      fentanyl and midazolam. Midazolam has sedative and amnestic properties, whereas diazepam has&#xD;
      no amnestic properties. The amnestic properties of midazolam make it a superior medication&#xD;
      for overall patient experience during TUGOR, as they are less likely to recall potentially&#xD;
      painful parts of their procedure. Midazolam has also been shown to act synergistically with&#xD;
      fentanyl, thereby decreasing not only the actual pain recalled, but the actual pain&#xD;
      experienced by patients. Since the only randomized control trial demonstrating the benefits&#xD;
      of paracervical block was performed using mepiridine and diazepam, we intend to repeat the&#xD;
      study using the superior combination of fentanyl and midazolam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oocyte retrieval may be the most painful part of fertility treatment. Our goal is to&#xD;
      minimize patient discomfort and improve overall patient experience during fertility&#xD;
      treatments. We do not know if PCB improves pain scores in the era of wider use of fentanyl&#xD;
      and midazolam for sedation. Fertility centres may be subjecting their patients to a painful&#xD;
      PCB injection without proven benefit. This study aims to assess whether a PCB in addition to&#xD;
      conscious sedation can be abandoned without impacting the patient's overall pain experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to compare whether conscious sedation alone is as effective as paracervical&#xD;
      block plus conscious sedation in controlling pain during oocyte retrieval&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is conscious sedation alone as effective as paracervical block plus conscious sedation in&#xD;
      controlling pain during oocyte retrieval?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of the Trial Design This study is designed to be a placebo-controlled, randomised,&#xD;
      double blind trial to compare whether conscious sedation with a normal saline paracervical&#xD;
      block (placebo) is as effective as conscious sedation with a lidocaine paracervical block in&#xD;
      controlling pain during oocyte retrieval. A total of 300 women will randomly be assigned in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio, after consenting to study participation. Short-Form McGill Pain scores will be&#xD;
      assessed in study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women presenting for oocyte retrieval after a cycle of IVF stimulation at the University of&#xD;
      Alberta Regional Fertility Centre&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women consenting to participate in the study will be randomly allocated to one of two groups.&#xD;
      The control group will receive conscious sedation with a placebo (normal saline) paracervical&#xD;
      block (PCB). The study group will receive conscious sedation with a local anaesthetic&#xD;
      (lidocaine 1%) PCB. Computer generated randomisation will be used to determine group&#xD;
      allocation. Group allocation will be concealed using opaque envelopes to ensure blinding. An&#xD;
      OR nurse will prepare the PCB syringe with either lidocaine or normal saline depending on the&#xD;
      patient's allocation. The contents of the PCB will remain blinded from the physician&#xD;
      performing the TUGOR and the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fertility centre's routine for TUGOR is as follows: Initially conscious sedation is&#xD;
      administered by OR nursing staff according to the patient's weight (midazolam 1 - 2 mg and&#xD;
      fentanyl 50 - 75 ug IV). This is followed by the PCB 5 minutes later. Additional fentanyl is&#xD;
      administered throughout the procedure as required to ensure patient comfort. The oocyte&#xD;
      retrieval proceeds once the PCB is completed. Following the oocyte retrieval and when the&#xD;
      conscious sedation has worn off; the patient will be assessed before discharge. Once the&#xD;
      discharge criteria have been met, the validated and standardized Short-Form McGill Pain&#xD;
      Questionnaire will be used to objectively measure the pain experienced during the TUGOR. All&#xD;
      study participants will be required to rate the pain experience during the procedure. The&#xD;
      attending nurse is required to record all adverse events from the procedure as part of her&#xD;
      clinical duties. Embryology information, i.e. fertilization, embryo grading, development and&#xD;
      frozen rates will be recorded to assess whether PCB affects this aspect of ART. Additional&#xD;
      information will be obtained by reviewing participants' clinic charts nine months&#xD;
      post-procedure to determine secondary outcomes, i.e. live birth rates. Animal mouse models in&#xD;
      the past have shown local anaesthetic to adversely affect fertilization and embryo&#xD;
      development (Schnell, 1992). No adverse effects on human embryos from lidocaine have ever&#xD;
      been demonstrated (Wikland 1990), however assessing embryo quality and birth outcomes has&#xD;
      been the standard when conducting studies assessing the use of PCB&#xD;
