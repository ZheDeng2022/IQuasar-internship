  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the marginal improvements in survival of patients suffering from malignant glioma&#xD;
      treated with gene therapy vectors, the clinical trials conducted so far using viral vectors,&#xD;
      in particular adenoviral vectors, have proven that the use of adenoviral vectors is a safe&#xD;
      therapeutic approach, even in large, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trials. Treatment of&#xD;
      malignant glioma using gene transfer modalities typically consists of surgical debulking of&#xD;
      the tumor mass followed by the administration of the viral vectors into the brain tissue&#xD;
      surrounding the tumor cavity. This study will combine direct tumor cell killing (TK) and&#xD;
      immune-mediated stimulatory (Flt3L) gene transfer approaches delivered by first generation&#xD;
      adenoviral vectors.&#xD;

      This is a Phase 1, multiple center open label, dose escalation safety study of Ad-hCMV-TK and&#xD;
      Ad-hCMV-Flt3L delivered to the peritumoral region after tumor resection. This study will&#xD;
      combine direct tumor cell killing (TK) and immune-mediated stimulatory (Flt3L) gene transfer&#xD;
      approaches delivered by first generation adenoviral vectors. Treatment with HSV1-TK is&#xD;
      expected to kill transduced brain cells, thus exposing tumor antigen. Treatment with Flt3L, a&#xD;
      cytokine known to cause proliferation of dendritic cells, should cause the migration of&#xD;
      dendritic cells to the peritumoral brain and remaining tumor. There, they will be exposed to&#xD;
      tumor antigens released from dying glioma cells through TK + valacyclovir-induced glioma cell&#xD;
      death, and thus mediate a specific anti-malignant glioma immune response against remaining&#xD;
      malignant glioma cells.&#xD;

    <description>This protocol is a dose escalation study of Ad-hCMV-TK and Ad-hCMV-Flt3L infused at the time of surgical resection followed by systemic oral administration of valacyclovir in addition to current standard of care with temozolomide and radiotherapy. Eligible subjects will be enrolled in six sequential dosing cohorts:&#xD;
A= Ad-hCMV-TK: 1x10^10 vp and Ad-hCMV-Flt3L: 1x10^9 vp&#xD;
B= Ad-hCMV-TK: 1x10^11 vp and Ad-hCMV-Flt3L: 1x10^9 vp&#xD;
C= Ad-hCMV-TK: 1x10^10 vp and Ad-hCMV-Flt3L: 1x10^10 vp&#xD;
D= Ad-hCMV-TK: 1x10^11 vp and Ad-hCMV-Flt3L: 1x10^10 vp&#xD;
E= Ad-hCMV-TK: 1x10^10 vp and Ad-hCMV-Flt3L: 1x10^11 vp&#xD;
F= Ad-hCMV-TK: 1x10^11 vp and Ad-hCMV-Flt3L: 1x10^11 vp&#xD;
Subjects will be treated sequentially with a minimum of 21 days before treatment of new subjects within a cohort or before dose escalation.</description>

    <intervention_name>Dose Escalation of Ad-hCMV-TK and Ad-hCMV-Flt3L</intervention_name>
    <description>Two adenoviral vectors will be used, each to deliver one of the therapeutic genes. Both vectors are human serotype 5, replication-defective, first generation adenoviral vectors deleted in E1a and E3 viral encoding regions. Each vector will constitutively express their respective therapeutic transgene (i.e. HSV1-TK or Flt3L) under the control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter (hCMV). Valacyclovir treatment will begin 1-3 days after vector administration at a dose of 2 grams given orally 3X per day for 14 days. A second course of valacyclovir will be given beginning Week 10.&#xD;
Radiation and chemotherapy will be administered as per standard of care.</description>
