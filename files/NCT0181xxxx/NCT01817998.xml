      Background and study concept:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atrial fibrillation is the new global epidemic in cardiology. With improved survival from&#xD;
      other cardiovascular diseases and longer living in general, the incidence and prevalence of&#xD;
      AF rise dramatically in all developed countries with an estimated life time risk of one in&#xD;
      four for all people above the age of 40 years. Similarly in Denmark, the prevalence is&#xD;
      estimated to almost double within 2020. It is a fatal arrhythmia with doubled mortality&#xD;
      compared to patients with normal sinus rhythm; this primarily caused by an increased risk of&#xD;
      stroke and heart failure. In particular stroke is a feared complication with a 70% risk of&#xD;
      fatal outcome or lasting handicaps and immense costs for each patient as well as in terms of&#xD;
      health costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, many AF patients experience a variety of symptoms and have markedly reduced quality&#xD;
      of life. Opposed to heart failure patients and patients who have suffered from a myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, AF patients are not offered any sort of rehabilitation when diagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological treatment of the arrhythmia is challenging. Most often, individual and&#xD;
      careful risk evaluation including ultrasound of the heart is obligatory to choose optimal&#xD;
      treatment strategy and prophylactic anticoagulation. In case a new anti-arrhythmic drug is&#xD;
      started to restore and maintain sinus rhythm, hospitalization for at least two days with&#xD;
      heart rhythm monitoring is required to detect any possible potentially dangerous or even&#xD;
      fatal arrhythmia as a side effect to the treatment. Additionally, the first new oral&#xD;
      anti-arrhythmic AF drug introduced for more than twenty-five years proved to be hazardous in&#xD;
      a high-risk AF population and is now only used with strict precautions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the role of alternative treatment strategies and to renew handling of cardiac&#xD;
      arrhythmia, we have therefore set out to study the role of physical exercise in AF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our specific study aims are to examine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The effect of physical exercise on AF burden&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The effect of physical exercise on the risk of cardiovascular hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is an interventional, randomized exercise study. 60 patients older than 18 years&#xD;
      with ECG-documented AF will be included if written informed consent is obtained. They will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to moderate-severe (80-85% of max capacity) or low intensity (50% of max&#xD;
      capacity) training. Exclusion criteria are language barrier, illness inherent with an&#xD;
      expected survival shorter than a year, other reasons preventing the patient from training,&#xD;
      revealed serious cardiac disease during pre-tests, AF ablation within one year, permanent AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups are first participating in a nurse-led educational and care program. The program&#xD;
      is built on two individual consultations and one team consultation with focus on education in&#xD;
      AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be thoroughly examined before randomization and after ended training period&#xD;
      with special ultrasound of the heart, ECG-monitored test of maximal oxygen uptake on&#xD;
      ergometer bicycle, 24 hours measurement of blood pressure and pulse, and blood samples. They&#xD;
      will all be taught to use home ECG recorders, a new handheld device. The patients will send&#xD;
      ECG's twice daily and if the experience cardiac symptoms for 5 months (during exercise and&#xD;
      two months after).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When randomized the patients will be divided in teams of ten and trained on separate teams,&#xD;
      so the physiotherapist closely can guide the patients in training at the correct intensity&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During and after physical exercise the burden of atrial fibrillation is measured by tele-ECG&#xD;
      i.e. number of ECGs with atrial fibrillation divided by total number of ECGs. ECG reporting&#xD;
      begins after four weeks of physical exercise and continues 2 months after last training&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recording of hospitalization begins after randomization and continues one year after last&#xD;
      training session. All hospitalizations caused by AF or related to the AF disease (relapse of&#xD;
      AF, heart failure, stroke, new anti-arrhythmic medication, elective electrical cardioversion,&#xD;
      complications to anticoagulation, pacemaker implantation) are recorded. Also, total days in&#xD;
      hospital are registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AF population is growing on a global scale and the disease attracts immense interest on&#xD;
      all international cardiology congresses. New knowledge of the effect of training for the&#xD;
      general population as well as the effect in the setting of established disease could have&#xD;
      paramount effect for prognosis, quality of life, and health costs as pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment is AF still holds challenges.&#xD;
