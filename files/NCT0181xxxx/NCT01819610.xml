      A SPRIX trial in pediatric subjects vs. adults undergoing open surgical procedures resulting&#xD;
      in at least a moderate pain level. Subjects will receive SPRIX and blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected for pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment. Subjects will also be assessed on the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of SPRIX.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of intranasal (IN) ketorolac tromethamine (SPRIX) in pediatric subjects age&#xD;
      12-17 years vs. adults ages 18-64 years undergoing open surgical procedures that are expected&#xD;
      to result in at least a moderate level of pain (i.e., 40 or above on a 0-100 Visual Analog&#xD;
      Scale (VAS) in which 0 is no pain and 100 is the worst pain imaginable). Following surgery&#xD;
      subjects will receive their 1st dose of SPRIX, if and when pain reaches a VAS of 40 or more,&#xD;
      followed by SPRIX administration every 6 hours. Blood samples for PK assessment will then be&#xD;
      collected for PK assessment pre-dose, at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, and 4 hours after the first&#xD;
      dose, at 6 hours (immediately before the 2nd dose), and immediately before each of the next&#xD;
      several subsequent q6h doses up to the dose to be administered on the morning of&#xD;
      post-operative day 2. Blood samples will then be collected at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours&#xD;
      after receiving the morning dose on day 2 (i.e., last blood sample for PK will be collected&#xD;
      on the morning of post-operative day 3). Pain intensity (PI) will be assessed using the 0-100&#xD;
      VAS at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours post dose, at 2 hours after the 2nd dose, and then&#xD;
      immediately prior to each dose at 12, 18, and 24 hours from baseline. Patients may elect to&#xD;
      continue taking SPRIX for a total of 5 days with daily assessments of pain intensity using a&#xD;
      diary. A final follow-up phone interview will be conducted 14 days after the final dose of&#xD;
      study drug. Thus, each subject's study participation will consist of a screening visit, a&#xD;
      treatment/assessment period of up to 5 days, and a follow-up interview.&#xD;
