  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxidative stress is involved in the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy. The&#xD;
      superoxide-generating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase 2 (NOX2, encoded by&#xD;
      the CYBB gene) and the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) play opposing roles&#xD;
      in the balance of cellular redox status. In the present study, we investigated associations&#xD;
      of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the regulatory regions of CYBB and GPX4 with&#xD;
      kidney disease in patients with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;

      In the present study, three cohorts of type 1 diabetic patients (one Brazilian and two&#xD;
      French/Belgium cohorts) were studied for the association with diabetic nephropathy (DN) with&#xD;
      a total of 1396 patients. The patients were classified according to the urinary&#xD;
      albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) or urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) in absence of&#xD;
      nephropathy, defined as ACR &lt;30 mg/g or UAER &lt; 20 µg/min or &lt; 20 mg/L and plasma creatinine&#xD;
      &lt;1.7 mg/dL; incipient nephropathy, defined as persistent microalbuminuria (ACR 30 - 300 mg/g&#xD;
      of creatinine or UAER 20 - 200 µg/min or 20 - 200 mg/L) and plasma creatinine &lt;1.7 mg/dL;&#xD;
      established diabetic nephropathy, defined as past or present macroalbuminuria (ACR &gt;300 mg/g&#xD;
      of creatinine or UAER &gt;200 µg/min or &gt; 200 mg/L) and plasma creatinine &lt;1.7 mg/dL; advanced&#xD;
      diabetic nephropathy, defined as past or present macroalbuminuria, plasma creatinine &gt;1.7&#xD;
      mg/dL and any renal replacement therapy. Genotyping of polymorphisms was performed by Real&#xD;
      Time PCR using fluorescent-labelled probes.&#xD;

        Three cohorts pf type 1 diabetic patients were used for the present study. The first one is&#xD;
        a Brazilian cohort with 451 patients recruited in diabetes/endocrinology departments of&#xD;
        three university hospitals in the cities of São Paulo (SP), Campinas (SP) and Porto Alegre&#xD;
        (RS), Brazil between October 2004 and October 2012. The second one is a French/Belgium&#xD;
        cohort with 501 patients recruited from both countries between November 1998 to December&#xD;
        2000. The third cohort is a French/Belgium cohort with 444 patients recruited from both&#xD;
        countries between May 1994 to April 1995.&#xD;
