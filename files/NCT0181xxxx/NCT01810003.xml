  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subclinical inflammation is now indisputably recognized as a key etiological factor in the&#xD;
      development of atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular disease. Obesity and related&#xD;
      dysmetabolic states including metabolic syndrome (MetS) are highly prevalent causes of&#xD;
      subclinical inflammation. Obesity and MetS are both diet and lifestyle-related and there is a&#xD;
      growing body of literature suggesting that specific nutrients, such as long chain omega-3&#xD;
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn-3PUFA), may attenuate the pro-inflammatory state associated&#xD;
      with these conditions. However, careful review of existing literature on this topic reveals&#xD;
      important gaps in knowledge, the purported anti-inflammatory effects of LCn-3PUFA even being&#xD;
      questioned by many. Significant confounding attributable to study design, sample size and&#xD;
      biomarker selection may be responsible in part for inconsistencies in the literature on&#xD;
      LCn-3PUFA and inflammation. We also found that evidence available to date (for and against)&#xD;
      is based primarily on secondary analyses, as most of the studies published were not primarily&#xD;
      designed to investigate inflammation as a primary outcome. It remains unclear whether the&#xD;
      different LCn-3PUFA, primarily docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid&#xD;
      (EPA, 20:5n-3), have similar effects on pro-inflammatory processes as almost all studies were&#xD;
      undertaken using a mix of LCn-3PUFA. Whether efficacy of EPA and DHA is influenced by&#xD;
      sex/gender is also unknown. Finally, a better understanding of the systemic and&#xD;
      tissue-specific mechanisms underlying the anticipated anti-inflammatory effects of different&#xD;
      LCn-3PUFA in MetS would also be of great value. Addressing these gaps has important public&#xD;
      health implications, considering that LCn-3PUFA supplements are broadly and indiscriminately&#xD;
      recommended for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching objective of the proposed research is to compare the anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      effects of EPA and DHA in men and women with MetS.&#xD;

      The proposed study will be undertaken according to a double-blind randomized placebo&#xD;
      controlled cross-over design with 3 treatment phases: 1- high DHA, 2- High EPA, 3- Control.&#xD;
      Each treatment phase will last 10 weeks and will be separated by 8-week washouts.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to one of 6 treatment sequences while stratifying for sex.&#xD;
      Treatments will provide 3 identical 1g capsules per day. During the 3 treatment periods,&#xD;
      subjects will receive in random order 0g/d EPA+DHA (3g corn oil placebo), 3g/d EPA (&gt;90%&#xD;
      EPA), and 3g/d DHA (&gt;90% DHA). Long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn-3PUFA)&#xD;
      will be provided in their re-esterified triacylglycerol form as studies have shown that&#xD;
      bioavailability was greater when EPA and DHA were consumed as TG rather than as ethyl esters.&#xD;
      The therapeutic dose that maximizes the anti-inflammatory effects of LCn-3PUFA in patients&#xD;
      with inflammation has not been established, although data suggest that they may be&#xD;
      dose-dependent. However, studies in healthy human volunteers suggest that an intake &gt; 2 g EPA&#xD;
      + DHA/day is required to affect inflammatory processes. Many of the available studies have&#xD;
      used a dose of EPA+DHA that was lower than 2g/d, with no apparent anti-inflammatory effects.&#xD;
      A study has shown that a dose of 1.8g/d of EPA+DHA induced significant changes in peripheral&#xD;
      blood cell (PBC) inflammation gene expression, with no change in plasma CRP concentrations.&#xD;
      In the present study, we propose to use a dose of 3 g/d for each individual LCn-3PUFA tested,&#xD;
      which is at the higher end of the recommended intake for patients with high plasma TG, but&#xD;
      which will maximize our chance to observe changes in inflammatory markers and to&#xD;
      differentiate the effects of EPA and DHA, if they exist. Participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      maintain a constant body weight during the course of the study. They will also be counselled&#xD;
      on how to exclude fatty fish meals (including salmon, tuna, mackerel, and herring), fish-oil&#xD;
      supplements, flax products, walnuts, and omega-3-enriched eggs during the study. Vitamin&#xD;
      supplements and natural health products will be strictly forbidden during the entire&#xD;
      experimental period, with the exception of calcium and vitamin D, which will be allowed at a&#xD;
      stable dose. Although alcohol consumption will be permitted during the study with intakes not&#xD;
      exceeding one serving (12-15 g alcohol) per day, it will be forbidden for the 4 days that&#xD;
      precede the various tests at the end of each treatment phase. Subjects will also be&#xD;
      instructed to maintain their usual physical activity except for the 4 days that precede blood&#xD;
      sampling at the various stages of the study, during which they will be asked to remain&#xD;
      sedentary.&#xD;
