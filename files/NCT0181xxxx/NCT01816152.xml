      Tailored light treatment will increase sleep efficiency, reduce depression and reduce&#xD;
      agitation scores in those with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a within subjects, randomized placebo control study, a tailored light treatment will be&#xD;
      used for short-term (4 weeks). Outcome measures include sleep measures (actigraphy), and&#xD;
      questionnaires probing behavior and mood in those who have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease and related dementia. After a 4-week washout period, a placebo control inactive light&#xD;
      will be used for another 4 weeks.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Disturbance</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline (week 0) and intervention (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Caregivers and subjects are asked to complete the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which is assessed at baseline and after 4 weeks they are exposed to the lighting intervention. The seven component scores are summed to provide a global score ranging from 0 to 21 and a score of 5 or above indicates sleep disturbance. A higher number indications a greater sleep disturbance</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Agitation</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline (week 0) and intervention (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Caregivers and subjects are asked to fill out the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Score, which is assessed at baseline and after 4 weeks they are exposed to the lighting intervention. All scores are summed for one total score - a higher score indicates more agitation</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline (week 0) and intervention (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Caregivers and subjects are asked to fill out subjective questionnaires assessing depression using the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) Questionnaires are assessed at baseline and after 4 weeks they are exposed to the lighting intervention. The CSDD consists of 19 questions rated on a scale of 0 to 2 with all scores summed for a total score. A score greater than 12 indicates depression and a higher score indicates greater depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activity of Daily Living</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline (week 0) and intervention (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Caregivers and subjects are asked to fill out subjective Activity of Daily Living questionnaire (MDS-ADL), which is assessed at baseline and after 4 weeks they are exposed to the lighting intervention. Scores range from 4 to 18 and a higher score indicates a higher dependence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Light/dark patterns</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline (week 0) and intervention (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects are asked to wear a calibrated light meter to obtain light/dark and activity/rest patterns for 7 days prior to intervention and for 7 days after 3 weeks that the light treatment is applied. These data are used to determine circadian disruption (correlation between light/dark and activity/rest) and light dose.</description>

    <measure>Actigraphy</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline (week 0) and intervention (week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects are asked to wear an actigraph to obtain activity/rest patterns for 7 days prior to intervention and for 7 days after 3 weeks that the light treatment is applied. Actigraphs are used to measure sleep efficiency.</description>
