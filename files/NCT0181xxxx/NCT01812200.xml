  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:The acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a complication of coronary artery disease&#xD;
      (CAD) and associated with increased mortality. Dual antiplatelet therapy of acetylsalicylic&#xD;
      acid (ASA) with P2Y12 receptor antagonists such as clopidogrel is a cornerstone in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with advanced CAD. Due to delayed onset of action, intersubject&#xD;
      variability or resistance to clopidogrel, different platelet aggregation inhibitors have been&#xD;
      developed. Ticagrelor is a reversible P2Y12 receptor antagonist with superior efficacy&#xD;
      compared to clopidogrel in the prevention of cardiovascular death in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is also associated with thromboembolic events and substantial&#xD;
      mortality. Beside vitamin K antagonists (VKA, phenprocoumon) for stroke prevention in&#xD;
      patients with AF, the direct factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban and the direct thrombin&#xD;
      inhibitor dabigatran have recently received approval for prophylactic treatment of patients&#xD;
      with non-valvular AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is a lack of efficacy or safety data for the combined impact of antithrombotic&#xD;
      drugs in patients requiring arterial and venous thromboembolic prophylaxis due to their&#xD;
      underlying co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives: To evaluate the effect of ticagrelor + ASA in combination with dabigatran,&#xD;
      rivaroxaban or phenprocoumon at steady state on markers of coagulation activation. The&#xD;
      effects on coagulation activation will also be studied after a single dose of dabigatran,&#xD;
      rivaroxaban or ticagrelor and at a therapeutic INR of phenprocoumon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A single-centre, prospective, randomized, controlled, analyst-blinded study in&#xD;
      three parallel-groups. Subjects will receive ticagrelor + ASA in combination with dabigatran&#xD;
      (treatment A), rivaroxaban (treatment B) or phenprocoumon (treatment C). All IMPs will be&#xD;
      administered at doses indicated for stroke prevention in AF or ACS. Markers on thrombin&#xD;
      generation and platelet activation will be studied in venous blood where coagulation is in&#xD;
      resting state and in shed blood where the clotting system is activated in the&#xD;
      microvasculature in vivo: prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2), thrombin-anti-thrombin (TAT),&#xD;
      β-thromboglobulin (β-TG), D-Dimer, thromboxane B2 (TxB2), CD40 ligand (CD40L), p-Selectin.&#xD;
      Further, the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), inhibition of factor Xa activity, activated&#xD;
      partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), Biophen® and Hemoclot® will be&#xD;
      assessed in venous blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: A total of 60 healthy, non-smoking and drug-free male volunteers will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this trial and randomized into one of three balanced groups (treatment A, B and&#xD;
      C; n = 20 per group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome variables: β-TG, F1+2 and TAT in shed blood&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional outcome variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  D-Dimer, TxB2, CD40L and p-Selectin in shed blood&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  β-TG, F1+2, TAT, D-Dimer, TxB2, CD40L, p-Selectin, ETP, aPTT, PT, inhibition of factor&#xD;
           Xa, Biophen® and Hemoclot® in venous blood&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk/ benefit assessment:Total blood loss will be, dependent on treatment allocation, between&#xD;
      330 ml and 510 ml throughout the entire study period of 4 - 5 weeks. This amount of venous&#xD;
      blood is considered to be acceptable in this healthy population. Blood sampling procedures&#xD;
      may cause mild and transient pain. A minor haematoma may occur at the site of needle&#xD;
      insertions. Bleeding time incisions may leave small persistent scars. Administration of the&#xD;
      study drugs, in particular as triple combination for 5 days, results in transient&#xD;
      hypocoagulability and may cause overt or occult bleeding. The risk is considered low in the&#xD;
      healthy subjects under study. Continuous monitoring of safety parameters (haemoglobin,&#xD;
      haematocrit, platelet count, coagulation) and surveillance of the overall status will be&#xD;
      performed during study participation. Subjects will be instructed to avoid vigorous physical&#xD;
      exercise and handling of hazardous machinery during study participation. ASA, dabigatran and&#xD;
      rivaroxaban can cause gastrointestinal discomfort. Other side effects are rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of these novel anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, ticagrelor) has not&#xD;
      been investigated so far. Conducting this study in a healthy population limits potential&#xD;
      bleeding risk reported from drug interactions and impaired liver or renal function, which may&#xD;
      influence the pharmacokinetics and -dynamics of the investigational products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study can provide information on haemostatic system activation in vivo during triple&#xD;
      treatment with antithrombotic drugs, which is indicated for patients with AF and ACS. The&#xD;
      results of this study may provide dosing guidance for risk reduction of patients with ACS and&#xD;
      AF.&#xD;
