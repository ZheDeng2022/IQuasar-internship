  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemochromatosis type 1 is one of the most frequent genetic disease since the genetic&#xD;
      predisposition (homozygosity for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene) is encountered in about&#xD;
      3/1000 white subjects (5/1000 in Brittany, France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the half of these predisposed subjects, the phenotypic expression of the disease needs a&#xD;
      treatment. This treatment is based upon repeated bloodletting which is generally considered&#xD;
      as simple, safe and effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, it is still questioned as regard its physiopathological justification and its&#xD;
      clinical implications. Indeed, bloodletting could cause an increase of non-transferrin bound&#xD;
      iron (NTBI) particularly for its reactive form called labile plasma iron (LPI) This adverse&#xD;
      physiopathological effect could have clinical consequences and could be linked with articular&#xD;
      consequences which can be aggravated by the treatment.&#xD;

      Hemochromatosis type 1 is one of the most frequent genetic disease since the genetic&#xD;
      predisposition (homozygosity for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene) is encountered in about&#xD;
      3/1000 white subjects (5/1000 in Brittany, France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the half of these predisposed subjects, the phenotypic expression of the disease needs a&#xD;
      treatment. This treatment is based upon repeated bloodletting which is generally considered&#xD;
      as simple, safe and effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, it is still questioned as regard its physiopathological justification and its&#xD;
      clinical implications. Indeed, bloodletting could cause an increase of non-transferrin bound&#xD;
      iron (NTBI) particularly for its reactive form called labile plasma iron (LPI) This adverse&#xD;
      physiopathological effect could have clinical consequences and could be linked with articular&#xD;
      consequences which can be aggravated by the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to explore the effect of bloodletting upon plasmatic concentrations&#xD;
      of NTBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  explore the impact of bloodletting upon different parameters of iron metabolism and in&#xD;
           particular LPI, hepcidinemia and markers of erythropoiesis ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  explore basal and nycthemeral characteristics of new parameters of iron metabolism&#xD;
           (hepcidin, NTBI, LPI) in hemochromatosis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demonstration of an adverse effect of bloodletting upon iron metabolism would allow for a&#xD;
      therapeutic innovation based upon an association of bloodletting and oral chelation during&#xD;
      the induction treatment of type 1 hemochromatosis and, more generally in hepcidino deficient&#xD;
      forms of hemochromatosis.&#xD;
