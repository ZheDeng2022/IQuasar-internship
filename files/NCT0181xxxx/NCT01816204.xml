  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapist assisted, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (TAI-CBT) has been shown to&#xD;
      be effective with patients who have Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in multiple studies&#xD;
      from several countries, including: the United Kingdom, Australia, Sweden, and the&#xD;
      Netherlands. Despite strong evidence of efficacy, TAI-CBT has not been offered in the USA.&#xD;
      TAI-CBT could provide an effective alternative to face-to-face psychotherapy that would&#xD;
      expand the availability and convenience of evidence- based treatment anywhere clinical&#xD;
      availability is limited. The University of Florida (UF) has historically had greater demand&#xD;
      for psychotherapy than the available supply of psychotherapy hours resulting in waiting lists&#xD;
      for students needing to receive treatment for anxiety. Anxiety disorders interfere with&#xD;
      memory and concentration thus impairing academic functioning. Students who must wait for&#xD;
      treatment for 3-4 weeks are at risk for failing courses or dropping out of school. If TAI-CBT&#xD;
      proved to be effective with UF students, providing it could increase the number of students&#xD;
      who would receive effective and timely treatment. This project will create a 6-8 session&#xD;
      therapist assisted on-line treatment for anxiety disorder. The investigators will offer&#xD;
      TAI-CBT as an experimental treatment in summer and fall, 2013 comparing outcomes to&#xD;
      face-to-face individual therapy, group therapy, and wait-list controls. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that students receiving TAI-CBT will have a reduction in anxiety symptoms&#xD;
      comparable to face-to-face counseling and greater than wait list controls.&#xD;

      Participation is restricted to currently enrolled students at the University of Florida who&#xD;
      have paid the health fee, and who are seeking treatment for anxiety and the Counseling and&#xD;
      Wellness Center. Students who meet criteria and agree to participate will select from two&#xD;
      treatments, individual face-to-face or therapist assisted on-line treatment. Prior to each&#xD;
      session of individual therapy, or on-line treatment participants will complete the Behavioral&#xD;
      Health Measure-20 is a normal part of treatment at the CWC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant is assigned to the Therapist-assisted on-line (TAO) treatment he/she will be&#xD;
      asked to complete a seven module on-line treatment. Each module includes interactive,&#xD;
      educational materials and weekly assignments. Subjects may participate in an on-line&#xD;
      discussion forum with other participants for each module. The forum will use only first names&#xD;
      or a pseudonym to protect confidentiality. In addition, participants in the TAO treatment&#xD;
      will receive a 10-20 minute video-conference weekly with a doctoral level therapist.&#xD;
      Therapists will review assignments, answer questions, and help to apply the educational&#xD;
      materials contained in the modules to the subjects life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The video conference will be on Adobe Connect. This involves a free download for a computer,&#xD;
      tablet, or smart phone. Medical records will be kept for ten years, per UF policy. Adobe&#xD;
      connect is HIPAA and HITECH compliant. Research records will be de-identified and use an&#xD;
      identifier number that cannot be connected to individual participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only 2 arms were actually used, Face-to-face therapy and TAO treatment.&#xD;
