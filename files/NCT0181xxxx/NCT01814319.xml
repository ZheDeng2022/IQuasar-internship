  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Probenecid is an FDA approved drug for the treatment gout and hyperuricemia. It has been used&#xD;
      safely in humans for decades for this and other indications. The investigators have recently&#xD;
      discovered that this drug can also stimulate other receptors in the heart and therefore&#xD;
      improve its function. The hypothesis of this study is that probenecid can be used to improve&#xD;
      the function of the heart and therefore the symptoms in patients with heart failure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that oral administration of probenecid results in&#xD;
      improved symptomatology and heart function in patients with systolic heart failure. There&#xD;
      will be three cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 will enroll up to 50 subjects in a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-control,&#xD;
      cross-over study with each patient serving as his or her own control. The subjects will have&#xD;
      stable HF, an ejection fraction of less than or equal to 40% and NYHA II to IV symptoms. Each&#xD;
      subject will undergo 1 week of investigational product (IP), consisting of oral probenecid&#xD;
      therapy 1 gram twice a day or placebo with weekly follow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will undergo EKGs, laboratory analysis, physical exams; dyspnea and quality of&#xD;
      life questionnaires and a 6 minute walk test (MWT) at baseline. There will be 2 optional&#xD;
      sub-studies one for echocardiographic data and the other biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 will enroll up to 50 subjects in a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-control study&#xD;
      and will include patients admitted to the hospital with acute decompensated HF. Each subject&#xD;
      will also receive Investigational product consisting of either 1 gram orally twice daily of&#xD;
      probenecid or placebo during their hospitalization. They will have daily follow-up with EKG&#xD;
      and appropriate laboratory work. In addition to the EKG, laboratory analysis, physical exams,&#xD;
      dyspnea and quality of life questionnaires and 6 MWT data will be collected; additional data&#xD;
      such as length of hospital stay, biomarkers, use of inotropic therapy and diuretics, and rate&#xD;
      of diuresis will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3 will enroll up to 50 healthy subjects in a double-blinded, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-control study. Each subject will also receive Investigational product consisting of&#xD;
      either 2 grams orally of probenecid or placebo. During a 6 hour course subjects will have&#xD;
      laboratory analysis, physical exam, telemetry, EKG and echocardiographic studies performed as&#xD;
      measures of both safety and effect of the compound.&#xD;
