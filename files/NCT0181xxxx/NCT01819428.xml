    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open-label, single-arm, multi-center phase II trial is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of novel pan-HER inhibitor, NOV120101 (Poziotinib), as a first-line&#xD;
      monotherapeutic agent in patients with lung adenocarcinoma harboring EGFR mutation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EGFR TKIs are known as more effective and less toxic medications against EGFR mutated tumors.&#xD;
      However, newly acquired resistance to these inhibitors is the inevitable obstacle in&#xD;
      continuous treatment with them. To overcome this problem, many new class of TKIs including&#xD;
      NOV120101 (Poziotinib) are developing these days. To evaluate the efficacy of NOV120101&#xD;
      (Poziotinib) as a first-line monotherapeutic medication, chemotherapy-na√Øve patients will&#xD;
      participate in this study. Subjects will receive NOV120101 (Poziotinib) 12 mg PO once daily&#xD;
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity development. Objective response rate (ORR)&#xD;
      will be analyzed as the primary endpoint in this trial. Secondary endpoints including PFS&#xD;
      rate at 12 months, DCR, PFS, and OS will also be analyzed.&#xD;
