      A. the controlling of the blood pressure, especially the variation of blood pressure, can&#xD;
      slow down the development of the small vessel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B intensive BP control is more effective than normal control of blood pressure in slowing&#xD;
      down the small vessel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C drugs of Calcium Channel Blocker(CCB) and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor(ACEI)&#xD;
      have no significant difference in lowing the blood pressure and variability of blood pressure&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The selected patients were diagnosis of stroke caused by small vessel disease due to&#xD;
      hypertension recently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients had been divided into two groups by random principle and given ACEI or CCB&#xD;
      separately for treatment. At the same time, given intensive or regular controlling of the&#xD;
      blood pressure by stratified random. In the regular controlling group, the BP should be in&#xD;
      the range of 130-139 mmHg and in the intensive controlling group, the BP should be below 130&#xD;
      mmHg. To the acute ischemic stroke patients who were accord with the lacunar infarction&#xD;
      syndrome, it is rule to do the examination for exclusive selection of exclusion of&#xD;
      hemodynamic dysfunction due to the artery stenosis ( stenosis &gt;50%, the examination of&#xD;
      intracranial artery was by the methods of Transcranial Doppler (TCD)/Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Angiography(MRA)/Computed Tomographic Angiography(CTA)/Digital Subtraction Angiography(DSA),&#xD;
      the examination of carotid artery was by the methods of colorful ultrasound / MRA/ CTA/ DSA )&#xD;
      at the baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be proved of lacunar infarction by brain imaging. All patients had a MRI scan at&#xD;
      the baseline and the beginning of the research, including T1-Weighted&#xD;
      Imaging(T1W1),T2-Weighted Imaging(T2WI), T2-FLAIR, Diffusion-Weighted Imaging(DWI),&#xD;
      Gradient-Recalled Echo(GRE) T2*, the Perfusion-Weighted Imaging(PWI) would complete&#xD;
      conditionally (100 cases). The details should be followed by the instruction in the appendix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research about the variability of blood pressure: all patients show complete the examination&#xD;
      of 24-hour blood-pressure monitor (at the baseline, the first month after the beginning,&#xD;
      every three months and the end of the research), complete the head-up tilt test if&#xD;
      conditionally ( at the baseline, each 3 months later and the end of the research ) The&#xD;
      automatic regulation function of the small vessel should be evaluated if conditionally (the&#xD;
      C02 reaction, TCD head-up tilt) and also the function of endothelium-derived relaxing of the&#xD;
      brachial artery (at the baseline, each 3 months later and the end of the research) The&#xD;
      reservation of the blood was for further research on genetic study.&#xD;
