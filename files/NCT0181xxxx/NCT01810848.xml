  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis of the knee is a degenerative joint disease that involves degradation of the&#xD;
      joint. Symptoms include joint tenderness, pain, stiffness, locking, and occasionally an&#xD;
      effusion. Over 40 million Americans also have cardiovascular disease in addition to their OA.&#xD;
      Initiation and maintenance of even low-levels of physical activity is critical for management&#xD;
      of cardiac risk. Patients with osteoarthritis have been shown to have poorer aerobic&#xD;
      conditioning, lower daily physical activity levels and lower self-efficacy for exercise than&#xD;
      non-OA cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been established that there exists a consistent gradient across activity groups&#xD;
      indicating greater longevity and reduced risk of CHD, CVD, and stroke, in more active&#xD;
      individuals. Available research suggests the greatest gains in cardiovascular fitness occur&#xD;
      in moving a sedentary individual to even low levels of physical activity, and 12 weeks is&#xD;
      enough to demonstrate change in the risk profile of at-risk individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, appropriate levels of aerobic and strength training have been shown to be beneficial&#xD;
      in treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      hylan G-F 20 (single injection preparation) in promoting greater levels of physical activity&#xD;
      and fitness as measured by MET level compared to an exercise-only cohort; evaluating both the&#xD;
      change in physical function as well as the cardiovascular risk profile. This is a randomized,&#xD;
      single-blinded clinical trial comparing injection of the knee joint with Hylan GF-20 to sham&#xD;
      procedure. Subjects will undergo a regular exercise program for 6 months following&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
