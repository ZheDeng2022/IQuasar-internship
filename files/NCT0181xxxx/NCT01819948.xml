    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the administration of the PhytoMed™&#xD;
      complement reduces CRP in women with histologically confirmed AJCC Stage 0-IIIA breast cancer&#xD;
      which has been completely surgically resected and without evidence of disease as determined&#xD;
      by their physician&#xD;
