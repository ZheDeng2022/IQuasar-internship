  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This small study is to investigate the efficacy of Acthar in the treatment of chronic&#xD;
      migraine in patients who have failed multiple treatments, including Botox (which is defined&#xD;
      as having &lt;30% reduction from baseline in the number of headache days per month). Despite the&#xD;
      widespread use of anti-seizure medications, there remain a significant number of patient&#xD;
      whose migraines are refractory to these agents. The pathophysiology of migraine is such that&#xD;
      the neural substances calcitonin G related protein (CGRP), substance P, and neurokinin A are&#xD;
      released at the trigeminal nerve endings innervating the large cranial and dura mater blood&#xD;
      vessels and this neurotrasmission generates migraine associated pain. Because of this,&#xD;
      treatment for migraine can be directed towards down regulating those receptor sites&#xD;
      accordingly. Acthar may provide pain relief through this mechanist, as ACTH has been shown to&#xD;
      inhibit the release of CGRP and may also provide relief through a negative feedback loop as&#xD;
      exogenous ACTH inhibits CRH release and mast cell degranulation.&#xD;

             month, of which &gt;=8 must be migraine days or &gt;=8 days of migraine-specific acute&#xD;
             medication-ergotamine or triptans for at least 3 months prior to study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must demonstrate at least &gt;=8 migraine days or &gt;=8 days of migraine specific acute&#xD;
