      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Researchers are interested in comparing two methods that doctors can use to position&#xD;
      catheters in blood vessels. These methods are used to deliver chemotherapy and close the&#xD;
      blood supply to a tumor. The methods are the standard method called fluoroscopy and a new way&#xD;
      called 3-D Roadmap. The 3-D Roadmap software uses computed tomography (CT) images to help the&#xD;
      doctor choose the best position for the catheter to get to the tumor. The computer shows the&#xD;
      route on an x-ray screen in real time. This technique may help doctors position the catheter&#xD;
      with less x-ray dye and in a shorter time. These methods will be compared in people who are&#xD;
      having a procedure to destroy liver tumors. The procedure, called trans-arterial&#xD;
      embolization, will deliver chemotherapy and destroy the tumor blood supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To compare the effectiveness of fluoroscopy or 3-D Roadmap software for liver tumor&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are having trans-arterial embolization for liver&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will&#xD;
           provide blood and urine samples, and have imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be divided into two groups. One group will have regular fluoroscopy&#xD;
           (X-ray) during the procedure. The other group will have the procedure with the 3-D&#xD;
           Roadmap software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the first group, participants will have a CT scan. The doctor will decide how many&#xD;
           vessels need to be treated. The doctor will advance the catheter using fluoroscopy only.&#xD;
           Another CT scan will be given after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the second group, participants will have a CT scan. The doctor will look at the scan&#xD;
           with the 3-D Roadmap software. The software will show the path to advance the catheter.&#xD;
           The doctor will use the software to help destroy the tumors. Another CT scan will be&#xD;
           given after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both groups will have the same follow-up care afterward. Other tests will be given as&#xD;
           needed for the cancer treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase II prospective randomized trial comparing novel tumor segmentation and&#xD;
      navigation with 3D roadmap vs. conventional imaging with angiography during trans-arterial&#xD;
      embolization procedures. Cone beam CT (CBCT) obtains CT-like images in the angiography suite&#xD;
      during trans-arterial chemoembolization procedures and liver chemo-perfusion (PHP). In&#xD;
      addition, 2D liver perfusion metrics can be calculated from angiography images. 3D Roadmap is&#xD;
      a navigation tool/ software that utilize the data from the CBCT overlaid on live fluoroscopy&#xD;
      to display a segmented tumor, delineate its vascular supply and to navigate catheters to the&#xD;
      target vessels. Moreover, with 3D Roadmap, CBCT can be fused to prior CT or MRI for improved&#xD;
      target visualization. The 3D Roadmap software received 510 (k) clearance on February 19,&#xD;
      2004. Our CRADA partner, Philips Healthcare, also submitted and received a separate 510 (k)&#xD;
      clearance on January 30, 2015 for the software s vessel segmentation functionality and is&#xD;
      under the trade name Emboguide. 3D Roadmap/ Emboguide software is intended to be used in&#xD;
      combination with the AlluraClarity X-ray system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare safety, and technical efficiency of navigation with 3D Roadmap vs. conventional&#xD;
      image guidance during trans-arterial embolization procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are eligible if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They are more than 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;

           embolization or bland embolization in interventional radiology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They are eligible for trans-arterial chemoembolization or bland embolization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are excluded if they have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An altered mental status precluding understanding or consenting for the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  A gross body weight exceeding 375 pounds (upper limit of angio table)&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  A severe allergic reaction to iodine contrast which cannot be controlled by&#xD;
           premedication with antihistamines and steroids&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of Participants: 30&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment Time Frame: 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of sites: 1&#xD;

                  trans-arterial chemo-embolization or bland embolization in interventional&#xD;
                  radiology. A multi-disciplinary team including oncology, surgery, pathology and&#xD;
                  radiation oncology as well as interventional radiology will review each candidate&#xD;
                  and determine the eligibility for TACE or bland embolization and ineligibility&#xD;
                  for other interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Age &gt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. They must be eligible for trans-arterial chemoembolization or bland embolization&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with an altered mental status precluding understanding or consenting for the&#xD;
             procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of allergic reactions to iodine contrast, which cannot be controlled by&#xD;
             premedication with antihistamines and steroids.&#xD;

             infertility or acquired or congenital disorders incompatible with pregnancy or if the&#xD;
             patient has had a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy. Patients are also excluded&#xD;
             from pregnancy testing if they are at least 50 years of age AND have not menstruated&#xD;
             for at least 12 months OR have a documented Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) level&#xD;
             of greater than 40 mIU/mL.&#xD;
