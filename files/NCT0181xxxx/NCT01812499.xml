  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhospital the blood transfusion process consists of many phases: ordering the blood product,&#xD;
      analysis of the blood sample, delivery, transport and storage of the blood product and&#xD;
      administration. In each of these phases (near) accidents may occur. A severe transfusion&#xD;
      incident refers to the transfusion of a wrong blood product, whereas a near miss is detected&#xD;
      before transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2010 the University Hospitals Leuven introduced a new electronic patient incident report&#xD;
      system for transfusion events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will analyze the reported blood transfusion events to detect&#xD;
      the most common causes of blood transfusion events and the weakest link in the blood&#xD;
      transfusion chain.&#xD;

      A retrospective survey will be conducted of all transfusion events reported in the University&#xD;
      Hospitals Leuven between January 2011 and July 2012. Both severe accidents and near misses&#xD;
      will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be drawn from the incident report system. Data concerning the number of transfused&#xD;
      blood products will be required from the Medical Administration Service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Events will be classified according to the severity and the cause of the event. The different&#xD;
      settings where the events took place will be compared using a chi-square test (p&lt;0,05).&#xD;
