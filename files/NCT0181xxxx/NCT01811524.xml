      The main goal of the study is to present a framework, which integrates DNA, RNA and tissue&#xD;
      data to identify and prioritize genetic events that represent clinically relevant new&#xD;
      therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers for different kinds of brain tumors. The&#xD;
      investigators study the regulation of neoplastic cell growth by oncogenes, tumor-suppressor&#xD;
      and other cancer related genes using modern molecular genetic methods, such as&#xD;
      chromogenic-in-situ hybridization, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), array-CGH, cDNA&#xD;
      microarray etc. In these studies the investigators utilize disease-specific tissue&#xD;
      microarrays (TMA) which the investigators have constructed since 1999. Until now up to 3000&#xD;
      different brain tumours have been sampled to our TMA:s. These permit high-volume simultaneous&#xD;
      analysis of molecular targets at the DNA, mRNA and protein levels. Research group has also&#xD;
      focused its interest on the neoplastic development of gliomas, particularly on their&#xD;
      hereditary and environmental factors.&#xD;

      Aims of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To collect adequate brain cancer tissue material for high throughput morphological,&#xD;
           protein, RNA and DNA analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To combine tissue-related results of these analyses with clinical data to examine the&#xD;
           potential of the new biomarkers to assess diagnosis, prognosis and heredity of brain&#xD;
           tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paraffin-embedded tumor material&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paraffin blocks of more than 4,000 brain tumours have been collected into the Laboratory of&#xD;
      Pathology at Tampere University Hospital (Department of Pathology in Fimlab Laboratory). They&#xD;
      have been used primarily for purposes of clinical diagnosis, but once patient or authority&#xD;
      consent has been obtained the surplus of the material can be used for research purposes. A&#xD;
      neuropathologist has marked the most representative region of each tumour in a tissue slide.&#xD;
      Using these markings, tumour tissue regions are then biopsied into the tissue microarray&#xD;
      block (Micro-Array Technology, Beecher Instruments, Inc.). Up to 1,000 histological samples&#xD;
      can be collected into one tissue microarray block, which can be cut into 200 tissue sections.&#xD;
      These sections can be used in various kinds of analysis (immunohistochemistry, fluorescence&#xD;
      and chromogene in situ hybridisation and other histological standings). Among the advantages&#xD;
      of the method are its high capacity, potential for automation, limited damage to the original&#xD;
      tissue block and optimised circumstances for molecular biological analyses. We produced the&#xD;
      first Finnish TMA block in 1999. Until now up to 3000 different brain tumors have been&#xD;
      sampled to our TMA:s of which 2000 gliomas and meningiomas are used for this study. The&#xD;
      following provides examples of projects in which the method is used. Similar strategies are&#xD;
      used in the present study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We have studied the relationship between carbonic anhydrases and brain tumours. Carbonic&#xD;
           anhydrase IX (CA IX) is a hypoxia-induced enzyme that is associated with tumorigenesis.&#xD;
           CA IX immunopositivity was found in 80% of 362 astrocytic gliomas collected in tissue&#xD;
           microarray blocks. According to multifactorial survival analysis, CA IX intensity was a&#xD;
           significant and independent prognostic factor. CA IX is a possible candidate for&#xD;
           targeted therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. By using the cDNA-microarray method it is possible to analyse the expression of several&#xD;
           cancer genes in one hybridisation. The cDNA-CGH microarray method makes simultaneous use&#xD;
           of the cDNA-microarray method and comparative genomic hybridisation. This method allows&#xD;
           us to study the relationship between gene copy number and the expression of the&#xD;
           particular amplified gene, and also to define, at high resolution, the genes in cell&#xD;
           lines that are amplified and over- expressed. The analysis gives a more focused picture&#xD;
           of the relationship between changes in gene copy number and their expression in&#xD;
           different kinds of tumours. With these methods we have found several new cancer gene&#xD;
           candidates that may be involved in the pathogenesis of neuroblastomas. To ensure the&#xD;
           role of these genes we have built neuroblastoma tissue micro array blocks and performed&#xD;
           FISH and IHC analyses using these TMAs. We succeeded in characterising an amplification&#xD;
           region which occurred in almost half of the tumour samples of neuroblastoma patients and&#xD;
           which was significantly associated with patient survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fresh tissue and frozen tissue microarrays&#xD;
&#xD;
           Our team at the Department of Pathology has been taking steps to prepare for molecular&#xD;
           biological and genetic studies that require fresh tissue archives. To this end we have&#xD;
           systematically collected and recorded brain tumour tissue for modern methods of cancer&#xD;
           diagnosis and research. The processing, storage and archiving of brain tumour tissue&#xD;
           from the neurosurgical operation theatres at&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tampere University Hospital are undertaken centrally at the Department of Pathology&#xD;
           frozen tissue laboratory. This work has been ongoing since 1992 and by now more than&#xD;
           1,000 fresh tumour samples have been collected. The sample material is used for exact&#xD;
           tumour diagnosis in the phase of primary diagnosis (e.g. genetic 1p19q LOH analysis of&#xD;
           oligodendrogliomas). Our novel frozen tissue application serves several new molecular&#xD;
           pathological methods. We have developed a completely new method based on the snap frozen&#xD;
           technique and produced dozens of samples from different brain localisations (frozen&#xD;
           brain array). The following provides one example of a project in which frozen tissue&#xD;
           method was used. Similar principles are to be used in the present study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. We have developed a new method which facilitates the differential diagnosis of brain&#xD;
           tumours during operation. Using the Ultrarapid Ki-67 staining method, the proliferation&#xD;
           marker Ki-67 can be analysed intraoperatively with the snap frozen technique and light&#xD;
           microscopy within 10 - 15 minutes. We were able to ascertain the applicability of the&#xD;
           method using frozen tissue sections of gliomas that had been previously collected into&#xD;
           our tissue bank. On the basis of their proliferation indices, the gliomas could be&#xD;
           divided into different malignancy grades and prognosis groups. This highly specific&#xD;
           diagnostic method can be applied for example in situations where therapeutic drugs are&#xD;
           placed into an intracranial operation field.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Extracted RNA and DNA&#xD;
&#xD;
           Our laboratory is well equipped and prepared for RNA and DNA studies. Following&#xD;
           extraction, RNA and DNA are archived and kept at -700 C for later use. Example of&#xD;
           projects that use this method:&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Linkage analysis offers a powerful tool for localising genes that predispose to familial&#xD;
           diseases, provided that there is a sufficient number of families with the disease&#xD;
           concerned. For linkage analysis, the polymorphic regions of the genome are investigated&#xD;
           using markers of chromosomal regions that have been passed on from the family's founder&#xD;
           parents to all members with gliomas in the family. We have collected blood and DNA&#xD;
           samples from very rare glioma families (with a total of 183 members) for purposes of&#xD;
           linkage analysis. On the basis of genome-wide linkage analysis, we found a new&#xD;
           chromosome locus that was significantly associated with the familial glioma. Deep&#xD;
           sequencing of the samples of familial glioma patients is the following step of our&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our neuro-oncological material at the Tampere University Hospital Department of Pathology&#xD;
      comprises 5,000 tissue samples (4,000 paraffin and 1,000 frozen tissue samples). This is too&#xD;
      large a dataset to be managed by individual researchers in their own databases. Our aim&#xD;
      therefore is to develop a new integrated research data system for the effective management of&#xD;
      the tissue material that has been collected over the past 30 years, including a detailed&#xD;
      register on all the samples. The register will also include digital photo material from TMA&#xD;
      and other histological slides as well as virtual microscopy slides. The relevant clinical&#xD;
      data of the patients (e.g. at least three year follow-up of glioma and meningioma patients&#xD;
      operated during 1983 - 2009) is combined with the tissue data with the permission of Finnish&#xD;
      authorities and the Tampere University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project observes the Helsinki Declaration, current Finnish legislation and the principles&#xD;
      of data protection, laid down by Tampere University Hospital. This study is retrospective and&#xD;
      purely observational. The assignment of the medical intervention is not at the discretion of&#xD;
      the investigator. The collection of samples for research purposes required each individual&#xD;
      patient's informed consent in the familial glioma study. The archiving of diagnostic material&#xD;
      in a tissue bank involves no ethical problems. Only excess material from diagnostic samples&#xD;
      is used for research purposes, either with the patient's informed consent or with the&#xD;
      permission of the relevant Finnish authorities (the National Authority for Medicolegal&#xD;
      Affairs of Finland). The Ethical Committee of Tampere University Hospital has given&#xD;
      permission for our project (R07042). The familial glioma study is conducted under a separate&#xD;
      permit (Ministry of Social Affairs and Health , Diary number 127/08/95). Research permits&#xD;
      have also been obtained on the basis of the Finnish tissue law (Valvira: Diary number&#xD;
      7796/05.01.00.06/2011).&#xD;
