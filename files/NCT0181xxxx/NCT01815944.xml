  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regional anesthesia employs the use of local anesthetics (LA) to block specific nerves to&#xD;
      enable pain free surgery to be performed, or for intra and post operative pain relief.&#xD;
      Dilution of local anesthetics with normal saline (NS) is a common practice to enable larger&#xD;
      volumes of LA to be given, for example, in instances where multiple nerve blocks are needed&#xD;
      to be performed for optimal pain relief while avoiding toxic doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A high sodium concentration is known to antagonize the analgesic effect of local anesthetics.&#xD;
      5% dextrose (D5W) on the other hand is painless on injection and does not cause any long-term&#xD;
      effects in animals or humans when injected around neurological tissue. In the literature,&#xD;
      only one study using dextrose 5% as diluent to produce 0.5% ropivacaine for axillary brachial&#xD;
      plexus block showed a statistically significant reduction in the onset time for sensory&#xD;
      blockade when compared with dilution with NS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 0.5% ropivacaine diluted with D5W or NS is used for ultrasound guided&#xD;
      supraclavicular brachial plexus block, and the time for complete sensory and motor blockade&#xD;
      was compared. 0.5% ropivacaine is easily diluted and is a common concentration used at our&#xD;
      centre for nerve blocks. The aim of this study is to assess if 0.5% ropivacaine diluted with&#xD;
      D5W results in a shorter onset time for sensory block which may change the current practice&#xD;
      of dilution with NS&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Patients randomly assigned to receive either 0.5% ropivacaine diluted with NS or D5W.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization followed a computer-generated randomization table and patients are blinded&#xD;
           as to their group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group allocations are concealed in a sealed opaque envelope and only known to an&#xD;
           independent anaesthesia trainee who prepares 20mls 0.5% ropivacaine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The anaesthesiologist involved in the performance of the supraclavicular brachial plexus&#xD;
           block is blinded to group allocation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All ultrasound-guided supraclavicular blocks are performed by 2 anaesthesiologists who&#xD;
           are familiar with the technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A trained anaesthesiology trainee who is blinded to group allocation evaluated sensory&#xD;
           loss and motor blockade every 5 mins after injection of local anaesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The extent of sensory loss is tested in the median, radial, ulnar, and musculocutaneous&#xD;
           nerve distributions and evaluated using a 3-point score: 2 = normal sensation, 1 =loss&#xD;
           of sensation to pinprick (ie, analgesia), or 0 = loss of sensation to light touch (ie,&#xD;
           anesthesia). The extent of motor blockade is tested in the distribution of the radial&#xD;
           (thumb abduction), ulnar (thumb adduction), musculocutaneous (flexion of the elbow in&#xD;
           supination and pronation), and median nerves (thumb opposition) and evaluated using a&#xD;
           3-point scale where 2 = normal movement, 1 = paresis, and 0 = absent movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Block success is defined as loss of sensation to pinprick (sensory score 1) in each of&#xD;
           the radial, ulnar, median, and musculocutaneous nerve distributions measured 60 mins&#xD;
           after the end of local anaesthetic injection. Patients in whom block success was not&#xD;
           achieved after 60 mins were excluded from data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the postoperative recovery period, pain (verbal response score 4 or patient&#xD;
           request for analgesic) is treated with IV tramadol 25-50 mg slow bolus with or without&#xD;
           fentanyl 25mcg boluses every 5 minutes as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When oral intake is allowed, patients will receive oral paracetamol 1g with oral&#xD;
           diclofenac 50 mg or celecoxib 200mg, if not contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The block duration is subsequently taken as time from complete analgesia to the time&#xD;
           when the patient first feels the slightest pain from the operative site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are followed up twice; once on post-operative day (POD) 1 and once between POD&#xD;
           7-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They are seen in the ward or are contacted via telephone and asked for the presence of&#xD;
           any pain, weakness, numbness, tingling, or any abnormal sensation in the operative&#xD;
           extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If indicated, they are then told to come to hospital for further evaluation and&#xD;
           management as necessary.&#xD;
