  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a brief screening and behavioral intervention for the&#xD;
      prevention of congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) that will both be acceptable to clinic staff&#xD;
      and feasible to implement as part of routine clinical prenatal care, and to test whether&#xD;
      behavioral intervention for susceptible pregnant women can lead to a behavioral change that&#xD;
      is likely to lead to decreased primary CMV infection. The study research assistants will&#xD;
      enroll pregnant women who are less than 20 weeks' gestation, either English or&#xD;
      Spanish-speaking and that do not have a primary CMV infection (never been infected or&#xD;
      previously infected). Enrollment will occur during the woman's prenatal visit.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized single-masked clinical trial of behavioral intervention versus&#xD;
      standard care of pregnant women lacking evidence of acute CMV infection that have consented&#xD;
      to be screened as part of the Maternal Fetal Medicine Units Network multi-centered randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial, in which pregnant women are screened with CMV serology for IgM, IgG, and IgG&#xD;
      avidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible pregnant women will be randomized to one of two treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control Group - no intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention Group - brief intervention and educational materials Written informed&#xD;
           consent will be obtained from patients before they can be screened for the study by CMV&#xD;
           testing (IgM, IgG, and IgG avidity) as per the protocol for screening in the MFMU study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women presenting for prenatal care no later than 20 weeks gestational age without a known&#xD;
      multifetal gestation are eligible for CMV screening Those with evidence of primary infection&#xD;
      will be offered participation in the MFMU randomized trial of CMV hyperimmune globulin to&#xD;
      prevent congenital infection. Women lacking evidence of acute infection will be eligible for&#xD;
      randomization into this study. Patients must be randomized no later than 20 weeks gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If eligible and no more than 20 weeks gestation, the patient will be randomized. If the&#xD;
      patient is randomized in the control group, she will continue her routine prenatal care&#xD;
      inclusive of the CDC brochure that she received at the time of her venipuncture for serologic&#xD;
      screening and assessment of hygiene behaviors. If the patient is randomized into the&#xD;
      intervention group, we will deliver a face-face educational intervention during her next&#xD;
      routine prenatal visit. In addition to the intervention, the patient will include educational&#xD;
      material to take home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be assessed for performance of hygiene behaviors as a baseline assessment at&#xD;
      the time of consent. A second assessment will occur at least 12 weeks after enrollment during&#xD;
      the third trimester between 28-36 weeks of gestation. The follow-up assessment will be&#xD;
      completed by a different research assistant from the unblinded educator. A Kessler 10 (K10)&#xD;
      survey will also be completed in addition to the baseline and follow-up assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up assessment will take place during the participant's third trimester between&#xD;
      28-36 weeks of gestation, depending on duration of enrollment and likelihood of early&#xD;
      delivery. The enrollment duration will vary from approximately 14-20 weeks.&#xD;
