  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well panitumumab and combination chemotherapy works in&#xD;
      treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer previously treated with combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy and bevacizumab. Monoclonal antibodies, such as panitumumab, can block tumor&#xD;
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others&#xD;
      find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and irinotecan hydrochloride, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing. Giving panitumumab and combination chemotherapy together may kill more&#xD;
      tumor cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the median progression-free survival in patients treated with leucovorin&#xD;
      calcium, fluorouracil, and irinotecan hydrochloride (FOLFIRI) and panitumumab for K-ras and&#xD;
      NRAS wild-type, metastatic colorectal carcinoma who have already progressed on FOLFIRI +&#xD;
      Bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the frequency and severity of toxicities of the regimens. II. To determine&#xD;
      overall response rate. III. To determine the median overall survival and the overall survival&#xD;
      rate at 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive panitumumab intravenously (IV) over 60-90 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV&#xD;
      over 90 minutes, fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours, and irinotecan hydrochloride IV&#xD;
      over 90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;

             radiographically documented&#xD;
&#xD;
