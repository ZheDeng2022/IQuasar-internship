        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children aged 2 years to &lt;18 years with CKD stages 3b to 5, not on dialysis (stage 3b&#xD;
             is defined as a glomerular filtration rate below 45 mL/min/1.73 mÂ²).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a documented diagnosis of hyperphosphataemia, as demonstrated by serum&#xD;
             phosphorus (P) levels above the age-related upper limit of normal (ULN) (Kidney&#xD;
             Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative [KDOQI] Clinical Practice Guidelines for Nutrition&#xD;
             in Children with CKD updated 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is on a stable P diet at baseline (as judged by the Investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria for subjects not currently treated with phosphate binders:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject, with serum P not controlled despite being on an appropriate P diet, must&#xD;
             demonstrate serum P levels &gt;1.5 standard deviation (SD) above the KDOQI 2008&#xD;
             age-related mean value at any time during the screening period. Such subjects do not&#xD;
             require wash-out and should proceed to baseline for the next visit if additional&#xD;
             screening visits are not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Baseline inclusion criteria for subjects treated with phosphate binders:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must enter the wash-out period, during which he/she must demonstrate serum&#xD;
             P levels &gt;1.5 SD above the KDOQI 2008 age-related mean value at any time during the&#xD;
             wash-out period (after stopping phosphate binders), and;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must demonstrate an increase in serum P levels by at least 10% above the&#xD;
             pre wash-out level (after stopping phosphate binders).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: should a subject fail to meet any of the above criteria, the subject is permitted to&#xD;
        be re-screened once after an interval of at least three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has been diagnosed with hypocholesterolaemia (i.e., cholesterol levels&#xD;
             below age-related normal ranges, per local practices)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has current clinically significant medical comorbidities, which may&#xD;
             substantially compromise subject safety, or expose him/her to undue risk, or interfere&#xD;
             significantly with study procedures and which, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             make the subject unsuitable for inclusion in the study (e.g., the subject currently&#xD;
             has or has had a history of seizure disorders, dysphagia, swallowing disorders,&#xD;
             predisposition to or current bowel obstruction, ileus or gastrointestinal [GI]&#xD;
             disorders such as chronic or severe constipation [as judged by the Investigator],&#xD;
             intestinal stenosis, intestinal diverticulum, sigmoid colitis, GI ulcers, current or a&#xD;
             history of GI bleeding, or major GI tract surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject cannot stop treatment (prescription or over the-counter) of any of the&#xD;
             following orally taken medications during the wash-out period: any product containing&#xD;
             calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), aluminium compounds, sevelamer, lanthanum, ketosteril&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is receiving immunosuppressant treatment for any medical condition at the&#xD;
             baseline visit or is expected to receive such treatment during the course of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is considered as unstable on his/her current treatment for CKD within one&#xD;
             month prior to screening (e.g., subjects starting treatment with vitamin D or its&#xD;
             analogues, or other agents/procedures that may influence bone mineral metabolism [i.e,&#xD;
             serum P and Ca levels]&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria for subjects treated with phosphate binders:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject was treated with a combination of two or more phosphate binders within one&#xD;
             month prior to screening&#xD;
