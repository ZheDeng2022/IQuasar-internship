  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of liver lesions causes patients acute pain during and&#xD;
      after the procedure. During the procedure patients need deep sedation and cannot be&#xD;
      collaborative. Furthermore post-operative analgesia is necessary. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate if the ultrasound-guided paravertebral block (TPVB)with a single injection can&#xD;
      provide anesthesia and post-operative analgesia in these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if single injection TPVB, ultrasound guided, ENS&#xD;
      assisted, is advantageous compared to deep sedation (DS)in patients undergoing percutaneous&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation of liver lesions with respect to post-operative analgesia (at rest&#xD;
      and in movement)and vomiting. Furthermore we collect data on operator and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study patients are randomly divided into two groups (20 patient each): TPVB and DS.&#xD;
      In TPVB group the block is performed in lateral position at level of T7 with bupivacaine&#xD;
      5mg/ml. In DS group the procedure is conducted under local and intravenous anesthesia, and a&#xD;
      post-operative analgesia is assigned. Data on patient, on procedures (duration, number and&#xD;
      position of lesions etc.), complications with the anesthesiological technique are collected.&#xD;
      The intensity of post-operative pain is assessed at 3-6-12 and 24 hours after procedure in&#xD;
      both group using VRS pain scale at rest and in movement. Any concomitant event like nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, respiratory complications etc are recorded.&#xD;
