    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the incidence of new-onset cognitive impairments and change in&#xD;
      existing impairment status between AF patients undergoing either catheter ablation or&#xD;
      remaining on anti-arrhythmic drugs (AAD) as assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: AF is mostly a disease of elderly. Up to 10% of people aged 80 years or older&#xD;
      suffer from this arrhythmia and the rate is projected to triple in the next 20 years (1).&#xD;
      Evidence is emerging that AF may increase the risk of all forms of dementia (2). Cerebral&#xD;
      hypoperfusion and the risk of cerebrovascular micro- and macro-embolism are plausible&#xD;
      explanations for the predisposition for cognitive decline in AF (1). Such insults may act&#xD;
      alone or in concert with other neuropathological changes common in the brain of older&#xD;
      individuals such as neuritic plaques or neurofibrillary tangles, in lowering cognitive&#xD;
      reserves and accelerating the onset of dementia (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior studies on AF and dementia have yielded conflicting results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An earlier study provided evidence supporting an association between AF and increased&#xD;
      incidence of dementia in patients with stroke (4). In a prospective study conducted on&#xD;
      participants of ONTARGET and TRANSCEND trials, it was revealed that cognitive and functional&#xD;
      decline are important consequences of atrial fibrillation, even in the absence of overt&#xD;
      stroke (5). Another independent study, observed similar results for risk of dementia in AF in&#xD;
      participants with and without clinically recognized stroke during follow-up (3). Evidences&#xD;
      from a previous research demonstrated not only a significant association of AF with all forms&#xD;
      of dementia including Alzheimer's disease, but also higher mortality rate in patients with&#xD;
      coexistent dementia and AF (2). On the contrary, some studies did not find any significant&#xD;
      risk-association between AF and dementia (6-8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These contradictory results compel the necessity for a prospective study on a large&#xD;
      population to obtain a clear understanding of the association between AF and cognitive&#xD;
      impairment. The potential association between the two conditions can have a very important&#xD;
      clinical implication; if there were a causal relationship between AF and dementia then the&#xD;
      different therapeutic strategies of AF may have differing influence on dementia risk (3).&#xD;
      Thus, this knowledge would facilitate in personalizing treatment approaches for individuals&#xD;
      with AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-arrhythmic drugs are considered as the first line of therapy in AF and catheter ablation&#xD;
      is widely-recognized as the best option in drug-refractory cases. Recent published data&#xD;
      suggested that effective rhythm-control by catheter ablation reverses the risk of dementia in&#xD;
      AF (9). However, it was an epidemiologic study from a health-care database where ICD codes&#xD;
      were used to identify clinical dementia. Therefore, mischaracterization of the dementia&#xD;
      subtypes was a major possibility in their study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      None of the other currently ongoing studies or registries on AF ablation in US includes&#xD;
      dementia as one of the outcomes to be assessed. Therefore, our study will be the first to&#xD;
      examine the benefit of successful catheter ablation on cognitive function in AF patients by&#xD;
      directly assessing cognition using standardized instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several standardized screening tools available to assess cognitive status, namely&#xD;
      Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) and&#xD;
      Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA). All have their strengths and limitations, but MoCA is&#xD;
      considered the most efficient because of its cross-cultural applicability and its higher&#xD;
      sensitivity for detecting mild cognitive impairments. In our study, MoCA would be used to&#xD;
      evaluate cognitive status in AF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides MoCA, the following questionnaires will be used to assess other risk-factors for&#xD;
      cognitive impairment and quality of life in AF patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hospital anxiety and Depression scale (HAD): to evaluate anxiety and depression&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Lawton's Instrumental&#xD;
           Activities Of Daily Living Scale (IADL): to assess independent living skills&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support by Zimet et al: to appraise&#xD;
           perception of social-support in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ): to obtain internationally&#xD;
           comparable data on health-related physical activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality-of-Life (AFEQT) questionnaire: to assess the&#xD;
           AF-specific changes in QoL before and after ablation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the number of patients showing improvement or no-worsening in cognitive status at&#xD;
      2 years follow-up after catheter ablation or after the beginning of drug-therapy in&#xD;
      non-ablation group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study the interaction between depression, social support and cognitive status&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the impact of social supports on the trajectory of dementia&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine the correlation between physical activity and cognitive impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess the impact of arrhythmia recurrence on dementia across the control and the study&#xD;
           group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective multicenter study will enroll 888 consecutive AF patients at different&#xD;
      centers in US, Asia and Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting patients will perform the MoCA evaluation. Patients with a score &lt; 17 will be&#xD;
      deemed a screen failure. Qualifying patients will be evaluated and the appropriate treatment&#xD;
      strategy for managing arrhythmia will be independently determined by the treating physician.&#xD;
      Patients undergoing a clinically indicated catheter ablation for AF will be assigned to the&#xD;
      Ablation group and those determined to stay on AAD will form the AAD group. Based on&#xD;
      physician decision, left atrial appendage occlusion or exclusion procedures may be performed&#xD;
      for reducing the thromboembolic risk. The AAD group will continue on AADs as prescribed in&#xD;
      accordance with standard of care at the discretion of the physician.&#xD;
