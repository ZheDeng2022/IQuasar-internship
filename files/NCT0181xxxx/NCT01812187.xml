      The purpose of this study is to increase access for rural Veterans to evidence-based,&#xD;
      person-centered, individually tailored treatment for alcohol use problems. The primary aim is&#xD;
      to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of using mobile technology deliver treatment&#xD;
      for alcohol use disorder. A mobile application will be used replacing the usual setting of&#xD;
      clinical visits that accompanies standard face-to-face CBT therapy. The application will be&#xD;
      loaded onto an iPod, which will be distributed to each participant that has been found to be&#xD;
      eligible to participate.&#xD;

      Many Veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan experience problems with drinking. There&#xD;
      are treatments for alcohol use disorders that can be very helpful, but sometimes it can be&#xD;
      hard for Veterans to find or participate in the treatments. This can be because of the amount&#xD;
      of time the treatments take and the long distance to places where substance abuse treatments&#xD;
      are offered. For Veterans who live in rural areas, these types of issues can pose even bigger&#xD;
      problems. To address these issues, new types of treatments and ways of delivering care are&#xD;
      being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have developed a mobile application that will be accessed through the use of a mobile&#xD;
      device such as an ipod. The application will contain an application dedicated to the&#xD;
      treatment of substance abuse disorders. This application will provide the coping skills and&#xD;
      educational information to aide in helping with problems associated with drinking alcohol.&#xD;
