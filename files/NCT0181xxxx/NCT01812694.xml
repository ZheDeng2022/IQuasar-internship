      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - LIFE-Moms (Lifestyle Interventions for Expectant Moms) is a national project that is&#xD;
      studying pregnant women who are overweight or obese. It is looking at ways they can manage&#xD;
      their weight gain in pregnancy and how this may affect them and their babies health at birth&#xD;
      and through the first year. Researchers want to recruit pregnant women who are being treated&#xD;
      at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center. They will participate in a two-part study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study pregnant women who are in the LIFE-Moms project at the Phoenix Indian Medical&#xD;
      Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant women at least 18 years of age who are overweight or obese.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be receiving care at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be having only one child in their pregnancy (no twins or other&#xD;
           multiple births).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will have two parts. The first part will have three visits to obtain data&#xD;
           about health early in pregnancy. It will also let participants and researchers find out&#xD;
           if the participants are eligible and should continue in the second part of the study. In&#xD;
           the second part, participants will be monitored throughout their pregnancy and during&#xD;
           the first year after the baby s birth to test the effects of a lifestyle intervention to&#xD;
           control weight gain during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the Part 1 study visits, participants will have a physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
           They will provide blood, urine, hair, and other samples to be examined for possible&#xD;
           genetic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the Part 2 study visits, participants will be placed in one of two treatment groups.&#xD;
           Each group will receive the same prenatal and postnatal care that they would get if they&#xD;
           did not join the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first group will have a lifestyle intervention program. They will spend about 2&#xD;
           hours every week with other members of their group to learn diet and activity behaviors&#xD;
           that may help with their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second group will have an enhanced care program. They will be given additional&#xD;
           information about health and pregnancy and be invited to attend three classes to learn&#xD;
           about staying healthy during pregnancy.&#xD;

      LIFE-Moms (Phoenix center) is a randomized clinical trial in overweight and obese pregnant&#xD;
      women that will test the effects of an intensive lifestyle intervention on gestational weight&#xD;
      gain, control of maternal hyperglycemia, and post-partum return to pre-pregnancy weight. The&#xD;
      Phoenix center will be conducted in collaboration between the Phoenix Indian Medical Center&#xD;
      (PIMC) nurse midwifery and obstetrics services and the National Institute of Diabetes and&#xD;
      Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). It is part of the LIFE-Moms Consortium consisting of&#xD;
      six other clinical centers that will follow similar protocols and a research coordination&#xD;
      unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      American Indians are at high risk for developing obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)&#xD;
      and its complications. A major factor responsible for this finding is exposure of the fetus&#xD;
      in the womb to its mother s diabetes, which increases the risk of diabetes in the offspring&#xD;
      particularly during childhood and adolescence. This study is designed to evaluate the effects&#xD;
      of an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) in at least 200 adult (age greater than or equal&#xD;
      to 18 years) pregnant women who are eligible for prenatal care at PIMC. Interventions will be&#xD;
      provided to overweight and obese pregnant women who do not have pregestational diabetes but&#xD;
      may have (GDM), i.e., diabetes that first develops or is first recognized in pregnancy, or&#xD;
      are at high risk of developing GDM. The lifestyle intervention will be patterned after the&#xD;
      Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) that prevented or delayed the onset of diabetes in non&#xD;
      pregnant adults; the interventions will be modified to be appropriate in pregnancy. For women&#xD;
      who develop diabetes, interventions will include coaching to optimize glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups, assigned with equal&#xD;
      probability: an enhanced standard of care group or an intensive lifestyle intervention group&#xD;
      (ILI). Following delivery, all the mothers and infants will be treated in the same way&#xD;
      regardless of their initial treatment group. For example, all mothers will be encouraged to&#xD;
      breast feed and follow other recommended practices for the health of themselves and their&#xD;
      babies. After delivery the mother will be invited to bring the infant to the research clinic&#xD;
      five times during the first 6 months and again at 1 year of age. These follow up visits for&#xD;
      the infant are timed 1) to understand the patterns of change in neonatal body composition and&#xD;
      2) to coincide, when possible, with well-child pediatric visits. We will also question the&#xD;
      mothers and abstract data from the medical record regarding the child s feeding practice,&#xD;
      overall health, hospitalizations, immunizations, and medicine use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be assessed on the same schedule for both intervention groups. Prenatal&#xD;
      measurements include demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical data. The latter will focus&#xD;
      on periodic measures related to blood glucose (sugar), including glucose tolerance tests.&#xD;
      Diet and physical activity will be assessed by questionnaires and objective activity&#xD;
      monitors. Many of these tests will be repeated in the mother at 6-12 weeks and 12 months&#xD;
      post-partum. Infant data at or shortly after birth and at months 1 through 6 and 12 will&#xD;
      include weight, length, head size, estimated body fat, feeding practices, and medical record&#xD;
      abstraction.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adult pregnant women of any race or ethnicity may participate if they meet each of the&#xD;
        following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. At least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Receive prenatal care at the nurse midwifery/obstetrics service of PIMC and plan to&#xD;
             continue receiving such care throughout the pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Able to have an OGTT prior to 16 weeks gestation. Hyperemesis can preclude some&#xD;
             pregnant women from successfully completing the OGTT; these women will not be excluded&#xD;
             if the fasting blood samples can be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Able to have an ultrasound examination to estimate fetal age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Complete initial run-in screening visits to determine whether the woman can manage the&#xD;
             tasks required of participation in an intensive intervention if randomized to the&#xD;
             intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Able to commit the time required for the interventions and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Singleton viable pregnancy. A twin pregnancy reduced to singleton before 14(0) weeks&#xD;
             by project gestational age is acceptable. An ultrasound must be conducted before&#xD;
             randomization that shows a fetal heartbeat; there should be no evidence of more than&#xD;
             one fetus on the most recent pre-randomization ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Gestational age at randomization no earlier than 9 weeks 0 days and no later than&#xD;
             15(6) weeks based on an algorithm that compares the LMP date and data from the&#xD;
             earliest ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Body mass index greater than or equal to 25 kilogram / square meter based on first&#xD;
             trimester measured weight and on measured height. The earliest weight measurement&#xD;
             before randomization, measured specifically for the study, will be used. Reported&#xD;
             pre-pregnancy weight will not be used to determine eligibility because of the&#xD;
             potential for inaccuracy. If the earliest weight measurement is conducted at 14(0) to&#xD;
             14(6) weeks or 15(0) to 15(6) weeks, 1 pound or 2 pounds will be subtracted from the&#xD;
             measured weight, respectively, to adjust to a first trimester weight. This weight and&#xD;
             the resultant BMI are defined as the baseline weight and BMI, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
             EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diagnosis of diabetes prior to pregnancy or any of the following results of the&#xD;
                  oral glucose tolerance test at visit #1 that suggest diabetes prior to pregnancy:&#xD;
                  HbA1c greater than or equal 6.5 %, FPG greater than or equal 126 milligrams per&#xD;
                  deciliter, or 2-hour post-load plasma glucose greater than or equal 200&#xD;
                  milligrams per deciliter (75 grams oral glucose tolerance test). All potential&#xD;
                  participants will have HbA1c and a 75 grams oral glucose tolerance test performed&#xD;
                  prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women who meet the above criteria for diagnosed or presumed diabetes prior to&#xD;
                  pregnancy will be excluded. Others who meet criteria for GDM will be eligible.&#xD;
                  Criteria for GDM diagnosis will be based on ADA 2012 criteria (at least one of&#xD;
                  FPG greater than or equal to 92 milligrams per deciliter, 1 hour PG greater than&#xD;
                  or equal 180 milligrams per deciliter, or 2 hour PG greater than or equal to 153&#xD;
