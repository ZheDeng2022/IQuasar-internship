  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis - MS - affects 1.3m people worldwide, costing the European Union economy&#xD;
      €9 billion/year, through both direct and indirect consequences of progressive disability.&#xD;
      Despite the usual relapsing-remitting presentation, over 80% of patients develop progressive&#xD;
      disability; 40% require a wheelchair within 10 years of diagnosis. At present, there are no&#xD;
      treatments that reverse, halt or even slow progressive disability in MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recently completed one of the first feasibility/safety trials in the world&#xD;
      of reparative bone marrow cell therapy in 6 patients with longstanding MS&#xD;
      (www.nature.com/clpt/journal/v87/n6/full/clpt201044a.html). Safety was confirmed, and&#xD;
      intensive repeated tests on the patients measuring nerve conduction in various pathways in&#xD;
      the brain and in the spinal cord showed statistically significant improvements at 12 months&#xD;
      in every patient. While highly preliminary and involving only a very small number of&#xD;
      patients, these results at least raise the possibility of a significant (though very partial)&#xD;
      underlying repair effect within the damaged nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe this urgently requires further testing - both to accelerate benefit&#xD;
      for patients, and to begin improving therapeutic efficacy. The investigators therefore&#xD;
      propose a programme of translational and clinical stem cell research, aiming (1) to continue&#xD;
      translation with a phase two controlled trial of bone marrow cells in patients with&#xD;
      longstanding MS; and (2) to explore in parallel the potential mechanisms of action, by&#xD;
      studying bone marrow cells from treated patients and control subjects, aiming to establish&#xD;
      which of the various relevant bone marrow subpopulations contribute to efficacy, and which&#xD;
      particular reparative mechanism(s) are important. The investigators hope these studies will&#xD;
      not only confirm the therapeutic benefit of this approach, but also provide the basis for&#xD;
      improving the magnitude and impact of this novel and exciting treatment modality.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine whether autologous bone marrow (BM) (ie taken from the&#xD;
      patients themselves rather than from a BM donor) cell therapy is truly beneficial in chronic&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis - as our small, uncontrolled phase 1 trial suggested&#xD;
      (www.nature.com/clpt/journal/v87/n6/full/clpt201044a.html).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also aim to answer the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do BM mesenchymal stem cells from patients with MS differ in the range or extent of&#xD;
           reparative and neuroprotective properties from those from control individuals?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What reparative and neuroprotective properties do BM stem cell subpopulations other than&#xD;
           mesenchymal stem cells possess, and do these differ between MS patients and controls?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Can BM stem cell subpopulations be isolated from blood samples from MS patients&#xD;
           following treatment, and, if so, for how long?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow contains stem cells capable of replacing all the cells in the blood. Recently,&#xD;
      bone marrow has been found to contain cells capable of replacing cells in tissues and organs&#xD;
      other than blood. In addition, infusion of bone marrow-derived cells has been shown to have&#xD;
      significant effects on the immune system and to promote the survival of central nervous&#xD;
      system cells under toxic conditions. These properties are of considerable interest to those&#xD;
      working to develop cell-based therapies for neurodegenerative disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential of such cells to aid repair in multiple sclerosis (MS) has been examined in&#xD;
      experimental models of MS. Myelin is the substance that insulates neurons within the central&#xD;
      nervous system and is attacked in MS. Infusion of adult bone marrow cells into a vein aids&#xD;
      myelin repair (remyelination) in these models of MS. Recently, the investigators performed a&#xD;
      small pilot study to examine the effects of harvesting bone marrow from MS patients and&#xD;
      infusing this back into each patient's vein. This was well tolerated and no significant&#xD;
      adverse events were encountered. Electrophysiological studies appeared to show some&#xD;
      improvement but, given the small numbers of participants in the phase 1 trial, no definitive&#xD;
      conclusion can be made regarding this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study seeks to address the question of whether genuine improvements in&#xD;
      neurophysiological tests are seen in MS patients with progressive disease following infusion&#xD;
      of bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, stepped wedge design will be&#xD;
      employed at a single centre (Bristol, UK). Eighty patients with progressive MS will be&#xD;
      recruited; 60 will have secondary progressive disease (SPMS) but a subset (n=20) will have&#xD;
      primary progressive disease (PPMS). Participants will be randomised to either early&#xD;
      (immediate) or late (1 year) intravenous infusion of autologous, unfractionated bone marrow.&#xD;
      The placebo intervention is infusion of autologous blood. The primary outcome measure is&#xD;
      global evoked potential derived from multimodal evoked potentials. Secondary outcome measures&#xD;
      include adverse event reporting, clinical (EDSS and MSFC) and self-assessment (MSIS-29)&#xD;
      rating scales, optical coherence tomography (OCT) as well as brain and spine MRI.&#xD;
      Participants will be followed up for a further year following the final intervention.&#xD;
      Outcomes will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis.&#xD;
