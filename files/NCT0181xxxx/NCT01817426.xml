      The purpose of this study is to determine whether infliximab can favourably and safely be&#xD;
      discontinued in patients with Crohn's disease in sustained complete clinical, biochemical,&#xD;
      and endoscopic remission on infliximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further to examine the clinical utility of measuring levels/activity of infliximab and&#xD;
      activity of anti-infliximab Ab in patients in sustained complete remission, in order to&#xD;
      investigate whether pharmacoimmunological data can predict the clinical outcome and&#xD;
      rationalize therapeutic management of these patients with respect to continuation or&#xD;
      discontinuation of infliximab therapy. Additional, to investigate the optimal time-point, out&#xD;
      of three, to measure this activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent guidelines for the management of Crohn's disease conclude that currently available&#xD;
      data are insufficient to make firm recommendations on when and in whom to stop TNF-α antibody&#xD;
      (TNF-α Ab) treatment after having obtained clinical remission. Further, the term &quot;remission&quot;&#xD;
      is not well uniformly defined and may incorporate one or more features such as clinical&#xD;
      remission, as assessed by CDAI, biochemical remission, endoscopical remission etc. The&#xD;
      recently published prospective STORI study of 115 patients with luminal Crohn's disease&#xD;
      reported that 56% of patients with Crohn's disease who had discontinued infliximab (IFX)&#xD;
      while in clinical remission, maintained remission one year after discontinuation of therapy.&#xD;
      Predictors of relapse included certain clinical features as well as objective biochemical and&#xD;
      endoscopical markers of disease activity. Consistent with these data, we have recently&#xD;
      reported that 61% of our own patients with Crohn's disease, who discontinued IFX while in&#xD;
      complete clinical, steroid free IFX induced remission, maintained remission after one year;&#xD;
      and half the patients were still in remission after nearly two years (median 680 days&#xD;
      [412-948]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective randomized study of patients with Crohn's disease is necessary to confirm and&#xD;
      extend the limited findings above, and assess whether IFX can be safely discontinued in a&#xD;
      selected subgroup of patients with complete clinical, biochemical, and endoscopical&#xD;
      remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, Danish&#xD;
      multi-center study with estimated seven Danish participating centers. Patients and treating&#xD;
      physicians are blinded for the type of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients with luminal Crohn's disease in sustained complete remission on&#xD;
      IFX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment: Patients are randomized to either continue IFX treatment at an unchanged&#xD;
      dosage and frequency, or alternatively to receive matching placebo. All patients will be&#xD;
      graded for disease activity (Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), biochemical parameters,&#xD;
      endoscopy, and/or MRI). Following screening and inclusion patients are seen after four weeks,&#xD;
      and then every eight weeks. Endpoints are assessed at 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will, as explorative analyses, examine the clinical utility of measuring IFX&#xD;
      levels and antibodies against IFX in patients with complete remission, in order to&#xD;
      investigate whether pharmacoimmunological data can predict the clinical outcome and&#xD;
      rationalize therapeutic management of these patients with respect to continuation or&#xD;
      discontinuation of IFX therapy. Additional, investigators will investigate the optimal&#xD;
      time-point out of three to measure this activity. Patients will on the day of infusion have&#xD;
      three blood samples drawn: one just before infusion (trough), one right after the infusion&#xD;
      (obtained from the other arm)(peak) and one an hour after infusion (C1). Samples will be&#xD;
      measured by common solid - and fluid phase assays for this purpose, e.g. Reporter Gene Assay&#xD;
      (RGA).&#xD;

             not accepted within the last year. The treatment interval in the last three months has&#xD;
             to be of 6-10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete remission defined as:&#xD;

             dosage and frequency must have been stable three months prior to inclusion and must&#xD;
             remain stable throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Initial indication for IFX being predominantly fistulizing perianal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any contraindications for continuing IFX treatment, including prior acute or delayed&#xD;
             infusion reaction to a TNF- inhibiting agent, any active infection requiring&#xD;
             parenteral or oral antibiotic treatment, known infection with tuberculosis, human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition including physician finds incompatible with participation in the study&#xD;
             or the patient being unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements.&#xD;
