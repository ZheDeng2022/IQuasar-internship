  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer remains a major health issue and a leading cause of cancer death worldwide,&#xD;
      although the prevalence and mortality of the disease have gradually decreased. The&#xD;
      investigators have very few options for patients with advanced disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer (ToGA) trial, a pivotal randomized clinical trial of&#xD;
      patients with HER-2 positive advanced, mostly metastatic, gastric cancer, proved the efficacy&#xD;
      of trastuzumab (anti-Her 2 therapy) in combination with chemotherapy. The median overall&#xD;
      survival was significantly prolonged in the trastuzumab-containing arm (13.8 vs. 11.1 months;&#xD;
      HR 0.74; p=0.0046) without unexpected toxicity including cardiac events. The survival benefit&#xD;
      was most pronounced in the subgroup of high HER-2/neu protein overexpression (median overall&#xD;
      survival of 16 months). Only 20% of the patients screened and subsequently enrolled for this&#xD;
      study were found to be HER2-positive when utilizing both immunohistochemistry and FISH. Her2&#xD;
      testing is recommended for all patients with advanced gastric cancers and type III&#xD;
      oesophageal adenocarcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on Indian patients is lacking. Hence, the investigators plan to test for Her 2 in 100&#xD;
      patients with IHC and FISH in 2+ and 3+ patients.&#xD;

      1. Study Objective/ Aims Aim: - Rate of Her 2 positivity in 100 consecutive gastric cancer&#xD;
           patients Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
           Test for Her 2 in 100 consecutive gastric cancer patients Immuno-histochemistry will be&#xD;
           done in all patients. Patients with 2 and 3+ IHC will also have FISH done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Design&amp; Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will have the Her2 tested in 100 consecutive gastric cancer samples by&#xD;
           immunohistochemistry and patients with 2+ and 3+ result will also have FISH done. This&#xD;
           will not affect patient management&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Overview of Data collection Dr.Bhawna Sirohi the principal investigators will maintain&#xD;
           and supervise data collection and maintaining records. The patient will be&#xD;
           de-identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Selection of Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 consecutive patients with gastric cancer who have a pathology specimen at TMH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If histopathology blocks were not available&#xD;
&#xD;
      5) Sample size 100 to be enrolled. Patient consent waiver applied for as this does not affect&#xD;
      patient care 6) Statistical Analysis It is an Observational study so Results will be given as&#xD;
      %age of total population.&#xD;
