      The Primary Objectives of this study are to assess the long-term efficacy of treatment with&#xD;
      colestilan (MCI-196) (including combination therapy) and to assess the long-term safety of&#xD;
      treatment with colestilan (MCI-196) (including combination therapy).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject and/or parent(s)/guardian(s) must be capable of providing informed&#xD;
             consent, and assent when applicable, in agreement with regional requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has completed either of the short-term studies, MCI-196-E14 or MCI-196-E16&#xD;
&#xD;
        or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has been withdrawn from MCI-196-E14, but is eligible to enter this study&#xD;
             according to the following rules, as defined in MCI-196-E14:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hyperphosphataemia: Subjects who experienced hyperphosphataemia, defined as any&#xD;
                  increase in serum phosphorus [P] levels above the age-related upper limit of&#xD;
                  normal(ULN) on two consecutive occasions, and was withdrawn by the Investigator&#xD;
                  in order to proceed to this study, where flexible dosing with colestilan&#xD;
                  (MCI-196) is available. Subjects withdrawn from MCI-196-E14 due to&#xD;
                  hyperphosphataemia may only enter this study after Week 6 of the short-term&#xD;
                  study, following two consecutive out-of-range P values (one obtained at Week 3&#xD;
                  and one obtained at Week 6). After Week 6, subjects meeting the above criteria&#xD;
                  may enter this study at any time (the two consecutive out-of-range P values&#xD;
                  having been obtained any time after Week 6 from a scheduled or unscheduled&#xD;
                  visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hypercalcaemia: Subjects treated with CBPB and experiencing hypercalcaemia may be&#xD;
                  withdrawn from the short-term study at the discretion of the Investigator in&#xD;
                  order to proceed to this study at any time, where flexible dosing with colestilan&#xD;
                  (MCI-196) is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has current clinically significant medical co-morbidities, which may&#xD;
             substantially compromise subject safety, or expose them to undue risk, or interfere&#xD;
             significantly with study procedures and which, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             make the subject unsuitable for inclusion in the study (e.g., the subject currently&#xD;
             has or has had a history of seizure disorders, dysphagia, swallowing disorders,&#xD;
             predisposition to or current bowel obstruction, ileus or severe gastrointestinal [GI]&#xD;
             disorders such as chronic or severe constipation [as judged by the Investigator],&#xD;
             intestinal stenosis, intestinal diverticulum, sigmoid colitis, GI ulcers, current or a&#xD;
             history of GI bleeding, or major GI tract surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is expected to receive immunosuppressant treatment during the course of&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is considered unstable on his/her current treatment for CKD within one&#xD;
             month prior to enrolment (e.g., subjects starting treatment with vitamin D or its&#xD;
             analogues, or other agents/procedures that may influence bone mineral metabolism&#xD;
             [i.e., serum P and calcium (Ca) levels]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is considered to be non-compliant with study procedures in the opinion of&#xD;
             the Investigator.&#xD;
