  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 20 subjects will be enrolled. Enrolled subjects will receive one of three study&#xD;
      treatments in the abdominal region: Ultherapy® only, Ultherapy® and CO2 laser treatment, or&#xD;
      CO2 laser treatment only. Follow-up visit will occur at 14, 90 and 180 days post-treatment.&#xD;
      Study images will be obtained pre-treatment, approximately 30 minutes post-treatment, and at&#xD;
      each follow-up visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, pilot clinical trial to evaluate the use&#xD;
      of the Ulthera® System in combination with the 70W Alma Pixel CO2 laser for efficacious&#xD;
      results in the treatment of abdominal striae rubra and striae alba. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of three treatment groups. Study personnel conducting efficacy measures&#xD;
      will be blinded to the assigned treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes from baseline in overall skin texture and appearance of abdominal striae will be&#xD;
      assessed at study follow-up visits. 2D images, 3D images and patient satisfaction&#xD;
      questionnaires will be obtained.&#xD;
