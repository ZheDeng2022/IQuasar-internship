      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I Proof of concept: treatment with smaller doses of elemental calcium from ACC compared&#xD;
      to CCS can maintain target serum calcium (corrected for albumin) values (7.0-10.0 mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II To test the hypothesis that treatment with smaller doses of elemental calcium from&#xD;
      ACC compared to CCS can maintain target serum calcium (corrected for albumin) values&#xD;
      (7.0-10.0 mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ACC dose selection - to confirm the conversion factor of ACC from CCS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effect of food on ACC absorption&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the hypothesis that treatment with smaller doses of elemental calcium from ACC&#xD;
           compared to CCS will not cause an increase in hypercalciuria in patients with&#xD;
           hypoparathyroidism&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the hypothesis that smaller doses of elemental calcium from ACC can reduce the&#xD;
           side effects related with high calcium consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amorphical has a strong basis to believe that the ACC product is better absorbed compared to&#xD;
      the commercially available CCS products and therefore, can maintain desirable target albumin&#xD;
      corrected calcium values in serum (CA) with smaller doses of elemental calcium from ACC. As&#xD;
      results, the burden of taking high doses of calcium supplementation along with the side&#xD;
      effects of the standard therapy (gastrointestinal discomfort and hypercalciuria) will be&#xD;
      reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing serum CA and urine calcium values in subjects with hypoparathyroidism may provide a&#xD;
      straightforward method to test this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to be conducted with extra precaution in order to avoid disturbing the&#xD;
      fragile balance between CA levels in serum and calcium levels urine. The crossover design of&#xD;
      phase II of the study allows a more accurate and reliable comparison of results attributable&#xD;
      to the specific treatment within the same individual. In addition, the subjects will continue&#xD;
      consuming all their routine medication throughout the trial. The subjects in the control arm&#xD;
      will consume their routine calcium supplement doses thus, will be treated with a standard of&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects will be treated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I Ten (10) subjects previously diagnosed and chronically treated for primary&#xD;
      hypoparathyroidism will be enrolled. The daily CCS intake will be gradually replaced by&#xD;
      reduced amount of elemental calcium from ACC. Five (5) subjects will consume the ACC before&#xD;
      having a meal and the other five (5) subjects will consume the ACC after having a meal. The&#xD;
      safety and the efficacy of the treatment will be closely monitored throughout this phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The absorption of ACC will be evaluated using weekly serum calcium corrected for albumin (CA)&#xD;
      value tests. Excretion of calcium in urine will be tested at screening and at the end of&#xD;
      phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I-Day -21 (+/-17) Screening: Subjects with a diagnosed primary hypoparathyroidism (see&#xD;
      section 4.1 for definitions), and who are treated with calcium and vitamin D supplementation&#xD;
      at least 1 year prior to the beginning of the study and are without major renal or hepatic&#xD;
      disease, will be invited to the Clinical Research Center. At the clinic, subjects will be&#xD;
      interviewed, their medical history and their current medication will be documented and they&#xD;
      will sign an informed consent form (ICF). Subjects will be referred to perform blood tests&#xD;
      for serum calcium, P, creatinine and albumin levels. Calculation of albumin corrected calcium&#xD;
      (CA) will be performed. Subjects will be instructed to perform 24 hour urine collection for&#xD;
      Ca, P and creatinine. Subjects will be asked to fill out a food and medication diary for 3&#xD;
      consecutive days to evaluate their daily dietary calcium intake. Women of childbearing age&#xD;
      will undergo a urine pregnancy test. Eligible subjects, complying with all inclusion criteria&#xD;
      and having none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be informed by phone or on site whether they are eligible to enter the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I-Day 0: Eligible subjects will arrive at the Clinical Research Center where they will be&#xD;
      asked about any changes in their medical condition since their last visit. Blood tests will&#xD;
      be performed to define serum calcium, P and albumin baseline values. Calculation CA at&#xD;
      baseline will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a pack of ACC tablets, each tablet containing 50, 100 or 200 mg&#xD;
      elemental calcium (according to the daily total amount of calcium supplementation, 14 day&#xD;
      supply + 5 spare tablets). The replacement of CCS with ACC will be calculated according to&#xD;
      the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NTDC = ITDC - [0.1×ITDC (mg CCS)] + [0.05×ITDC (mg ACC)]&#xD;
&#xD;
      *ITDC - Initial total daily calcium intake (mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
      **NTDC - New total daily calcium intake (mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
      10% (in mg) out of the initial total daily intake of elemental calcium will be replaced by 5%&#xD;
      of elemental calcium from ACC (in mg, calculated out of the initial total daily intake). The&#xD;
      daily intake of vitamin D will remain the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculation for the number of tablets per day will be performed specifically for each&#xD;
      subject (according to the daily dosage of calcium supplementation) by the doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed to take XXX ACC tablets a day, according to their individual&#xD;
      calculated NTDC:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Five subjects will be instructed to take XXX tablets in the morning after a meal, XXX in&#xD;
           midday after a meal and XXX in the evening after a meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Five subjects will be instructed to take XXX tablets in the morning before having a&#xD;
           meal, XXX in midday before having a meal and XXX in the evening before having a meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed to continue their routine medications consumption during the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I-Day 3 (±1): Subjects will arrive at the Clinical Research Center and their serum calcium, P&#xD;
      and albumin levels will be tested. Calculation of CA will be performed to exclude&#xD;
      hypocalcaemia (Ca&lt;7.0 mg/dL). If CA values are within the desired target range (7.0-10.0&#xD;
      mg/dl), subjects will continue to take the calcium doses that were instructed on I-day 0. If&#xD;
      CA values are below 7.0 mg/dl or above 10.0 mg/dl, changes to the calcium intake will be&#xD;
      made, according to the doctor's decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I-Day 7 (±1): Subjects will arrive at the Clinical Research Center and their serum calcium, P&#xD;
      and albumin levels will be tested. Calculation of CA will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conversion factor 0.5:&#xD;
&#xD;
           If CA = baseline, then 20% (in mg, calculated out of the initial total daily intake) of&#xD;
           elemental calcium will be replaced by 10% of elemental calcium from ACC (in mg,&#xD;
           calculated out of the initial total daily intake).&#xD;
&#xD;
           NTDC = ITDC - [0.2×ITDC (mg CCS)] + [0.1×ITDC (mg ACC)]&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conversion factor 0.75:&#xD;
&#xD;
           If CA &lt; baseline, then 10% (in mg, calculated out of the initial total daily intake) of&#xD;
           elemental calcium will be replaced by 7.5% of elemental calcium from ACC (in mg,&#xD;
           calculated out of the initial total daily intake).&#xD;
&#xD;
           NTDC = ITDC - [0.1×ITDC (mg CCS)] + [0.075×ITDC (mg ACC)] CA &lt;7.00 mg/dl will enforce&#xD;
           end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Conversion factor 0.25:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If CA &gt; baseline, then 10% (in mg, calculated out of the initial total daily intake) of&#xD;
      elemental calcium will be replaced by 2.5% of elemental calcium from ACC (in mg, calculated&#xD;
      out of the initial total daily intake).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NTDC = ITDC - [0.1×ITDC (mg CCS)] + [0.025×ITDC (mg ACC)] Subjects will be asked about any&#xD;
      side effects or AEs that may have occurred and changes in concomitant medications since their&#xD;
      last visit. Subjects will be asked about symptoms and signs related with a change in serum&#xD;
      calcium levels (tetany, facial grimacing, paresthesias, muscle aches, arrhythmia,&#xD;
      depression). Subjects will receive instructions regarding the new doses of ACC and will be&#xD;
      reminded to take XXX tablets a day (according to their individual calculated NTDC), XXX in&#xD;
      the morning, XXX in midday and XXX in the evening, before or after a meal (based on their&#xD;
      initial assignment). Subjects will be reminded to continue their routine medications&#xD;
      consumption during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I-Day 10 (±1): Subjects will arrive at the Clinical Research Center and their serum calcium,&#xD;
      P and albumin levels will be tested. Calculation of CA will be performed to exclude&#xD;
      hypocalcaemia (Ca&lt;7.0 mg/dL). If CA levels are within the desired target range (7.0-10.0&#xD;
      mg/dl), subjects will continue to take the calcium doses that were instructed on I-day 7. If&#xD;
      CA levels are below 7.0 mg/dl or above 10.0 mg/dl, changes to the calcium intake will be&#xD;
      made, according to the doctor's decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I-Day 14 (±1): Subjects will arrive at the Clinical Research Center and their serum calcium,&#xD;
      P and albumin levels will be tested. Calculation of CA will be performed to exclude&#xD;
      hypocalcaemia (Ca&lt;7.0 mg/dL). If none of the conversion formulas (a-c, I-Day 7) resulted in&#xD;
      serum calcium values within the desired target range (7.0-10.0 mg/dL), the study will be&#xD;
      terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked about any side effects or AEs that may have occurred and changes in&#xD;
      concomitant medications since their last visit. Subjects will be asked about symptoms and&#xD;
      signs related with a change in serum calcium levels (tetany, facial grimacing, paresthesias,&#xD;
      muscle aches, arrhythmia, depression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      50% of the initial daily supplementation of CCS will be replaced by ACC based on the&#xD;
      conversion factor found in I-day 7 (formulas a-c):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conversion factor 0.5: 50% (in mg, calculated out of the initial total daily intake) of&#xD;
           elemental calcium will be replaced by 25% of elemental calcium from ACC (in mg,&#xD;
           calculated out of the initial total daily intake).&#xD;
&#xD;
           NTDC = ITDC - [0.5×ITDC (mg CCS)] + [0.25×ITDC (mg ACC)]&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conversion factor 0.75: 50% (in mg, calculated out of the initial total daily intake) of&#xD;
           elemental calcium will be replaced by 37.5% of elemental calcium from ACC (in mg,&#xD;
           calculated out of the initial total daily intake).&#xD;
&#xD;
           NTDC = ITDC - [0.5×ITDC (mg CCS)] + [0.375×ITDC (mg ACC)]&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Conversion factor 0.25: 50% (in mg, calculated out of the initial total daily intake) of&#xD;
           elemental calcium will be replaced by 12.5% of elemental calcium from ACC (in mg,&#xD;
           calculated out of the initial total daily intake).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NTDC = ITDC - [0.5×ITDC (mg CCS)] + [0.125×ITDC (mg ACC)] Subjects will receive a pack of ACC&#xD;
      tablets, each tablet containing 50, 100 or 200 mg elemental calcium (according to their&#xD;
      individual calculated NTDC, 14 day supply + 5 spare tablets). Subjects will receive&#xD;
      instructions regarding the new doses of ACC and will be reminded to take XXX capsules a day,&#xD;
      XXX in the morning, XXX in midday and XXX in the evening, before or after a meal (based on&#xD;
      their initial assignment). Subjects will be reminded to continue their routine medications&#xD;
      consumption during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I-Day 21 (±1): Subjects will arrive at the Clinical Research Center and their serum calcium,&#xD;
      P and albumin levels will be tested. Calculation of CA will be performed to exclude&#xD;
      hypocalcaemia (Ca&lt;7.0 mg/dL). Subjects will be asked about any side effects or AEs that may&#xD;
      have occurred and changes in concomitant medications since their last visit. Subjects will be&#xD;
      asked about symptoms and signs related with a change in serum calcium levels (tetany, facial&#xD;
      grimacing, paresthesias, muscle aches, arrhythmia, depression). If CA levels are below 7.0&#xD;
      mg/dl, or above 10.0 mg/dl, subject will be excluded from the study (based on the doctor's&#xD;
      decision). If CA levels are within the desired target range (7.0-10.0 mg/dL), a complete&#xD;
      replacement of the daily supplementation of CCS with ACC will be performed, based on the&#xD;
      conversion factor found in I-day 7 (formulas a-c):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conversion factor 0.5: 100% (in mg) of the elemental calcium initial total daily intake&#xD;
           will be replaced by 50% of elemental calcium from ACC (in mg, calculated out of the&#xD;
           initial total daily intake).&#xD;
&#xD;
           NTDC = ITDC - [ITDC (mg CCS)] + [0.5×ITDC (mg ACC)]&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conversion factor 0.75: 100% (in mg) of the elemental calcium initial total daily intake&#xD;
           will be replaced by 75% of elemental calcium from ACC (in mg, calculated out of the&#xD;
           initial total daily intake).&#xD;
&#xD;
           NTDC = ITDC - [ITDC (mg CCS)] + [0. 75×ITDC (mg ACC)]&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Conversion factor 0.25: 100% (in mg) of the elemental calcium initial total daily intake&#xD;
           will be replaced by 25% of elemental calcium from ACC (in mg, calculated out of the&#xD;
           initial total daily intake).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NTDC = ITDC - [ITDC (mg CCS)] + [0.25×ITDC (mg ACC)] Subjects will receive instructions&#xD;
      regarding the new doses of ACC and will be reminded to take XXX tablets a day, XXX in the&#xD;
      morning, XXX in midday and XXX in the evening, before or after a meal (based on their initial&#xD;
      assignment). Subjects will be reminded to continue their routine medications consumption&#xD;
      during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a container to perform 24 hour urine collection prior to their next&#xD;
      scheduled visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I-Day 27 (±1) by phone: Subjects will be reminded to perform 24 hour urine collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I-Day 28 (±1) - Termination of phase I: Subjects will arrive at the Clinical Research Center&#xD;
      and their serum calcium, P and albumin levels will be tested. Calculation of CA will be&#xD;
      performed. Subjects will provide the container of 24 hour urine collection for Ca, P and&#xD;
      creatinine to test calciuria. Subjects will be asked about any side effects or AEs that may&#xD;
      have occurred and changes in concomitant medications since their last visit. Subjects will be&#xD;
      asked about symptoms and signs related with a change in serum calcium levels (tetany, facial&#xD;
      grimacing, paresthesias, muscle aches, arrhythmia, depression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I results will be examined before deciding whether or not to embark on the crossover&#xD;
      portion of the study planned for Phase II. Phase I data will be summarized, showing for each&#xD;
      subject, by arm and overall the relationship between CA levels by amount of ACC replacement&#xD;
      of CCS received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II Ten (10) subjects previously diagnosed and chronically treated for primary&#xD;
      hypoparathyroidism will be enrolled. Subjects participated in phase I will be offered to&#xD;
      participate in phase II as well. If needed, new subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatments for 6 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard of care (CCS) - The same elemental calcium dosage that was used routinely prior&#xD;
           to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ACC - The established dosage of elemental calcium from ACC (based on the conversion&#xD;
           factor and the fed/fasted conditions found in phase I of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two formulations will be administered with the regular daily dosage of vitamin D (1-alfa&#xD;
      D3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the treatment, each group will receive the alternative formulation for another&#xD;
      6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The superior absorption of ACC will be evaluated using weekly blood tests to calculate serum&#xD;
      CA values. Excretion of calcium in urine will be tested at screening and in the end of each&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II-Day -21 (+/-17) Screening: Subjects with a diagnosed primary hypoparathyroidism (see&#xD;
      section 4.1 for definitions), and who receiving calcium and vitamin D supplementation at&#xD;
      least 1 year prior to the beginning of the study and are without major renal or hepatic&#xD;
      disease, will be invited to the Clinical Research Center . At the clinic, subjects will be&#xD;
      interviewed, their medical history and their current medication will be documented and they&#xD;
      will sign an informed consent form (ICF). Subjects will be referred to perform blood tests&#xD;
      for Calcium, P and albumin levels. Calculation of CA will be performed. Subjects will be&#xD;
      instructed to perform 24 hour urine collection for Ca, P and creatinine levels. Subjects will&#xD;
      be asked to fill out a food and medication diary for 3 consecutive days to evaluate their&#xD;
      daily dietary calcium intake. Women of childbearing age will undergo a urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects, complying with all inclusion criteria and having none of the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be enrolled to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be informed by phone or on site whether they are eligible to enter the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

      asked about any changes in their medical condition since their last visit. Blood tests will&#xD;
      be performed to define serum calcium, P and albumin baseline values. CA values will be&#xD;
      calculated at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard-of-care (CCS) - The same elemental calcium dosage that was used routinely prior&#xD;
           to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ACC - The established dosage of elemental calcium from ACC (based on the conversion&#xD;

      each tablet containing 200 mg elemental calcium (35 day supply + 5 spare tablets). Subjects&#xD;
      assigned to the CCS treatment arm will continue to take their routine calcium&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact dosage of calcium supplementation will be determined for each subject according the&#xD;
      known medical history.&#xD;

      medications since their last visit. Subjects will be asked about symptoms and signs related&#xD;
      with a change in serum calcium levels (tetany, facial grimacing, paresthesias, muscle aches,&#xD;
      arrhythmia, depression). Adjustments of ACC or CCS intake will be performed if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be reminded to take the calcium supplementation according to their assignment&#xD;
      instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be reminded to continue their routine medications consumption during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II-Day 10 (±1): Subjects will arrive at the Clinical Research Center and their serum calcium,&#xD;
      P and albumin levels will be tested. Calculation of CA will be performed to exclude&#xD;
      hypocalcaemia (Ca&lt;7.0 mg/dL). If CA levels are within the desired target range (7.0-10.0&#xD;

&#xD;
      Subjects will be reminded to take the calcium supplementation according to the instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be reminded to continue their routine medications consumption during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a container to perform 24 hour urine collection prior to their next&#xD;
      scheduled visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II-Day 34 (±1) by phone: Subjects will be reminded to perform 24 hour urine collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II-Day 35 (±1): Subjects will arrive to the Clinical Research Center and their serum calcium,&#xD;
      P and albumin levels will be tested. Calculation of CA will be performed. Subjects will&#xD;
      provide the container with 24 hour urine collection for Ca, P and creatinine to test&#xD;
      calciuria. Subjects will be asked about any side effects or AEs that may have occurred and&#xD;
      changes in concomitant medications since their last visit. Subjects will be asked about&#xD;
      symptoms and signs related with a change in serum calcium levels (tetany, facial grimacing,&#xD;

&#xD;
      Subjects previously assigned to the CCS treatment arm will receive a pack of ACC tablets,&#xD;
      each tablet containing 200 mg elemental calcium (35 day supply + 5 spare tablets). Subjects&#xD;
      previously assigned to the ACC treatment arm, will be instructed to resume their regular CCS&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact dosage of calcium supplementation for each subject will be determined by the known&#xD;
      medical history.&#xD;

    <measure>Calcium (albumin-corrected) serum level - composite value based on multiple measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood tests will be performed for each subject in each CRC visit from day 0 and onward: Phase I: Day 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28. Phase II: Day 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, 35, 38, 42, 45, 49, 56, 70.</time_frame>
    <description>The initial assessment of hypocal¬cemia is usually based on the measurement of serum total calcium corrected for albumin concentration. Normal CA values range from 8.5 to 10.2 mg/dL. In subjects with hypoparathyroidism, the desired target CA values are 7.0-10.0 mg/dL.&#xD;
The relationship between total serum calcium and albumin is defined by the following rule: the serum total calcium concentration falls by 0.8 mg/dL for every 1-g/dL fall in serum albumin concentration. This rule assumes that normal albumin equals 4.0 g/dL and normal calcium is 10.0 mg/dL.&#xD;
Calculation: Calcium (corrected, mmol/L) = Calcium (measured, mmol/L) + {(40 - albumin(g/L)) x 0.02}</description>
