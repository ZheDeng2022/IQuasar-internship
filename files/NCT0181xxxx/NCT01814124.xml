  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is recognized as a formal source of hip pain and&#xD;
      disability typically affecting the young adult, active population and has been identified as&#xD;
      a precursor to hip osteoarthritis (OA). Common impairments include sharp, anterior groin pain&#xD;
      in a position of hip flexion limiting patients' ability to tolerate prolonged sitting,&#xD;
      squatting, stair climbing, etc. resulting in both work limitations and decreased social&#xD;
      participation. Manual therapy and exercise is known to be effective in reducing pain and&#xD;
      increasing physical function in the management of hip OA. To the extent that FAI is often a&#xD;
      precursor to developing hip OA, logic would seem to dictate a manual therapy plus exercise&#xD;
      approach to decrease pain and disability and potentially prevent or delay osteoarthritis&#xD;
      related surgery. Currently, surgery is considered the first line of treatment with respect to&#xD;
      FAI. However, there is a lack of evidence to support or refute the use of conservative&#xD;
      treatment interventions in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to investigate the benefits of physical therapy interventions (manual&#xD;
      therapy and exercise) over usual care for improving pain and physical function in patients&#xD;
      with FAI of the hip. For this study, 52 participants will be recruited from the Department of&#xD;
      Orthopaedic Surgery, Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, for an outpatient consultation for&#xD;
      consideration of hip arthroscopy surgery. Participants will include those patients who meet&#xD;
      clinical and radiological criteria for formal diagnosis of FAI. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized into two treatment groups. Participants in one group will receive usual care plus&#xD;
      manual therapy directed at the hip as well as a supervised exercise program and home exercise&#xD;
      program twice weekly for six weeks. Participants in the usual care group will receive usual&#xD;
      care as prescribed by the physician. Changes in pain, physical function and benefits of the&#xD;
      intervention will be assessed over six weeks. Should this research study demonstrate&#xD;
      treatment effectiveness of physical therapy intervention in patients diagnosed with FAI of&#xD;
      the hip, manual therapy plus exercise may have the potential to delay or prevent surgery in&#xD;
      this patient population. Further, to the extent to which FAI has been shown to lead to later&#xD;
      development of hip OA, effective treatment interventions may help to delay or prevent&#xD;
      secondary osteoarthritis related changes as well as total joint replacement surgery&#xD;
      associated with hip OA. This study will provide preliminary data that can be used to prepare&#xD;
      further grant applications designed to determine the safest, most effective treatments for&#xD;
      patients with FAI.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will fill out the Hip Outcome Score (HOS). The HOS is a 29-item instrument. Patient data from the HOS has been reported as reliable, valid, and responsive specific to this patient population and has been identified as the best available questionnaire for assessing younger patients undergoing hip arthroscopy. Test-retest reliability has been reported in the range of ICC = 0.92 - 0.98; internal consistency measures at cronbach's alpha = 0.96, 0.95; and responsiveness characteristics with effect sizes post-surgery ranging from 1.2-1.5.</description>

    <measure>Numeric Pain Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline pain level at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Lower extremity pain will be recorded using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). Participants will be asked to report their pain levels from no pain (0/10) to worse imaginable pain (10/10). This scale has been demonstrated to be a reliable, generalizable, internally consistent measure of clinical and experimental pain sensation intensity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Squat</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline functional status at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The functional squat test is considered to be a provocative test that also serves as a measure of function. A digital inclinometer will be placed on the tibia just distal to the tibial tuberosity. The participants will be asked to bend the knees and bring their buttocks toward their heels without bending forward or lifting their heels off the floor. The range of motion measurement will be taken at the greatest range of motion at which the participant was able to maintain good form or the first point of reported pain. The functional squat test has good reported reliability (ICC = 0.90 - 0.92) and responsiveness with standard error of measurement of 1.9.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Rating of Change Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Global Rating of Change Scale (GRCS) will be completed by each participant to rate their own perception of improved hip function. The GRCS questionnaire is an instrument that measures overall changes in the quality of life of the subject. The use of a GRCS is a common, feasible, and useful method for assessing outcome, and has been shown to be a valid measurement of change in patient status in patients with knee OA and other pain populations</description>

    <measure>Lower Extremity Functional Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline general functional status at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>General lower extremity function will be quantified using the LEFS. The LEFS is a 20 item instrument with reported test-retest reliability of ICC = 0.98; internal consistency measures of cronbach's alpha = 0.96; and responsiveness characteristics of area under the curve of 0.77</description>
