      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate whether renal sympathetic denervation is safe and&#xD;
      effective in patients with hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common cardiac arrhythmia, complications of AF&#xD;
      such as stroke, thromboembolism and heart failure will bring high disable rate and mortality&#xD;
      , which will be serious influence on people's health and aggrandize medical financial burden,&#xD;
      however, treatment for AF is not ideal. The affection of traditional antiarrhythmia drugs is&#xD;
      not enough good, due to extra-heart bad reaction and potential arrhythmogenic substrate&#xD;
      function restricted; rate control strategy applied quite abroad, however, anticoagulated&#xD;
      medicine were not applied enough, Radiofrequency catheter ablation of AF has developed&#xD;
      rapidly in recent years, But it's station is also disputed and its success rate is low and&#xD;
      recrudescence is very high. meanwhile, serious complications will be caused. So far,&#xD;
      hypertension is the most risk factor of AF. Long-term hypertension will change left-ventricle&#xD;
      structure, through variability of pressure loading and capacity loading, damage diastolic&#xD;
      function of left-ventricle. Increase of diastolic pressure in left-ventricle and atrial&#xD;
      pressure will gradually result in atrial enlargement and fibrosis, so it will cause atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation, repeating paroxysm or slow maintaining. Investigation indicated&#xD;
      anti-hypertension therapy can decrease occurrence ratio and reoccurrence ratio of AF.&#xD;
      Recently, many clinical researches have verified that renal sympathetic denervation acquired&#xD;
      exact and sustained hypotension effect, In addition, Renal sympathetic denervation can reduce&#xD;
      left ventricular hypertrophy, improve glucose metabolization and obstructive sleep,&#xD;
      meanwhile, it reduce the level of nonepinephrine for both partial and whole-body. While left&#xD;
      ventricle hypertrophy, left atrium enlarge，epinephrine over release itself and breath sleep&#xD;
      obstacle are the independent dangerous factors of emerging AF. So ,we design this randomized&#xD;
      parallel control multi center clinical study to demonstrate that renal sympathetic&#xD;
      denervation is a safe and effective treatment for patients with hypertension and paroxysmal&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation.&#xD;

    <description>Perform renal angiogram immediately prior to renal sympathetic denervation procedure to confirm anatomic eligibility，The treatment catheter was introduced into each renal artery using a guiding catheter. Up to six ablations at 10 W for 1 min each were performed in both renal arteries. Treatments were delivered from the first distal main renal artery bifurcation to the ostium proximally and were spaced longitudinally and rotationally under fluoroscopic guidance. Catheter tip impedance and temperature were constantly monitored, and radio frequency energy delivery was regulated according to a predetermined algorithm. Visceral pain at the time of energy delivery was managed with intravenous analgetics and sedatives.</description>
