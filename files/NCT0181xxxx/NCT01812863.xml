      The purpose of this study is to determine if US-guided supraclavicular anesthetic blocks&#xD;
      reduce postoperative pain, use of rescue medication, and improve functional outcomes in&#xD;
      children who underwent surgery for supracondylar humerus fractures.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty six American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I or II patients between the ages&#xD;
      of 2 and 10 years undergoing reduction of supracondylar humerus fractures will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the study. From mid-May to the beginning of August, Lurie Children's (formerly Children's&#xD;
      Memorial Hospital)historically has 50-70 supracondylar humerus fractures in children, and we&#xD;
      expect an 80% recruitment rate for the study. A power analysis estimated that a sample size&#xD;
      of 46 patients would have an 80% power at the 0.05 level of significance to detect a 50%&#xD;
      reduction in the number of patients requiring rescue medication when comparing intravenous&#xD;
      opioids and the ultrasound-guided supraclavicular nerve block (from approximately 80% to&#xD;
      40%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, the patients will be taken to the operating room where the&#xD;
      procedure will be performed. Intraoperatively, patients will be randomly assigned to be in&#xD;
      one of two groups. Randomization will be determined by block allocation with a 1:1 ratio with&#xD;
      permuted, mixed blocks of 4 and 6 created randomly using a computer based randomization&#xD;
      table. Randomization will be performed by one of the co-investigators. Preoperatively,&#xD;
      patients will be assessed for neurovascular status by testing the patient's ability to make&#xD;
      three movements: thumb extension (radial nerve), proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) flexion&#xD;
      (median nerve), and interossei function (ulnar nerve). Patients may be removed from the study&#xD;
      after consent is given if removal of the cast prior to surgery reveals excessive swelling in&#xD;
      the elbow, indicating an increased likelihood for development of compartment syndrome&#xD;
      postoperatively. This determination will be made by the attending orthopaedic surgeon&#xD;
      performing the procedure. Patients with an increased likelihood of developing compartment&#xD;
      syndrome will be given narcotics to treat pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo a general anesthetic for the surgical procedure. Surgical&#xD;
      anesthesia will be maintained using volatile anesthetics. Intraoperatively, while still under&#xD;
      general anesthesia, Groups 1 and 2 will receive a standardized intravenous dose of 0.05 mg/kg&#xD;
      of morphine in a total volume of 1 ml. Following injection of morphine, an ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      supraclavicular nerve catheter (Angiocath) will be placed in Group 2. All catheters will be&#xD;
      placed by one of the anesthesiologist trained in regional pain control using a 25 mm linear&#xD;
      US probe in a sterile fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be taken to the postoperative recovery room (PACU) area where they will be&#xD;
      tested for nerve function after emergence from anesthesia. If the examination is unchanged&#xD;
      from preoperative assessment, an injection block using 5 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine with&#xD;
      1:200,000 epinephrine will be administered. Bupivacaine is a long acting local anesthetic&#xD;
      that prevents nerve conduction and action potential initiation by decreasing the permeability&#xD;
      of the neuronal membrane to sodium. We use a maximum dose of 5 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine, and&#xD;
      we usually base the dose on a ml/kg (0.2 ml/kg) with a maximum dose not to exceed 2.5 mg/kg.&#xD;
      This will be well below toxic levels. A band-aid will be placed on all patients where a&#xD;
      supraclavicular nerve block would have been inserted, and parents will be asked to leave the&#xD;
      band-aid on for 3 days to maintain the blindness to the treatment type by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the PACU, the patient will be evaluated for pain and discomfort by a member of the&#xD;
      research team using the &quot;Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R)&quot; Other side effects such as nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, somnolence and respiratory depression will be noted. Any incidence of nausea and/or&#xD;
      vomiting will be treated with 0.1 mg/kg (up to 4 mg) of ondansetron given intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postoperative care unit staff is well versed in keeping children calm after anesthesia.&#xD;
      There is a chance that the child may know which group they are in. However, due to the age of&#xD;
      these children and the fact that they are just coming out of anesthesia, it is more likely&#xD;
      that they will not understand what is happening and the implications of the interventions. It&#xD;
      is also unlikely that it will affect the outcomes of requiring additional medication for pain&#xD;
      in the PACU or at home. Likewise, it is unlikely that knowing the group would affect the&#xD;
      range of motion outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families will be randomly contacted 7 times in the 36 hours approximately after the operation&#xD;
      by nurses from the Collaborative Research Unit (CRU) to record a patient's pain score. Data&#xD;
      will be analyzed using a time series analysis. Patients will be discharged with a&#xD;
      standardized 5/325 mg dose of Norco to be taken every 4-6 hours. Patients are typically&#xD;
      discharged the same day or after a brief overnight stay. Patients typically follow up in 1&#xD;
      week for a radiograph with the treating orthopaedic surgeon followed by pin removal at 3-4&#xD;
      weeks post-surgery. PT will begin if there is less than a 100 degree arc of motion at 6 weeks&#xD;
      after pin removal and will involve ROM exercises per the PT discretion. A binary outcome will&#xD;
      be recorded as to whether PT is necessary 6 weeks after the cast and pins are removed.&#xD;
      Functional recovery will be measured 6 weeks after pin removal through ROM measurements. A&#xD;
      pain score will also be taken at the follow-up visit 6 weeks after pin removal to measure&#xD;
      long-term pain. Parents will be given a questionnaire before their child is discharged from&#xD;
      the hospital. Part of the questionnaire is filled out while the child is still at the&#xD;
      hospital. The rest of the questionnaire will be sent home with the parents to be filled out&#xD;
      throughout the week following the operation. The contents of the questionnaire will be&#xD;
      explained to the parents at the time that the questionnaire is handed out to ensure that they&#xD;
      understand the questions. Parents will return the questionnaire at the 1 week follow up visit&#xD;
      to give feedback data on any postoperative discomfort, any additional pain medications and&#xD;
      also the overall satisfaction with the study design. All data obtained will be entered in an&#xD;
      Excel® database. Statistical analysis will be carried out using the SPSS software®&#xD;
      (Statistical Program for the Social Sciences), and a t-test will be performed with the data&#xD;
      obtained. Primary outcome data will be the use of rescue medication in the immediate&#xD;
      postoperative period. Secondary outcomes include pain scores, use of additional medication&#xD;
      after leaving the hospital and range of motion at 9-10 weeks postoperatively. Analyzed data&#xD;
      will include the duration of pain relief and retention of nerve functionality. We will also&#xD;
      record and analyze the incidence of postoperative vomiting and respiratory distress in either&#xD;
      group. We will carefully monitor and record for the development of compartment syndrome.&#xD;
