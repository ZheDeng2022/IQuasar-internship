  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the upper airway closes over and over again during sleep.&#xD;
      This leads to disrupted sleep (waking up during the night), daytime sleepiness, and an&#xD;
      increased risk for developing high blood pressure. Currently, the best treatment for&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea is sleeping with a mask that continuously blows air into the nose&#xD;
      (i.e. Continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] treatment). While CPAP treatment stops the&#xD;
      upper airway from closing in most people, many people have difficulty sleeping with the mask&#xD;
      in place and therefore do not use the CPAP treatment. This research study is being conducted&#xD;
      to learn whether using a sedative will improve OSA severity by altering some of the traits&#xD;
      that are responsible for the disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by repetitive collapse or 'obstruction' of the&#xD;
      pharyngeal airway during sleep. These obstructions result in repetitive hypopneas/apneas and&#xD;
      intermittent hypoxia/hypercapnia, as well as surges in sympathetic activity. Such processes&#xD;
      disturb normal sleep and impair neurocognitive function, often resulting in excessive daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness and decreased quality of life. Furthermore, OSA is associated with cardiovascular&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, making OSA a major health concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current evidence suggests that OSA pathogenesis involves the interactions of at least four&#xD;
      physiological traits comprising: 1) the pharyngeal anatomy and its propensity towards&#xD;
      collapse. This collapsibility of the upper airway is measured as the critical closing&#xD;
      pressure or PCRIT. 2) the ability of the upper airway dilator muscles to activate and reopen&#xD;
      the airway during sleep (i.e. neuromuscular compensation) measured as the increase in upper&#xD;
      airway electromyography (EMG) activity above the baseline level. 3) the arousal threshold&#xD;
      from sleep (i.e. the propensity for hypopneas/apneas to lead to arousal and fragmented sleep)&#xD;
      measured as the epiglottic pressure occurring just at the time of arousal and 4) the&#xD;
      stability of the ventilatory feedback loop (i.e. loop gain). Continuous positive airway&#xD;
      pressure (CPAP) is the most common treatment for OSA but it is often poorly tolerated; only&#xD;
      ~50% of patients diagnosed with OSA continue therapy beyond 3 months. Given this limitation,&#xD;
      alternative approaches have been tested and have generally focused on the use of oral&#xD;
      appliances and upper airway surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to these alternative therapies, the use of pharmacological agents for the&#xD;
      treatment of OSA has been gaining widespread interest. Previous data have shown that the&#xD;
      non-myorelaxant hypnotic trazodone increases the arousal threshold however its effects on&#xD;
      sleep apnea severity remain unclear. Based on studies showing that increasing the arousal&#xD;
      threshold with a different hypnotic improves sleep apnea severity, we hypothesize that&#xD;
      trazodone will increase the arousal threshold and this will be associated with an improvement&#xD;
      in sleep apnea severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the overall aim of this study is to examine the effects that trazodone has on OSA&#xD;
      severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A double-blinded randomized control design will be used. Initially, participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to the trazodone or placebo arm where they will have both a clinical&#xD;
      polysomnography (PSG) with the addition of an epiglottic pressure cathether. The purpose of&#xD;
      the clinical PSG is to determine the severity of OSA (i.e. AHI) and the epiglottic catheter&#xD;
      allows the calculation of the arousal threshold to be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the trazodone arm, participants will be given trazodone (100mg by mouth) to take&#xD;
      before bed. During the placebo arm, subjects will be given a placebo to take before bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have at least a 1-week washout period before cross over to the next arm of&#xD;
      the study whereby the clinical PSG will be repeated. In total each subject will be studied&#xD;
      for 2 nights.&#xD;
