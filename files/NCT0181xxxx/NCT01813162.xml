      The purpose of the study is determine if the local release characteristics and systemic&#xD;
      exposure to tenofovir (TFV) 1% gel and a given commonly used vaginal product are impacted by&#xD;
      concomitant use&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study consists of three separate crossover studies, each evaluating if local release&#xD;
      characteristics and systemic exposure to TFV 1% gel and a given vaginal product are impacted&#xD;
      by concomitant use. Vaginal products to be assessed are: antifungal cream, antimicrobial gel,&#xD;
      and the combination contraceptive vaginal ring (IVR). There will be no comparison between&#xD;
      vaginal product groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to vaginal product. Participants in the cream and gel cohorts&#xD;
      will be randomized to the order of treatment conditions (TFV gel alone, vaginal product&#xD;
      alone, and TFV gel and vaginal product concomitantly). Participants in the IVR cohort will&#xD;
      use TFV gel alone during the first crossover period; the order of the remaining treatment&#xD;
      conditions (IVR alone, TFV and IVR concomitantly) for crossover periods 2 and 3 will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will attend a total of at least 7 visits. At the first visit, volunteers&#xD;
      will be consented and will undergo procedures to assess whether they are eligible to continue&#xD;
      in the study. If eligible, they will undergo 3 crossover treatment periods. Within each&#xD;
      crossover treatment period there will be 2 visits, which will be scheduled to occur within&#xD;
      the same menstrual cycle; the first visit will be in the follicular phase of the menstrual&#xD;
      cycle such that product use is initiated on cycle day 9 to 18 and the second visit will be on&#xD;
      cycle day 16 to 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of crossover period 1, after it has been confirmed that the participant meets&#xD;
      all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, she will be randomized to a&#xD;
      vaginal product cohort and to a sequence of the treatment conditions for the 3 crossover&#xD;
      periods. Crossover periods 2 and 3 will be scheduled in the subsequent menstrual cycles, with&#xD;
      the first visit of each crossover period occurring approximately 2 weeks after the completion&#xD;
      of the previous crossover period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product usage during the 3 crossover periods is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Condition (vaginal product alone): The participant will be instructed to use&#xD;
           her assigned product for 5 to 21 days, depending on the dosing instructions for the&#xD;
           particular product cohort to which she has been assigned . The second visit of the&#xD;
           crossover period will occur after product use is complete. For participants using&#xD;
           antifungal cream or antimicrobial gel, blood specimens will be collected approximately 6&#xD;
           hours after the last gel or cream use. In the IVR cohort, blood specimens will be&#xD;
           collected after 21 days of use at 0/4, 6, 10, and 24 hours. The 0/4 hour collection time&#xD;
           point is the time of the first plasma draw. It is meant to mimic the 4 hour post-TFV gel&#xD;
           insertion collection time point described below for the TFV gel alone and the vaginal&#xD;
           product/TFV gel treatment conditions. No biopsies will be collected during the vaginal&#xD;
           product treatment condition for all cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Condition (TFV gel alone): The participant will be instructed to use TFV gel&#xD;
           for 7 days, inserted twice a day with each dose approximately 12 hours apart. The second&#xD;
           visit of the crossover period will occur after product use is complete. Blood specimens&#xD;
           will be collected approximately 4 hours after the last dose of TFV gel. In the IVR&#xD;
           cohort, participants will have blood specimens collected 4, 6, 10 and 24 hours after the&#xD;
           last dose of TFV gel. Vaginal biopsy will be scheduled to take place approximately 6&#xD;
           hours after the last dose of TFV gel for all cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Condition (vaginal product and TFV gel): The participant will be instructed to&#xD;
           use her assigned product for 5 to 21 days, depending on the dosing instructions for the&#xD;
           particular product cohort to which she has been assigned. TFV gel will be used for 7&#xD;
           days, inserted twice a day with each dose approximately 12 hours apart; the morning&#xD;
           insertion of TFV gel will occur approximately two hours after insertion of the vaginal&#xD;
           product (for the gel and cream cohorts). The second visit of the crossover period will&#xD;
           occur after product use is complete. In the gel and or cream cohorts, blood specimens&#xD;
           will be collected approximately 4 hours after the last TFV gel use. In the IVR cohort,&#xD;
           blood specimens will be collected 4, 6, 10 and 24 hours after the last dose of TFV gel.&#xD;
           Vaginal biopsy will be scheduled to take place approximately 6 hours after the last dose&#xD;
           of TFV gel for all cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be contacted by phone approximately 1-2 weeks after completion of&#xD;
      crossover period 3 to confirm that there have been no additional adverse experiences. If&#xD;
      necessary, she may be seen in an unscheduled visit for follow-up. She will then be exited&#xD;
      from the study.&#xD;
