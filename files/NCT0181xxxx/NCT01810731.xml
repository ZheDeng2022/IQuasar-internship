  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2012, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) concluded that pregnant women are&#xD;
      the most important risk group for season influenza vaccination based upon &quot;compelling&#xD;
      evidence of substantial risk of severe disease in this group and evidence that seasonal&#xD;
      influenza vaccine is safe and effective in preventing disease in pregnant women as well as&#xD;
      their young infants, in whom disease burden is also high&quot;. Recent data from Kenya, similarly&#xD;
      suggest rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations in children under age 1 to be as high,&#xD;
      or higher, than those observed in the United States. However, TIV may have reduced&#xD;
      immunogenicity in HIV-infected adults, and HIV infection has been shown to reduce placental&#xD;
      transfer of both tetanus and measles antibodies. Therefore, we propose to conduct a&#xD;
      double-blind randomized controlled trial of influenza vaccines stratified by HIV status in up&#xD;
      to 720 pregnant women in their second and third trimesters and their infants residing in&#xD;
      health and demographic surveillance sites (HDSS) in Nyanza Province, Western Kenya. We&#xD;
      propose to assess the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of standard dose QIV and double&#xD;
      dose QIV in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected pregnant women. Findings will inform maternal&#xD;
      influenza vaccination policies in Kenya and other African countries.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent investments in influenza surveillance in many African countries confirm results from&#xD;
      other countries that young children, pregnant women, and those with chronic medical&#xD;
      conditions are at increased risk of hospitalization and death from influenza infection.&#xD;
      Annual influenza vaccination is the most effective method for preventing influenza virus&#xD;
      infection and its complications. Vaccination is currently recommended in high risk groups in&#xD;
      many developed countries and the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on&#xD;
      Immunization made a recommendation for vaccination of pregnant women in their 2005 position&#xD;
      paper on influenza vaccine. In 2012, the SAGE further concluded that pregnant women are the&#xD;
      most important risk group for inactivated seasonal influenza vaccination based upon&#xD;
      &quot;compelling evidence of substantial risk of severe disease in this group and evidence that&#xD;
      seasonal influenza vaccine is safe and effective in preventing disease in pregnant women as&#xD;
      well as their young infants, in whom disease burden is also high&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal influenza immunization is viewed as the most effective way to protect infants less&#xD;
      than 6 months of age who are not yet eligible for immunization. In the United States,&#xD;
      children under 6 months experience very high rates of influenza-associated hospitalization&#xD;
      and are among those most at risk of severe outcomes. Recent data from Kenya, similarly&#xD;
      suggest rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations in children under age 1 to be as high,&#xD;
      or higher, than those observed in the United States. Vaccination of pregnant women provides&#xD;
      protection to their infants against laboratory-confirmed influenza illness in the first&#xD;
      months of life. Furthermore, vaccination of pregnant women has been associated with a&#xD;
      decreased risk of pre-term birth and small for gestational age in Canada and the state of&#xD;
      Georgia in the US, and increased birth weight in infants during periods of high transmission&#xD;
      in Bangladesh. However, traditional TIV may have reduced immunogenicity in HIV-infected&#xD;
      adults, and HIV infection has been shown to reduce placental transfer of both tetanus and&#xD;
      measles antibodies. The high prevalence of other diseases, including malaria and&#xD;
      malnutrition, may also impact the effectiveness of influenza vaccination for pregnant women&#xD;
      and their infants in sub-Saharan Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of double dose QIV may produce a greater immune response in pregnant women and increased&#xD;
      antibody production may improve transplacental transfer of influenza antibodies to the&#xD;
      developing fetus, conferring a better or possibly longer duration of protection from&#xD;
      influenza infection. Therefore, we propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial of&#xD;
      influenza vaccines in a high HIV-prevalence, malaria-endemic setting in Kenya, using&#xD;
      inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) as a comparator/control. We propose to assess the safety,&#xD;
      immunogenicity, and efficacy of standard dose (15 µg) QIV (FLUARIX® (GlaxoSmithKline&#xD;
      Biologicals, Dresden, Germany) and double dose (30 µg) QIV in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected&#xD;
      pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the immunogenicity of standard dose (15 µg) QIV and double dose (30 µg) QIV&#xD;
           in HIV-infected and uninfected pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the level of vaccine-induced influenza antibody transfer to infants of&#xD;
           HIV-infected and uninfected pregnant women who receive standard dose (15 µg) QIV or&#xD;
           double dose (30 µg) QIV&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the safety of standard dose (15 µg) QIV and double dose (30 µg) QIV in&#xD;
           HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected pregnant women and fetus&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be conducted as a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial stratified by&#xD;
      HIV status in up to 720 pregnant women in their second and third trimesters and their infants&#xD;
      residing in health and demographic surveillance sites (HDSS) around Siaya District Hospital&#xD;
      and Lwak Mission Hospital in Nyanza Province, Western Kenya. The study will be conducted in&#xD;
      accordance with International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (GCP)&#xD;
      standards. Mothers must agree to be counseled and tested for HIV at the time of screening and&#xD;
      enrollment unless there is written documentation of HIV infection or a negative HIV test in&#xD;
      the last 3 months. After initial screening for eligibility and informed consent, enrolled&#xD;
      women will be stratified by HIV status (infected, uninfected) and block randomized in a&#xD;
      1:1:1:1 ratio to receive standard dose (15 µg) QIV, double dose (30 µg) QIV or IPV. The day&#xD;
      of vaccination will be considered study Day 0 for each subject. Each subject will receive a&#xD;
      single vaccination. For the first 240 enrolled women, study personnel will visit their homes&#xD;
      on Days 1, 2, and 3 to do active surveillance for adverse events following vaccination.&#xD;
      Pregnancy outcomes will be recorded for all subjects (live birth, still birth, or spontaneous&#xD;
      abortion). HIV testing will be repeated at birth for all women with negative results at&#xD;
      screening. Live and still born infants will be examined by trained study personnel in the&#xD;
      first 24 hours after delivery to determine birth weight, length, assess gestational age, and&#xD;
      identify possible congenital anomalies associated with vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled subjects will be asked to return to the antenatal study clinic on Study Day 7,&#xD;
      Day 28, Day 56 (if not delivered), for delivery, and for any febrile or respiratory illness&#xD;
      or other concern. During the enrollment process, their mobile telephone number will be&#xD;
      recorded (or a number will be recorded for someone they identify in the village with a mobile&#xD;
      telephone who will be willing to transmit information to them). Participants will be&#xD;
      contacted by phone or in person every 2 weeks to determine if they have had fever and/or&#xD;
      cough during the prior 2 weeks. Subjects with fever only will receive a malaria smear and&#xD;
      other treatment as appropriate per Kenya Ministry of Health (MOH) guidelines. Subjects with&#xD;
      fever or cough will have respiratory specimens collected via placement of NP/OP swabs by&#xD;
      trained clinical personnel for influenza testing. After delivery, subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      bring infants to the study clinic for evaluation on Days 7, 42, and 70 of life and when the&#xD;
      child is approximately 6 months of age. Infants will also be under surveillance for fever,&#xD;
      history of fever, hypothermia and/or cough for the first 6 months of life. All febrile,&#xD;
      hypothermic, and/or coughing infants will receive testing for malaria and nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      (NP)and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs for influenza. Febrile infants under 2 months of age will&#xD;
      receive additional testing and treatment per national guidelines. Any infant admitted to the&#xD;
      hospital with any respiratory symptom, hypothermia, apnea or fever will receive testing for&#xD;
      influenza by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of NP/OP&#xD;
      specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccine immunogenicity will be evaluated by comparing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers&#xD;
      on Day 0 and Day 28 and at delivery in the mother, in cord blood, in the mother and infant at&#xD;
      infant Day 70 of life, and in the infant at approximately 6 months of age. We will determine&#xD;
      the proportion of vaccinated women who achieve a fourfold rise in HI titers post-vaccination&#xD;
      compared to pre-vaccination or an HI titer ≥40 for subjects with baseline HI titer &lt;10,&#xD;
      compared to the same outcome in controls. The proportion of HI titers ≥40 in cord blood and&#xD;
      in infants will also be measured and compared among vaccine recipients and controls.&#xD;
      Geometric means of HI titers will also be compared.&#xD;
