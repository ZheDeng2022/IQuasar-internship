    <textblock>
      Cardioinhibitory neurocardiogenic syncope (CNS) or vasovagal syncope, is the most frequent&#xD;
      aetiology of syncope in young people without apparent cardiac or neurological pathology. It&#xD;
      is usually caused by inappropriately trigger-activated cardiac reflex which finally&#xD;
      precipitates asystole, sinus bradycardia, or atrioventricular (AV) block [1]. Despite young&#xD;
      patients affected by CNS have an excellent prognosis when electro-structural heart diseases&#xD;
      are excluded [2], their quality of life may be seriously affected by recurrent episodes [2,&#xD;
      3]. Cardiac pacing might help to control symptoms and therefore is considered in patients&#xD;
      aged more than 40 years old with recurrent episodes and documented cardioinhibitory response&#xD;
      [1, 4]. In young individuals, the role of cardiac pacing is dubious due to predicted frequent&#xD;
      device substitutions and adverse ventricular remodeling over time. Recently, radiofrequency&#xD;
      (RF) biatrial ablation of ganglionated plexi (GP) has showed promising results in the short&#xD;
      and long-term treatment of reflex syncope, functional atrioventricular block, or sinus node&#xD;
      dysfunction [5, 6]. Nonetheless, strong evidences are emerging about efficacy of&#xD;
      transcatheter ablation limited to ganglionated plexi in the right atrium with the possibility&#xD;
      to avoid side-effects related to left-sided procedures [6]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of study&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate in a large cohort of patients effectiveness and safety of gangliar transcatheter&#xD;
      ablation in the right atrium to obtain atrial denervation and prevent CNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty consecutive patients affected by cardioinhibitory neurocardiogenic syncope will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age between 18 and 60 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 syncopal episodes at least of likely CNS in the previous 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  marked cardioinhibitory response to HUT or documented asystolic pauses at internal loop&#xD;
           recorder registration [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardioinhibition will be considered as elicitation of asystolic pause (sinus arrest or AV&#xD;
      block) ≥ 3 seconds associated to syncope or ≥ 6 seconds and related presyncope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  documented myocardial and/or valvular abnormalities on 2D echocardiogram (ejection&#xD;
           fraction lower than 50%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  documented tachyarrhythmias as possible causes of symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  channelopathies (Brugada syndrome, LQT or SQT syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ventricular preexcitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  symptomatic orthostatic hypotension diagnosed by standing blood pressure measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pregnancy in women&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  previous cardiac pacemaker implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent patients will undergo to basal electrophysiological study&#xD;
      (EPS) to record AH interval, HV interval, Wenckebach cycle length, sinus node recovery time&#xD;
      (SNRT) and correct sinus node recovery time (cSNRT); the same parameters will be recorded&#xD;
      immediately after ablation. Following basal EPS an accurate (200 valid points at least)&#xD;
      electroanatomic right atrium mapping (CARTO 3™ Biosense Webster, Inc) will be performed and&#xD;
      subsequently radiofrequency delivered at right atrial anatomic sites where the underlying&#xD;
      presence of ganglionated plexi (GPs) clusters was regarded as highly probable, on the basis&#xD;
      of anatomical studies [8-11]: the supero-posterior area (superior right atrial GP, adjacent&#xD;
      to the junction of the superior vena cava and the posterior surface of RA), the&#xD;
      middleposterior area (posterior right atrial GP, posterior surface of the RA adjacent the&#xD;
      interatrial groove), the infero-posterior area (inferior right GP placed between the inferior&#xD;
      vena cava, coronary sinus ostium, and near the atrioventricular groove). Transcatheter&#xD;
      ablation will be performed using an 8mm-tip catheter (Biosence-Webster Navistar DS 8mm) or an&#xD;
      irrigated 4 mm-tip catheter with force control system (Biosence Webster Smarttouch). Ablation&#xD;
      will be performed until complete elimination of local atrial electrical activity. Response to&#xD;
      radiofrequencies delivery will be considered successful in case of asystolic pause or cardiac&#xD;
      cycle lengthening of 30% (compared to basal cycle) at least. To prolong RF delivery despite&#xD;
      asystolic response, a quadripolar catheter will be positioned in right ventricle to backup&#xD;
      stimulation. To avoid phrenic nerve injury, high amplitude stimulation will be performed just&#xD;
      before radiofrequency delivery to the superior right atrial GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HRV analysis will be performed on admission, at 2 hour after ablation and patients discharge.&#xD;
      The HRV analysis will include the following parameters: mean, maximal and minimal heart rate,&#xD;
      SDNN (standard deviation of Normal-Normal), RMSSD (root mean square successive difference),&#xD;
      pNN50 (percentage of differences between adjacent N-N intervals that are &gt;50 msec), LF (low&#xD;
      frequency), HF (high frequency).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, an HUT and an HRV analysis will be performed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after&#xD;
      ablation procedure during the follow up.&#xD;
