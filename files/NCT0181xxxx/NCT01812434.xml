      Hypothesis 1: Treatment of heart transplant recipients with sildenafil, a PDE-5 inhibitor,&#xD;
      will improve small artery elasticity (SAE) when compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: PDE-5 inhibition will improve endothelial function, resulting in increased&#xD;
      production of nitric oxide, reduced activation of circulating endothelial cells, and&#xD;
      increased endothelial progenitor cells.&#xD;

      Background and Significance In the United States, heart failure is an epidemic affecting&#xD;
      5,700,000 people, of which an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 suffer from end-stage heart&#xD;
      failure. Cardiac transplantation has emerged as the definitive therapy for patients with&#xD;
      end-stage heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the major limitation to longevity after heart&#xD;
      transplant (HTx) and currently there are no effective treatments. It affects up to 45% of&#xD;
      transplant recipients by year four post transplantation and is detectable on intravascular&#xD;
      ultrasound in up to 75% at one year. Attempts to prevent cardiac allograft vasculopathy by&#xD;
      modifying traditional risk factors such as dyslipidemia and hypertension have resulted in&#xD;
      only modest improvements in outcomes after transplant. The efficacy of these preventive&#xD;
      measures have been limited by the multifactorial nature of the process and the influence of&#xD;
      nontraditional, less well-defined risk factors such as immune response, mode of brain death&#xD;
      of the donor, and cytomegalovirus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both traditional and non-traditional risk factors do share a common final pathway, which is&#xD;
      endothelial injury and subsequent endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial dysfunction has been well described as a precursor to cardiac allograft&#xD;
      vasculopathy in cardiac transplant recipients. While endothelial dysfunction is an integral&#xD;
      part of the development of CAV and one of the earliest manifestations, it has not yet been&#xD;
      demonstrated that targeting endothelial dysfunction delays or prevents the onset of cardiac&#xD;
      allograft vasculopathy. Thus this study seeks to determine whether short-term sildenafil,&#xD;
      when administered during the first 3 years after transplant, improves endothelial function in&#xD;
      heart transplant recipients and thereby could prevent or delay cardiac allograft vasculopathy&#xD;
      (CAV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for using sildenafil Sildenafil has been demonstrated to dilate epicardial coronary&#xD;
      arteries in patients with coronary artery disease and in those with normal coronary arteries&#xD;
      who have risk factors for CAD and has been demonstrated to improve endothelial function in a&#xD;
      variety of cardiovascular diseases including pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. By&#xD;
      inhibiting PDE-5, an enzyme that metabolizes cyclic guanosine monophosphate (c-GMP),&#xD;
      sildenafil enhances c-GMP-mediated relaxation and inhibits proliferation of vascular&#xD;
      smooth-muscle cells. Inhibition of PDE-5 receptors with sildenafil appears to selectively&#xD;
      improve endothelial function of the epicardial arteries; and in patients with severe CAD,&#xD;
      sildenafil has been shown to improve coronary flow reserve. Based on these properties, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that PDE-5 inhibition will improve endothelial function in transplant recipients&#xD;
      and delay or prevent the onset of vasculopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of Sildenafil on endothelial function in cardiac transplant&#xD;
      recipients by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measuring the change in radial artery elasticity in HTx recipients before and after&#xD;
           Sildenafil therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measuring change in number of endothelial progenitor cells before and after Sildenafil&#xD;
           therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Overview of Study Design This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      16 week crossover designed pilot study to evaluate the effect of oral sildenafil 20mg t.i.d,&#xD;
      on small artery elasticity (SAE) and endothelial cells in heart transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have pre-randomization and post treatment measurements of peripheral artery&#xD;
      elasticity and endothelial progenitor cells Visits will occur at 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks. A&#xD;
      graphic presentation of the study is shown below.&#xD;
