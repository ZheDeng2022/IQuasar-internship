      An important gap in the management of peanut allergy is that we do not know the threshold&#xD;
      dose, below which most peanut allergic individuals will not react. There is likely a spectrum&#xD;
      of reactivity to peanut where some individuals react to trace doses, whereas others are able&#xD;
      to tolerate larger doses. The purpose of this study is to determine the minimum threshold&#xD;
      dose needed to cause a mild objective reaction when peanuts are consumed by peanut-allergic&#xD;
      individuals in a carefully controlled clinical setting. 30 peanut-allergic participants aged&#xD;
      7-65 years will undergo a two-day, double blind placebo controlled food challenge.&#xD;
      Participants will be gradually fed increasing amounts of peanut, or placebo, until objective&#xD;
      allergic symptoms are observed. Statistical modelling of individual threshold doses will be&#xD;
      used to determine a population threshold dose, or a level of peanut to which 90% of the&#xD;
      peanut-allergic population will not react. Knowledge of threshold doses at an individual and&#xD;
      population level is valuable in that it provides critical information for the management of&#xD;
      peanut allergy by individuals, their caregivers and health professionals, as well as&#xD;
      knowledge of allergen risks to public health agencies and the food industry.&#xD;

      Overview&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study protocol will be modeled on a consensus protocol developed with the input of&#xD;
      clinical allergists and other allergy stakeholders to standardize threshold challenge studies&#xD;
      [5-8]. As per protocol, 30 patients with a known or convincing history of peanut allergy will&#xD;
      be recruited. After an initial screening visit to verify eligibility, all participants will&#xD;
      undergo a two-day DBPCFC. Briefly, qualifying participants will be fed increasing amounts of&#xD;
      peanut masked in a food matrix. On a different day, the participant will be fed the same&#xD;
      amount of the food matrix without any peanut. Overall, the study will require three visits by&#xD;
      participants: a screening day to determine if the prospective participants meet eligibility&#xD;
      criteria, and two days for the DBPCFC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective participants will come to the Allergy Clinic at the McMaster University Medical&#xD;
      Centre for a screening visit up to 6 months prior to the DBPCFC in order to confirm study&#xD;
      eligibility. The informed consent form will be reviewed and signed at this time. The allergic&#xD;
      status of these prospective participants will be characterized by patient history, skin prick&#xD;
      test (SPT), and peanut-specific IgE, so that they can be related to the overall allergic&#xD;
      population. Relevant history (all reactions related to peanut and any other foods, other&#xD;
      allergic co-morbidities, other medical conditions, medications, family history, etc.) will be&#xD;
      recorded. A physical examination will be performed including skin prick tests to peanut and&#xD;
      the routine inhalant allergen panel. Blood work will be done as a baseline measure and&#xD;
      analyzed as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin Prick Test (SPT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a positive SPT is needed to qualify participants for the study, each prospective&#xD;
      participant will have a SPT during the screening visit. SPTs will be judged and recorded&#xD;
      based on the size of the wheal (raised welt around prick site) and flare (reddened area&#xD;
      around wheal) as compared to the positive and negative control skin tests after 15-30 minutes&#xD;
      [9]. A SPT is deemed positive by comparison to the negative control skin test. Skin test&#xD;
      reaction wheals with diameters 3 mm greater than those of the negative saline control are&#xD;
      considered positive. The diameter of the wheal and the diameter of the wheal and flare will&#xD;
      be recorded. A record of the peanut SPT size will be kept via cellophane tape recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood draw&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening visit, a blood sample will be taken from prospective participants in&#xD;
      order to test the in vitro peanut-specific IgE level. The amount of blood drawn will be&#xD;
      dependent on the age and weight of the subject (see Appendix III). The blood will be&#xD;
      separated so that the serum can be submitted for specific testing against peanut proteins.&#xD;
      Testing for IgE to peanut requires only a few milliliters of serum. The remaining serum will&#xD;
      be used to identify specific proteins in peanuts that bind IgE from each subject's serum and&#xD;
      characterization of those peanut proteins. Serum samples will be coded to protect the&#xD;
      identity of the subjects, stored at McMaster University Medical Centre, and used until&#xD;
      supplies are exhausted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double Blind Placebo Controlled Food Challenge&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will come to the Allergy Clinic at McMaster University Medical Centre for the&#xD;
      DBPCFC, which will take 2 days. Each visit will last a minimum of 4 hours with a minimum of&#xD;
      one week between the food challenge visits. Oral food challenges will occur in a clinical&#xD;
      setting allowing for prompt medical treatment if necessary during the protocol. Participants&#xD;
      will be monitored by qualified medical personnel. An IV will be put in place prior to the&#xD;
      start of the challenge. In the extremely unlikely event that the subject has a severe&#xD;
      reaction during the challenge, a code cart or special emergency supplies including intubation&#xD;
      equipment and defibrillator will be available and epinephrine and other medications will be&#xD;
      administered according to the severity of reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be randomized to receive either peanut on Day 1 and placebo on Day 2 or&#xD;
      vice versa. The randomization process and challenge materials are described in detail below.&#xD;
      On the 'peanut' day, participants will be orally challenged with 17 doses of peanut masked in&#xD;
      a suitable food matrix, such as applesauce or chocolate pudding. To ensure the establishment&#xD;
      of a NOAEL, the starting dose will be 0.1mg, 50-30 times lower than what has previously been&#xD;
      reported. The progression of dosing will follow a defined schedule up to 5000g. On a separate&#xD;
      day, participants will be challenged with an equivalent series of placebo doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To start the challenge, each participant will be given a small amount of either peanut&#xD;
      (masked in the challenge vehicle) starting at 0.1 mg or placebo. Doses will be given at 20-30&#xD;
      minute intervals and participants will be monitored continuously between doses. The dose of&#xD;
      peanut will be increased following the progression above until:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. One or more of the following objective findings are observed:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Rash: erythema, morbilliform rash, urticarial, angioedema&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Ocular: conjunctival swelling, scleral edema, tearing&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Nasal: congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Gastrointestinal: vomiting, diarrhea&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Systemic: blood pressure drop by â‰¥ 20%&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The final dose of peanut is reached&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Physician's discretion&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjective and objective symptoms will be fully recorded on the data collection forms.&#xD;
      Vital signs (oxygen saturation, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate) will be&#xD;
      assessed before every dose, with every new subjective symptom reported, and when objective&#xD;
      findings are observed. The challenge may be stopped at the discretion of the principal&#xD;
      investigator if the participant cannot tolerate the subjective symptoms. Once objective&#xD;
      reactive symptoms are observed, the challenge will immediately be stopped and the participant&#xD;
      will receive appropriate medication which may include epinephrine, antihistamine, or steroids&#xD;
      to manage the reaction. Participants will be observed for a minimum of 2 hours after an&#xD;
      allergic reaction has occurred to ensure that it has been adequately treated and resolved.&#xD;
