  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this sub-study is to determine whether healthy individuals over 90 years of age&#xD;
      possess immune cells that are involved in protection from chronic disease. The immune system&#xD;
      is well known to produce anti-cancer and other immune cells, called antibodies that can be&#xD;
      beneficial to our health. In this study the investigators will evaluate the immune status of&#xD;
      the healthy individuals over 90 years of age. The investigators will be focused on studying&#xD;
      molecules known to be involved in cholesterol, cancer like those for prostate cancer and&#xD;
      breast cancer, inflammatory diseases, and infectious diseases like influenza.&#xD;

      The aim of this sub-study is to determine whether the Wellderly posess neutralizing&#xD;
      antibodies targeting antigens involved in chronic disease. The humoral immune system is well&#xD;
      known to produce anti-cancer and other antibodies that can be long lived in vivo. In this&#xD;
      study we will evaluate the antibody status of the Wellderly with respect to neutralizing (i)&#xD;
      molecules known to induce cholesterol like PCSK9, (ii) antibodies against cancer antigens&#xD;
      like PMSA (prostate cancer) or Her2 (Breast cancer), (iii) antibodies against inflammatory&#xD;
      molecules like TNFa or IL-6, (iv) antibodies that have broad neutralizing activity against&#xD;
      infectious diseases like influenza.&#xD;

    <description>We have made phage display libraries from the antibody genes derived from Wellderly B-cells. Remarkably, we could identify specific antibodies against several targets involved in multiple chronic diseases including PCSK9, inflammatory cytokines, and influenza hemaglutinin. We hypothesize that the Wellderly may contain antibodies targeting antigens involved in chronic disease, and that these antibodies may be protective and health-promoting.</description>
