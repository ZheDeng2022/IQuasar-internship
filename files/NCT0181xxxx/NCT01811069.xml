  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper airway obstruction (UAO) during induction of general anesthesia is a frequently&#xD;
      occurring complication. The mechanism of UAO during anesthesia shares many similarities with&#xD;
      the upper airway obstruction observed during obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Obesity is major&#xD;
      risk factors for OSA and obese patients have a higher prevalence of UAO during anesthesia.&#xD;
      The change of body position improved upper airway stability during sleep in patients with&#xD;
      OSA.We hypothesis that the 30˚ reverse trendelenburg body position maintain airway patency in&#xD;
      obese patients during general anesthesia.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, observational study. Fifteen subjects with BMI limited in the range of&#xD;
      30 kg/m2 to 50 kg/m2, between 18-65 years of age meeting ASA physical status classification&#xD;
      I-III requiring general anesthesia for elective surgery will be recruited from the main&#xD;
      operating room of the Massachusetts General Hospital. We will start the recruiting process at&#xD;
      least 12 hours ahead of the surgery at a pre-admission test area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI/Co-I who approaches a potential subject who has expressed interest will not be the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist providing anesthesia care for the subjects. In addition the PI/Co-I&#xD;
      approaching the patient will reinforce that she or he does not have to participate and that&#xD;
      the decision not to participate will not affect their care at anytime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Principal Investigator or Co-Investigator will participate in the informed consent&#xD;
      process in operative holding area. Subjects to be recruited will be given a thorough review&#xD;
      of the informed consent, as well as the study purpose and procedures, and its risks,&#xD;
      discomforts, and potential benefits. When the subject is comfortable with and knowledgeable&#xD;
      about the protocol, he or she will sign the consent form in the presence of the investigator.&#xD;
      Investigator will also sign the informed consent form. All subjects will be given ample time&#xD;
      to read the consent form and consider participating in the trial. Any complaint or problems&#xD;
      related to our recruitment plan will report in real time to the IRB.&#xD;

        classification I-III Requiring general anesthesia for elective surgery -&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with major cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cerebral vascular&#xD;
             disease or American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class IV or greater.&#xD;

          2. Abnormal vital signs on the day of admission for surgery [heart rate (HR, &gt;100 bpm or&#xD;
             &lt; 40 bpm), blood pressure (BP, &gt;180/100 mmHg or &lt; 90/60 mmHg), room air transcutaneous&#xD;
