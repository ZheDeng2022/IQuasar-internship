  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death world-wide.&#xD;
      Dyspnea (i.e., sensations of breathlessness) is the hallmark symptom of patients with this&#xD;
      disease. Pulmonary rehabilitation programs that incorporate exercise training remain the most&#xD;
      effective non-pharmacological method of reducing dyspnea in COPD, however it is not&#xD;
      understood how exercise training relieves dyspnea. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to determine if pulmonary rehabilitation can reduce the disparity between the drive to&#xD;
      breathe and the breathing response in patients with COPD and to determine if this reduction&#xD;
      is associated with improvements in dyspnea during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise pulmonary rehabilitation will reduce dyspnea at a standardized&#xD;
      work rate and this reduction will be directly related to an improvement in the breathing&#xD;
      response.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if 8 weeks of pulmonary rehabilitation can reduce&#xD;
      neuromechanical uncoupling (a disparity between the effort/drive to breathe and the breathing&#xD;
      response) in patients with COPD and to determine if this reduction is associated with&#xD;
      improvements in both the intensity and qualitative dimensions of dyspnea during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary rehabilitation is an exercise and education intervention designed to help patients&#xD;
      cope with their dyspnea, and exercise effectively. Pulmonary rehabilitation programs that&#xD;
      incorporate exercise training are the most effective non-pharmacological method of reducing&#xD;
      dyspnea in COPD. However, the precise mechanisms of dyspnea relief following exercise&#xD;
      training are still unknown. Understanding the pathophysiologcal underpinnings of this&#xD;
      debilitating symptom is critical in order to develop effective symptom-based strategies for&#xD;
      dyspnea management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with COPD will report to the exercise laboratory on 3 separate visits. Visit 1&#xD;
      will serve as an initial screening visit whereby participants will provide written informed&#xD;
      consent prior to familiarization of all testing procedures and symptom scales followed by&#xD;
      completion of an incremental cycle exercise test. The remaining 2 experimental visits will be&#xD;
      conducted immediately before and after 8 weeks of pulmonary rehabilitation. Visits 2 and 3&#xD;
      will include: symptom-related questionnaires, pulmonary function tests, functional ability&#xD;
      test and a constant-work rate (CWR) cycle exercise test at 75% of the maximal work rate&#xD;
      achieved during visit 1. The CWR cycle exercise tests will be performed with the&#xD;
      instrumentation of an esophageal catheter and detailed physiological and sensory measurements&#xD;
      will be obtained on both visits. The comparison of data from visits 2 and 3 will address the&#xD;
      investigators' hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participants: The study will include 12 COPD participants in total. Pulmonary&#xD;
      Rehabilitation: The pulmonary rehabilitation program provides education and exercise training&#xD;
      for patients with chronic lung disease to assist them with symptom management and improve&#xD;
      their daily ability to function. The 8 week program involves 3 visits per week for 2 hours&#xD;
      each visit (1 hour education and 1 hour exercise training). The pulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
      program is usual care for all participants in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Protocol: A symptom-limited incremental exercise test will be performed on visit 1&#xD;
      using an electronically braked cycle ergometer according to recommended guidelines. The test&#xD;
      will consist of steady-state rest for 10 minutes, a 1 minute warm-up at 0 watts, and 10 watt&#xD;
      stepwise increases in work rate every minute until symptom-limitation. The CWR test performed&#xD;
      on visits 2 and 3 will consist of a 1 minute warm-up followed by an increase in work rate to&#xD;
      75% of the maximum incremental work rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements Pulmonary Function: Spirometry, plethysmography, diffusing capacity, and maximum&#xD;
      respiratory pressures will be performed on visit 1 according to standard recommendation.&#xD;
      Visits 2 and 3 will include spirometry, plethysmography, and maximum respiratory pressures. A&#xD;
      commercially available cardiopulmonary testing system (Vmax 229d with Autobox 6,200 DL;&#xD;
      SensorMedics, Yorba Linda, CA) will be used, and all measurements will be expressed as&#xD;
      percent of predicted normal values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dyspnea Evaluation: Dyspnea intensity (defined as &quot;the sensation of laboured or difficult&#xD;
      breathing&quot;) and perceived leg discomfort will be evaluated at rest, every minute during&#xD;
      exercise, and at peak exercise using the modified 10-point Borg scale on all testing visits.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to describe their dyspnea during exercise prior to the intensity&#xD;
      ratings and at end-exercise using the following 3 descriptors: (1) &quot;my breathing requires&#xD;
      more work and effort&quot; (work and effort); (2) &quot;I cannot get enough air in&quot; (unsatisfied&#xD;
      inspiration); (3) &quot;I cannot get enough air out&quot; (unsatisfied expiration). None to all 3 of&#xD;
      the descriptors can be chosen at any one time. Upon exercise cessation, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to verbalize their main reason(s) for stopping exercise (i.e., breathing discomfort,&#xD;
      leg discomfort, combination of breathing and legs, or some other reason) and to select&#xD;
      qualitative descriptors of breathlessness using an established questionnaire. Pre- to&#xD;
      post-intervention changes in dyspnea will also be assessed with the Transition Dyspnea Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardio-respiratory Responses to Exercise: Standard cardio-respiratory measures will be&#xD;
      recorded on a breath-by-breath basis and averaged over 30-second epochs, including minute&#xD;
      ventilation (V'E), oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide production (CO2), partial&#xD;
      pressure of end-tidal CO2, (tidal volume) VT, and breathing frequency (Vmax 229d with Autobox&#xD;
      6,200 DL; SensorMedics, Yorba Linda, CA). Operating volumes (i.e., end-expiratory and&#xD;
      end-inspiratory lung volumes) will be derived from dynamic inspiratory capacity (IC)&#xD;
      manoeuvres as previously described 26. For safety purposes, electrocardiography will be&#xD;
      monitored using a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure will be measured using a&#xD;
      manual sphygmomanometer, and arterial oxygen saturation will be monitored using pulse&#xD;
      oximetry. Exercise tests will be terminated based on established criteria as per American&#xD;
      College of Sports Medicine guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory Mechanics: Diaphragmatic electromyography (EMGdi) will be measured using a&#xD;
      multi-pair electrode catheter that combines two balloons for measuring esophageal and gastric&#xD;
      pressures. Lidocaine spray or gel (a local anaesthetic) will be used to freeze the&#xD;
      participant's nose and back of their throat. After which, while the participant sips water&#xD;
      through a straw, an experienced technician will insert the catheter through the participants&#xD;
      nose and into their stomach via their esophagus. The catheter will be positioned based on the&#xD;
      strength of EMGdi signal during spontaneous breathing. The raw EMGdi signal will be converted&#xD;
      to a root mean square (RMS). The maximum RMS for each inspiration will be determined between&#xD;
      QRS complexes to avoid the influence of ECG artefact 30. Maximal EMGdi (EMGdimax) will be&#xD;
      obtained during IC, sniff and maximal inspiratory pressure manoeuvres. The ratio of EMGdi to&#xD;
      EMGdimax will be used as an index of neural respiratory drive. The ratio between VT and vital&#xD;
      capacity (VC) will be used to represent the mechanical response of the respiratory system.&#xD;
      Normalizing for EMGdimax and VC allows the stimulus intensity to be standardized and compared&#xD;
      across individuals. Thus neuromechanical uncoupling of the respiratory system will be&#xD;
      determined as the ratio (or interaction) between neural drive and the mechanical response of&#xD;
      the respiratory system (EMGdi/EMGdimax : VT/VC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanical work of breathing (WOB) will be determined using modified Campbell diagrams as&#xD;
      used previously. Chest wall compliance will be obtained from the literature and positioned as&#xD;
      previously described. The WOB will be partitioned into its resistive and elastic components.&#xD;
      This data will be compared to the WOB data in previous COPD studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle oxygenation and hemodynamics: Muscle oxygenation will be noninvasively monitored using&#xD;
      near infrared spectroscopy. A four-channel continuous-wave near-infrared spectroscope (Oxymon&#xD;
      M III, Artinis Medical Systems, BV, The Netherlands) will be used to determine oxyhemoglobin,&#xD;
      deoxyhemoglobin, and total hemoglobin by measuring light attenuation at 760 and 864 nm&#xD;
      wavelengths, and analyzed using algorithms based on the modified Beer-Lambert law. This data&#xD;
      will be used for descriptive exploratory purposes as limited data exists on the muscle&#xD;
      oxygenation of the legs (vastus lateralis) and respiratory muscles (sternocleidomastoid,&#xD;
      parasternal, and intercostals) in COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflection Point of the VT and V'E Relationship: VT data will be averaged over 30-second&#xD;
      epochs and will be plotted against V'E at rest and throughout all exercise intensities for&#xD;
      each individual participant. The point at which VT deviates from linearity and begins to&#xD;
      plateau will be defined as the inflection point of the VT and V'E relationship. Two different&#xD;
      observers will determine the inflection point for each participant during the incremental&#xD;
      exercise test by examining individual Hey plots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Data will be presented as means ± SD unless otherwise specified. Pre&#xD;
      and post-pulmonary rehabilitation descriptive characteristics, exercise responses, and Borg&#xD;
      ratings at standardized evaluation points (10 watt increments, VT/V'E inflection, and peak)&#xD;
      will be compared using paired t-tests with Bonferroni corrections where appropriate. Pearson&#xD;
      correlation coefficients will be used to examine the association between measured variables:&#xD;
      neuromechanical uncoupling, breathing pattern, operational lung volumes, Borg ratings, and&#xD;
      exercise variables. Reasons for stopping exercise and qualitative descriptors of dyspnea will&#xD;
      be analyzed as frequency statistics and compared between pre and post pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation using the McNemar's exact test at standardized 10 watt increments in&#xD;
      work-rate, VT/V'E inflection, and peak exercise. A P-value less than 0.05 will be regarded as&#xD;
      statistically significant. Statistical analysis of the data will be performed using Stata&#xD;
      v11.2 (StataCorp, Texas, USA).&#xD;
