  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RV1729 is a new medicine being developed for possible treatment of asthma and smoking related&#xD;
      lung disease (also known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - COPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of single and repeat doses of RV1729.&#xD;
