      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium is an important problem in critical care. Its prevalence often reaches 75% in&#xD;
      intensive care patients. Its occurrence is associated with numerous complications and&#xD;
      deleterious consequences such as death, longer stay, higher cost, and long-term cognitive&#xD;
      impairment. Delirium treatment entails correcting its underlying causes and usually&#xD;
      initiating a pharmacological intervention with an antipsychotic. Typical antipsychotics,&#xD;
      particularly haloperidol, are commonly used to treat delirium although few placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trials of pharmacological treatments for delirium have been conducted. Furthermore,&#xD;
      appropriate doses for delirium treatment have yet to be established. In critical care, two&#xD;
      pilot studies provided the first randomized, placebo-controlled evidence for the&#xD;
      pharmacologic treatment of ICU delirium. One found that neither haloperidol nor ziprasidone&#xD;
      significantly reduced the incidence or duration of delirium compared with placebo whereas the&#xD;
      other one found that quetiapine added to as-needed haloperidol resulted in faster delirium&#xD;
      resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to determine the effectiveness of antipsychotics in regular dosage&#xD;
      regimen (quetiapine group and haloperidol group) compared to as-needed haloperidol (placebo&#xD;
      group) in the pharmacological treatment of delirium. We will conduct a three-arm randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to achieve this goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During one year, 45 delirious patients from three intensive care units will be recruited and&#xD;
      randomized into one of three groups. Randomization will be performed in blocks of 9 by the&#xD;
      pharmacy department, using a random numbers table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be continuously screened for delirium using the Intensive Care Delirium&#xD;
      Screening Checklist (ICDSC) as part of routine care. A positive screening score (≥4) will&#xD;
      warrant confirmation of delirium diagnosis by the treating physician. Treatment will begin&#xD;
      according to randomization group, provided that informed consent has been obtained. Delirium&#xD;
      status will be monitored during the episode using the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale&#xD;
      (Nu-DESC). When the Nu-DESC monitoring will become negative for delirium (total score below&#xD;
      2), the resolution of the episode will be confirmed by the treating physician. A clinical&#xD;
      evaluation by a psychiatrist will be performed within 24-48 hours of each of the two&#xD;
      evaluations made by the treating physician (beginning and end of the delirium episode).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treating physician will initiate twice-daily treatment at the first of five levels for&#xD;
      each of the three groups: 1) 1 mg of intravenous (IV) haloperidol + oral (PO) placebo, 2) 50&#xD;
      mg of PO quetiapine + IV placebo, or 3) IV + PO placebo. Therapy will be titrated upwards on&#xD;
      a daily basis by increments of 1) 1 mg of IV haloperidol or 2) 50 mg of PO quetiapine, or 3)&#xD;
      IV + PO placebo every 12 hrs, respectively, if the subject received at least two doses of&#xD;
      as-needed haloperidol in the previous 24 hrs. As-needed (PRN) doses of 2 mg of IV haloperidol&#xD;
      q 30 minutes will be available to patients from all three groups and administered by nurses&#xD;
      until symptoms associated with delirium resolve. In case of unsuccessful as-needed treatment,&#xD;
      rescue (STAT) doses of 5 mg of IV haloperidol q 30 minutes will be available to patients from&#xD;
      all three groups and will be administered by nurses if agreement is reached with the treating&#xD;
      physician that the situation indeed calls for it. The treatment level of patients requiring a&#xD;
      STAT dose will immediately be raised to the above level. The treatment will stop when one of&#xD;
      the following occurs: (1) the subject is deemed by the treating physicians, based on their&#xD;
      clinical judgment, to no longer demonstrate signs of delirium and, therefore, to no longer&#xD;
      require scheduled therapy with an antipsychotic agent; (2) 21 days of therapy has elapsed;&#xD;
      (3) ICU discharge occurred; or (4) a life-threatening adverse event potentially attributable&#xD;
      to the study drug occurred that warranted discontinuation of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse effects will be closely monitored: extrapyramidal reactions, neuroleptic malignant&#xD;
      syndrome, drowsiness, hypotension, QTc prolongation. The treatment level of patients&#xD;
      presenting a non life-threatening adverse event will immediately be lowered to the level&#xD;
      directly below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated for a 2-tailed test with an alpha of .05 and a power of .80.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary statistical analysis will involve Cox proportional time to event analysis&#xD;
      comparing the three groups. Secondary analysis will use T-test comparisons for continuous&#xD;
      variables and chi square for proportional analysis.&#xD;
