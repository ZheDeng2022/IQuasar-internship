      1. PURPOSE To analyze the correlation between pleural elastance and the radiological&#xD;
           effectiveness (measured by chest tomography) of pleurodesis performed via catheters in&#xD;
           patients with RMPE. The secondary objectives of this study are: correlate pleural&#xD;
           elastance with quality of life, analysis of dyspnea and pain after the procedure,&#xD;
           clinical effectiveness, complications and mortality in 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. METHODS Patients who participate in this study will be selected at the Pleural Diseases&#xD;
           Clinic of Department of Thoracic Surgery and Department of Pulmonology of the Medical&#xD;
           School of USP. Shall be deemed elected patients with: malignant pleural effusion&#xD;
           diagnosed by pleural fluid cytology and / or pleural biopsy; recurrent pleural effusion&#xD;
           (new accumulation of fluid after puncture) and symptoms (dyspnea and / or chest pain);&#xD;
           parcial lung expansion (&gt; 50%) after puncture emptying confirmed by chest radiography;&#xD;
           Karnofsky index (KPS - Karnofsky Performance Status) &gt; 30; and agreed to participate in&#xD;
           the study and sign an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will include 140 patients in the study, predicting loss of some&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. PROCEDURE After insertion of the tube, this will be fixed to the skin with nonabsorbable&#xD;
           sutures and wound covered with a bandage. The catheter is connected to a three-way&#xD;
           stopcock. On its output side is connected to a delivery unit for measuring central&#xD;
           venous pressure or a gear connected to an electronic transducer of vascular pressure. In&#xD;
           the output is connected to the distal extension tube with the proximal end of the valve&#xD;
           and the distal end of Heimlich is connected to a collection bag. The pleural pressure&#xD;
           level will be zero at the time of the insertion site of the drain on the skin. The&#xD;
           pleural pressure is set to the value measured at end-expiration. The pleural pressure is&#xD;
           measured at baseline, after withdrawal of 10 ml of liquid and thereafter every 400 ml of&#xD;
           pleural effusion evacuated to the pressure to be negative, from that moment the&#xD;
           measurement will occur every 200 ml of pleural effusion drained to obtain 800 ml of&#xD;
           liquid. Patients that are removed less than 800 ml of liquid will be excluded from the&#xD;
           protocol. The pleural elastance is then calculated in cm H2O / L and the data placed in&#xD;
           a pressure curve by volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A chest radiograph is performed and the patient will be eligible for pleurodesis if&#xD;
           there is a lung expansion that will allow some contact between the pleural surfaces,&#xD;
           even partially.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The eligible patients for pleurodesis will be referred to an outpatient procedure room&#xD;
           or remain in their ward beds, where, under sterile conditions will be submitted to the&#xD;
           instillation of silver nitrate or talc mineral. Analgesia is given only when necessary.&#xD;
           The drain is kept closed for one hour, after this period, the drain is opened and the&#xD;
           patient discharged and instructed to return within 1 week in outpatient cases. A CT of&#xD;
           the chest will be held in the near-pleurodesis, while the patient is still on the drain&#xD;
           and with a maximum of five days after pleurodesis. In the outpatient possible&#xD;
           complications are evaluated. The drain is removed when less than 100 ml/day of pleural&#xD;
           fluid is drained.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After removal of the drain will be scheduled one month in return for clinical evaluation&#xD;
           and another CT scan of the chest. Since then the returns will be quarterly. In all&#xD;
           returns will be evaluated further chest radiographs, questionnaires of quality of life,&#xD;
           dyspnea and pain shall be applied and will be actively investigated the occurrence of&#xD;
           complications. Patients who fail to attend the consultation will be contacted by phone.&#xD;
           Non-scheduled queries occur in case of clinical necessity (relapses, complications, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blinding The investigator will make measurements of pleural elastance not follow the&#xD;
           patients. Researchers who make assessments of patients and CT scans of the chest after&#xD;
           drainage and pleurodesis will be blinded to the measurements of pleural elastance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. OUTCOMES 4.1) RADIOLOGICAL EFFECTIVE In this study, the effectiveness will be measured&#xD;
           by radiographic tomography of the chest. Will be measured volumes of pleural fluid in&#xD;
           chest CT after placement of the drain and 1 month after pleurodesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be subjected to computed tomography of the chest without contrast. This will&#xD;
      be measured through the volume of pleural fluid. With use of axial slices, stipulate every 2&#xD;
      cm segments. Will calculate the area occupied by the pleural effusion. Multiplying the height&#xD;
      of 2 cm will approximate the volume of this segment. Be inferred from the approximate volume&#xD;
      of pleural effusion by adding the volumes of all segments of 2 cm. The unit of volume is&#xD;
      milliliter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference between volumes 1 month and near-pleurodesis indicate how much was the&#xD;
      re-accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, thus we provide a numerical value to be&#xD;
      related to the numerical value of pleural elastance. In case of recurrence within 30 days,&#xD;
      the TC will be held and that value will be considered post-pleurodesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2) CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS In this study, the clinical effectiveness will be considered a&#xD;
      binary variable (success or failure). We will consider failure of pleurodesis when, at any&#xD;
      time of follow-up procedure was necessary some new procedure for emptying pleural effusion,&#xD;
      is puncture, drainage or thoracoscopy. Such procedures shall be appointed by the surgical&#xD;
      team of the Pleural Diseases Clinic of the HCFMUSP considering clinical criteria (symptoms:&#xD;
      dyspnea, cough and chest pain) and radiological (new fluid accumulation in chest tomography).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3) ANALYSIS OF QUALITY OF LIFE To analyze the quality of life the investigators use the&#xD;
      WHOQoL-Bref. The WHOQOL-Bref is a reduced version of the questionnaire of quality of life&#xD;
      developed by the World Health Organization multi-cultural context, aiming to cover as many&#xD;
      countries and cultures as possible and thus can be used internationally, allowing the&#xD;
      comparison between the results obtained in different locations. This questionnaire has been&#xD;
      validated for the Portuguese language and covers the following areas: quality of life and&#xD;
      general health (scored by the patient), physical, psychological, social and environmental.&#xD;
      This questionnaire has been previously used for analysis of quality of life after pleurodesis&#xD;
      and will be applied by the same investigator during the initial evaluation, the returns one&#xD;
      month after the procedure and then quarterly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4) ANALYSIS OF PAIN Pain assessment will be made by patient´s quantifying of the Visual&#xD;
      Analog Scale of Pain. The questionnaire will be applied by the same investigator during the&#xD;
      initial evaluation, the returns one month after the procedure and then quarterly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5) ANALYSIS OF DYSPNEA The analysis of dyspnea will be made by quantifying the&#xD;
      functionality with the dyspnea scale of the British Medical Research Council (MRC). The&#xD;
      questionnaire will be applied by the same investigator during the initial evaluation, the&#xD;
      returns one month after the procedure and then quarterly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.6) SECURITY ANALYSIS For the analysis of safety procedures shall be deemed times of&#xD;
      hospitalization and drainage and occurrence of complications. Such data will be obtained&#xD;
      during the inpatient and outpatient follow-up as previously described. The expected&#xD;
      complications, and actively investigated, as the group's experience and literature are fever,&#xD;
      bleeding, infection (pulmonary and / or pleural), abdominal pain, prolonged drainage (&gt; 10&#xD;
      days), air leak, subcutaneous emphysema, respiratory failure, reexpansion edema and death&#xD;
      related to the procedure. Other complications will be recorded as the occurrence and graded&#xD;
      according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 - DATA COLLECTION Initial Assessment Will be collected the following data: age, sex,&#xD;
      primary tumor and number of puncture. All data will be included in a spreadsheet program SPSS&#xD;
      (Chicago, IL) and patients' names deleted after completion of collection. During the initial&#xD;
      assessment will also be filled in the questionnaires of quality of life WHO-Qol, MRC dyspnea&#xD;
      scale and Visual Analog Scale of Pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the pleural drainage will be collected initial data from PP, the intermediate and&#xD;
      final and calculated elastance of the pleural space&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up After chest tube removal patients will return in a month and then every three&#xD;
      months or as symptoms. In case of non-attendance, telephone contacts will be established and,&#xD;
      in case of death, the date will be noted for purposes of construction of the survival curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all returns the clinical data will be annotated seeking occurrence of any complications.&#xD;
      The quality of life questionnaires will be used again as soon as new chest X-rays are&#xD;
      performed. Examinations and additional consultations will be conducted according to clinical&#xD;
      need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6) ANALYSIS OF OUTCOMES Radiation Effectiveness The difference between the pleural volume&#xD;
      after 30 days and peri-pleurodesis be correlated with measured pleural elastance. The&#xD;
      significance of this correlation is evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Will&#xD;
      be considered significant p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be used to establish the linear regression equation that can predict the volume of&#xD;
      pleural fluid reacúmulo expected based on the measured pleural elastance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Effectiveness The clinical effectiveness will be considered as a categorical value&#xD;
      and will be correlated with pleural elastance. The significance of this correlation will be&#xD;
      assessed by the Spearman test. Will be considered significant p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Try Doc through a curve and the area under the curve values of elastance set from which there&#xD;
      is reduced clinical effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life The differences in scores on the questionnaire of quality of life in each of&#xD;
      its four areas after pleurodesis and before the same shall be correlated with pleural&#xD;
      elastance. The significance of these correlations will be assessed through the Pearson&#xD;
      correlation coefficient. Will be considered significant p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain The difference in pain scores in the questionnaire after pleurodesis and before the same&#xD;
      shall be correlated with pleural elastance. The significance of this correlation is evaluated&#xD;
      using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Will be considered significant p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dyspnea Dyspnea is considered as categorical value and will be correlated with pleural&#xD;
      elastance. The significance of this correlation will be assessed by the Spearman test. Will&#xD;
      be considered significant p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications Complications will be considered as categorical value (score ≥ 3 and ≤ 2 by&#xD;
      CTCAE) and will be correlated with the pleural elastance. The significance of these&#xD;
      correlations will be assessed through the Spearman test. Will be considered significant p&#xD;
      &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3) SURVIVAL A survival curve is constructed considering pleurodesis initial time and death&#xD;
      as the event. Censored are those which have not undergone the event until the end time of the&#xD;
      analysis. Cox regression will be held to the relevance of the following factors on mortality:&#xD;
      pleural elastance, KPS and primary neoplasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology The measurement of partial elastance (first 800 ml) and not the total value can&#xD;
      change, since the pressure x volume curve is not always monophasic. The investigators will&#xD;
      measure the pressure until the end of the withdrawal of liquid and analyze the total&#xD;
      elastance, noting whether there will be significant changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pleural pressure measurements and the water column pressure transducer vascular are&#xD;
      superimposable. Therefore, the investigators don't see problems in measuring pleural pressure&#xD;
      by different methods, depending on the non-availability of the transducer in all clinics and&#xD;
      wards of our hospital.&#xD;
