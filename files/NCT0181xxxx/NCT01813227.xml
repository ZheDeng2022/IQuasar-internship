  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an investigational&#xD;
      study drug called carfilzomib. The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or&#xD;
      bad, it has on patients and their cancer if treatment continues beyond previous carfilzomib&#xD;
      treatment study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carfilzomib (KyprolisTM) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be&#xD;
      used only in certain U.S. patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma that have&#xD;
      tried and failed other therapies. It has not been approved to be used for any other disease&#xD;
      or condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, carfilzomib is referred to as an investigational study drug because it is not&#xD;
      approved for use in all patients with multiple myeloma in the United States, and it is not&#xD;
      approved by some regulatory authorities (the agencies that are responsible for approving the&#xD;
      use of a medicine in a country such as Health Canada).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carfilzomib is a type of drug called a proteasome inhibitor. A proteasome is a protein found&#xD;
      within cells that has the important role of identifying and marking damaged proteins that are&#xD;
      needed to be destroyed by the cell for survival. The inhibition of the proteasome allows for&#xD;
      damaged protein to accumulate within cells. This accumulation of damaged protein causes the&#xD;
      cell to die.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM) is a rare low-grade B-cell lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.&#xD;
      Overall reported incidences approximately 3 cases per million persons per year with about&#xD;
      1500 and cases diagnosed annually in United States. There is a higher incidence in males&#xD;
      compared to females (3.4 vs 1.7 cases per 1 million person-years at risk) and WM is nearly&#xD;
      twice as common among whites compared to blacks.[1] A familial form of the disease is also&#xD;
      recognized. WM is an indolent disease with an overall median survival of 5 years although&#xD;
      more recent data suggest a disease-specific median survival of 11.2 years, given the&#xD;
      frequently older age (median 63 years) and accompanying co-morbidities at diagnosis(1). WM is&#xD;
      characterized by infiltration of lymphoplasmacytic cells and bone marrow and by serum&#xD;
      immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal gammopathy. B-cell origin and some clinical cellular and&#xD;
      epidemiological features are shared among WM arises from intermediately mature B cells&#xD;
      (somatically mutated post germinal center the lymphocytes that have not yet undergone isotype&#xD;
      switching), as opposed to immature B cells from which chronic lymphocytic leukemia arises in&#xD;
      the fully mature, somatically mutated, from which cells multiple myeloma arises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no standard of care for WM (2). Therefore, involving the patient's in clinical&#xD;
      trials is strongly recommended whenever possible.&#xD;
