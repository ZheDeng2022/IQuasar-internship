      A multicenter prospective single arm interventional trial in hospitals where therapeutic&#xD;
      hypothermia is standard practice. This trial will enroll 50 subjects to evaluate the ability&#xD;
      of the ZOLL Intravascular Temperature Management (IVTM) System to induce, maintain, and&#xD;
      reverse mild therapeutic hypothermia and maintain normothermia post cardiac arrest.&#xD;

             Fibrillation/Tachycardia (VF/VT), Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA), or Asystole&#xD;
             (AS)] during EMS phase of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             OR:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Out-of-hospital unwitnessed cardiac arrest with VF upon EMS arrival&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Hypothermia initiated at a transferring facility prior to arrival at the enrolling&#xD;
             hospital (excludes pre-hospital IV fluids or cold packs for cooling by EMS)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Current Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) filter&#xD;
