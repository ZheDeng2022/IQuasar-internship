      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the emergence of the internet, health care professionals are changing the way they&#xD;
      approach diabetes management. Internet Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems (IBGMS) are aimed at&#xD;
      keeping blood glucose levels normal or in the range of acceptable levels to prevent the&#xD;
      complications associated with diabetes. The Principal Investigators have completed a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial supporting the efficacy of IBGMS (1,2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient satisfaction of reporting platform is essential to encourage patient reporting and&#xD;
      participation in IBGMS. In this study, we wish to compare two different types of meters which&#xD;
      will be used to internet blood glucose monitoring: the BG Star Meter (Conventional Meter),&#xD;
      and the iBG Star Group (iPhone Technology).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose and Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are more satisfied with their meter and internet reporting platform are more&#xD;
      likely to participate in an internet monitoring system. Patients often lack the motivation to&#xD;
      report to their endocrinologist. With increased reporting to their healthcare professional,&#xD;
      patients are more likely to benefit from such a system. This study aims to compare two types&#xD;
      of meters and their respective internet reporting platforms to encourage patient&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main goal is to compare the two types of meters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes Include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient Satisfaction as measured by the &quot;Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire&quot;&#xD;
           (DTSQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Frequency of reporting to endocrinologist&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Number of Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose (SMBG) tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Time taken to teach each patient the platforms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design/Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: 50 patients will be randomized into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BG Star Group (Conventional Meter) 25 patients will use the (conventional) BG star meter in&#xD;
      which patients will upload their readings onto a computer and send in their readings via&#xD;
      email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBG Star Group (iPhone Technology) 25 patients will be randomized to the iBGstar system will&#xD;
      upload their readings to their iPhone and send in their readings using the iPhone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from a Physician's private office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the (Conventional meter) BG star and iBG star (iPhone Technology) group will be asked to&#xD;
      perform SMBG 3 or more times per day and to upload their metered glucose values online every&#xD;
      2 weeks to be reviewed by the doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type 1s&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type 2s, can be on insulin, oral antihyperglycemic agents, or in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Willingness to test blood glucose levels a minimum of 3 times daily&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Willingness to be randomized&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trained in self-blood glucose monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Internet Access&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Patients who do not meet the above criteria or are not willing to&#xD;
      participate will not be included in the study.&#xD;

      Background/Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of diabetes is an evolving challenge to health care professionals. The&#xD;
      fluctuations of glucose levels over the lifetime of patients with diabetes can lead to&#xD;
      complications such as nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy and cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
      Although diabetes is a chronic disease, it can be controlled with use of medications (oral&#xD;
      agents or insulin), and/or changes in life-style and diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the emergence of the internet, health care professionals are changing the way they&#xD;
      approach diabetes management. Internet Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems (IBGMS) are aimed at&#xD;
      keeping blood glucose levels normal or in the range of acceptable levels to prevent the&#xD;

&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Patients who do not meet the above criteria or are not willing to&#xD;
      participate will not be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality According to the guidelines of the University of British Columbia&#xD;
      (UBC)/Providence Health Care Research Ethics Boards, the identity of participants will be&#xD;
      kept confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for each patient will be collected from the Clinical Research Coordinator and the&#xD;
      Internet based glucose monitoring system. These data will only be accessed by the&#xD;
      investigators and will be inputted into an ExcelÂ® spreadsheet where each patient will be&#xD;
      given a unique identifier. All data pertaining to individual patients will be kept locked in&#xD;
      the office of the study investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculations and Statistics Statistical analysis will be performed on site by the&#xD;
      researchers. Each group will complete the DTSQ. Questions revolve around satisfaction of&#xD;
      treatment and are to be answered on a scale of 1 (very dissatisfied) to 6 (very Satisfied).&#xD;
      Frequency of reporting will be determined through number of reports sent in per month. Total&#xD;
      strip count will be recorded for each group. Time will be measured for the time it takes to&#xD;
      train each patient in their respective meter/platform. All outcome measurements will be&#xD;
      analysed using independent samples t-tests. Participants will only be identified by coded&#xD;
      initials and a number to protect privacy.&#xD;
