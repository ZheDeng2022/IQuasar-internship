    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well carfilzomib and dexamethasone work in treating patients&#xD;
      with multiple myeloma who previously underwent a stem cell transplant. Carfilzomib may stop&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Immunosuppressive therapy, such as dexamethasone, may improve bone marrow function and&#xD;
      increase blood cell counts. Giving carfilzomib together with dexamethasone may be an&#xD;
      effective treatment for multiple myeloma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the complete response (CR) rate with carfilzomib and dexamethasone consolidation&#xD;
      following an upfront single stem cell transplant (SCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the toxicity of carfilzomib and dexamethasone when used as consolidation therapy&#xD;
      in patients post SCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the progression free rate at 1 and 2 years post SCT. III. To evaluate&#xD;
      progression-free survival and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the proportion of patients achieving a minimal residual disease (MRD)&#xD;
      negative status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the HevyLite assay prior to and during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and dexamethasone orally (PO)&#xD;
      on days 1, 2, 15, and 16. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 2 years.&#xD;
