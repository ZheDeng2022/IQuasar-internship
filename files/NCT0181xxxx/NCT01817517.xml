  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being performed to try to understand if the use of deep brain stimulation or&#xD;
      DBS can treat the symptoms of Tourette syndrome that do not respond well to current&#xD;
      medications. In order to do this the investigators will place small stimulation leads on both&#xD;
      sides of the brain in a region (a portion of the thalamus) that may alter the abnormal&#xD;
      activity in the brain contributing to the symptoms of Tourette syndrome. This requires two&#xD;
      surgical procedures, and several preoperative and postoperative visits for tuning the&#xD;
      stimulation parameters and recording stimulation effects. The FDA has not approved DBS for&#xD;
      use in people with Tourette syndrome, and Medtronic (the manufacturer of the device) has not&#xD;
      conducted testing for the system in Tourette syndrome. Therefore its use in this study is&#xD;
      experimental.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males and females who are &gt;=15 years of age. There is no strict age cutoff at the&#xD;
             upper limit of inclusion, however subjects may meet the exclusion criteria based on&#xD;
             medical contraindications to deep brain stimulation surgery (Points 3. and 6. under&#xD;
             the Exclusion Criteria). For subjects in the age range of 15-24 years, an additional&#xD;
             Ethics Committee consultation will be obtained prior to offering the subject the&#xD;
             required screening visit. This is based on the revised screening criteria now proposed&#xD;
             by Shrock, Mink, et al. on studies investigating DBS in TS. Additionally, for subjects&#xD;
             in the age range of 15-20, a caregiver will be required to be present for all study&#xD;
             visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has a diagnosis of TS as determined by a review of medical records, discussion&#xD;
             with referring psychiatrist as well as the DSM-IV criteria and videotaped assessment.&#xD;
             This will include an assessment to determine the presence of psychogenic tics,&#xD;
             embellishment, factitious symptoms, personality disorders and malingering.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject determined to be treatment-resistant for at least one year prior to the&#xD;
             Screening Visit as demonstrated by clinical evidence (determined by review of medical&#xD;
             records and discussion with referring psychiatrist or neurologist) of persistent&#xD;
             functionally impairing tics that have not responded to treatment with a minimum of&#xD;
             three adequate regimens of medication including two failed trials of at least one&#xD;
             typical neuroleptic and one atypical neuroleptic medication, along with one failed&#xD;
             trial of a first tier medication as defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Adequate trials of one non-neuroleptic medication including drugs from the&#xD;
                  following (first tier) list: clonidine, guanfacine, topiramate, baclofen,&#xD;
                  levetiracetam, and clonazepam. Trial failure is defined as demonstrated lack of&#xD;
                  efficacy or severe side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Two adequate trials of at least one typical neuroleptic medication (pimozide,&#xD;
                  fluphenazine, haloperidol) and at least one atypical neuroleptic (risperidone,&#xD;
                  aripiprazole, ziprasidone, olanzapine, quetiapine). Trial failure is defined as&#xD;
                  demonstrated lack of efficacy or severe side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A mandatory trial of behavioral interventions in an attempt to reduce the severity of&#xD;
             the tics or comorbid symptoms must also be completed by the subject before offering&#xD;
             participation in this trial. This may include habit reversal therapies, stress&#xD;
             reduction therapies, or other behavioral therapies under investigation for tic&#xD;
             suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has both significant vocal and motor tics with a tic subscale score of at&#xD;
             least 35 on the YGTSS (Yale Global Tic Severity Scale) at all three Baseline Visits&#xD;
             prior to undergoing surgery. For subjects with predominantly vocal tics (and minimal&#xD;
             motor) causing significant problems this score requirement will be reduced to 18,&#xD;
             similarly for subjects with predominantly motor tics (and minimal vocal) causing&#xD;
             significant problems the required score will be 18. A portion of the study team,&#xD;
             including the surgeon and two neurologists, will determine by consensus which category&#xD;
             the subject falls into and whether the tics are a significant problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. All other aspects of the subject's care must be optimized during the preceding 6&#xD;
             months before admission to the study. This includes treatment for comorbid medical,&#xD;
             neurological, and psychiatric disorders. Additionally, it includes psychological&#xD;
             interventions for any ongoing psychosocial problems the subject may have during the&#xD;
             preceding 6 months before study admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject must be ambulatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Females who are postmenopausal, physically incapable of childbearing, or practicing an&#xD;
             acceptable method of birth control. Acceptable methods of birth control include&#xD;
             surgical sterilization, hormonal contraceptives, or double-barrier methods (condom or&#xD;
             diaphragm with a spermicidal agent or intrauterine device [IUD]). If practicing an&#xD;
             acceptable method of birth control, a negative urine pregnancy test result has been&#xD;
             obtained at baseline Visits 1 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject is determined by an independent psychiatrist with expertise in capacity&#xD;
             assessments to have decision-making capacity to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject is able to read English, understand and cooperate with study procedures, and&#xD;
             has signed a written informed consent form prior to any study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has a positive urine drug screen at any of the three Baseline Visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject had major surgery within three months prior to Baseline Visit 1 or has other&#xD;
             surgery planned during the proposed study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is determined by medical consultant to have medical contraindications to&#xD;
             undergoing surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has a history of alcohol or drug abuse within the past 6 months and/or&#xD;
             dependence within the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has a medical illness/condition, and/or abnormal diagnostic finding that would&#xD;
             interfere with the completion of the study, confound the results of the study, or pose&#xD;
             risk to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has an untreated or uncontrolled Axis I disorder or other major psychiatric&#xD;
             disorder including major depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia as determined&#xD;
             by the screening psychiatrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject has either a current or past history of suicidal plan and/or intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject has a tic disorder or other movement disorder attributable to another medical,&#xD;
             neurological, or psychiatric disorder other than Tourette Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject has a drug-induced tic disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject has significant psychosocial factors that might increase the risk of the DBS&#xD;
             procedure or complicate recovery and outcome assessments. (Examples include - history&#xD;
             of noncompliance with previous medical and psychosocial treatments, multiple failed&#xD;
             medication treatments of inadequate dose or duration, a history of multiple other&#xD;
             surgical procedures with poor outcome, unexplained medical history gaps, or pending&#xD;
             lawsuits or other legal action.)&#xD;
&#xD;

             pacemaker, deep brain stimulator for a different disease, spinal cord stimulator,&#xD;
             cochlear implant, vagus nerve stimulator, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subject has participated in another investigational drug trial or therapeutic trial&#xD;
             within 30 days of Baseline Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subject has a diagnosis of intellectual disability with documented IQ&lt;70.&#xD;
