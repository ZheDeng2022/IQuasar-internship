  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first randomized trial comparing Early post-operative intraperitoneal&#xD;
      chemotherapy (EPIC) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) for appendiceal and&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad,&#xD;
      EPIC and HIPEC after cytoreductive surgery have on the patient and the appendiceal, rectal or&#xD;
      colon cancer.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of cerebrovascular disease. that would limit study compliance or place the&#xD;
             patient at unacceptable risk for participation in the study.&#xD;
