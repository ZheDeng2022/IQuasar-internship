  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Halo Index has utility in detecting the&#xD;
      difference between normal and non-normal recovery of patients in the first few hours&#xD;
      immediately following major inpatient surgery. A small but significant percentage of patients&#xD;
      who undergo major surgery will experience a major life-threatening complication in the first&#xD;
      30 days following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chance of developing one or more of these complications increases with the size of the&#xD;
      surgery and with the severity of the patient's preexisting medical problems. It is unknown&#xD;
      whether fluctuations in a patient's vital signs and other measures of bodily function that&#xD;
      occur early in the recovery period are associated with postoperative complications. If this&#xD;
      is so, it may be possible to predict who is at increased risk for complications based on&#xD;
      monitoring during the early recovery period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will make use of the Halo Index, a compilation of measures of patient functions&#xD;
      collected by non-invasive monitoring devices. In addition to heart rate, blood pressure,&#xD;
      temperature, and breathing rate, these include measures of dissolved oxygen in the blood, the&#xD;
      amount of hemoglobin in the blood, and other parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have two additional non-invasive monitors attached during their stay in the&#xD;
      hospital post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). After the patient has been discharged from the&#xD;
      hospital, their medical record will be reviewed at two time points: The first will be soon&#xD;
      after discharge. Normal recovery patients will be defined as those who require only IV&#xD;
      fluids, pain medications and anti-emetic medications. Non-normal recovery will include those&#xD;
      who require transfusions of blood products, airway interventions such as a breathing tube,&#xD;
      blood pressure medications, or heart rhythm medications. The second chart review will occur&#xD;
      30 days after surgery. In this review, the presence or absence of the following events will&#xD;
      be ascertained: rapid response team calls, admission to the intensive care unit, infection,&#xD;
      pneumonia, the need for transfusion of 5 or more units of blood within a three-day period,&#xD;
      septic shock, the need for ventilation with a breathing tube, blood clot in the lung, kidney&#xD;
      failure, coma, stroke, heart attack, and death.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to define normal and non-normal recovery of patients in the&#xD;
      post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) following major inpatient surgery using the Halo Index, a&#xD;
      measure derived from physiologic parameters collected through the Patient SafetyNet system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Masimo has developed a series of patient monitors designed to improve&#xD;
      perioperative care. The Radical-7 pulse oximeter not only delivers accurate,&#xD;
      artifact-rejecting pulse and oximetry information, but can also be configured to measure&#xD;
      hemoglobin levels and pleth variability index (an assessment of the adequacy of fluid volume&#xD;
      replacement). The rainbow Acoustic Respiration Monitor is able to document presence and&#xD;
      adequacy of ventilation. These parameters have been combined in the SafetyNet Remote&#xD;
      Monitoring system. With this system, data from individual patient monitors are wireless&#xD;
      transmitted to a central station. When certain alarm thresholds are crossed, the system can&#xD;
      automatically notify caregivers. Use of this system on a post-operative floor has shown it to&#xD;
      result in significantly fewer rapid response team (RRT) calls and ICU admission compared to&#xD;
      routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an enhancement, Masimo has developed the Halo Index. The Halo Index is calculated through&#xD;
      an amalgamation of SafetyNet parameters. The index provides global trend information about&#xD;
      the patient's overall physiologic status. Often patient deterioration occurs over time, with&#xD;
      subtle changes that are appreciated only through trend analysis. Conceptually, the Halo Index&#xD;
      and associated alarms will improve patient care compared with care based on periodic human&#xD;
      assessment and routine monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the SafetyNet and Halo index are intended for use on the post-operative patient care&#xD;
      floors with relatively high patient-to-nurse staffing ratios, there may well be monitoring&#xD;
      utility in the PACU, where there is greater patient acuity. It is quite possible that the&#xD;
      Halo index will be able to detect evidence of &quot;mal-recovery&quot; in the PACU and may allow&#xD;
      intervention in such patients that will improve outcome. Before such an assessment of benefit&#xD;
      can be made, it is necessary to define the behavior of the Halo index during &quot;normal&quot;&#xD;
      recovery and to see if the index has a different characteristic in those patients whose PACU&#xD;
      discharge is delayed for medical reasons or those who require unusual medical interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, significant percentage of patients who undergo major surgery will experience&#xD;
      morbidity in the first 30 days following surgery. Major morbidity can be defined as an&#xD;
      occurrence of one or more of the following postoperative complications: organ space&#xD;
      infection, pneumonia, unplanned intubation, pulmonary embolism, ventilator dependence more&#xD;
      than 48 hours, acute renal failure, stroke/cerebral vascular accident with neurologic&#xD;
      deficit, coma more than 24 hours, cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation,&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, transfusion of 5 or more units erythrocytes within 72 hours,&#xD;
      sepsis/septic shock, and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chance of developing one or more of these morbid outcomes increases with the size of the&#xD;
      surgery and with the severity of the patient's preexisting medical problems, ranging from&#xD;
      less than 1% to over 50% depending on these factors. It is unknown whether perturbations in&#xD;
      early recovery parameters are associated with postoperative morbidity. If so, it may be&#xD;
      possible to predict who is at increased risk for morbidity based on monitoring during the&#xD;
      early recovery period.&#xD;
