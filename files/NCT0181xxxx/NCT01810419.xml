    <textblock>
      In internal medicine, assessment of spleen size on physical examination is an extremely&#xD;
      important part of the overall evaluation of patients with many illnesses. Examination of the&#xD;
      spleen is also one of the core competencies that the investigators expect our students and&#xD;
      residents to learn as part of their training. Unfortunately, the sensitivity and specificity&#xD;
      of examination of the spleen at the bedside is not very good. The investigators wish to&#xD;
      determine if handheld ultrasound can accurately assess spleen size. Doing so would make&#xD;
      physical examination of the spleen obsolete and transform training objectives for medical&#xD;
      students and residents.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of splenomegaly (abnormal enlargement of the spleen) is extremely important in&#xD;
      managing patients with many medical conditions. The ability to recognize an enlarged spleen&#xD;
      in a timely manner can impact patient outcomes. Although the physical exam can be used to&#xD;
      confidently diagnosis massive enlargement of the spleen, evaluating lesser degrees of&#xD;
      splenomegaly at the bedside proves more difficult. In current practice, the gold standard for&#xD;
      diagnosis of splenomegaly is the standard abdominal ultrasound. The prevalence of&#xD;
      splenomegaly in patients with several medical conditions such as blood disorders and&#xD;
      cirrhosis is relatively high. Therefore, the demand for abdominal ultrasound is evergrowing&#xD;
      and similarly the cost of caring for patients with these diseases increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination of the spleen is one of the core competencies that we expect our students and&#xD;
      residents to learn as part of their training. This physical diagnosis manoeuver is frequently&#xD;
      used to examine residents at the Royal College level and determine their fitness to practice.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the sensitivity and specificity of examination of the spleen at the bedside is&#xD;
      not very good.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the introduction of handheld ultrasound (HCU) devices, rapid bedside assessment of a&#xD;
      patient is now possible. The Pocket-sized Vscan Ultrasound device (Vscan) (GE Healthcare,&#xD;
      USA) allows for 2D imaging on a 3.5 inch display and has been shown to have comparable image&#xD;
      quality to standard ultrasound for some applications. The Vscan and other HCU devices have&#xD;
      been used at point of care to evaluate a number of conditions and can greatly impact&#xD;
      treatment decisions in medical patients at the bedside. The ability to recognize splenomegaly&#xD;
      in a timely manner can impact patient outcomes. In addition, the use of this technology could&#xD;
      significantly impact training standards for students and residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It remains unclear whether bedside evaluation with the Vscan is able to accurately measure&#xD;
      spleen size. Our study aims to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the Vscan when used by&#xD;
      trained ultrasonographers, in patients with varying degrees of splenomegaly. If we can&#xD;
      reliably show that a trained ultrasonographer can accurately characterize spleen size at the&#xD;
      bedside with a handheld device, the next stage of the study will involve training medical&#xD;
      residents in the use of handheld ultrasound to see if they can also reliably assess spleen&#xD;
      size.&#xD;
