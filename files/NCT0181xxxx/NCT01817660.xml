      Weakness in the wall of a blood vessel located behind the knee (popliteal artery) which leads&#xD;
      to a swelling of this blood vessel (aneurysm) is one of the most common types of arterial&#xD;
      aneurysms. It is associated with significant risk of blood clot formation, narrowing of blood&#xD;
      vessel which can create a serious threat to individual's health. Currently, approved&#xD;
      treatment options for this condition include both open surgical and endovascular stent-graft&#xD;
      repairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the open repair procedure, the blood vessel behind the knee is tied up or removed and a&#xD;
      small artery is created using a vein on the same leg. This is also called a bypass procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the endovascular repair, using X-rays, doctors places a stent in the blood vessel. Stent&#xD;
      is a small device similar to a thin tube. When it is placed in the right location, your&#xD;
      doctor can open it. When stent is opened, it supports weakened blood vessel and blood goes&#xD;
      through it. The weakened artery then shrinks around the stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OVER-PAR is a short name for this study. Many hospitals in the United States agreed to&#xD;
      participate in this study. Patients are randomized to undergo either open or endovascular&#xD;
      repair because they can be treated with either of the procedures. Investigators use the short&#xD;
      names OPAR for open surgical repair and EPAR for endovascular repair. People who have an&#xD;
      aneurysm that is larger than 2 cm (about an inch) can participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes after these two standard procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current therapy for patients with asymptomatic PAA, elective repair has been recommended for&#xD;
      PAA &gt; 2 cm and for smaller aneurysms with associated mural thrombus1. Treatment modalities&#xD;
      are similar in that they exclude the aneurysm from the circulation. Current treatment options&#xD;
      include both open surgical bypass (OPAR) with aneurysm exclusion and endovascular popliteal&#xD;
      artery repair (EPAR) in which the PAA is excluded by a stent graft. Open repair of PAA has&#xD;
      been shown to have excellent graft patency and limb salvage rates, however it is associated&#xD;
      with the need for general or regional anesthesia, 10-20% surgical site infection rate, and&#xD;
      other complications such as seroma, hematoma, and neurological injury. Endovascular popliteal&#xD;
      aneurysm repair is a minimally invasive technique that can be performed under conscious&#xD;
      sedation but may be associated with higher risk of graft thrombosis, stent fracture, and may&#xD;
      have a lower long term success rate. A paucity of strong comparative data further increases&#xD;
      this equipoise. An adequately powered, prospective, comparative study contrasting OPAR&#xD;
      approach with EPAR will guide vascular specialists in their treatment of PAA and is very much&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Conduct The trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice (GCP) guidelines, Declaration of Helsinki and applicable federal regulatory&#xD;
      requirements [Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 50, 54, 56, 812 and 45CFR46]. This&#xD;
      trial will be registered on NIH clinical trial registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description and Importance of the Population to be Studied One hundred and forty eights&#xD;
      subjects aged 35 or older with asymptomatic ≥ 2.0 cm PAA undergoing repair will be randomized&#xD;
      to undergo either OPAR or EPAR. These patients will be recruited at the participating VSGNE&#xD;
      centers who agreed to enroll and randomize patients for this trial. This trial will be&#xD;
      formally approved by respective Institutional Review Boards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will focus on a population of subjects who are candidates for both open surgery&#xD;
      and endovascular therapy as determined by the treating investigator. Such individuals&#xD;
      represent patients who fall into the &quot;grey area of treatment equipoise&quot;. Investigators will&#xD;
      exclude subjects with associated acute limb ischemia and hyper-coagulable states. In the OPAR&#xD;
      group the choice of conduit will be at the discretion of the surgeon. Vein or non-autogenous&#xD;
      conduits will be allowed. In the EPAR group, a femoral cu-down for introduction of stent will&#xD;
      be permissible. Percutaneous placement of stent-grafts will also be allowed. Investigators&#xD;
      will exclude individuals who are deemed to be at prohibitive risk for open vascular surgery&#xD;
      by standard American Heart Association AHA criteria as noted on formal preoperative&#xD;
      evaluation or who have significant non-dialysis dependent renal dysfunction (Cr. &gt;3.0). From&#xD;
      an anatomic standpoint, investigators will exclude patients who cannot have their PAA treated&#xD;
      by stent-grafts due to short &quot;proximal or distal landing zones&quot;. Subjects without a patent&#xD;
      outflow target vessel will, likewise, be excluded, as treatment options in such patients are&#xD;
      usually limited to medical management, amputation or experimental therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OVER-PAR Trial is a multicenter randomized trial of best open surgical (OPAR) or best&#xD;
      endovascular (EPAR) revascularization in a target population of subjects with asymptomatic ≥&#xD;
      2.0 cm popliteal artery aneurysm who are candidates for both open and endovascular treatment.&#xD;
      The trial has a superiority design and has the following specific aims and hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design The OVER-PAR Trial is a prospective, randomized, open label (two-arm),&#xD;
      multicenter, superiority trial comparing the effectiveness of open surgical bypass (OPAR) and&#xD;
      endovascular popliteal artery stent graft repair (EPAR) in 148 patients (n=74 in each group)&#xD;
      with asymptomatic, clinically significant PAA. Patients with asymptomatic PAA will be&#xD;
      screened. These patients will be enrolled from VSGNE centers who agreed to participate in&#xD;
      this trial. The proposed trial duration is 4 years. The estimated mean follow-up per subject&#xD;
      will be 2.5 years. The trial is powered at 80% to detect a hazard ratio of 1.53, depending on&#xD;
      crossover rates, and assuming 2% loss to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Randomization Scheme The randomization scheme will be set up at Boston Medical Center.&#xD;
      Participating sites will have access to it by telephone. It is important to emphasize that&#xD;
      both procedures to which patients will be randomized are acceptable modalities of care to&#xD;
      treat PAA. Within each cohort, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the 2&#xD;
      treatment arms by study coordinator at each center. Randomization will follow the following&#xD;
      scheme. For each center, sealed, opaque envelopes indicating either OPAR or EPAR repair will&#xD;
      be placed in a container in blocks of 6. Each block of 6 envelopes will contain 3&#xD;
      representing OPAR and 3 representing EPAR. When a participating site recruits a patient, a&#xD;
      phone call will be made to the central study coordinator at BMC who will open an envelope&#xD;
      from the container corresponding to the center and relay the result (OPAR or EPAR) to the&#xD;
      coordinator at the requesting center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects cannot be randomized on the day of surgery since both procedures require some&#xD;
      pre-operative planning. For example, a patient who undergoes open repair will need a&#xD;
      pre-operative vein mapping to access suitability of vein conduit. Similarly, the patient&#xD;
      awaiting EPAR will require procurement of appropriately sized patient-tailored stent -graft&#xD;
      for repair of PAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since randomization will be performed during the pre-operative period, the patient will be&#xD;
      aware of the surgical plan (open vs. endovascular) prior to the date of the surgery. He or&#xD;
      she will then have an option to withdraw from the study and choose any appropriate treatment&#xD;
      modality, if they so choose. Additionally, if the surgeon, based on his judgment, decides to&#xD;
      offer his patient a different treatment modality from that assigned by the randomization&#xD;
      scheme the subject will become a screening failure. Data from subjects categorized as a&#xD;
      screening failure will be recorded in the usual registry arm of the VSGNE and used in&#xD;
      post-hoc analyses after study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be followed for a minimum of 24 months following randomization. Follow-up&#xD;
      will continue during the accrual period and therefore the earliest enrolled surviving subject&#xD;
      will have a maximum of 48 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since randomization will be performed during the pre-operative period, the patient will be&#xD;
      consulted about the surgical plan (open vs. endovascular) prior to the date of the surgery.&#xD;
      He or she will then have an option to withdraw from the study and choose any appropriate&#xD;
      treatment modality, if they so choose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, if the surgeon, based on his bias, decides to offer his patient a different&#xD;
      treatment modality from that assigned by the randomization scheme the subject will become a&#xD;
      screening failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Withdrawal Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject declines further study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the investigator's judgment, it is in the subject's best interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All protocol-specified visits and follow-up procedures should be performed for every subject&#xD;
      enrolled in the trial. If the subject refuses to continue with the study visits, every&#xD;
      attempt should be made to continue contact by telephone, written communication, or record&#xD;
      review to determine if outcome events have occurred, unless the subject specifically refuses&#xD;
      such follow-up. The reason for withdrawal will be documented for all subjects withdrawn from&#xD;
      the study. If the withdrawing subject is unwilling to have his/her medical records reviewed&#xD;
      until the end of the trial period (to document vital status and cause of death), he/she must&#xD;
      submit a written refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENTS TO BE ADMINISTERED Subjects randomized to OVER-PAR endovascular therapy will&#xD;
      receive treatment according to established standard of care for exclusion of PAA by&#xD;
      commercially available endovascular sten-graft. Subjects receiving endovascular&#xD;
      stent-graft(s) will be treated according to the Instructions for Use for the implanted&#xD;
      device(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medications/Treatments Permitted and Not Permitted during the Trial There are no medications&#xD;
      dispensed specifically for this trial. Investigators should follow standard of care&#xD;
      guidelines as well as adhere to Contraindications, Warnings, and Precautions published in the&#xD;
      instructions for use of each commercially available endovascular stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY Specification of the Efficacy Parameters All-cause mortality will be&#xD;
      as reported to occur any time after randomization. Perioperative death is the subset&#xD;
      occurring with 30 days of the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amputation above the ankle in the index (treated) leg is a standard definition, as reported&#xD;
      in surgical notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-interventions will be reviewed for the primary endpoint only (new bypass graft,&#xD;
      jump/interposition graft revision, thrombectomy/ thrombolysis). All re-interventions&#xD;
      (hospitalizations) will be recorded, with length of stay (LOS) discharge diagnoses and&#xD;
      (coded) procedures performed for the cost-effectiveness analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional Status will be assessed using the SF-12 which is widely used in cardiovascular&#xD;
      trials and is available in Spanish, French, for use in North American trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life will be assessed with using VascuQoL questionnaire7 These are standard,&#xD;
      validated instruments, available in Spanish and Canadian French as well as English, for this&#xD;
      trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICS Analysis of the Primary Endpoints The first phase of analysis will include a&#xD;
      description of study variables. This step includes generating summary statistics for study&#xD;
      characteristics. Summary statistics will be generated and assessed for the total sample size.&#xD;
      The quartiles and median time-to-event outcomes (e.g. MALE-free survival, or MALE-POD) will&#xD;
      be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and will be reported with two-sided 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals for each intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy analysis will be an estimation of the hazard ratio comparing time to&#xD;
      MALE and all death rates of subjects receiving OPAR to those receiving EPAR treatment using&#xD;
      the nonparametric log-rank test. The hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval will be&#xD;
      estimated in a Cox regression model in which time to MALE+all deaths is the dependent&#xD;
      variable and intervention is the independent variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis (i.e. based on their&#xD;
      randomization status), which includes all subjects randomized, after the last subject has&#xD;
      been followed for 1-year or are off study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of Secondary Outcomes Other time-to-event outcomes, such as amputation-free&#xD;
      survival, described in the secondary aim will be analyzed similarly to the primary analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above analyses will also be run on the per-protocol population (i.e. based on the actual&#xD;
      intervention they received).&#xD;
