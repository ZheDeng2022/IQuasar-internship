  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn more about the possible effects of&#xD;
      metformin extended release (ER) in patients with colon cancer or adenomas who are about to&#xD;
      have surgery. The safety of this drug will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin-ER is commonly used to control blood sugar levels in patients with diabetes. It is&#xD;
      also designed to block a protein in tumor cells that is important in tumor growth and blood&#xD;
      vessel development. This may cause cell death or reduce the spread of the disease.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive metformin ER. You will have a 2 in 3 chance of&#xD;
           being assigned to Group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive no treatment. You will have a 1 in 3 chance of&#xD;
           being assigned to Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 1, You will start taking the drug the day after your colonoscopy (or&#xD;
      later if your surgery is scheduled to be more than 30 days after the colonoscopy) and will&#xD;
      continue to take it until your scheduled surgery (for up to 30 days). During the first week&#xD;
      you will take one tablet of metformin-ER by mouth one time each day with food. From the&#xD;
      beginning of the second week until your scheduled surgery, you will take two tablets of&#xD;
      metformin-ER by mouth one time each day with food. If you have side effects, your dose may be&#xD;
      lowered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 2, you will not receive any study drug from the time of your colonoscopy&#xD;
      until surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of your colonoscopy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded and you will be asked about any drugs you may be&#xD;
           taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extra tissue samples will be collected during the colonoscopy for routine and biomarker&#xD;
           testing. Biomarkers are small pieces of material or substances found in you tissue that&#xD;
           may provide information about your condition or the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study staff will call you 1 week after your colonoscopy and ask about your general&#xD;
           health and about any side effects you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day before surgery or the day of the surgery itself:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your weight will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and for research about the&#xD;
           safety of metformin-ER and how it may affect the disease. This routine blood draw will&#xD;
           include a pregnancy test if you are able to become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about your general health and about any side effects you may be&#xD;
           having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the surgery, extra tissue samples will be collected for biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be on study for up to 30 days. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if&#xD;
      the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow&#xD;
      study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over once you have had the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Metformin-ER is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Its use in this study is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 23 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
