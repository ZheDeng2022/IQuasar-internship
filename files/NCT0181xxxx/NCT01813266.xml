  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) can result in acute hepatitis; it more&#xD;
      commonly progresses to chronic hepatitis. The acute process is most often asymptomatic. Acute&#xD;
      HCV typically leads to chronic infection. Chronic HCV infection is usually slowly&#xD;
      progressive. Approximately 5 to 20 percent of chronically infected individuals develop&#xD;
      cirrhosis over a 20-30 year period of time. Chronic HCV is the most common cause of chronic&#xD;
      liver disease, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the most frequent indication for&#xD;
      liver transplantation in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for chronic HCV infection is crucial because chronic HCV infection is often&#xD;
      asymptomatic, effective treatment is available, and untreated disease carries a high risk of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Expert opinion, recommendations, and guidelines for HCV screening do&#xD;
      not all agree. All guidelines recommend screening patients at increased risk for HCV (ie:&#xD;
      typical risk factors). In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&#xD;
      recommended screening all persons born between 1945 and 1965. At least two studies suggest&#xD;
      that screening persons born between 1945 and 1964 or 1946 to 1970, respectively, is&#xD;
      cost-effective. The studies estimated that if patients found to be HCV positive were treated&#xD;
      with pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and direct acting antiviral therapy (for patients with&#xD;
      HCV genotype 1), it would cost $35,700 to 37,700 per quality adjusted life-year. Screening&#xD;
      based upon a birth cohort in patients without risk factors may lead to more false positive&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently only 1 % of patients in the birth cohort of 1945-1965 who cared for by&#xD;
      Intermountain Healthcare providers have been screened. Ambulatory care physicians are not&#xD;
      effectively screening patients. It is unclear whether screening based on risk factors alone&#xD;
      versus screening based upon risk factors and birth cohort most effectively manages the burden&#xD;
      of chronic HCV infection for patients managed by Intermountain Healthcare providers. It is&#xD;
      possible that the Intermountain Healthcare population differs in risk from the U.S.&#xD;
      population,making guideline application less certain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A well-designed prospective cohort study is needed to understand the risks and benefits of&#xD;
      different HCV screening strategies on diagnostic yield and clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that screening based on a person's history of risk factors will&#xD;
      detect chronic HCV infection in 2.7 % of the population tested; this would be according to&#xD;
      national average. The investigators further hypothesize that screening based on birth cohort&#xD;
      and risk factors will identify roughly the same percentage in the tested population. The&#xD;
      investigators anticipate usable data within three months which should give us data to&#xD;
      describe and publish the effectiveness of different screening strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will identify patients with chronic HCV infection through this initial&#xD;
      study who now require treatment and management. The investigators believe this group could be&#xD;
      followed inexpensively for clinical endpoints for many years. This would then definitively&#xD;
      define the effectiveness of screening strategies based on good evidence. No study has&#xD;
      evaluated clinical outcomes associated with the different screening strategies for chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis c virus infection.&#xD;

      A. SPECIFIC AIMS (limit one page)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare yield of risk based versus risk based and birth cohort screening for hepatitis C&#xD;
           virus as a function of number invited to screen. The control group will receive the&#xD;
           routine care as delivered normally by local medical practice. This will be conducted in&#xD;
           the Salt Lake Area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine cost in each arm of hepatitis C virus screening strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess patient history for unknown risk factors for infection with HCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Create a registry of HCV positive and HCV negative patients to follow in future studies&#xD;
           to determine long term outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rate of positive screening for HCV in each group as a function of number invited to&#xD;
           screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rate of persistent HCV infection in screen-positive patients based on confirmatory&#xD;
           testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine percentage Utah population that test positive for HCV as compared to national&#xD;
           average.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Listing of risk factors for each patient and analysis of risk factor tools to discover&#xD;
           new risk factors and causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE (Limit two pages)&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been much published in regards to recommendations to screen patients for HCV. Much&#xD;
      of the attention is due to new treatments. Specific antiviral treatments to genotype 1 of HCV&#xD;
      have received much attention. The reported sustained viral response in HCV genotype 1 with&#xD;
      these new agents have been impressive but currently at great expense(12). With these new&#xD;
      advances it has become paramount to identify patients early to avoid great morbidity and&#xD;
      early mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are also disparate recommendations on screening for HCV between the Centers for Disease&#xD;
      Control and Prevention and the United States Preventive Task Force. The American Association&#xD;
      for the Study of Liver Diseases has sided with the CDC. The CDC has a new birth cohort&#xD;
      recommendation in addition to risk factor screening versus the USPTF recommendation to do&#xD;
      screening based upon risk factors only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given conflicting guidelines, tailored evidence to provide guidance to Intermountain&#xD;
      clinicians would be useful; especially as the Intermountain population may differ from the&#xD;
      U.S. population in risk making application of national guidelines more uncertain. This study&#xD;
      will delineate the most effective screening approach for the population served, identify the&#xD;
      rates of false positive tests, and delineate the costs of the screening strategies as&#xD;
      recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently only one percent of patients in the birth cohort of 1945-1965 and cared for by&#xD;
      Intermountain Healthcare providers have been screened. Ambulatory practitioners are not&#xD;
      effectively screening patients or may not believe these patients to be at sufficient risk to&#xD;
      merit screening. It is unclear whether screening based on risk factors alone, or screening&#xD;
      based upon risk factors and birth cohort recommendations most effectively manages the burden&#xD;
      of chronic HCV infection for patients managed by Intermountain Healthcare providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A well-designed prospective cohort study is needed to understand the risks and benefits of&#xD;
      different HCV screening strategies on diagnostic yield and clinical outcomes (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that screening based on established risk factors will detect HCV 2.7 % of the&#xD;
      population tested. We believe that adding the proposed birth cohort in addition to risk&#xD;
      factors for screening will not increase the number of those we identify with chronic HCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once we have generated a registry of patients through this Initial study we believe this&#xD;
      group could be followed inexpensively for clinical endpoints for many years to come. We would&#xD;
      have a group of newly diagnosed chronically infected patients with HCV, identified by the CDC&#xD;
      and USPTF guidelines. We then could ensure evidence base HCV treatment and follow endpoints&#xD;
      of chronic liver disease and its complications. We would then be able to know if screening&#xD;
      for hepatitis C virus is beneficial to the patient we care for and cost effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have 885,000 patients of intermountain healthcare born between 1945 and 1965. Only one&#xD;
      percent of them have been screened for HCV. In those screened 11% had positive HCV tests. The&#xD;
      national average is 2.7 percent. This is not based upon any clear screening program. We&#xD;
      appear to be screening for hepatitis C well below the national average. The state of Utah&#xD;
      Epidemilogist's data indicate that 1% of Utahns have hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If we tested per CDC recommendation we would expect to diagnose 20,000 additional patients&#xD;
      with HCV. If each individual were screened and those who tested positively received liver&#xD;
      biopsy and treatment we could expect this to cost the system close to 3 billion dollars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, it is likely that many people with chronic HCV have not been identified and&#xD;
      treated. In this study, we will determine the effectiveness of each screening strategies.&#xD;
      This will inform clinicians about how to screen know how to screen for chronic HCV based on&#xD;
      evidence and not recommendations. Further as we follow the newly diagnosed patients we will&#xD;
      determine if our screening was effective following our evidence based management. We will&#xD;
      also be able to measure costs as opposed to just calculations based on quality of life year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND METHODS (Limit five pages)&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have identified 9 internal medicine offices in the Salt Lake area. We will divide the&#xD;
      clinics into three groups (three clinics per each group). We are currently performing a&#xD;
      prestratification of the groups to make sure there isn't an age, sex, or racial divergency.&#xD;
      Group 1 would be our control group. The providers at these facilities will perform any&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus screening as they would normally. Group 2 would provide risk factor&#xD;
      screening per USPTF guide lines. Group 3 would use the CDC's recent birth cohort&#xD;
      recommendations in addition to risk factor screening. The only exclusion criteria is if the&#xD;
      patient has a test positive for hepatitis C virus or they give a positive history regarding&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to identify 2000 patients for each strategy in 3 months. We would do this by&#xD;
      asking office manager and physicians of clinics to let their office staff give a screening&#xD;
      strategy form to each patient and ask them to be a part of this study. We will create sheets&#xD;
      the patients can complete while they are waiting for their appointment. The clinical staff&#xD;
      would then be asked to interpret and order the appropriate testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will place the strategy on a one sided sheet of paper that can be given to all internal&#xD;
      medicine patients between the age of 18 and 75.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I have enlisted the help of Dr. Greg Elliott, Scott Stevens, and Scott Woller and others in&#xD;
      an steering committee to offer expert advice and guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screen for hepatitis C as per regular practice as is occurring in their clinics&#xD;
           currently.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Form would ask them if they ever had been tested for Hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The rest of screening would be left to the provider's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Screen for hepatitis C as per conventional risk factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. A sheet with these risk factors will be provided i. Those with a history of illicit&#xD;
           injection drug use or intranasal cocaine use, even if only used once ii. Those who&#xD;
           received clotting factors made before 1987 iii. Those who received blood/organs before&#xD;

           HCV-positive blood xiii. Children born to HCV-positive women xiv. Are spouses or&#xD;
           household contacts of HCV-infected patients&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Any exposure you are concerned about:______________________________.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidance for initial positive HCV screen:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be tested for HCV, HBV, and HIV if they have the above risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients are found to be Hepatitis C positive by EIA, a HCV RNA quantity (viral load)&#xD;
      would be performed. If the HCV RNA is negative and EIA is +, will order a HCV RIBA. (not&#xD;
      PCR); if RIBA is negative this indicates a false positive EIA test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients with positive results would be notified by their primary physicians. We would&#xD;
      provide a decision tree for work up and treatment of a newly found infection. Patients can be&#xD;
      referred to gastroenterologists, hepatologists, and primary care providers who treat chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. IMPACT (Limit one page)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatitis C virus is the leading cause of chronic liver disease in the United States, and is&#xD;
      the leading reason for liver transplantation. Recent advances, in treatment , have made&#xD;
      Hepatitis C virus chronic infection curable for many patients. It is important to identify,&#xD;
      treat, and attempt to cure these patients, many of whom don't know they are affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommendations have been made to try and accomplish this. There needs to be evidence to&#xD;
      guide our screening and therapy. With this study we could provide evidence to Intermountain,&#xD;
      Utah, and I believe the greater medical community. In a few months we could have data that is&#xD;
      publishable having compared the screening recommendations for HCV. We would know which if any&#xD;
      of the screening strategies are superior in identifying chronic HCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would do a follow up study, hopefully with additional funding from an outside group,&#xD;
      having identified new carriers of chronic Hepatitis C. We would provide current evidence&#xD;
      based antiviral treatments that are available based on genotype. This would allow us to see&#xD;
      the comparative progression of liver disease with its subsequent complications in the three&#xD;
      screened groups. We could follow these groups for up to 20 years and have evidence that would&#xD;
      guide screening and treatment for HCV.&#xD;
