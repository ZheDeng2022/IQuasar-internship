  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unruptured saccular intracranial aneurysms larger than 7 mm can be treated with endovascular&#xD;
      occlusion using detachable coils, with or without expendable stent assistance. A new&#xD;
      endovascular technique has recently been developed, using flow diverter stents without&#xD;
      associated coils. Clinical results already published are encouraging but have to be&#xD;
      confirmed. Furthermore, these medical devices are expensive in comparison to the coiling&#xD;
      strategy. The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical efficacy, safety, and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of endovascular coiling and endovascular flow diversion for unrupted&#xD;
      saccular intracranial aneurysms.&#xD;
