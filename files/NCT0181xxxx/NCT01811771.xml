      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vibrio cholerae is one of the major causes of severe diarrheal disease in Bangladesh. It is&#xD;
      estimated that there are about 450,000 cholera cases each year in Bangladesh. Cholera is&#xD;
      prevalent in both urban and rural settings in the country. Policy decisions about how best a&#xD;
      new public health tool can be incorporated into the system requires evidence. Investigators&#xD;
      have recently carried out a feasibility study of oral cholera vaccine in urban Dhaka in&#xD;
      Mirpur (Protocol #10061). However, whether a similar system can also be utilized in a rural&#xD;
      area in Bangladesh needs to be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hospital disease surveillance data from International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease&#xD;
      Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) reveals a substantial burden of cholera from Keraniganj&#xD;
      upazila. Investigators propose a feasibility study of oral cholera vaccination by using the&#xD;
      existing national immunization service delivery mechanism in Keraniganj. This study will help&#xD;
      to provide evidence for the policy makers in introducing oral cholera vaccine in preventing&#xD;
      cholera in high risk rural areas in Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      That icddr,b in collaboration with the Government of Bangladesh will be able to implement an&#xD;
      oral cholera vaccine program that;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. reaches residents of rural union of Keraniganj&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. reduces the incidence of diarrhea due to Vibrio cholerae&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Carry out cholera vaccination in one rural union in Keraniganj.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the impact of vaccination in reducing cholera in the study area&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two unions in Keraniganj will be selected; around 30,000 individuals in one union will be&#xD;
      vaccinated and impact evaluated by comparison with another similar union. After vaccination,&#xD;
      passive cholera surveillance at the Upazila hospital will be conducted for two years on the&#xD;
      patients from the two unions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures/variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholera vaccination programme will be assessed by the number of doses administered, drop-out&#xD;
      rates between the two rounds, the proportion of vaccine wastage, and the vaccine coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proportion of diarrheal hospitalizations that are due to V. cholerae O1 between the&#xD;
      vaccinated and non vaccinated union will be calculated and compared to assess the impact of&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study in two selected rural cholera endemic unions in Keraniganj Upazila near Dhaka city&#xD;
      will continue for two and half years. The study has two major components- 1. Feasibility of&#xD;
      intervention with oral cholera vaccine in one union; and, 2. Impact evaluation of the&#xD;
      intervention through prospective passive surveillance for diarrheal patients coming from the&#xD;
      two selected unions at the upazila health complex. For the cholera vaccination all male and&#xD;
      non-pregnant female residents above one year age will be targeted for vaccination in the&#xD;
      selected union. Investigators are excluding less than one year children and pregnant woman&#xD;
      form vaccination. For the surveillance part a standardized questionnaire will be administered&#xD;
      to all consented diarrheal patients or their guardians in order to obtain information on&#xD;
      diarrhea, health and demographic issues. Stool samples will be co llected and tested for V.&#xD;
      cholerae O1 and O139.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators, purposively, have selected Keraniganj Upazila of Dhaka as the study area due&#xD;
      to high incidence of diarrhea and evidence of culture confirmed cholera and its close&#xD;
      proximity to Dhaka. Based on the Keraniganj diarrheal disease report and evidence of cholera&#xD;
      prevalence in icddr,b surveillance data, the Ruhitpur union with approximately thirty&#xD;
      thousand population will be selected as our area for vaccination, the intervention union.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effectiveness of intervention Investigators will include Basta union of&#xD;
      Keraniganj as the non-intervention area. In selecting the two unions, to make them&#xD;
      comparable, in addition to population size, evidence of diarrhea and cholera, Investigators&#xD;
      have considered the closeness to the Upazila Health Complexes (UHC), presence of educational&#xD;
      institutes and health facilities, literacy rates, land area, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will use the killed whole cell oral cholera vaccine, &quot;Shanchol&quot;, manufactured&#xD;
      by Shantha Biotechnics for the study. The vaccine is registered in India and is prequalified&#xD;
      by WHO. In urban Mirpur area investigators have already successfully used more than 265,000&#xD;
      doses of the same vaccine. Vaccines are stored in the EPI(Expanded program on immunization)&#xD;
      cold room at 2-8 degree C. Based on available space in District and upazila cold stores,&#xD;
      vaccines will be shifted from the EPI cold room facilities in Dhaka. Investigators will use&#xD;
      the rural health facilities including community clinics as the vaccination site for&#xD;
      vaccinating the catchment eligible targeted population. Investigators will use the existing&#xD;
      EPI cold chain facilities at the Keraniganj Upazila health complex to deliver the vaccine in&#xD;
      the selected union. During vaccination, vaccinators will gently shake the single dose vial&#xD;
      well to disperse the suspension and then open it to feed its content to the recipient. Adults&#xD;
      and older children can take the vaccine by themselves but vaccinators will feed the vaccine&#xD;
      contents to younger children. Trained Community health care provider, Health Assistants and&#xD;
      Family Welfare assistants of the community clinic area will act as vaccinators. There will be&#xD;
      adequate training for all concerned prior to the vaccination programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, volunteers from the community will be recruited and trained to assist with the&#xD;
      vaccination and social mobilization activities. Investigators will develop appropriate&#xD;
      communication materials to inform the population about the cholera vaccination opportunity.&#xD;
      Local health facilities, pharmacies and community residents will be involved to assist social&#xD;
      mobilization of the population to attend vaccination sessions. Persons below one year of age&#xD;
      and pregnant women will not receive the vaccine. People living in the adjacent unions will&#xD;
      not be eligible to receive the vaccine, due to limited number of vaccines in hand.&#xD;
      Investigators will have to clarify in a convincing way through the field workers, community&#xD;
      volunteers/leaders and to the stakeholders that everyone cannot be given the intervention&#xD;
      because of the targeted approach and unavailability of vaccine for all and because this study&#xD;
      is only a feasibility study to test the vaccine delivery mechanism in a rural setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients from the study area to the Keraniganj Upazila Health Complex (UHC) with&#xD;
      diarrhoea will be included in cholera surveillance. All study participants will be encouraged&#xD;
      to attend Upazila health complex for the treatment of diarrhoeal diseases at the initiation&#xD;
      of the study and time to time will be reminded by the field workers. A patient who has in the&#xD;
      last 24 hours three or more loose or liquid stool is defined as a case of diarrhea (13). The&#xD;
      surveillance for cholera at the Upazila health complex will be carried out for two years. As&#xD;
      the study is implementing passive surveillance in both the unions- intervention and control,&#xD;
      to see the effectiveness of the intervention, the key element is to capture most of the cases&#xD;
      coming from the two unions. To do so, the study will convey the messages to the people of the&#xD;
      two unions to utilize the existing GoB(Government of Bangladesh) facility in the upazila&#xD;
      health complex for diarrheal illness. Study will provide a card to the peoples in two unions&#xD;
      which will contain such messages, while distributing the cards field workers will convey the&#xD;
      messages and tell them to bring the cards for diarrheal illness at the Keraniganj UHC. The&#xD;
      existing field health workers, workers in the health facilities (community clinics, health &amp;&#xD;
      family welfare center) will be encouraged to convey such messages and refer the diarrheal&#xD;
      patients to the Keraniganj upazila health complex. The patients in the OPD(out patient&#xD;
      department) and ORT(oral rehydration therapy) corners at the Keraniganj UHC will be included&#xD;
      in the passive surveillance and other private clinics/hospital(if available and agrees) will&#xD;
      also be taken under surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will collect stool or rectal swab specimens from diarrheal patients coming from&#xD;
      the study population for diarrheal diseases. Specimens will be evaluated for V. cholerae&#xD;
      O1and O139 according to WHO/CDC guidelines at the icddr,b.&#xD;
