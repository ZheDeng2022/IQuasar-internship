      This study is being done to find the effect of Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in&#xD;
      combination with Ixabepilone for women with triple negative metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ixabepilone is a FDA approved drug for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced breast&#xD;
      cancer after failure of chemotherapy. SBRT is a treatment method to deliver a high dose of&#xD;
      radiation to the target, utilizing either a single dose or a small number of treatments with&#xD;
      a high degree of precision within the body. The combination of Ixabepilone with SBRT is not&#xD;
      an approved treatment at this time.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Biopsy proven triple negative invasive ductal or lobular metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
             Tumor estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 (tested by IHC or FISH) negative disease. (ER-&#xD;
             defined as &lt;/=1% by IHC, PR- defined as &lt;/=1% by IHC, and HER2- by IHC 1+. If HER2&#xD;
             result by IHC is 2+ (equivocal), the tumor must be confirmed to be HER2- by FISH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must not have started Ixabepilone treatment more than 5 weeks prior to&#xD;
             initiation of SBRT treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients can have up to 6 sites of active extracranial disease(&lt;/=3 in the liver = one&#xD;
             site and &lt;/=3 in the lung= one site) identified by CT scan, or PET/CT, within 8 weeks&#xD;
             prior to initiation of SBRT (up to 2 contiguous vertebral metastasis will be&#xD;
             considered a single site of disease). Maximum number of lesions treated is deemed as&#xD;
             feasible per the treating radiation oncologist; ie: A patient with 4 right axillary&#xD;
             lymph nodes, L1-L2 bone metastasis, 3 lung lesions, 1 left lung lesion, 2 liver&#xD;
             lesions, and T2-T3 bone metastasis would be defined as having 6 sites of disease.&#xD;
             Criteria to define a lesion in any location as a metastasis requiring local treatment&#xD;
             as one of the sites for SBRT is any lesion clinically felt to be viable; defined as&#xD;
             enlarging on CT/MRI or having persistent FDG avidity (Either SUV&gt;3 or increase of&#xD;
             SUV&gt;20% over a 6 month interval).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with skin nodules, skin invasion, or skin ulceration are eligible, if&#xD;
             treatment with conventional radiation (at discretion of radiation oncologist) or&#xD;
             surgery is planned. SBRT to skin nodules is not advised because of risk of skin&#xD;
             necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. . Patients must have had failure of an anthracycline, a taxane and capecitabine as per&#xD;
             FDA approved criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Performance status of ECOG 0,1, or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SPGT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy.&#xD;
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
             9.1 A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual&#xD;
             orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who&#xD;
             meets the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e.,&#xD;
                  has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients who would be receiving SBRT for lung tumors who are known or must have a&#xD;
             documented forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)&gt;/=30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Must have a CT C/A/P, or PET/CT scan within 8 weeks of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients may not be actively receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with untreated brain metastasis (patients can have whole brain radiation or&#xD;
             stereotactic radiation to brain prior to enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with leptomeningeal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to Agent(s) used in study. Patients with a history of severe reactions to&#xD;
             Cremephor EL or its derivatives (polyoxyethylated castor oil) are ineligible as&#xD;
             Ixabepilone contraindicated in these patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Because the tolerance dose of SBRT to the gastrointestinal tract is not established,&#xD;
             patients with metastatic disease invading the esophagus, stomach, intestines, or&#xD;
             mesenteric lymph nodes will not be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with more than 6 discrete extra-cranial sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Treatment for other carcinomas within the last 5 years, except cured non-melanoma skin&#xD;
             and treated in-situ cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital&#xD;
             abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must not be on concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers (see section 4.3).&#xD;
