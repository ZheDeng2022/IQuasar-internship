  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with plastic stent placement for&#xD;
      resolution of biliary obstruction has been the method of choice for many years. However,&#xD;
      stent clogging/obstruction is a major limitation in the management of biliary obstruction.&#xD;
      Studies have shown that the conventional tubular type polyethylene stents (CS) with side&#xD;
      holes accumulate significant sludge and their mean patency is approximately 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus patients requiring longer term stenting need to undergo stent exchanges every 2-3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a stent with a star-shaped cross-section has been developed for biliary&#xD;
      applications. This FDA approved biliary Wing stent (WS) (ViaDuct™) is a novel plastic biliary&#xD;
      stent that lacks a lumen, and is designed to allow bile to flow on the outside of the stent.&#xD;
      The stent which is star shaped in cross section, channels fluid along its winged perimeter.&#xD;
      It has been proposed that the winged stent design with a lack of central lumen obviates the&#xD;
      risk of luminal occlusion and that the risk of occlusion, given the presence of multiple&#xD;
      external drainage channels, is smaller. Longer term biliary drainage without the need for&#xD;
      stent exchange should therefore be possible with these stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate the patency rate of the WS up to&#xD;
      90 days in 50 patients with biliary obstruction due to stones or benign strictures.&#xD;

      1. Fifty patients that meet all the inclusion criteria and have none of the exclusion&#xD;
           criteria will be invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Initial visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Written informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complete history and physical will be performed and the patients baseline liver&#xD;
                function tests and imaging results will be assessed and noted in the case report&#xD;
                form.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients gender, date of birth, concomitant medications will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will then be scheduled for the ERCP procedure with wing biliary stent&#xD;
           placement. They will undergo the ERCP as standard of care and the wing biliary stent&#xD;
           will be placed for decompression of the obstructed biliary system in situations where&#xD;
           stenting is standard of care. One or more biliary stents may be placed during the&#xD;
           procedure depending on the indication such as a biliary stricture necessitating multiple&#xD;
           stent placements for dilation as the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Bloodwork:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will undergo bloodwork (total and direct bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase,&#xD;
           aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase) one week after the procedure. The&#xD;
           degree of drop in bilirubin will also be noted. The patients will be then have these&#xD;
           labs drawn again at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Telephone calls:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patients will be called on the telephone at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 after the procedure&#xD;
           to monitor their clinical status. Patients and family members will be given a contact&#xD;
           number to call us immediately if they develop any signs of biliary obstruction such as&#xD;
           fever, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine or light stools. They will also be&#xD;
           instructed to come to the emergency room should they develop fevers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Stent removal:&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the end of 90 days from the stent placement patients will return for a repeat ERCP&#xD;
           for stent removal as the standard of care and further endo-therapy as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Stent patency will be calculated from the time of stent insertion up to the end of 90&#xD;
           days. The stent patency rate at 90 days will be the proportion of stents placed that do&#xD;
           not occlude over this time period. Stent occlusion will be defined as biochemical or&#xD;
           clinical evidence of obstructive jaundice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. All the continuous and outcome variables (stent obstruction) will be statistically&#xD;
           analyzed and stent malfunction rates will be analyzed for the wing stent across the&#xD;
           various indications.&#xD;
