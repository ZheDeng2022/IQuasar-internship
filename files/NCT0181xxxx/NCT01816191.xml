      The study is a single-center, open-label, safety and pharmacokinetic study in12 adult&#xD;
      subjects with Anal Fissures. Subjects will be screened to determine eligibility within 7 days&#xD;
      of treatment. There will be three parts to the study and all subjects will participate in&#xD;
      each part.&#xD;

    <description>Adverse events, physical examination findings, vital sign measurements, ECG results, and clinical laboratory data will be reviewed and summarized to evaluate the safety profile of topical DTZ cream and oral DTZ. Safety data will be summarized by study time point, and by change from Baseline using descriptive statistics as appropriate. Data listings will also be provided.</description>
