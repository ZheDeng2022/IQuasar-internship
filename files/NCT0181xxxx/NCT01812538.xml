  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of DIC075V on ventricular&#xD;
      repolarization in healthy subjects compared to placebo after a single dose of DIC075V&#xD;
      administered intravenously (IV) and to evaluate ECG assay sensitivity by evaluating the&#xD;
      baseline-adjusted effect of a single oral (PO) moxifloxacin 400 mg dose on ventricular&#xD;
      repolarization in healthy subjects compared to placebo. Other secondary objectives are as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of DIC075V on ventricular repolarization in healthy subjects&#xD;
           compared to placebo at the Tmax of diclofenac and hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if there is a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between&#xD;
           the duration of the QTc intervals and diclofenac and HPβCD plasma concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain additional pharmacokinetic (PK) information on diclofenac and HPβCD in healthy&#xD;
           subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide additional safety information.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single-dose, comparative, positive and placebo controlled, 4 period,&#xD;
      4-way crossover study evaluating the effect of DIC075V on QTc intervals in healthy subjects.&#xD;
      Two doses of DIC075V are tested and include moxifloxicin as a positive control and normal&#xD;
      saline as the placebo arm. On 4 separate occasions separated by at least 72 hours, subjects&#xD;
      are given single IV or oral (moxifloxicin) treatments. ECGs are acquired from a continuous&#xD;
      Holter monitor and selected timepoints will be evaluated. These ECGs will be 15 seconds in&#xD;
      duration and extracted in triplicate. Monitoring will continue for 24 hours with each&#xD;
      treatment. The primary ECG endpoint is the baseline-adjusted QTc using the Fridericia&#xD;
      correction (QTcF). Secondary endpoints include the baseline-adjusted QTc using the Bazett&#xD;
      correction formula (QTcB). In addition, a population-specific regression model will be&#xD;
      constructed with QT plotted against RR (the time elapsed between 2 consecutive R-waves).&#xD;
      Finally, QT parameters are explored graphically in relation to PK variables Cmax, Tmax and&#xD;
      AUC.&#xD;
