  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radical cystectomy remains the gold standard treatment for invasive non metastatic&#xD;
      transitional cell cancer (TCC) of the bladder. In contemporary series, specific survival&#xD;
      rates are about 60 to 65% at 5 years, decreasing for locally advanced disease to 45-50% in&#xD;
      patients with nonorgan-confined lymph-node negative tumours and to 30-35% in patients with&#xD;
      lymph node positive tumours. Perioperative chemotherapy (adjuvant ou neoadjuvant) has been&#xD;
      developed in order to improve these results. Thanks to randomized trials and meta-analysis,&#xD;
      it can be concluded that perioperative chemotherapy increases overall survival with an&#xD;
      absolute benefit of 5%, equating to a survival rate of 50% at 5 years for nonorgan-confined&#xD;
      tumours. However, the chemotherapy administration time and the optimal chemotherapy regimen&#xD;
      to be delivered are not yet determined. Meta-analyses have shown that the benefit is only&#xD;
      observed for chemotherapy regimens including cisplatin. In daily management 4 to 6 cycles of&#xD;
      gemcitabine and cisplatin are delivered since this combination has been shown to yield a&#xD;
      similar efficacy with a better tolerance as compared to the MVAC regimen (methotrexate,&#xD;
      vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin) in the metastatic setting. As HD-MVAC has been shown&#xD;
      to be associated with higher response rates than MVAC in bladder metastatic disease, also a&#xD;
      better efficacy of HD-MVAC can be suspected in the perioperative setting. Investigators&#xD;
      therefore designed a randomized phase III study to compare the efficacy of GC and HD-MVAC in&#xD;
      term of progression-free survival in patients for whom chemotherapy has been decided, before&#xD;
      or after radical cystectomy. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, side effects,&#xD;
      response rate in the neoadjuvant setting and ancillary studies focusing on gemcitabine and&#xD;
      cisplatin sensitivity. The total number of patients projected is 500. The number of patients&#xD;
      is based on the median progression-free survival rate of 50% at 3 years observed in patients&#xD;
      treated with GC (standard arm A) in the perioperative setting. An absolute improvement of 10%&#xD;
      (HR=0.74) is expected with HD-MVAC (experimental arm B) with a=0.05 and b=0.20. An interim&#xD;
      analysis is planned after the occurrence of 174 events. With an estimated uniform accrual&#xD;
      rate of 140 patients per year for 3.5 years and exponential survival, the final analysis is&#xD;
      expected to occur 8 years after the start of the trial.&#xD;
