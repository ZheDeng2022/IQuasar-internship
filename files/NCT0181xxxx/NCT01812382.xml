    <textblock>
      This feasibility study will allow for the determination of the in vivo recovery and time of&#xD;
      dialysis to optimize a future thorough microdialysis study. This is a single session, open&#xD;
      label study to evaluate the feasibility of microdialysis for Retapamulin in healthy subjects.&#xD;
      Three healthy subjects will be enrolled and complete the study procedures. Subjects will be&#xD;
      admitted to the research unit on Day 1 and three microdialysis probes will be placed in the&#xD;
      thigh of each subject prior to the start of the microdialysis procedure. After normal saline&#xD;
      solution infusion for 30 minutes, a Retapamulin solution will be infused for 90 minutes.&#xD;
      Saline perfusion will occur during the washout period. Microdialysis sampling will be done&#xD;
      for 30 minutes (during the last 30 minutes of drug perfusion) and dialysate sample collection&#xD;
      will continue every 30 minutes for 4 hours. The approximate duration of study including&#xD;
      follow-up is 4 days.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical&#xD;
        evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests. A subject&#xD;
        with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the&#xD;
        population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GlaxoSmithKline&#xD;
        (GSK) Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk&#xD;
        factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Subjects with clinically&#xD;
        significant lab values outside the normal range should always be excluded from enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions&#xD;
             and protocol-stated restrictions and is likely to complete the study as planned.&#xD;
             Subject is willing to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Does not use medications containing Retapamulin while participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body Mass Index within the range 18.5 to 32 kilogram/ meter^2 (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following normal ranges for blood pressure and heart rate are given as a guide:&#xD;
             Systolic blood pressure 90 to 140 milimeter of Mercury (mmHg), Diastolic blood&#xD;
             pressure 60 to 90 mmHg, and Heart rate 45 to 100 beats per minute (bpm). The&#xD;
             investigator may interpret screening vital sign data based on the subject's age,&#xD;
             physical state and level of fitness. Subjects with vital sign readings marginally&#xD;
             outside the normal range may be included in the study if in the investigator's opinion&#xD;
             these values are not clinically significant and will not present a safety risk or&#xD;
             affect study assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential&#xD;
             (defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy;&#xD;

             for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator)&#xD;
             prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that&#xD;
             point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until study completion (i.e.&#xD;
             follow-up phone call). Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential&#xD;
             must agree to use one of the contraception methods. This criterion must be followed&#xD;
             from the time of the first dose of study medication until study completion (i.e.&#xD;
