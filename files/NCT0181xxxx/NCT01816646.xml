  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn how the drug cidofovir given as 1 dose&#xD;
      directly into the bladder is absorbed by the body. Researchers also want to measure the&#xD;
      amount of study drug in the body at different time points. The safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      this drug will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cidofovir is designed to fight certain viruses by blocking the virus cells from dividing.&#xD;

      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, on Day 1, you may receive some&#xD;
      fluid for hydration by vein and then cidofovir will be put into your bladder through your&#xD;
      foley catheter. The catheter will be clamped shut for 2 hours to keep the drug inside your&#xD;
      bladder. After 2 hours, the catheter will be unclamped so that the drug may drain out. If you&#xD;
      were receiving bladder irrigation (where the bladder is flushed with water) as therapy for&#xD;
      hemorrhagic cystitis, this therapy will be restarted after your dose of cidofovir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic (PK) Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for PK testing approximately 1&#xD;
      hour (+/- 15 minutes) before the dose, and then again at 1 hour (+/- 15 minutes), 2 hours&#xD;
      (+/- 15 minutes), 4 hours (+/- 1 hour), 14 hours (+/- 1 hour) and 24 hours (+/- 1 hour) after&#xD;
      the dose. A PK sample will also be drawn on Day 14 (+- 2 days) after the dose. PK testing&#xD;
      measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virus Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study, urine and blood will be collected and used for research to test for&#xD;
      certain viruses, including the type of infection you had when you joined this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after the cidofovir dose on Day 1, Day 3 (+/- 1 day), Day 7 (+/- 2 days) and again&#xD;
      on Day 14 (+/- 2 days) urine and blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be collected for virus&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your active study participation will be over after the Day 30 follow-up phone call (below).&#xD;
      If you experienced a side effect, the study staff will continue checking your medical records&#xD;
      until the side effect becomes stable or gets better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 3 (+/- 1 day):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your vital signs will be measured, and you will be asked about any symptoms you may be&#xD;
           having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 7 (+/- 2 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your vital signs will be measured, and you will be asked about any symptoms you may be&#xD;
           having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 14 (+/- 2 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any symptoms you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 30 (+/- 2 days), you will be contacted by phone and asked about any side effects you&#xD;
      may be having. This call will take about 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Cidofovir given by injection is commercially available and&#xD;
      FDA approved to treat CMV in patients with HIV. Its use in this study is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 6 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
