      This study will prospectively enroll approximately 880 children, at least 18 months and less&#xD;
      than 60 months of age, who have been referred to a pediatric developmental evaluation center.&#xD;
      Enrolled children will have blood drawn for RNA gene expression analysis and optionally for&#xD;
      metabolite, lipid and DNA analysis and undergo a clinical evaluation to determine the&#xD;
      presence or absence of a diagnosis of ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To develop an algorithm to classify blood RNA gene expression patterns to maximize&#xD;
      agreement between the classification and a clinical assessment of presence or absence of&#xD;
      Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop an algorithm to classify plasma metabolite and/or lipid profiles in such a&#xD;
           way as to maximize agreement between the classification and a clinical assessment of&#xD;
           presence or absence of ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To prospectively assess the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the plasma&#xD;
           metabolite and/or lipid profile classification algorithm in a separate population&#xD;
           consisting of children referred to a developmental evaluation clinic for a possible&#xD;
           developmental disorder (DD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate clinical sensitivity and specificity of various combinations of gene&#xD;
           expression signature, metabolite and/or lipid signatures, and presence of ASD-associated&#xD;
           genetic variation detected by chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or sequencing&#xD;
           protein-coding regions of the genome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to define a gene expression signature indicative of ASD and&#xD;
      to establish its clinical sensitivity and specificity. Clinician diagnosis of ASD will be&#xD;
      made using DSM-5 as the reference standard instrument. The widely used diagnostic instrument&#xD;
      Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2) is a typical component of the clinical&#xD;
      assessment for a child diagnosed with ASD and this evaluation will be performed on all study&#xD;
      participants. Secondary aims of this study are (1) to define metabolite and lipid signatures&#xD;
      indicative of ASD and establish their clinical sensitivity and specificity and (2) to&#xD;
      determine clinical sensitivity and specificity of various combinations of gene expression&#xD;
      signature, metabolite and/or lipid signatures, and presence of ASD-associated genetic&#xD;
      variation detected by CMA and sequencing protein-coding regions of the genome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses: Details of the analysis will be specified in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP),&#xD;
      which will include procedures for handling outliers, missing data, and differences across&#xD;
      sites. The SAP will be reviewed and approved by a committee of Principal Investigators (PIs)&#xD;
      before unblinding of the validation set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analyses: The primary outcomes of the study will be the estimates of the clinical&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of the SDX-002 test to classify subjects according to DSM-5 ASD&#xD;
      diagnosis, with associated 95% confidence intervals. Sensitivity and specificity will be&#xD;
      assessed on the Validation Phase population based on agreement with the clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
      presence or absence of Autism Spectrum Disorder by DSM-5 (published May 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gene expression signature will be trained on the 500 subject Development Phase set, using&#xD;
      5-fold cross validation over the results of several machine learning algorithms, including&#xD;
      partial least squares, support vector machines, and boosted decision trees. The training&#xD;
      procedure will generate estimated ROC curves for each method, as well as confidence intervals&#xD;
      for the area under the curve (AUC). The final choice of a machine-learning algorithm will be&#xD;
      based on AUC, as well as on the estimated performance at the chosen operating point on the&#xD;
      ROC curve. The operating point will be chosen to provide high sensitivity at an acceptable&#xD;
      specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyses: In the majority of patients enrolled to date, consent was obtained for&#xD;
      collection of an optional bio-repository sample. The intended analysis of the bio-repository&#xD;
      samples has now been established (see also, secondary objectives listed above). The&#xD;
      metabolomic and lipomic signatures will be similarly assessed on the subset of the 500&#xD;
      subjects in the Development Phase set who consent to a bio-repository sample. In addition to&#xD;
      the gene expression signature, metabolite and/or lipid signatures and DNA analysis will be&#xD;
      combined with the gene expression signature in various configurations and the impact of these&#xD;
      additional measures on clinical sensitivity and specificity will be evaluated. If these&#xD;
      additional metabolomic/lipomic signatures and/or DNA analyses improve test performance, these&#xD;
      elements may be included in the SDX-002 assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity and specificity the final SDX-002 assay will also be assessed among&#xD;
      subpopulations using demographic information and the results of developmental testing. There&#xD;
      are likely to be few subjects in many of these subpopulations and caution will be used in&#xD;
      interpreting the results. Planned subpopulation analyses include gender, age, ethnicity, ASD&#xD;
      DSM-IV-TR diagnostic subcategory, DSM-5 ASD severity level (social communication and&#xD;
      restricted interests/repetitive behaviors) and ADOS-2 scores.&#xD;
