      Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does using dabigatran bridging result in consistent therapeutic anticoagulation? What&#xD;
           percentage of patients will become subtherapeutic on warfarin once dabigatran is&#xD;
           stopped?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the incidence of bleeding events with the use of dabigatran overlapped with&#xD;
           warfarin for bridging?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What is the cost benefit of using dabigatran instead of dalteparin for bridging&#xD;
           anticoagulation?&#xD;

      Subject Selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include low risk patients on long-term warfarin therapy for venous&#xD;
      thromboembolic disease (VTE) followed by the hematology anticoagulation clinic. Low risk will&#xD;
      be defined as status greater than 12 months post thromboembolic event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria include: (1) Low risk status as defined above, (2) Chronic warfarin&#xD;
      therapy of at least 12 months duration with target INR of 2.0-3.0. Patients will be excluded&#xD;
      from the study if one or more of the following are met: (1) increased risk of bleeding:&#xD;
      bleeding requiring transfusion in last 12 months, history of hemorrhagic stroke or&#xD;
      intracranial hemorrhage, recent gastrointestinal bleeding {&lt;6 months}, history of a bleeding&#xD;
      disorder, (2) Pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant or breastfeed, (3)&#xD;
      inhibitors allergy/sensitivity to dabigatran etexilate, (4)Creatinine Clearance &lt; 30 mls/min,&#xD;
      (5) Concomitant treatment with strong P-glycoprotein (6) Known thrombophilia including Factor&#xD;
      V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, antithrombin deficiency, protein C deficiency,&#xD;
      protein S deficiency, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and (7) inability to provide&#xD;
      written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified by performing a manual search of the anticoagulation clinic&#xD;
      database to identify patients on long-term warfarin therapy (&gt;12 months). The results will be&#xD;
      gleaned to identify patients who meet the inclusion criteria listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then be contacted via phone by one of the anticoagulation clinic personnel who&#xD;
      will be known to the patient and familiar with their history. If the patient is interested in&#xD;
      participating in the study they will be asked to come in for an assessment to elucidate&#xD;
      whether they meet inclusion criteria as described above. The coordinator will discuss the&#xD;
      study principles, goals, and risks. If they are interested in the study informed consent will&#xD;
      be obtained by the study coordinator, If they are not interested in participating in the&#xD;
      study they will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients enrolled in the study will undergo a planned sham surgery bridging protocol.&#xD;
      This will take place for all patients over a 2 week period, which is the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day -5, patients will stop taking their warfarin. They will have a baseline CBC, INR,&#xD;
      activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and thrombin time (TT) drawn. They will have an&#xD;
      INR, aPTT and TT drawn daily for the duration of the study period, except the sham surgery&#xD;
      day and the following day, until Day +5 post the sham surgery day or longer until the INR is&#xD;
      = 2. If INR = 2 by Day -2 after stopping the warfarin, Vitamin K will be adminstered orally&#xD;
      to help reversing the INR to normal. When the INR falls to &lt;2.0, dabigatran will be started&#xD;
      at a therapeutic dose of 150 mg orally twice daily. This will continue until the sham surgery&#xD;
      day,. On the evening of the sham surgery day, warfarin will be restarted at twice the&#xD;
      patient's maintenance dose to a maximum of 10 mg orally. Dabigatran will be decreased to a&#xD;
      prophylactic dose of 150 mg orally daily. Warfarin dosing will be adjusted for each patient&#xD;
      based on the day +2 INR. Dabigatran prophylaxis will continue until the INR is greater or&#xD;
      equal to 2.0, at which point it will be discontinued and warfarin maintained. The INR will be&#xD;
      checked the day after dabigatran is discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic demographic information will be collected from the study participants including age and&#xD;
      sex. Patient's weight, medical history, current medications, and indication for long-term&#xD;
      warfarin therapy will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Reporting The study will closely follow laboratory testing as it relates to&#xD;
      coagulation status (INR, pTT, PTT, and CBC). All serious adverse events will be captured and&#xD;
      appropriately assessed by the Principal Investigator as to causality and expectedness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adverse drug reaction is any noxious and unintended response to the study drug that is&#xD;
      caused by administration of the drug. Lack of efficacy is not considered an adverse drug&#xD;
      reaction. Untoward medical occurrences will be considered adverse drug reactions if a causal&#xD;
      relationship between the event and the study drug cannot be ruled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adverse event considered &quot;serious&quot; if it meets any of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results in death,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is life-threatening,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is a congenital anomaly / birth defect, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in&#xD;
           death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to&#xD;
           prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should any serious unexpected adverse drug reactions occur, it will be reported to Health&#xD;
      Canada in accordance with the Regulations Amending the Food &amp; Drug Regulations (1024 -&#xD;
      Clinical Trials), Section C.05.014.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Where it is neither fatal nor life-threatening, within 15 days after becoming aware of&#xD;
           the information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Where it is fatal or life-threatening, immediately where possible and, in any event,&#xD;
           within 7 days after becoming aware of the information, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within 8 days after having informed Health Canada of the ADR, submit as complete a&#xD;
           report as possible which includes an assessment of the importance and implication of any&#xD;
           findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All serious unexpected adverse drug reactions (and other safety events as applicable) will be&#xD;
      reported to the Capital Health Research Ethics Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address our primary objective, investigators will look at the percentage of patients in&#xD;
      our cohort of 40 who have normal INR, on day 0 (sham surgery day) and thus would be ready to&#xD;
      proceed with surgial intervention. Simple statistics will be used to calculate this&#xD;
      percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who do not have corrected INR on day 0, and thus would have surgery delayed, a&#xD;
      multivariate analysis to elucidate which factors contribute to insufficient normalization of&#xD;
      bleeding tests will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative bridging anticoagulation with dabigatran and warfarin has not been studied&#xD;
      previously, and investigators do not know the significance of the overlap on the INR. It is&#xD;
      possible that patients will be under-anticoagulated in the post-operative period. An&#xD;
      exploratory analysis will be performed to see if this is the case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, a cost analysis will be performed comparing this dabigatran based bridging protocol&#xD;
      with our current standard of care, a dalteparin based bridging protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient information will be maintained in paper copy in the office of Dr. Sudeep Shivakumar&#xD;
      in a locked cabinet. Only members of the study team will have access to this information. For&#xD;
      the purposes of data-analysis, this information will be entered into a database within the&#xD;
      CDHA firewall and will be password protected. Patients will be given a study identification&#xD;
      number and therefore no identifiable information will be kept in the database. The study team&#xD;
      will keep a list of screened and enrolled patients with corresponding study identification&#xD;
      number. t&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once data analysis has been completed this information will be stored at the Capital Health&#xD;
      Centre for Clinical Research in the Research Archive Room and then at an offsite storage&#xD;
      facility leased by Capital Health (Iron Mountain, Hammonds Plains) for 25 years as per&#xD;
      ICH-GCP Guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drs. Shivakumar, McCurdy, Sharif, Anderson, and Shawwa are bound by physician-patient&#xD;
      confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a theoretical risk of bleeding in this study, although exceedingly low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a theoretical risk of bleeding when restarting warfarin while on prophylactic&#xD;
      dabigatran. Bleeding laboratory parameters will be followed daily, except the day of Sham&#xD;
      surgery and day 1, and this will allow us to detect any abnormalities in coagulation testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, there is a risk of allergy/sensitivity to Dabigatran.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three main benefits of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dabigatran offers an oral alternative to subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin.&#xD;
           Subcutaneous injections can be painful and intimidating for many patients. An oral&#xD;
           alternative is painless and easy to administer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An increasing number of patients are being managed with dabigatran outside the context&#xD;
           of clinical trials. No prior studies have evaluated dabigatran in the peri-operative&#xD;
           setting and specifically the re-institution of warfarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. LMWH regimens are very costly. Using the protocols as outlined above, the average cost&#xD;
           per bridge in the LMWH regimen is $225.00 CDN whereas with Dabigatran it is $18.00 CDN,&#xD;
           savings of $207.00 CDN per patient.&#xD;
