  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with an&#xD;
      estimated number of 180 million infected patients. Until 2012 the current standard of care&#xD;
      (SOC) treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C was a 24 to 72 weeks therapy with&#xD;
      pegylated interferon- and ribavirin (PR). In 2012, the protease-inhibitors (PI's) telaprevir&#xD;
      and boceprevir as first directly acting HCV drugs have been approved by the local Swiss&#xD;
      authority for hepatitis C mono-infected and HCV-HIV-co-infected individuals. However, therapy&#xD;
      success is strongly limited in null-responders (NR) to previous PR. Treatment of HCV-HIV&#xD;
      co-infected individuals with the new PI's is accompanied by additional challenges (e.g.&#xD;
      drug-drug interactions, toxicity, high pill burden). Patients with advanced fibrosis are at&#xD;
      highest risk for decompensated liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and prompt&#xD;
      initiation of treatment is strongly recommended. Recently, data in mono-infected patients&#xD;
      showed, that in prior non responders a 12 week course of a triple therapy (TT) with&#xD;
      telaprevir and PR followed by another 24 weeks of PR resulted in an sustained virologic&#xD;
      response (SVR) of only 29%. In HCV-HIV co-infected non-responders with unfavourable&#xD;
      preconditions (e.g. HCV-genotype 1, interleukin 28 B non-CC genotype, advanced liver&#xD;
      fibrosis, high baseline HCV viral load) SVR after TT is even expected to be lower. These&#xD;
      patients urgently need additional therapeutic options with the goal to eradicate HCV in order&#xD;
      to prevent further fibrosis progression and to reduce morbidity and mortality. A promising&#xD;
      substance in the field of drugs targeting the HCV replication is silibinin. Silibinin is the&#xD;
      main component of silymarin, an extract of the milk thistle Silybum marianum. Intravenous&#xD;
      silibinin (iSIL) targets multiple steps in the virus life cycle and exhibits anti-oxidant,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, anti-viral and immunomodulatory properties. iSIL inhibits the HCV NS5B&#xD;
      polymerase activity directly or by interfering with the binding of RNA to this enzyme. In&#xD;
      addition, iSIL appears to block virus entry, virus transmission and virus secretion.In 2008&#xD;
      Ferenci et al. for the first time reported the substantial clinical antiviral-effect of&#xD;
      intravenous silibinin (iSIL) against HCV in PR non-responders. The administration of 20mg/kg&#xD;
      iSIL in 20 patients led to a highly significant decrease in viral load. We intend to&#xD;
      investigate the effect and tolerability of iSIL in HIV-HCV co-infected individuals with&#xD;
      advanced liver fibrosis and previous non- or partial response to SOC. All included&#xD;
      study-subjects will receive a lead-in therapy with iSIL in a dosage of 20mg/kg/day (expressed&#xD;
      as silibinin concentration) once a day for 14 days. At the end of the THISTLE study, i.e.&#xD;
      after the day of completion of the 14-day iSIL administration (day 15), the patients will be&#xD;
      considered for eligibility to receive standard of care. We assume that the decline in HCV&#xD;
      viral load would substantially improve the chances of SVR as the reduction of viral load&#xD;
      should both increase the efficacy of PR and reduce the odds of drug resistance to&#xD;
      HCV-specific protease inhibitor.&#xD;
