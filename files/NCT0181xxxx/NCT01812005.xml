  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well alisertib with and without rituximab works in treating&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Alisertib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the&#xD;
      ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or&#xD;
      carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving alisertib with and without rituximab may be&#xD;
      an effective treatment for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy of MLN8237 (alisertib) alone in patients with relapsed and&#xD;
      refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and transformed NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy of MLN8237 when combined with rituximab in NHL patients who fail&#xD;
      to respond to MLN8237 alone in patients with relapsed and refractory NHL and transformed NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine specific toxicities associated with MLN8237 alone and when combined with&#xD;
      rituximab (in NHL patients) in patients with relapsed and refractory NHL and transformed NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine pharmacokinetics of MLN8237 alone and in combination with rituximab (for&#xD;
      NHL patients) in patients with relapsed and refractory NHL and transformed NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate specific molecular characteristics of the NHL for patients treated with&#xD;
      MLN8237 alone and with rituximab in order to correlate particular molecular markers with&#xD;
      response and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate long term survival of patients treated with MLN8237 alone and with rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT A: Patients receive alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7. Patients&#xD;
      unable to achieve complete response (CR) after course 4 also receive rituximab intravenously&#xD;
      (IV) on day 1 of courses 5-12. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT B: Patients receive alisertib as in Cohort A. Patients achieving stable disease (SD)&#xD;
      or asymptomatic progressive disease after 2 courses also receive rituximab IV on day 1 of&#xD;
      courses 3-10. Patients unable to achieve CR by course 4, receive rituximab as in Cohort A.&#xD;
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2&#xD;
      years and then every 6 months.&#xD;
