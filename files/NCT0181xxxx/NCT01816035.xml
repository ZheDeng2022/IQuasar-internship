      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best way of giving trastuzumab emtansine in&#xD;
      treating patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer&#xD;
      that has spread to other parts of the body or nearby tissue and cannot be removed by surgery.&#xD;
      Biological therapies, such as trastuzumab emtansine, may stimulate the immune system in&#xD;
      different ways and stop cancer cells from growing.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess change in thrombokinetics (platelet circulation life span).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Benefit rate (as defined by stable disease, partial response, or complete response by&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] v 1.1) at the end of study activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety of trastuzumab emtansine (ado-trastuzumab emtansine) (non-platelet&#xD;
      toxicity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ado-trastuzumab emtansine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive trastuzumab emtansine intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving response may continue treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;

    <description>The actual analysis will fit a linear mixed effects model, using a two-sided Wald test to compare pre-therapy to the two post-therapy values, and should have greater power than a matched pairs design. Also, platelet lifespan may be measured in absolute terms (platelet lifespan) or relative terms (percentage relative to pre-therapy lifespan), and may be transformed to decrease the influence of extreme values.</description>
