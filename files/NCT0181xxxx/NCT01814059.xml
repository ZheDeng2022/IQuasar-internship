      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disorders (EGID) are a group of related disorders&#xD;
           that affect the esophagus, stomach, and bowel. There are two major types of EGID,&#xD;
           eosinophilic esophagitis and eosinophilic gastroenteritis. They are caused by the body's&#xD;
           immune system being activated by food allergens, which then damages the gut wall. People&#xD;
           with EGID have large numbers of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in their gut.&#xD;
           EGID can cause difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain, or nausea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At present, there are no drugs specifically approved to treat EGID. Most adults who have&#xD;
           EGID receive steroid therapy to manage the symptoms. However, long-term steroid use may&#xD;
           cause other problems in the body. Researchers want to see if low-dose sirolimus can be&#xD;
           used to treat EGID. Sirolimus is a drug used to prevent rejection of transplanted&#xD;
           organs. It may be able to keep the body's immune cells from being activated by food&#xD;
           allergens and decrease the eosinophils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if low dose sirolimus is safe and decreases blood or gut eosinophils in EGID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 18 to 65 years of age who have EGID.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must also have an elevated blood eosinophil count and positive blood tests&#xD;
           for IgE antibodies to foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who are on medicine for EGID or related symptoms must be on a stable dose&#xD;
           for 1 month before screening and stay on that dose throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam, and review their&#xD;
           symptoms. They will provide blood and urine samples. They will also have heart and lung&#xD;
           function tests. Some participants may have allergy skin tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first study visit, participants will have 2 days of inpatient tests. They will&#xD;
           repeat the tests from the screening visit. They will also have a full analysis of the&#xD;
           esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. On the second day, they will start to take&#xD;
           sirolimus as a liquid with orange juice or water.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will continue to take sirolimus at home. They will record their doses and&#xD;
           any symptoms. They will also have a visit to provide blood samples about 2 weeks after&#xD;
           the first study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the second study visit (about a month after the first visit), participants will&#xD;
           repeat the tests from the screening visit. The sirolimus dose may be adjusted as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take sirolimus for at least another 28 days. Depending on the dose of&#xD;
           the drug and the blood test results, some participants may need to take it for up to 112&#xD;
           days. Those who take the drug for a longer period will have additional study visits with&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be another study visit when participants stop taking the drug. The last visit&#xD;
           will be a final follow-up visit.&#xD;

      Eosinophil-Associated Gastrointestinal Disorders (EGID) are a group of related disorders&#xD;
      characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms and eosinophilic infiltration of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal wall. The 2 major forms of EGID, eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and&#xD;
      eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EG), differ in regard to the site of inflammation (esophagus&#xD;
      vs. stomach/small bowel). Both EoE and EG are highly associated with coexisting allergic&#xD;
      disease, and a large fraction of EGID patients are sensitized to multiple food allergens.&#xD;
      Existing data strongly support the concept that EGID is a food-allergen-driven, eosinophilic,&#xD;
      inflammatory gut disease. Multiple lines of evidence support a major role for Th2 cells and&#xD;
      the cytokines they express (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) in EGID pathogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are presently no drugs with a labeled indication for EGID. Most adult patients are&#xD;
      managed long-term with corticosteroid therapy, which raises concerns about toxicity.&#xD;
      Sirolimus is an immunomodulator approved for use in preventing transplant rejection. It&#xD;
      specifically inhibits Th2 cell proliferation in vitro, suggesting it may have activity in&#xD;
      EGID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a phase I open-label design intending to target a sirolimus whole blood&#xD;
      concentration of 6 ng/mL for a duration of 56 days. Twenty adult EGID subjects 10 with EoE&#xD;
      and 10 with EG with evidence of Th2-mediated IgE sensitization and peripheral blood&#xD;
      eosinophil counts (Bullet)800 cells/ L will be recruited to participate. Subjects will begin&#xD;
      sirolimus at a dose of 1.2 mg/m2/day. Blood sirolimus level will be checked at 14- to 28-day&#xD;
      intervals, and the dose will be serially adjusted in each subject as needed to target the 6-&#xD;
      ng/mL target trough concentration. Blood will be drawn at each visit to monitor drug levels&#xD;
      and safety labs.&#xD;

                  months of twice daily proton-pump inhibitor therapy); and 3) no known etiology&#xD;
                  for the tissue eosinophilia despite careful clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Subjects with EG must have: 1) gastrointestinal symptoms; 2) histologic evidence&#xD;
                  of stomach or duodenal tissue infiltration by eosinophils with a peak greater&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Blood AEC greater than or equal to 800 cells/microL at the screening visit. This&#xD;
             screening value will not be used to calculate the baseline AEC used in the principal&#xD;
             secondary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Baseline laboratory values within the following ranges:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. White blood cell count greater than or equal to3,300 cells/microL.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to1,000 cells/microL.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Hemoglobin greater than or equal to10 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Platelet count greater than or equal to100,000 platelets/microL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Three or more positive allergen-specific IgE tests (skin tests or in vitro assay) out&#xD;
             of this panel of 10 food and aeroallergens: milk, eggs, wheat, soy, shrimp, cod, corn,&#xD;
             peanut, dust mite, cat.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects currently on medication for their EGID or for GI symptoms must be on a stable&#xD;
             dose for 1 month prior to screening and be willing to continue on that dose for the&#xD;
             duration of the study. Other medications (e.g. for hypertension, asthma, or&#xD;
             depression) may be adjusted by the subject s physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Willingness to have samples stored for future research and genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum beta-hCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Agree to practice abstinence or effective contraception as detailed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Contraception: The fetal risks associated with sirolimus are not known, but pre-clinical&#xD;
        animal data demonstrate some risk. Subjects must agree not to become pregnant or impregnate&#xD;
        a female, accordingly. Females of childbearing potential must have a pregnancy test at each&#xD;
        NIH visit. Because of the risk involved, both male and female subjects and their partners&#xD;
        must use 2 methods of birth control. As per the sirolimus package insert, subjects must&#xD;
        continue to use both methods for 3 months after stopping the study drug. Two methods of&#xD;
        birth control may be selected from the list included below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hormonal contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female condoms with or without a spermicidal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diaphragm or cervical cap with a spermicidal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intrauterine device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If pregnancy is suspected or should occur, subjects must notify the study staff&#xD;
        immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
