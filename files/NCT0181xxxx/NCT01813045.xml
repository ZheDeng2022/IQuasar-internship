  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Angiogenesis and fibrosis lie at the heart of a number of fundamental processes responsible&#xD;
      for cardiovascular disease. In this proposal, the investigators intend to build upon a highly&#xD;
      successful programme of studies exploring the cardiovascular applications of positron&#xD;
      emission tomography. Specifically, the investigators will explore the potential role of a&#xD;
      novel radiotracer, 18F-fluciclatide, which is a highly selective ligand for the αvβ3 and αvβ5&#xD;
      integrin receptors that are up regulated during angiogenesis, and tissue fibrosis and&#xD;
      remodelling. This tracer has been successfully used to assess angiogenesis in metastatic&#xD;
      tumours and its uptake is suppressed by anti-angiogenic therapies. The investigators here&#xD;
      propose to describe the pattern of uptake of 18F-fluciclatide in cardiovascular diseases,&#xD;
      specifically acute myocardial infarction and aortic atherosclerosis. The investigators will&#xD;
      correlate 18F-fluciclatide uptake with in vivo measures of angiogenesis and fibrosis. If&#xD;
      successful, this novel radiotracer could provide an extremely important non-invasive method&#xD;
      of assessing in vivo angiogenesis, plaque vulnerability, and tissue remodelling as well as&#xD;
      potential applications in developing stem cell therapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Integrins are a group of molecules responsible for intercellular adhesion and signalling.&#xD;
      They comprise a superfamily of heterodimeric receptors that are composed of 18 different α&#xD;
      and β subunits. In combination, they can generate 24 different receptor subtypes with a range&#xD;
      of physiological and pathophysiological functions [Takada et al, 2007]. The αvβ3 receptor is&#xD;
      an integrin that is found at low levels on mature endothelial cells but is markedly up&#xD;
      regulated on endothelial cells of actively growing blood vessels. It was previously known as&#xD;
      the vitronectin receptor although it was subsequently found to bind many other ligands&#xD;
      including fibrinogen, fibronectin, laminin, thrombospondin, von Willebrand factor, and&#xD;
      certain collagen subtypes. These features are also seen with the αvβ5 integrin receptor, with&#xD;
      both receptors recognising the arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) motif present on these&#xD;
      ligands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.2 Role of αvβ3 and αvβ5 Integrins in Cardiovascular Disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expression of αvβ3 and αvβ5 receptors is up regulated in a number of diseased states and&#xD;
      this has been particularly well characterised in the angiogenesis associated with tumour&#xD;
      growth and metastases [Friedlander et al, 1995; Brooks et al, 1994]. However, there are many&#xD;
      potential roles for this integrin pathway in cardiovascular disease including myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, atherosclerosis, restenosis, aortic stenosis and aneurysm disease that have been&#xD;
      relatively unexplored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.2.1 Myocardial Infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
      After myocardial infarction, there is an intense inflammatory response followed by&#xD;
      angiogenesis and fibrosis. During this time of healing and reparation, there is marked up&#xD;
      regulation of integrins in order to orchestrate efficient myocardial healing. For the αvβ3&#xD;
      and αvβ5 integrin receptors, this reflects both angiogenesis and fibrosis given their ligand&#xD;
      binding properties [van den Borne et al, 2008; Higuchi et al, 2008]. This is at the centre of&#xD;
      early and delayed left ventricular remodelling in the infarct and peri-infarct zone. The&#xD;
      early phase is dominated by angiogenesis to restore vascular integrity and tissue perfusion&#xD;
      with αvβ3 and αvβ5 receptors being up regulated and expressed on activated endothelial cells&#xD;
      within newly forming vessels [Higuchi et al, 2008]. With subsequent myocardial healing and&#xD;
      remodelling, activation of fibroblasts and differentiation into myofibroblasts requires αvβ3&#xD;
      and αvβ5 receptor interactions and is central to the development of fibrosis [van den Borne&#xD;
      et al, 2008]. Maladaptive fibrotic responses and adverse left ventricular remodelling may&#xD;
      underlie the development of heart failure following myocardial infarction. These processes&#xD;
      and pathways may also play a role in the development of myocardial fibrosis in other&#xD;
      conditions such as left ventricular hypertrophy associated with aortic stenosis [Dweck et al,&#xD;
      2011].&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.2.2 Atherosclerosis and Restenosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of atherosclerosis is due to a complex interplay of oxidised lipid,&#xD;
      inflammatory cell infiltration, and smooth muscle cell migration in the arterial wall. Once&#xD;
      established, atherosclerotic plaques may progress and rupture leading to the clinical&#xD;
      presentations of acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Features associated with plaque&#xD;
      rupture include a thin fibrous cap, lipid-rich pool and intraplaque haemorrhage. Indeed,&#xD;
      plaque rupture is particularly associated with plaque neovascularisation and&#xD;
      vascular-endothelial growth factor expression [Hiyama et al, 2010] suggesting that&#xD;
      instability may be induced by angiogenesis. Thus, up regulation of αvβ3 and αvβ5 receptors&#xD;
      may represent a novel marker of, and potential therapeutic target for [Maile et al, 2010],&#xD;
      plaque vulnerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process of neointimal hyperplasia and restenosis following percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention involves the recruitment of vascular smooth muscle cells. This process is also&#xD;
      dependent on both αvβ3 and αvβ5 receptors and is also a potential target for inhibition of&#xD;
      restenosis [Kokubo et al, 2007].&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.3 Fluciclatide&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluciclatide is a RGD-containing cyclic peptide that has recently been developed as an&#xD;
      18F-radiotracer to detect tumour angiogenesis by positron emission tomography. It is highly&#xD;
      selective for the αvβ3 and αvβ5 receptors with affinities (EC50) of 11.1 and 0.1 nM&#xD;
      respectively with minimal cross reactivity with the αIIbβ3 receptor (EC50 281 nM).&#xD;
      Pre-clinical tumour work has demonstrated that 18F-fluciclatide is taken up by glioblastomas&#xD;
      and that this is suppressed by the anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sunitinib,&#xD;
      confirming the specificity of fluciclatide for areas of angiogenesis. It has been assessed in&#xD;
      phase I clinical trials and found to be safe and well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.4 Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there have been many preclinical studies examining the application of radiotracers&#xD;
      targeting the αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrin receptors. The clinical application of these tracers has&#xD;
      been largely limited to oncology as a method of assessing angiogenesis within tumours. Here&#xD;
      we wish to explore the role of the αvβ3 and αvβ5 receptor radiotracer, 18F-fluciclatide, to&#xD;
      assess angiogenesis and fibrosis in two major cardiovascular disease areas. Specifically, we&#xD;
      intend to assess myocardial angiogenesis and remodeling in patients with recent myocardial&#xD;
      infarction. We anticipate that this patient group will have co-existent aortic atheroma and&#xD;
      this will provide us with an opportunistic assessment of tracer uptake in atherosclerosis. We&#xD;
      feel it is important to assess a range of cardiovascular conditions to determine whether αvβ3&#xD;
      and αvβ5 integrin receptor expression is particular to certain disease processes. If&#xD;
      successful, these preliminary data will permit the more detailed exploration of specific&#xD;
      disease areas and novel therapeutic interventions. At present, fluciclatide is not licensed&#xD;
      or approved for clinical use and is being used here as an Investigational Agent to explore&#xD;
      the pathophysiology of aortic stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 ORIGINAL HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesise that 18F-fluciclatide can identify the expression of the αvβ3 and αvβ5&#xD;
      integrin receptors in vivo in man in two major cardiovascular disease areas: acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and aortic atherosclerosis. Specifically, we hypothesise that 18F-fluciclatide&#xD;
      will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demonstrate selective uptake within the region of myocardial infarction in the early&#xD;
           phase of recovery (1-3 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Bind in both the infarct and remote regions of patients with substantial myocardial&#xD;
           infarction in the later phases of recovery (6-12 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Be taken up into aortic atherosclerotic plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 ASSESSMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 ANGIOGENESIS AND FIBROSIS FOLLOWING ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following acute myocardial infarction, there is intense up regulation of αvβ3 and αvβ5&#xD;
      receptors that initially helps regulate angiogenesis and the restoration of vascular&#xD;
      integrity and tissue perfusion in addition to delayed expression that is associated with the&#xD;
      development of fibrosis within the infarcted myocardium. We will therefore assess patients&#xD;
      two and nine weeks after acute myocardial infarction. Because it will not be possible to&#xD;
      undertake direct histological confirmation of angiogenesis or fibrosis in this population, we&#xD;
      will compare these findings to patients with established collateral coronary blood flow from&#xD;
      a chronic coronary artery occlusion as well as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging of&#xD;
      established and stable myocardial fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1.1 Study Schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      On days 14±7 and 63±7 following an acute myocardial infarction, 30 patients will undergo&#xD;
      blood sampling and positron emission and computed tomography scans with 18F-fluciclatide.&#xD;
      Following injection of 18F-fluciclatide, patients will be monitored using our standard&#xD;
      clinical approach, including observation of haemodynamic parameters, and this will continue&#xD;
      throughout their study visit until departure. They will also undergo cardiac magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging with assessment of gadolinium perfusion and late enhancement on day 14±7&#xD;
      and again between 6 to 12 months after the myocardial infarction. We will specifically&#xD;
      recruit two equal sized and matched populations of patients (n=15 per group) in whom the&#xD;
      infarct-related artery has been, or has not been, revascularised with percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention. In addition, we will similarly assess, on a single occasion, 10 age and&#xD;
      sex-matched patients with a chronic (&gt;6 months) occlusion of a major epicardial vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be assessed using standard clinical biochemical and haematological&#xD;
      profiles such as full blood count and urea and electrolytes. In addition, markers of cardiac&#xD;
      ischaemia, fibrosis and angiogenesis will be assessed. Additional serum, plasma and DNA will&#xD;
      be stored at -80 degrees Celsius for future potential analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1.2 Study Interpretation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that the vessels will be fully established, the collateral arteries and any infarcted&#xD;
      myocardium of patients with a chronic occlusion will not express the αvβ3 and αvβ5 receptors,&#xD;
      and will act as negative controls. We also anticipate that those with an acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and an unrevascularised complete coronary artery occlusion will have more&#xD;
      intensive uptake of 18F-fluciclatide at both day 14 and day 63 because of greater early&#xD;
      neovascularisation and more extensive infarction. Patients with complete revascularisation&#xD;
      are likely to have modest angiogenesis and fibrosis, and we therefore anticipate less intense&#xD;
      18F-fluciclatide uptake at both time points. Although we will not have a comparator of&#xD;
      histology, the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging will provide us with data on the extent of&#xD;
      the myocardial infarction (day 14) and fibrosis (6 - 12 months), left ventricular function,&#xD;
      degree of myocardial perfusion and presence of microvascular obstruction. We will also assess&#xD;
      the entire infarct group (n=30) to determine whether the extent of 18F-fluciclatide uptake&#xD;
      correlates with magnetic resonance measures of left ventricular function and remodelling&#xD;
      following infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to use the images obtained from 10 age and sex matched healthy subjects recruited&#xD;
      from a co-existing study titled 'The identification of in vivo angiogenesis and fibrosis in&#xD;
      aortic stenosis using positron emission tomography' (R&amp;D 2012/R/CAR/23, REC 12/SS/0204).&#xD;
      These will act as negative controls as comparators for healthy myocardium. It is a similar&#xD;
      study involving the use of radiotracer 18F-Fluciclatide in patients with Aortic Stenosis.&#xD;
      These patients will have undergone a single CT-PET scan and an MRI scan with assessment of&#xD;
      late gadolinium enhancement and will have consented for their data to be used in this current&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 ANGIOGENESIS IN AORTIC ATHEROSCLEROSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with acute myocardial infarction will have a high prevalence of concomitant aortic&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. In Dr Dweck's Fellowship, we were able to exploit this association and&#xD;
      undertake secondary analyses of 18F-sodium fluoride uptake in aortic and coronary&#xD;
      atherosclerosis [Dweck et al, 2012b]. This generated some highly innovative findings that&#xD;
      informed our understanding of atherosclerosis and the role of calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2.1 Study Schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use the datasets obtained from the patients above to explore the uptake of&#xD;
      18F-fluciclatide within the thoracic aorta. Atherosclerosis will be identified using computed&#xD;
      tomography and magnetic resonance images obtained of the thorax at the time of the study&#xD;
      scans. No additional image acquisition will be required. This will provide pilot data to&#xD;
      inform subsequent dedicated studies focused on acutely inflamed atherosclerotic plaques, such&#xD;
      as patients with recent transient ischaemic attacks or strokes attributable to carotid&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
