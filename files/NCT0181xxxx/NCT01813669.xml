  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether an integrative group-based intervention will&#xD;
      help children experiencing psychological and physical distress. Children, ages 10 to 12, will&#xD;
      be recruited for participation in this therapeutic group. Eligible and consenting&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to a wait-list control group or the group intervention. The&#xD;
      group intervention will take place over a 12-week period, during which participants will&#xD;
      attend a weekly coping skills group that integrates yoga-based practices (such as yoga poses,&#xD;
      mindfulness, self-acceptance, breath work) with cognitive-behavioral principles (such as&#xD;
      increasing awareness of thoughts and emotions).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psychosomatic symptoms are physical complaints in the absence of an organic cause. For&#xD;
      children and adolescents, psychosomatic symptoms often manifest as headaches,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort, non-specific musculoskeletal pain, and fatigue. These&#xD;
      symptoms are strongly associated with the presence of an internalizing disorder-namely,&#xD;
      anxiety or depression-in youth. Thus, treatment of these symptoms has often been cached&#xD;
      within a broader intervention protocol, the overarching goal of which is to address the&#xD;
      global internalizing disorder. For children who experience intense and persistent&#xD;
      psychosomatic discomfort, however, it can be critical to specifically target these symptoms&#xD;
      through intensive intervention. Otherwise, psychosomatic complaints can be extremely&#xD;
      impairing, impeding children's attendance in school, participation in extracurricular&#xD;
      activities, and disrupting family activities. At present, there are few systematic that can&#xD;
      target a range of psychosomatic problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yoga-based interventions may be a particularly valuable treatment for children with&#xD;
      psychosomatic complaints. Such interventions have been studied empirically in adults with a&#xD;
      number of psychosomatic conditions, and more recently in children with a variety of&#xD;
      psychological conditions. Indeed, there have been a small number of studies targeting&#xD;
      psychosomatic complaints in children via yogic practices. Although there is emerging interest&#xD;
      in yoga-based interventions for youth, and slowly growing evidence their efficacy, at present&#xD;
      there are no known structured interventions for youth with psychosomatic complaints in the&#xD;
      context of an internalizing disorder. Thus, the goal of the present proposal is to develop a&#xD;
      semi-structured, manualized intervention that targets impairing psychosomatic symptoms in&#xD;
      youth with a comorbid internalizing disorders. The specific aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 Treatment Feasibility: Assess the feasibility of a novel integrative coping&#xD;
      intervention for children with somatic symptoms and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The yoga-based intervention will be acceptable and feasible for children.&#xD;
      Acceptability will be defined as a 50% consent rate among participants approached for the&#xD;
      study; Feasibility will be defined by 75% of children completing 80% of intervention&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 1 Treatment Efficacy: Assess the preliminary efficacy of a 12-week integrative&#xD;
      coping intervention on both somatic and psychological (e.g., anxiety, mood) symptoms compared&#xD;
      to a wait-list control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Children in the active intervention condition will have a significant reduction&#xD;
      in somatic and anxiety symptoms following the 12-week intervention compared to a wait-list&#xD;
      control.&#xD;

    <description>The proposed 12-week intervention will integrate yoga-based skills with cognitive-behavioral principles. The development of this program was based on existing and empirically-validated cognitive-behavioral interventions for youth (i.e., Coping Cat and Cat Project; Kendall et al.) and therapeutic yoga interventions (e.g., Galantino et al., 2008 for review). The intervention will be broken down into four three-week modules, which address the following:&#xD;
Module 1: Introduction to group and awareness of body Module 2: Awareness of emotion and developing an understanding of the mind-body connection Module 3: Focus on cognitive process Module 4: Experiential practice and therapeutic discussions</description>

    <description>Participants in the waitlist condition will not receive any experimental intervention. They can continue any treatments as usual. The waitlist will be approximately 10-14 weeks in duration. At the end they will be offered the opportunity to participate in the intervention. If they elect to participate in the intervention, post-study data will also be collected from this group, approximately 13-weeks following the first group session.</description>
