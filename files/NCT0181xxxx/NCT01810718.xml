      Chronic Graft versus Host Disease (cGvHD) has been identified as the leading cause of late&#xD;
      non-relapse mortality in Hemopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) survivors. Up to now a&#xD;
      standard satisfactory treatment for these patients does not exist. cGVHD is an&#xD;

      Chronic Graft versus Host Disease (cGvHD) has been identified as the leading cause of late&#xD;
      non-relapse mortality in Hemopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) survivors. Up to now a&#xD;
      standard satisfactory treatment for these patients does not exist. cGVHD is an&#xD;
      immune-mediated disease, resulting from a complex interaction between donor and recipient&#xD;
      adaptive immunity, but its exact pathogenesis is still incompletely defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many cGVHD patients show skin and visceral involvement with fibrotic scleroderma-like&#xD;
      features; recent experimental data suggest that patients with cGVHD with fibrotic/sclerotic&#xD;
      manifestations, have agonistic antibodies activating the platelet-derived growth factor&#xD;
      receptor (PDGF-R), like patients with Systemic Scleroderma (SS), suggesting a similar&#xD;
      pathogenesis for these two diseases; recently it has been demonstrated that the up-regulation&#xD;
      of the PDGF-R intracellular pathway leads to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), with&#xD;
      consequent increased collagen synthesis, which, in turn, contributes to the pathologic&#xD;
      lesions observed in both cGVHD and SS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many data strongly suggest that, among the profibrotic cytokines, besides PDGF, also&#xD;
      transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) can play a relevant role in the pathogenesis of fibrotic&#xD;
      damage. Blockade of PDGF or TGF-β signaling has been shown to reduce the development of&#xD;
      fibrosis in various experimental models. Recent in vitro data showed that the Tyrosine Kinase&#xD;
      Inhibitor (TKI), Imatinib strongly inhibits both PDGF and TGF-β intracellular signaling.&#xD;
      Considering this selective, dual inhibition by Imatinib of the TGF-β/PDGF pathways, we&#xD;
      conducted a pilot study evaluating safety and activity of Imatinib in a series of patients&#xD;
      affected by refractory cGVHD, with fibrotic/sclerotic features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2008 we started a national pilot multicentric study (supported by AIFA) to confirm these&#xD;
      preliminary data; until now, 24 patients have been enrolled, and an interim analysis&#xD;
      confirmed that Imatinib at low dosage is safe and well tolerated in this setting; however the&#xD;
      response rate observed in this second study is 50% at sixth month, apparently inferior to the&#xD;
      first pilot experience. Two possible reasons could be responsible for this discrepancy:&#xD;
      first, in the last study, the response criteria are more stringent, being related to a&#xD;
      multi-organ evaluation (according to the NIH Consensus Conference on GVHD); secondly, the&#xD;
      average age of the patients enrolled in the second trial is significantly superior to the&#xD;
      other ones (in the first study we observed the best responses in young patients). It's&#xD;
      important to point out that the higher tolerated dose of Imatinib in this setting of patients&#xD;
      is significantly inferior (100-200 mg) to the dosage currently used in patients with Chronic&#xD;
      Myeloid Leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Like Imatinib, Nilotinib is a TKI with better tolerability profile suggesting a better&#xD;
      compliance, especially in frail patients with poor haematological tolerance and poor Quality&#xD;
      of Life (QoL), such as those affected by steroid-refractory cGvHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore in the population of allotransplanted patients, with steroid-refractory cGvHD, an&#xD;
      innovative approach with a novel TKI is justified for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Both first-generation TKI and second-generation TKI have been largely used for long&#xD;
           periods in many patients with malignancies, showing a good safety profile;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Imatinib achieved preliminary encouraging results in refractory cGvHD patients, who&#xD;
           represent a frail and truly orphan population with a very poor quality of life;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The availability of a new TKI with better tolerability profile can achieve not only a&#xD;
           better response rate, (which may be considered perhaps a cosmetic result), but it could&#xD;
           be also better tolerated for long time, allowing to improve the compliance and the&#xD;
           duration of treatment in responding patients, with a consequent impact on the long term&#xD;
           outcome of the transplantation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nilotinib is a novel aminopyrimidine, protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor which has been&#xD;
      developed based on crystallographic studies of the interaction between IM (imatinib) and ABL&#xD;
      (tyrosine kinase product of Abelson gene), so as to increase the affinity and the binding&#xD;
      capacity of the derivative to wild type ABL and more important, to the ABL mutants which are&#xD;
      the main cause of IM resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nilotinib is active against the same TK as Imatinib, namely Abl, BCR-ABL (BCR-ABL oncoprotein&#xD;
      product of BCR-ABL fusion gene), PDGFR-α and β, and c-Kit, but it is at least 10 times more&#xD;
      potent against BCR-ABL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, Nilotinib is not active, like Imatinib, against several other TKs, including&#xD;
      VEGFR-2, c-ERB-2, FLT3 (fetal liver tyrosine kinase 3), IGFR-1R (insulin-like growth factor&#xD;
      receptor 1), Jak-2, RAS, lk and AKT. More interesting and more important (Table 2), Nilotinib&#xD;
      is more active that Imatinib against a number of BCR-ABL mutants, with the exception of the&#xD;
      T315I. It has to be noticed that in all the proliferation assays the concentration at which&#xD;
      50% of effect is inhibited of Nilotinib is lower than 50 nM, apart from the two BCR-ABL&#xD;
      mutants (E255K and E255V) where the IC50 is 600 to 700 nM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have design a prospective, phase I/II, non-randomized, open-label, multicenter study to&#xD;
      determine safety and efficacy of Nilotinib in a population with steroid-refractory/or&#xD;
      steroid-dependent cGvHD. In phase I approximately 3-24 patients will be needed to find the&#xD;
      MTD depending on the toxicities seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase II the MTD will be used to define the efficacy of Nilotinib in a cGvHD steroid-&#xD;
      refractory or steroid dependent population, with the same characteristics of the previously&#xD;
      Imatinib-treated population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL DESIGN AND SAMPLE SIZE Phase I (Dose finding). Phase I will be conducted&#xD;
      according to a standard 3+3 design. Initially, three patients will receive the lowest dose of&#xD;
      Nilotinib, 200 mg QD. If no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), defined as that dose which includes&#xD;
      any Grade III/IV toxicity by the NCI-COMMON TOXICITY CRITERIA criteria is observed in the&#xD;
      current cohort after at least one month of treatment, the next three patients will be treated&#xD;
      with the next higher dose of Nilotinib (300 mg QD), then 200 mg BID, then 300 mg BID).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If two or more DLTs are observed, the Phase I will end and MTD will be defined as the next&#xD;
      lower dosage. If we will observe one DLT (1/3 patients), we will treat other three patients&#xD;
      with the same dosage; if there isn't another DLT in these three patients, we will increase&#xD;
      the dosage in the next cohort; but if we will observe another DLT in this cohort (total DLT&#xD;
      2/6 patients), this means that we exceeded the MTD, and the study will continue in phase II&#xD;
      using the previous dose. MTD will be considered the maximum dosage used to treat six patients&#xD;
      achieving at most one DLT, or the minimum dosage if with this dosage we will achieve two DLT.&#xD;
      In case of limiting Grade II toxicity a meeting of the data safety monitoring board (DSMB)&#xD;
      might be held to decide how to continue the study. Pharmacokinetics: pharmacokinetics serum&#xD;
      levels of Nilotinib will be determined in all patients within this phase by using&#xD;
      mass-spectrometry assay, thanks to collaboration of Professor F. Pane, Naples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doses will not be escalated beyond 600 or below 200 mg/die. Then the algorithm will proceed&#xD;
      into Phase II. The dose estimated as the MTD in phase I will be used for phase II, this dose&#xD;
      will be reviewed and may be adjusted accordingly by the DSMB after the analysis of toxicity&#xD;
      obtained from all phase I patients at least 3 months under therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II (Clinical efficacy part) To evaluate the efficacy of Nilotinib treatment the study&#xD;
      will follow a Minimax design. This design consists in two subsequent enrolment phases. 19&#xD;
      patients will be recruited in the first stage and, if after the enrolment not more than 6&#xD;
      responses will happen, then the trial will end. In the second stage, other 20 patients will&#xD;
      be recruited. The upper limit of the second stage rejection of the drug is 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole number of recruited patients will be 39 with an early termination probability of&#xD;
      67%. If after the first stage, the number of responses is fewer than or equal to a&#xD;
      pre-determined value, r1 of n1, then PET is equal B(r1;n1,p) where B denotes the cumulative&#xD;
      distribution function evaluated at r1 for a random variable that is binomially distributed&#xD;
      with parameters n1 and p is the true probability of response. If the trial continues to the&#xD;
      second stage, then the drug is rejected at the end of this stage if r or fewer responses are&#xD;
      observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the best results observed in the literature with experimental treatments of steroid&#xD;
      refractory cGvHD, we choose an overall minimal response (CR+PR) rate at least 50%, that is&#xD;
      p1=0.50. The rate of ineffectiveness after the first stage is required not greater than 30%,&#xD;
      (no attention is paid to its correlation to the disease or to the treatment), so p0=0.30. If&#xD;
      the significance level is alpha=0.05, requiring a power of 1-beta=0.80, they have n1=19, r1=6&#xD;
      according to the tables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow the Good Clinical Practice rules, and the ongoing trial will be&#xD;
      monitored by the promoter GITMO &quot;Trials Office&quot;.&#xD;
