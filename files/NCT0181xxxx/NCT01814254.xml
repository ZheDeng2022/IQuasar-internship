  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Estimation of hydration state in dialysis patients is a major challenge in clinical practice.&#xD;
      Although many methods have been studied, none have been established yet for clinical routine&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed a method, using segmental and calf bioimpedance spectroscopy&#xD;
      (cBIS) techniques to measure body hydration. The device we used based on the FDA-approved&#xD;
      Hydra 4200 (Xitron Technologies, San Diego, CA). The Hydra 4200 was initially developed to&#xD;
      measure whole body and segmental body fluid volumes but Hydra is approved only for measuring&#xD;
      healthy subjects. The cBIS monitors hydration state by continuously measuring change in&#xD;
      resistance and resistivity in the calf during hemodialysis (HD) or it can be used for simple&#xD;
      measurement before, during and after dialysis. Preliminary results in clinical studies have&#xD;
      shown that optimal hydration state of HD patients may be determined by the calf method. This&#xD;
      study aims to compare the Hydra 4200 to two other devices: the FDA approved ZOE (100 kHz)&#xD;
      Fluid Status Monitor (Noninvasive Medical Technologies, Inc, Las Vegas) and a modified&#xD;
      version ZOE 5 kHz. The modified ZOE monitor (ZOE (5 kHz)) delivers frequency of 5 kHz and 0.8&#xD;
      mA current instead of 100 kHz and 2 mA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects of this study include a group of hemodialysis patients and a group of healthy&#xD;
      controls. The healthy controls are used to identify a normal range within the healthy&#xD;
      population for each method. Each hemodialysis patient will be studied twice in different&#xD;
      hydration state. The study will not change the procedure of the patient's dialysis treatment.&#xD;
      Since all devices are based on noninvasive bioimpedance technique, this study has minimal&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
