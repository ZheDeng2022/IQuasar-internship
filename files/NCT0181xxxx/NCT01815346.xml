  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the level of effectiveness for 2&#xD;
      acupuncture treatment schedules for chronic CIPN in breast cancer survivors. Researchers also&#xD;
      want to study how patients may respond to acupuncture treatments, and how the treatments may&#xD;
      affect quality of life, hand function, balance, and the use of drugs for neuropathy pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common chemotherapy side effects affecting the&#xD;
      nerves. Each year, thousands of patients receive taxane-based chemotherapy and more than&#xD;
      50-60% of these patients will have CIPN. CIPN can cause painful or abnormal skin sensation&#xD;
      (such as pins and needles), numbness, and/or nerve damage that may affect movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You have already had certain tests as part of your routine care that helped show that you&#xD;
      were eligible to take part in this study. If you agree to take part in this study, the&#xD;
      following tests and procedures will be performed at your first study visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate) will be&#xD;
           measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may be&#xD;
           having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete 3 questionnaires about any symptoms you may have. The questionnaires&#xD;
           should take about 15-30 minutes to complete in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will perform hand function and balance tests. For these tests, you will complete&#xD;
           tasks such as putting pegs into a pegboard. These tests should take about 20 minutes to&#xD;
           complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. Both groups will&#xD;
      receive a total of 12 acupuncture treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 will receive acupuncture 2 times a week for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 will receive acupuncture 3 times a week for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture Treatments (All Participants):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your acupuncture treatments will be given on an outpatient basis in private rooms. For the&#xD;
      treatment, you will lay down on a table face up. The acupuncturist will disinfect the&#xD;
      selected acupuncture points with alcohol. Then, the acupuncture needles will be placed so&#xD;
      that you achieve a &quot;de qi&quot; sensation, which is often described as an achy, tingling, or numb&#xD;
      feeling of pressure after an acupuncture needle has been properly placed in the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acupuncture needles will be left in place for about 20 minutes. During this time, the&#xD;
      needles will be charged with a small electric current, which is done to enhance the effect of&#xD;
      the acupuncture treatment. The needles may also be twirled to cause the sensation of de qi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each treatment session, you will receive acupuncture to the arms, legs, and abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) time every week:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your vital signs will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may be&#xD;
           having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Weeks 3 and 6 (Group 1 only) and Weeks 2 and 4 (Group 2 only):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the same 3 questionnaires you completed at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will perform hand function and balance tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue your participation on this study for up to 10 weeks, as long as the study&#xD;
      doctor thinks it is your best interest. Your active participation in this study will be over&#xD;
      after you have completed the 4-week follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four (4) weeks after you complete the acupuncture treatment, the following tests and/or&#xD;
      procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your vital signs will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be reviewed and any updates will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may be&#xD;
           having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the same 3 questionnaires you completed at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will perform hand function and balance tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The acupuncture needles being used in this study are FDA&#xD;
      approved for medical use. The use of acupuncture treatments for chronic CIPN on the schedules&#xD;
      in this study is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 54 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

             bortezumab chemotherapy in the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Local infection at or near the acupuncture site. (Although acupuncture is a minimally&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Active central nervous system (CNS) disease. (The action for acupuncture may be&#xD;
             associated with central nervous system activity, and patients with CNS pathology may&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Mental incapacitation or significant emotional or psychological disorder that, in the&#xD;
