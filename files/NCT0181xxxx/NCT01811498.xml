  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high-grade malignant brain tumors, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), comprise the majority&#xD;
      of all primary brain tumors in adults. This group of tumors also exhibits the most aggressive&#xD;
      behavior, resulting in median overall survival of only 9-12 months. Initial therapy consists&#xD;
      of either surgical resection, external beam radiation, or both. All patients experience a&#xD;
      recurrence after first-line therapy, so improvements in both first-line and salvage therapy&#xD;
      are critical to enhancing quality-of-life and prolonging survival. It is unknown if currently&#xD;
      used intravenous (IV) therapies even cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). We have shown in a&#xD;
      previous phase I trial that a single Superselective Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion (SIACI)&#xD;
      of Bevacizumab (up to 15mg/kg) is safe and effective in the treatment of recurrent GBM.&#xD;
      Therefore, this phase I/II clinical research trial is an extension of that trial in that we&#xD;
      seek to test the hypothesis that repeated dosing of intra-arterial Bevacizumab is safe and&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of newly diagnosed malignant glioma. By achieving the aims of this&#xD;
      study we will also determine if repeated intra-arterial Bevacizumab improves progression free&#xD;
      and overall survival in newly diagnosed patients. We expect that this project will provide&#xD;
      important information regarding the utility of repeated SIACI Bevacizumab therapy for&#xD;
      malignant glioma, and may alter the way these drugs are delivered to our patients in the near&#xD;
      future.&#xD;

      The experimental aspects of this experimental plan will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects will first be treated with Mannitol prior to chemotherapy infusion (Mannitol&#xD;
           20%; delivered IA, 12.5 mL over 2 minutes) in order to disrupt the blood brain barrier.&#xD;
           This technique has been used in several thousand subjects in previous studies for the IA&#xD;
           delivery of chemotherapy for malignant glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects will then be treated with repeated intraarterial delivery (SIACI) of&#xD;
           Bevacizumab. Each subject will receive one dose of IA Bevacizumab on day 30, followed by&#xD;
           chemoradiation. SIACI of Bevacizumab will be repeated every three months for a total of&#xD;
           3 infusions.&#xD;

        Criteria for Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients of ≥18 years of age.&#xD;

             diagnosed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have at least one confirmed and evaluable tumor site.∗&#xD;
&#xD;
             *A confirmed tumor site is one which is biopsy-proven. NOTE: Radiographic procedures&#xD;
             (e.g., Gd-enhanced MRI or CT scans) documenting existing lesions must have been&#xD;
             performed within three weeks of treatment on this research study.&#xD;
