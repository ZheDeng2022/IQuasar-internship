  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether tactile stimulation for reduced sensibility&#xD;
      of the affected extremities after stroke has effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulation of sensibility after stroke will have a significant contribution for improved&#xD;
      sensibility. Without any stimulation, no signal is sent to the brain and there is no need for&#xD;
      the healthy parts of the brain to adapt this function. Stimulation of the sensibility over a&#xD;
      period of time on both sides of the body, gives the brain signals and the opportunity to&#xD;
      compare how the signals should be recognized. New connection will be able to interpret&#xD;
      signals correctly.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through stroke rehabilitation, function from damaged areas can be replaced by healthy parts&#xD;
      of the brain. It is important for rehabilitation to take advantage of this compensatory&#xD;
      qualities whit early intervention and mobilization. Only small gains can lead to big&#xD;
      improvements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About half of stroke survivors gets reduced sensibility caused bye the stroke, and&#xD;
      sensibility is considered to be an important part of rehabilitation of function and&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Norwegian guideline concludes that the scientific knowledge is to week to recommend this&#xD;
      kind of treatment. There is some evidence for improvement of sensibility when specific&#xD;
      training and stimulation is given. Achievements in sensibility can lead to some improvement&#xD;
      in function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be carried out as a randomized controlled trial. In this project, the&#xD;
      intervention group receive tactile senses stimulated twice daily over a period of 3 months,&#xD;
      while the control group receives standard treatment. The results from both groups are&#xD;
      measured before and after treatment.&#xD;
