      Combined spinal-epidurals (CSE) involve the injection of pain relief medication into the&#xD;
      cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and the insertion of an epidural catheter in the epidural space&#xD;
      to continue to give pain relief medication. During a CSE, after injection of the medication&#xD;
      in the CSF and before inserting the epidural catheter, if normal saline is injected into the&#xD;
      epidural space, there may be an increase in pain relief and an increase in the level of&#xD;
      numbness. This injection of saline in the epidural space to increase pain relief and numbness&#xD;
      is termed epidural volume extension (EVE). The purpose of this study is to determine if there&#xD;
      is a benefit for EVE to improve labor analgesia (pain relief) using CSE in pregnant laboring&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Regional analgesia (pain relief) for labor can be an epidural, a spinal or a combination of&#xD;
      the two. Combined spinal-epidurals (CSE) are popular because of their rapid pain relief and&#xD;
      high patient satisfaction. At the IWK Health Centre, many anesthesiologists routinely use&#xD;
      this method of pain relief. It involves the injection of pain relief medication into the&#xD;
      cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and the insertion of an epidural catheter (slim plastic tube) in&#xD;
      the epidural space to continue to give pain relief medication. The epidural space is located&#xD;
      just outside the CSF. In order to insert the epidural catheter, some anesthesiologists inject&#xD;
      2-4 ml of saline in the epidural space to help the catheter go in. During a CSE, after&#xD;
      injection of the medication in the CSF and before inserting the epidural catheter, if normal&#xD;
      saline is injected into the epidural space, there may be an increase in pain relief and an&#xD;
      increase in the level of numbness. This injection of saline in the epidural space to increase&#xD;
      pain relief and numbness is termed epidural volume extension (EVE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus far, studies on EVE have all been done in patients undergoing surgery with spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia and not solely for analgesia. The purpose of this study is to determine if there&#xD;
      is a benefit for EVE to improve labor analgesia (pain relief) using CSE. We will study 60&#xD;
      women requesting labor pain relief. Half these women will receive a CSE without EVE, which is&#xD;
      the present standard of care. The other half will receive a CSE with 10 ml of saline for EVE&#xD;
      before inserting the epidural catheter. We will then determine if there is a benefit for EVE&#xD;
      by observing for a difference between the two groups with respect to the level of numbness,&#xD;
      the amount and speed of pain relief and the intensity of leg weakness. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      injecting 10 ml of saline for EVE using CSE may improve the amount and speed of pain relief&#xD;
      while decreasing side effects such as leg weakness. If there were a benefit to EVE, this&#xD;
      would be a simple and inexpensive method for improving pain relief in laboring women.&#xD;
