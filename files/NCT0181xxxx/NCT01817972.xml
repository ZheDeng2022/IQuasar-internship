  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind trial of combination therapy (Cimzia plus Azathioprine)&#xD;
      versus mono therapy (Cimzia alone) and the improvement in mean SES-CD (Simple Endoscopic&#xD;
      Scoring in Crohn's Disease) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a trial where the investigators are administering biological therapy by itself and&#xD;
      biological therapy plus an immunosuppressive medicine in combination to see which form of&#xD;
      therapy has a better effect on healing ulcerations in the small intestine and colon that are&#xD;
      due to a flare up of Crohn's disease.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient has signed an Informed Consent Form (ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient is ambulatory, community-dwelling male or non-pregnant female and is aged&#xD;
             between 18 and 70 years at the Screening Visit. Lactating females must agree not to&#xD;
             breastfeed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Sexually active female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use one of the&#xD;
             following methods of birth control from the date they sign the ICF until the&#xD;
             conclusion of the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Hormonal contraception (i.e. oral contraceptive, contraceptive implant, or&#xD;
             injectable hormonal contraceptive) b. Double-barrier birth control (e.g. condom plus&#xD;
             intrauterine device, diaphragm plus spermicide) c. Surgical sterilization (i.e.&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy, or tubal ligation) d. Maintenance if a&#xD;
             monogamous relationship with a male partner who has been surgically sterilized by&#xD;
             vasectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at the&#xD;
             Randomization Visit (first study treatment visit) prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has no clinically significant findings on a physical examination, 12-lead&#xD;
             electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests (clinical chemistry panel,&#xD;
             complete blood count [CBC], urinalysis [UA]) after signing the ICF but before&#xD;
             receiving the first dose of study drug. (Note: The Investigator will determine if a&#xD;
             particular finding is clinically significant. In making this determination, the&#xD;
             investigator will consider whether the particular finding could prevent the patient&#xD;
             from performing any of the protocol-specified assessments, could represent a condition&#xD;
             that would exclude the patient from the trial, could represent a safety concern if the&#xD;
             patient participates in the trial, or could confound the trial-specified assessments&#xD;
             of safety or efficacy.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient is fluent in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Are considered eligible according to the following TB screening criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Have no history of latent or active TB prior to screening. An exception is made for&#xD;
             patients with a history of latent TB and documentation of having completed appropriate&#xD;
             treatment for latent TB within 3 years prior to the first administration of study&#xD;
             agent. Appropriate documentation to verify that there had been treatment with a&#xD;
             antituberculous treatment must be established prior to study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Have no signs or symptoms suggestive of active TB upon medical history and/or&#xD;
             physical examination.&#xD;

&#xD;
             • Subject has a negative purified protein derivative test within 30 days prior to the&#xD;
             first dose. Tuberculin skin tests should be considered positive when they have greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 5 mm of induration at 48 to 72 hours after test is placed. Subjects&#xD;
             with a positive tuberculin skin test (if less than or equal to 14 mm of induration)&#xD;
             are allowed if they have a history of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination with a&#xD;
             negative Quantiferon test in the past year, no symptoms per tuberculosis workup, and a&#xD;
             negative chest X-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Be able to adhere to the required study visit schedule and comply with noted protocol&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Subject has established ileal, ileo-colonic, or colonic Crohn's disease for a minimum&#xD;
             of 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject has moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, as defined by a Crohn's&#xD;
             Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score from 225 to 450 at screening and baseline and must&#xD;
             also have an SES score that falls under the auspice of moderate to moderately severe&#xD;
             disease (10-15).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject has evidence of active inflammation, as demonstrated by any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Elevated C reactive protein (CRP) at screening (&gt;2.87 mg/L, or upper limit of&#xD;
                  normal (ULN) as set by local laboratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Endoscopic evidence of inflammation during the screening period or within 8 weeks&#xD;
                  prior to the screening period&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects are allowed to continue on concurrent treatment with the following agents:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  5-aminosalicylates, if stable dosage for at least 2 weeks prior to screening&#xD;
                  (same dosage to be maintained throughout the trial)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Probiotics, provided that the dose has been stable for the 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
                  enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Antidiarrheals (eg, loperamide, Imodium) for control of chronic diarrhea; as per&#xD;
                  standard CDAI protocols, the use of antidiarrheals will be assessed at each&#xD;
                  visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional eligibility information&#xD;
&#xD;
        SES-CD The subject has a diagnosis of active moderate to severe CD at screening with these&#xD;
        specific findings: the presence of large ulcerations (0.5cm is the minimal diameter in size&#xD;
        to be categorized as large - this also constitutes between 2-3 points on the SES-CD score),&#xD;
        the extent of ulcerated surface (the minimal percentage has got to be at least 10% - this&#xD;
        also constitutes between 2-3 points on the SES-CD score), the extent of the affected&#xD;
        surface (50% is the minimal percentage to fall in the moderate category - would constitute&#xD;
        between 2-3 points on the SES-CD score) and finally the presence and type of narrowing&#xD;
        found (number of strictures found and if the colonoscope can be passed or cannot be passed&#xD;
        - this also constitutes between 2-3 points on the SES-CD score). The minimal score will be&#xD;
        between 10 and 15. The local endoscopist (investigator) will determine whether subjects&#xD;
        meet the entrance criteria from the SES scoring perspective. An appendix will be attached&#xD;
        to define in a table the simple endoscopic scoring for Crohn's Disease (Appendix 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        CDAI Crohn's Disease Activity Index scoring: this consists of eight variables including&#xD;
        five subject reported outcomes. Variables 1,2,3,4 and 5 will be obtained from the patient's&#xD;
        diary (see table 2a, subject diary, under Appendix 2, Crohn's Disease Activity Index&#xD;
        Variables) completed by the patient during the 7 days prior to each CDAI evaluation. The&#xD;
        Standard Height and Weight Table (Table 2b) must be used to calculate variable 8. The score&#xD;
        from each variable is weighted by applying the multiplier shown. The total CDAI score is&#xD;
        then determined by calculating the sum of the individual, weighted scores. A minimum score&#xD;
        of 225 points is required and cannot exceed 450. These are the two primary criteria for&#xD;
        entry that have to do with the study outcomes proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient has any condition, including clinically significant abnormalities on&#xD;
             Screening laboratory test and/or medical history found during Screening assessments,&#xD;

             constitutes a risk for the patient or a contraindication for participation in and&#xD;
             completion of the study, or could interfere with study objectives, conduct, or&#xD;
             evaluations (such as unstable diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, vascular disease,&#xD;
             end-stage coronary disease, pulmonary disease, liver disease, renal disease and any&#xD;
             metabolic disorders that are also uncontrolled).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient has major surgery scheduled during the study period.&#xD;
