      The purpose of this study is to verify and analyse psychological and physiological effects of&#xD;
      olfactory aromatherapy and yogatherapy respiratory exercises, together and separately, on the&#xD;
      quality of life, levels of stress, quality of sleep and intensity and frequence of hot&#xD;
      flashes in climacteric women.&#xD;

      Introduction: Menopause is the period in which reproductive life ends and senescence begins.&#xD;
      Because of the increase in life expectancy there are more women reaching this period.&#xD;
      Although it is a physiological change, it is frequently accompanied by disagreeable symptoms&#xD;
      that can influence quality of life and sleep in a negative manner. The most common symptom is&#xD;
      hot flashes. The traditional treatment for the symptoms is hormone replacement therapy, that&#xD;
      has many important side effects, such as increase in cancer incidence. This therapy also has&#xD;
      dubious effects on psychosexual symptoms and quality of life. This justifies the study of&#xD;
      other more secure treatments. Aromatherapy can be a particularly efficacious treatment for&#xD;
      hot flashes because it has therapeutic mechanisms that are similar to the physiological&#xD;
      mechanisms of hot flashes. It is also a secure therapy with little side effects, specially&#xD;
      when applied in inhalation (olfactory aromatherapy). Yogatherapy can also influence&#xD;
      psychoneuroedocrineimmunological axis similar to the physiological axis of hot flashes.&#xD;
      Yogatherapy includes respiratory exercises that can potentiate the effects of olfactory&#xD;
      aromatherapy. Because of this, it can be beneficial to apply aromatherapy and yogatherapy&#xD;
      together. These therapies were studied as they are applied in clinical practice. The&#xD;
      psychoneuroendocrineimmunological model permits the study of the effects of both these&#xD;
      therapies aiming at increase in quality of life, from a psychosomatic and global point of&#xD;
      view. The global approach is important in the study of menopause because it has both&#xD;
      psychological and physiological characteristics. Objective: verify and analyse psychological&#xD;
      and physiological effects of olfactory aromatherapy and yogatherapy respiratory exercises,&#xD;
      together and separately, on the quality of life, levels of stress, quality of sleep and&#xD;
      intensity and frequence of hot flashes in climacteric women. Material and methods: The study&#xD;
      is a placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial, with restrict randomization methods&#xD;
      (that allow groups of the same size). Recruitment of voluntaries was made using posters and&#xD;
      electronic messages in websites. Data was collected at the &quot;Centro de Práticas Esportivas da&#xD;
      Universidade de São Paulo&quot; (Sport Centre of the University of Sao Paulo). The study will have&#xD;
      four groups: aromatherapy, yogatherapy, both therapies and control-placebo group. Appraisal&#xD;
      was done using questionnaires for personal data, social-economical data, stress levels,&#xD;
      quality f sleep levels, body resonance levels, quality of life levels, climacteric influence&#xD;
      on quality of life and physiological data (heart rate, breathing rate, blood pressure and&#xD;
      body temperature). Appraisal was done before, during and after 20 treatment sessions. The&#xD;
      research was approved by the &quot;Comitê de Ética em Pesquisa da Escola de Educação Fisica e&#xD;
      Esporte da Universidade de São Paulo&quot; (Ethics Committee of the Sport and Physical Education&#xD;
      School of the University of Sao Paulo). Data will be analysed using descriptive statistics,&#xD;
      Student t-test, ANOVA variance analysis and Pearson correlation, considering significance&#xD;
      levels of p&lt;0,05.&#xD;
