      The goal of this study will be to determine the potential of Diltiazem Hydrochloride 2% Cream&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study will be to determine the potential of Diltiazem&#xD;
      Hydrochloride 2% Cream and its vehicle to induce sensitization by repeated topical&#xD;
      application to the skin of healthy subjects under controlled conditions. In addition, the&#xD;
      irritation potential of the investigational products will be assessed during the Induction&#xD;
      Phase and safety will be assessed by evaluation of any adverse events (AEs) reported during&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 weeks after the first topical application</time_frame>
    <description>A total cumulative irritation score for each subject and product will be calculated by summing each individual's scores on each of the 9 evaluation days in the Induction Phase. Cumulative irritancy during Induction will be quantified by means of the cumulative irritancy index (CII), defined as the mean of irritation scores received during the Induction Phase (9 readings). The determination of dermal sensitization potential will be based on specific scoring criteria derived from observations in the Challenge Phase of the study and confirmed in the Rechallenge Phase, if necessary. The recurrence of a cutaneous response at Rechallenge equivalent to or more severe than that observed at challenge will be considered indicative of a sensitization reaction. The observation of such a response in even a single subject suggests that the test product may have the potential to cause hypersensitivity.</description>
