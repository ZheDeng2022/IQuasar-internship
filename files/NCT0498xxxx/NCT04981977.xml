  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unplanned hospital readmissions are extremely costly to patients and our healthcare system.&#xD;
      Being readmitted to the hospital also leads to increased risk of health complications for&#xD;
      patients including infections and impairments in functioning. Hospital readmissions are&#xD;
      particularly common among older adults. Further, racial/ethnic disparities are evident in&#xD;
      readmission rates and are the greatest among African American and Latino/Hispanic older&#xD;
      adults. Effective, sustainable, and culturally appropriate interventions to improve outcomes,&#xD;
      reduce unplanned hospital readmissions, and reduce health disparities are urgently needed.&#xD;
      The proposed randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness of a novel&#xD;
      transitional care strategy designed to avoid unplanned hospital readmissions and improve&#xD;
      patient health outcomes in a racially/ethnically diverse sample of older adults who have been&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital due to a chronic health condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eric Coleman's Care Transitions Intervention (CTI) has been identified as the strategy most&#xD;
      successfully implemented and evaluated in multiple settings and systems of care. CTI has been&#xD;
      shown to reduce hospital readmissions for non-Hispanic White older adults, however its'&#xD;
      effects have not been as strong for minority older adults in some studies and research trials&#xD;
      have not recruited a sufficient number of racial/ethnic minorities to examine outcomes by&#xD;
      race or ethnicity. Thus, it is unknown whether CTI is effective for racial/ethnic minority&#xD;
      older adults who suffer disproportionately high readmission rates. Further, studies of&#xD;
      transitions interventions suggest that older adult and racial/ethnic minority patients&#xD;
      require additional assistance and support during transitions in care. The researchers&#xD;
      hypothesize the addition of peer support will enhance and maximize the benefit of the CTI and&#xD;
      increase its' cultural sensitivity and future sustainability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed 3-arm trial is designed to evaluate the Care Transitions Intervention (CTI) and&#xD;
      CTI + Peer Support (PS), as compared to usual care (UC), on unplanned all-cause hospital&#xD;
      readmissions occurring within 6 months (assessed at 30 days, 90 days and 6 months) and&#xD;
      secondary health system (i.e., ED visits) and patient-centered outcomes (i.e., self-efficacy&#xD;
      managing chronic disease, quality of life, functional status and mortality) among 402&#xD;
      hospitalized African American and Latino/Hispanic older adults (age 60+) who have a chronic&#xD;
      physical illness (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes, COPD) and are being discharged from&#xD;
      the hospital back to the community.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unplanned hospital readmissions represent a critical failure of the healthcare system,&#xD;
      perpetuate health disparities, and are the single largest driver of excess healthcare costs.&#xD;
      For patients, hospital readmission increases risk for complications, infections, and&#xD;
      functional impairment. Hospital readmissions are particularly prevalent among older adults.&#xD;
      Further, racial/ethnic disparities in readmission rates are profound and are the greatest&#xD;
      among African American and Latino/Hispanic older adults. Effective, sustainable and&#xD;
      culturally appropriate interventions to improve outcomes, reduce un-planned hospital&#xD;
      readmissions, and reduce health disparities are urgently needed. The proposed randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness of a novel transitional care strategy&#xD;
      designed to avert un-planned hospital readmissions and improve patient health outcomes in a&#xD;
      high-risk and under studied population of medically hospitalized African American and&#xD;
      Latino/Hispanic older adults (age 60+). Transitional care strategies are interventions&#xD;
      initiated before hospital discharge with the aim of ensuring the safe and effective&#xD;
      transition of patients from the acute hospital setting to home. Of all the transitional care&#xD;
      interventions tested, Eric Coleman's Care Transitions Intervention (CTI) has been identified&#xD;
      as the strategy most successfully implemented and evaluated in multiple settings and systems&#xD;
      of care. CTI is a non-clinical coaching strategy that occurs in the hospital, home, and via&#xD;
      telephone for 28 days post-discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTI has been shown to reduce hospital readmissions for non-Hispanic White older adults,&#xD;
      however intervention effects have been mixed for minority older adults and effectiveness&#xD;
      trials have not recruited a sufficient number of racial/ethnic minorities to examine race or&#xD;
      ethnicity specific outcomes. Thus, it is unclear whether CTI is effective for racial/ethnic&#xD;
      minority older adults who suffer disproportionately high readmission rates. Further, studies&#xD;
      of transitions interventions suggest that older adult and racial/ethnic minority patients&#xD;
      require additional assistance and support during transitions in care. To address this gap,&#xD;
      the researchers propose to add peer support (PS) to the CTI to enhance its effectiveness&#xD;
      among high-risk populations of racial/ethnic minority older adults. The researchers believe&#xD;
      the addition of peer support will enhance and maximize the benefit of the CTI and increase&#xD;
      its' cultural sensitivity and future sustainability. The proposed 3-arm trial is designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the Care Transitions Intervention (CTI) and CTI + Peer Support (PS), as compared to&#xD;
      usual care (UC), on all cause unplanned hospital readmissions occurring within 6 months&#xD;
      (assessed at 30 days, 90 days and 6 months) and secondary health system (i.e., ED visits) and&#xD;
      patient-centered outcomes (i.e., self-efficacy managing chronic disease, quality of life,&#xD;
      functional status and mortality) among 402 hospitalized African American and Latino/Hispanic&#xD;
      older adults (age 60+) who have a chronic physical illness (e.g., cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      diabetes, COPD) and are being discharged from the hospital back to the community. The&#xD;
      researchers will also maximize the uniquely diverse sample to explore potential mediators and&#xD;
      moderators of intervention effects. The researchers will further conduct semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews with patients (n=48) and caregivers (n=24) to qualitatively examine mechanisms&#xD;
      impacting readmission risk and patient-centered outcomes post discharge. The researchers will&#xD;
      utilize multi-methods to triangulate and contextualize the findings.&#xD;

    <description>CTI is delivered by a trained Care Transitions Coach (Coach) who works closely with patients to ensure a smooth transition from hospital to home following an acute hospitalization. The patient, caregiver, and Coach work together to maximize the involvement of interdisciplinary experts, ensuring that the appropriate professionals are involved, issues are addressed, goals are understood, and the discharge care plan is executed correctly. There are three aspects to CTI; the first is the initial hospital visit, followed by an in-home visit, concluding with telephone follow-up over a 28-day period. During these visits, the Coach focuses on four conceptual areas, referred to as pillars (i.e., Personal Health Record, Medication Management, Red Flags, and Physician Follow up). The Coach ensures the patient understands and utilizes the Personal Health Record to facilitate communication and ensure continuity of care plan across providers and settings.</description>

    <description>The PS intervention for this study is based upon the principles of motivational interviewing, which is a person-centered, goal-directed method to enhance intrinsic motivation for change by exploring and resolving ambivalence. A recent meta-analysis found the mean effect size for MI to be significantly larger for racial and ethnic minority samples (0.79 vs. 0.26) as compared to non-Hispanic Whites, highlighting its potential benefit and cultural relevance for minority populations. Patients in this arm of the study will receive the 28-day CTI intervention with a 2-month long Peer Support (PS) intervention provided by trained peer educators (PEs).</description>
