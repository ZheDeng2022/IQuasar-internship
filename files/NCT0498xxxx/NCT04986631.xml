  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric severe obesity is the fastest growing obesity category in the United States, and&#xD;
      anti-obesity pharmacotherapies are promising adjuncts to lifestyle modification (LSM) for the&#xD;
      treatment of this disease. While anti-obesity pharmacotherapies have overall been associated&#xD;
      with mean weight loss, there is substantial variability in their individual-level&#xD;
      effectiveness. While some patients lose a significant amount of weight with anti-obesity&#xD;
      pharmacotherapies, others lose little or even gain weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to this well-recognized variability in individual-level response, the National Institutes&#xD;
      of Health (NIH) has recognized the importance of using precision medicine approaches in order&#xD;
      to optimize treatments for pediatric severe obesity. Pharmacometrics, which uses mathematical&#xD;
      models to study medication dose-exposure (i.e. blood drug concentrations)-response&#xD;
      relationships, is an emerging science that can help determine optimal dosing regimens based&#xD;
      upon patient-specific characteristics. Pharmacometrics quantitates the interplay between&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK; drug dose-exposure associations) and pharmacodynamics (PD; drug&#xD;
      exposure-response associations). Population PK (popPK), a type of PK, can be used to&#xD;
      quantitate variability in drug exposure among individuals in order to help inform&#xD;
      recommendations on therapeutic individualization (e.g. through tailored dosing). In this&#xD;
      study, investigators will use popPK/PD modeling to characterize associations between&#xD;
      anti-obesity pharmacotherapy dose, exposure, and changes in weight and weight-related&#xD;
      outcomes in youth with severe obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will focus on topiramate because this medication is commonly prescribed for weight&#xD;
      loss in youth with severe obesity and has been associated with highly variable&#xD;
      individual-level effectiveness.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The weight loss achieved with topiramate occurs through several purported mechanisms&#xD;
      including reductions in appetite, food cravings, and binge eating, and adverse alterations in&#xD;
      taste for carbonated beverages. It is hypothesized that some of the individual-level&#xD;
      effectiveness of this medication on weight loss response is secondary to patient-specific&#xD;
      differences in these factors. In a 3.5-month pragmatic-based prospective cohort study (n=65),&#xD;
      the investigators will develop a popPK model using sparse sampling by drawing a series of&#xD;
      topiramate concentration measures over time in order to begin determining patient-specific&#xD;
      factors that contribute to topiramate exposure variability. The investigators will also&#xD;
      identity associations between topiramate exposure, changes in eating behaviors, and weight&#xD;
      loss outcomes through PD models using regression techniques. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      patient-specific characteristics (i.e. age, body mass index (BMI), and sex) will explain some&#xD;
      variability in topiramate exposure in youth, and that higher topiramate exposure will be&#xD;
      associated with greater improvements in weight loss response and eating behaviors among youth&#xD;
      prescribed this medicine for the treatment of pediatric severe obesity.&#xD;
