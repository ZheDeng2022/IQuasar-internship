      Lack of adequate sun exposure due to urbanization is prone to hypovitaminosis D. Vitamin D&#xD;
      (25-hydroxyvitamin D) deficiency is now a major health concern in the western world. Recent&#xD;
      data suggest that Vitamin D level in the Bangladeshi population is also very low. However,&#xD;
      the cutoff value used to determine vitamin D deficiency is not yet validated for our ethnic&#xD;
      group; we also don't know the optimal vitamin D level for our population. Before coming to&#xD;
      any firm conclusion regarding nationwide vitamin D deficiency, we must know the Optimal range&#xD;
      of serum Vitamin D for our people of Bangladesh. As sunlight is the primary source of vitamin&#xD;
      D and adequate sun exposure alone is sufficient to produce enough vitamin D to maintain the&#xD;
      physiological demand without producing toxicity. According to Holick's rule, exposure to&#xD;
      sunlight at the face and both arms for 25 min, 3 times a week should maintain adequate&#xD;
      vitamin D status. In Indonesia, it was found that after exposure to sunlight at this specific&#xD;
      time and duration for 6 weeks, the mean 25(OH)D levels of participants increased from 59&#xD;
      nmol/L at the baseline to 84 nmol/L.In India, exposure to sunlight for 30 minutes, between 11&#xD;
      am and 2 pm, three times a week, is sufficient to maintain adequate serum vitamin D&#xD;
      concentration. Therefore it could be assumed that healthy subjects without any risk factors&#xD;
      for vitamin D deficiency and having adequate sun exposure should maintain an Optimal serum&#xD;
      vitamin D concentration. Here Optimal means a range where there will be no features of&#xD;
      insufficiency or toxicity. In this cross-sectional study, we want to find out the serum&#xD;
      vitamin D level of such a population, representing the Optimal level of vitamin D for&#xD;
      Bangladeshi people.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Vitamin D is the sunshine vitamin produced on this earth for more than 500 million years.&#xD;
      This is produced in humans by sunlight. Sunlight is the main source of vitamin D, and&#xD;
      adequate sun exposure alone is sufficient to produce enough vitamin D to maintain the&#xD;
      physiological demand without producing toxicity. According to Holick's rule, exposure to&#xD;
      sunlight on the face and both arms for 25 min, 3 times a week, should maintain adequate&#xD;
      vitamin D status. In Indonesia, it was found that after exposure to sunlight at this specific&#xD;
      time and duration for 6 weeks, the mean 25(OH)D levels of participants increased from 59&#xD;
      nmol/L at the baseline to 84 nmol/L.In India, exposure to sunlight for 30 minutes, between 11&#xD;
      am and 2 pm, three times a week is sufficient to maintain adequate serum vitamin D&#xD;
      concentration. Lack of adequate sun exposure as a consequence of urbanization prone human&#xD;
      races to a threat of hypovitaminosis D. Vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) insufficiency and its&#xD;
      impending consequence on health is now the subject of important concern and controversy. The&#xD;
      optimal value of vitamin D substantially differs among populations depending upon&#xD;
      environmental, cultural and racial factors. However, the definition of vitamin D&#xD;
      insufficiency is still not out of controversy, mostly cutoffs of &lt;50 nmol/L of serum&#xD;
      25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level is considered as &quot;vitamin D deficiency&quot; state, 50 to 74.9&#xD;
      nmol/L denotes &quot;insufficiency&quot; and ≥75 nmol/L considered as &quot;sufficiency&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the falling of serum25 (OH)D beyond a certain point, absorption of calcium from the gut&#xD;
      decreases, which leads to a surge of parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, which in turn&#xD;
      stimulates the conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D to keep calcium at a normal limit. Thus, a&#xD;
      higher value of PTH could be considered as a surrogate marker of vitamin D insufficiency.&#xD;
      Serum 25(OH) D below the level of 75-100 nmol/L has an inverse correlation with PTH&#xD;
      concentration; beyond this point, serum intact PTH concentration remains in a plateau state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these definitions, the whole world faces a pandemic of vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency/insufficiency. According to recent studies, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency&#xD;
      has been found between 30% and 100% in different communities. This picture is similar in the&#xD;
      USA, Europe, South East Asia and the Middle East. In India, the prevalence of Vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency is around 70%-100% in the general population. Baidya et al. (2012) studied 40&#xD;
      healthy Indian physicians in Calcutta. Around 97.5% of subjects had low vitamin D. Mean age&#xD;
      and meant 25(OH)D levels of that cohort were 52.22 ± 10 years and 13.02 ± 4.77 ng/ml&#xD;
      (32.50±11.91 nmol/L). Vitamin D deficiency was found in 92.5% of participants. Though&#xD;
      available data in Bangladesh are confined to female subjects only, the scenario is not&#xD;
      different. More than ninety-nine percent of Bangladesh female garment workers were vitamin D&#xD;
      insufficient in a study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This picture is alarming because, in addition to its deleterious effect on the&#xD;
      musculoskeletal system, vitamin D deficiency is also linked with many other medical issues&#xD;
      like cardiovascular disease, malignancy, neuromodulation, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      several autoimmune diseases (such as multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis) and certain infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis. Vitamin D supplementation is&#xD;
      also a key component in the hierarchy of management of Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and&#xD;
      Bone Disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the caveat of all of those studies done in Bangladesh and neighbouring countries&#xD;
      like India and Pakistan is that the cutoff value used to determine vitamin D deficiency or&#xD;
      insufficiency has not yet been validated for the corresponding population. Before reaching a&#xD;
      firm conclusion about epidemics of vitamin D deficiency and planning for supplementation&#xD;
      programs, the cutoff value of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency of the Bangladeshi&#xD;
      population must be validated. The optimal level of vitamin D for the Bangladeshi population&#xD;
      should also find out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Maintenance of adequate vitamin D levels undoubtedly is an important human health&#xD;
      issue. It helps prevent many chronic diseases, which in fact are in addition to its principal&#xD;
      role in maintaining appropriate blood calcium levels. To get the optimum beneficial effects&#xD;
      of vitamin D, including prevention of many potential adverse health effects caused by&#xD;
      deficient vitamin D, circulating 25(OH)D levels should be within the normal range. Vitamin D&#xD;
      varies depending on various factors like exposure to the sun, age, race, body mass index,&#xD;
      lack of exercise etc. The cutoff value for deficiency and insufficiency also varies between&#xD;
      studies. Several studies using prescribed cutoff values of vitamin D deficiency reveal an&#xD;
      epidemic of vitamin D deficiency in our country, despite abounded sunlight due to the&#xD;
      proximity of the equator. However, no study was done previously in Bangladesh to determine&#xD;
      the Optimal value of vitamin D representative of this population. The deficiency and&#xD;
      insufficiency levels are ignorant and when to intervene is also not known. That is why it is&#xD;
      important to conduct this exploratory study. It will help to assume the optimal reference&#xD;
      range of serum vitamin D for the Bangladeshi population. That will give a clearer picture of&#xD;
      the actual burden of vitamin D deficiency in Bangladesh and guide them to treat them and take&#xD;
      necessary preventive measures at the national level.&#xD;
