  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was investigate the comparison of postoperative effects of local&#xD;
      antibiotics mixed with platelet-rich fibrin and postoperative systemic antibiotic&#xD;
      applications prescribed for mandibular impacted third molar tooth extraction. The study&#xD;
      included a total of 75 patients with impacted mandibular third molar. Patients were evaluated&#xD;
      in 5 randomly separated groups. For the first and third group, Platelets Rich Fibrin+&#xD;
      systemic Antibiotics were applied into the tooth socket and for the second and fourth group,&#xD;
      Platelets Rich Fibrin + local antibiotics were applied, respectively. There was a control&#xD;
      group which only Platelets Rich Fibrin was applied into the socket. The outcome variables&#xD;
      were pain, swelling, the number of analgesics taken, and trismus. These variables were also&#xD;
      assessed based on first, second, third, and seventh days following the operation.&#xD;

    <description>Platelet rich fibrin (PRF), is an example and popular procedure for accelerate healing of soft and hard tissue because of the presence of various growth factors.a blood sample was taken without anticoagulant in 10 mL glass-coated plastic tubes that were immediately centrifuged (Elektro-mag M415P) at 3,000 rpm for 10 min (approximately 400 g) (13). The platelet-poor plasma that accumulated at the top of the tubes was discarded.PRF was dissected approximately 2 mm below its contact point with the red corpuscles situated beneath, to include any remaining platelets that may have localized below the junction between the PRF and red corpuscles.</description>
