  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of liver hydatid cysts (LHC) is controversial. Surgery remains the basic&#xD;
      treatment, and can be divided into radical and conservative approaches. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study was to compare the outcome of radical and conservative surgery (CS) in the treatment of&#xD;
      LHC and to evaluate the efficiency and safety of radical surgery (RS).&#xD;

      The management of liver hydatid cysts (LHC) is controversial. Surgery remains the basic&#xD;
      treatment, and can be divided into radical and conservative approaches. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study was to compare the outcome of radical and conservative surgery (CS) in the treatment of&#xD;
      LHC and to evaluate the efficiency and safety of radical surgery (RS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from all patients with LHC treated in Sahloul Hospital, between January 2000 and&#xD;
      December 2019, were retrieved from a retrospective database. To minimize selection bias,&#xD;
      propensity score matching (PSM) was performed, based on variables representing patient&#xD;
      characteristics and operative risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RS especially total pericystectomy had fewer postoperative complications and lower recurrence&#xD;
      rate compared to CS. RS may be the preferred procedure for LHC if the expertise is available.&#xD;

        914 Patients , who underwent surgical treatment at the Department of General and Digestive&#xD;
        Surgery, Sahloul University Hospital Center, Sousse, Tunisia from 1st January 2000 to 31st&#xD;
        December 2019 was performed. The diagnosis of LHC was established by clinical history,&#xD;
