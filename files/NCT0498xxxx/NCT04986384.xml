  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pruritus is defined as an unpleasant sensation of the skin that provoke the desire to scratch&#xD;
      or rub. Its presence is an essential diagnostic feature. According to some European studies,&#xD;
      91% of patients with Atopic Dermatitis report suffering from pruritus at least once daily.&#xD;
      And 58.1% of them experience chronic pruritus, leading to great deterioration in quality of&#xD;
      life. Various internal and external factors may trigger pruritus. Mediators secretion such as&#xD;
      keratinocyte-derived Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin (TSLP) and Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) could&#xD;
      activate nerve fibres which will eventually transmit signals to the brain causing the&#xD;
      sensation of itching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although being one of the major annoying symptoms faced by patients with Atopic Dermatitis,&#xD;
      effective anti-itching treatments are not available. There is no consistent evidence that&#xD;
      topical antihistamines can relief itch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a new spray named Atoderm 'SOS' is developed. The skin relief technology (by ambora&#xD;
      extract and Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), associated to enoxolone) claimed to inhibit the&#xD;
      release TSLP and NGF which eventually could reduce nerve signals to the brain for itchy&#xD;
      feelings. Therefore, our group would like to test the efficacy of this proprietary anti-itch&#xD;
      product with our paediatric patients using a wait-list approach as a control. It is aimed to&#xD;
      demonstrate that the using the Atoderm 'SOS' spray topically whenever necessary can reduce&#xD;
      the unpleasant itchy Atopic Dermatitis's symptom, improve quality of life, as well as to&#xD;
      reduce the need for topical treatment.&#xD;
