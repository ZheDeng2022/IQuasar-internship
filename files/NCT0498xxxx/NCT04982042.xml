  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19) is a highly infectious respiratory disease that causes&#xD;
      respiratory, physical and psychological dysfunction in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the increased understanding of the severity of COVID-19 and clinical evidence in&#xD;
      accordance with the opinions of first-line clinical experts involved in the treatment of this&#xD;
      epidemic, the investigators believe that the participation of patients with sequelae of&#xD;
      COVID-19 in a Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program would be of utmost importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to recent scientific recommendations for patients with sequelae of COVID-19,&#xD;
      respiratory rehabilitation would alleviate symptoms of dyspnea, anxiety and depression and,&#xD;
      eventually, improve physical functions and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is essential to anticipate early rehabilitation after the acute phase of ARDS,&#xD;
      in order to limit the severity of the effects of the ICU and promote rapid functional&#xD;
      recovery. Physiotherapy will play a role in providing exercise, mobilization and&#xD;
      rehabilitation interventions for survivors of critical illnesses associated with COVID-19, in&#xD;
      order to enable a functional social return.&#xD;

      The investigatores propose a clinical, prospective and consecutive study composed of&#xD;
      participants with pulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 and pulmonary diseases such as COPD, Asthma,&#xD;
      Bronchitis, Emphysema, Bronchiectasis and pulmonary fibrosis. Initially, all patients will&#xD;
      undergo a physical assessment, pulmonary function tests and nutritional assessment, in&#xD;
      addition to applying the modified dyspnea scale of the MMRC (Modified Medical Research&#xD;
      Council) and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), according to the standards recommended by the&#xD;
      American Thoracic Society (ATS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed Outpatient and Home Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program is based on the Guidelines&#xD;
      recommended by the Brazilian Society of Pulmonology (SBPT) and by the Global Initiative for&#xD;
      Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), with a minimum duration of 12 weeks, frequency of 3&#xD;
      weekly sessions, accompanied by health professionals in this field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who seek care at municipal and state health services in the city of An치polis,&#xD;
      (Goi치s) will be recruited. Patients with clinically stabilized COVID - 19 sequelae will be&#xD;
      considered eligible, and who agree to participate in the study, signing the Informed Consent&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outpatient PRP consisted of a combination of aerobic and strengthening exercises, lasting&#xD;
      12 weeks, frequency 3 times a week. Each session will consist of active warm-up exercises,&#xD;
      upper and lower limb strengthening, aerobic conditioning and stretching exercises. The&#xD;
      warm-up phase consists of intercalated calisthenic exercises for different muscle groups,&#xD;
      according to each patient's tolerance.&#xD;
