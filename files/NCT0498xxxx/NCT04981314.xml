      The main objectives of ECCO-2 are: 1) Efficacy: to study whether EQUINACEA ARKOPHARMA, hard&#xD;
      caplets containing cryogenized root of the plant Echinacea purpurea, show an improvement of&#xD;
      the clinical manifestations and disease course in ambulatory patients with covid-19 with a&#xD;
      respiratory presentation and not requiring hospitalization (i.e., mild covid-19). The drug&#xD;
      being evaluated will be added as a supplement of the standard treatment, with its current&#xD;
      recommended dose for treatment of the common cold. 2) Safety: to determine that the incidence&#xD;
      of adverse events is not higher than that seen with the standard treatment applied in each&#xD;
      case.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Different presentations of the plant Echinacea purpurea are widely prescribed and used for&#xD;
      the treatment of upper respiratory tract viral infections. The plant is known to contain an&#xD;
      array of active principles including alkylamides, cichoric acid, glucoproteins resulting in&#xD;
      stimulation of the innate immune system, in particular, an activation of macrophages and an&#xD;
      increase of phagocytic activity (Nagoor Meeran et al. 2019. Heliyon, 7(2):e05990). It has&#xD;
      also been recently shown to exert a direct antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-II in vitro&#xD;
      (Signer et al. 2020. Virol J 17:136). EQUINACEA ARKOPHARMA is a pharmaceutical preparation of&#xD;
      Echinacea purpurea prepared by controlled cryo-processing roots of the plant and packing the&#xD;
      powder thus obtained in hard caplets. The product is a medicine approved by the European&#xD;
      Medicines Agency for the treatment of common cold. In this study, 230 patients presenting&#xD;
      with mild Covid-19 at the emergency room of 4 participating hospitals, with an eminently&#xD;
      respiratory presentation, fever, and not requiring hospitalization, will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to two branches to receive EQUINACEA ARKOPHARMA or placebo, in a double-blind manner.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up for 4 weeks and the effect of treatment vs. placebo on clinical&#xD;
      manifestations, duration of fever and of total disease and percentage of return to the&#xD;
      emergency room and/or hospitalization will be assessed.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Predominantly respiratory presentation. Additional minor digestive or/and neurological&#xD;
             clinical manifestations will not lead to exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Axillary temperature equal to or higher than 37ºC, at some point during the evolution&#xD;
             of clinical signs prior to recruitment, or at the moment of recruitment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Capacity to complete the treatment, i.e., not having any swallowing difficulties, or&#xD;
             any physical or psychiatric condition that would prevent the patient from taking&#xD;
             caplets.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that after being evaluated at the emergency room are deemed to be in a&#xD;
             condition to follow treatment at home, with follow up by their family doctor, i.e.,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with a predominantly digestive presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a hypersensitivity to the active principle, any of the excipients of the&#xD;
             drug or to the Asteraceae family of plants.&#xD;
&#xD;
