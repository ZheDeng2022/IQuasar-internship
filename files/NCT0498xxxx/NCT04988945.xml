      This study is a prospective phase II, single arm mono-institutional study conducted in Queen&#xD;
      Mary Hospital (Hong Kong) assessing the efficacy and safety of the sequential administration&#xD;
      of trans-arterial chemo-embolization (TACE) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with&#xD;
      immune checkpoint inhibitors in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a serious global health problem. It ranks the fifth in&#xD;
      incidence and third in cancer-related mortality at Hong Kong in 2015. The disease has high&#xD;
      mortality rate, and surgery is the only curative therapy although only 30% of patients are&#xD;
      diagnosed early enough to undergo liver resection or transplantation or radiofrequency&#xD;
      ablation (RFA). For inoperable patients with disease limited to liver, trans-arterial&#xD;
      chemo-embolization (TACE) is the most commonly used therapy. Previous randomized studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated its survival benefit, however it rarely cures the disease; also its efficacy is&#xD;
      very limited in patients with sizable tumor or multi-focal diseases. Efforts have been made&#xD;
      to improve the response of treatment, but none has consistently demonstrated the benefit. As&#xD;
      a result, over the past decade, there is no major advancement in the treatment strategy for&#xD;
      intermediate stage HCC patients. Recently, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has emerged&#xD;
      as one of the promising local therapy of HCC. This advanced radiotherapy technique allows&#xD;
      killing of cancer cells by delivering a potent dose of radiation with excellent geometric&#xD;
      precision. Data have demonstrated its favorable local control rate and toxicity profile in&#xD;
      locally advanced HCC. Further, recent studies, including our series, indicated that combining&#xD;
      SBRT and TACE is therapeutically superior. As such, it is postulated that combined TACE+SBRT&#xD;
      is a more potent local therapy than TACE in preventing tumor progression, and it may&#xD;
      potentially translate into survival benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent discovery in immune-oncology represents another breakthrough in management of HCC.&#xD;
      Pre-clinical data showed that there is high expression of immunosuppressive cells and&#xD;
      up-regulation of programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated&#xD;
      protein 4 (CTLA-4) immune checkpoints in the HCC microenvironment; it provides the rationale&#xD;
      for immunotherapy to be used in this setting. This premise was supported by several early&#xD;
      phase clinical studies, in which anti-PD-1/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy resulted&#xD;
      in a durable response and favorable survival. More intriguingly, there are scientific and&#xD;
      clinical data in supporting the synergy between immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and SBRT&#xD;
      for both local tumor regression and distant control (out-of-the-field abscopal) effect. For&#xD;
      high risk HCC, such approach may warrant further exploration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on all these, a hypothesis is made that combined TACE+SBRT followed by immunotherapy is&#xD;
      a promising strategy in treating unresectable HCC. In this single-arm prospective phase II&#xD;
      study, it is aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of this treatment regime.&#xD;
