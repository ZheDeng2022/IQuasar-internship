  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a new way to treat women who have symptoms that are caused by the&#xD;
      sex hormonal changes that happen when a woman's body is going through the menopause. These&#xD;
      symptoms include Vasomotor Symptoms (VMS) (hot flashes), and changes in blood pressure.&#xD;
      Menopause is when women stop having a menstrual cycle, also called a period. During the&#xD;
      period, the ovaries increasingly produce less sex hormones as a result of the natural ageing&#xD;
      process and related hormonal adjustments. The decline in hormone production can lead to&#xD;
      various symptoms which, in some cases, can have a very adverse effect on a menopausal woman's&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, researchers want to learn more about a new substance called elinzanetant.&#xD;
      Elinzanetant was developed to treat symptoms caused by sex hormonal changes. It works by&#xD;
      blocking a group of proteins called neurokinins from sending signals to other parts of the&#xD;
      body, which play a role in starting the symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the researchers will learn how safe elinzanetant is and how it affects the&#xD;
      body of healthy Japanese women compared to a placebo. A placebo is a treatment that looks&#xD;
      like a medicine but does not have any medicine in it. Before a new treatment can be given to&#xD;
      patients, researchers do studies in healthy participants to learn more about its safety and&#xD;
      how it acts in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 2 parts to this study. In Part A, the participants will take a single dose of&#xD;
      either elinzanetant or the placebo. In Part B, the participants will take multiple doses of&#xD;
      elinzanetant or the placebo. The participants will take each study treatment as capsules by&#xD;
      mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to learn how safe elinzanetant is and how it affects the&#xD;
      body. To answer this question, the researchers will collect the medical problems the&#xD;
      participants have after receiving the treatment and that may or may not be related to the&#xD;
      study treatment. These medical problems are also known as &quot;adverse events&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Part A, the participants will stay at their study site for a total of 9 days. They&#xD;
      will take either elinzanetant or the placebo only on Day 1 of their stay. During Part B, the&#xD;
      participants will stay at their study site for a total of 15 days. They will take either&#xD;
      elinzanetant or the placebo once a day for 7 days of their stay. Each participant will be in&#xD;
      the study for a total of approximately 5 weeks for Part A and approximately 6 weeks for Part&#xD;
      B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the doctors will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  take blood and urine samples;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  check the participants' health;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ask the participants questions about what medicines they are taking and if they are&#xD;
           having adverse events.&#xD;
