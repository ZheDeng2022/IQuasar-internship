    <textblock>
      This is a monocentric, two-arm, non-randomised, non-blinded, historically controlled,&#xD;
      interventional trial. The purpose of this trial is to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      model-informed infliximab dose de-escalation on the infliximab exposure and therapeutic&#xD;
      outcome as compared to standard dose de-escalation in patients with inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;

    <description>The proportion of patients maintaining steroid-free, combined clinical and biological remission during one year after infliximab dose de-escalation based on a standard dosing algorithm versus a model-informed dosing algorithm.&#xD;
Combined clinical and biological remission is defined based on patient-reported outcomes (rectal bleeding score = 0 + stool frequency score ≤1 [ulcerative colitis], mean daily abdominal pain score ≤1 + liquid stool frequency score ≤1.5 [Crohn's disease]) together with normal C-reactive protein (&lt;5 mg/L) and faecal calprotectin (&lt;250 mg/kg). Steroid-free indicates the absence of any dose of any oral or rectal steroid use.</description>

    <description>The treating physician adjusted the intravenously administered infliximab doses and dosing intervals without being guided by a model-informed precision dosing software tool. The primary objective was to extend the dosing interval. Therefore, dose de-escalation (interval extension with/without dose adjustment) were performed following a scheme at the treating physician's discretion.</description>
