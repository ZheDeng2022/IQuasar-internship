  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Statins are part of one of the largest groups of drugs prescribed worldwide used in the&#xD;
      treatment of dyslipidemia. Despite the good therapeutic results of statins and their good&#xD;
      tolerance on the part of patients, some adverse effects may occur during treatment. In&#xD;
      skeletal muscle, statins can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by decreased&#xD;
      adenosine triphosphate production, decreased oxidative phosphorylation capacity, increased&#xD;
      concentration of reactive oxygen species, and decreased mitochondrial biogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiorespiratory fitness is a physiological indicator that corresponds to the integration of&#xD;
      the cardiovascular, pulmonary, muscular, and cellular (mitochondria) systems in capturing,&#xD;
      transporting and using oxygen, commonly expressed as the maximum oxygen consumption. Several&#xD;
      studies show a strong association of lower cardiorespiratory capacity with an increased risk&#xD;
      of mortality from cardiovascular disease and mortality from all causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combining the use of statins with lifestyle changes has been suggested in many medical&#xD;
      guidelines. Physical exercise plays a fundamental role in improving cardiorespiratory fitness&#xD;
      and controlling dyslipidemia. However, some studies suggest that the association of statin&#xD;
      with physical training can negatively influence the adaptation and improvement of&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory capacity. On the other hand, some studies show that the combination of&#xD;
      statin and physical exercise does not negatively interfere with the maximum oxygen&#xD;
      consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the impact of statins on cardiorespiratory fitness and adaptation to physical&#xD;
      exercise, the investigators will use the database of the Cardiovascular Rehabilitation and&#xD;
      Exercise Physiology Department at Heart Institute (Sao Paulo, Brazil), which currently has&#xD;
      33,804 maximal cardiopulmonary exercise tests. This large database, which is the gold&#xD;
      standard of cardiorespiratory capacity (maximum oxygen consumption), will be used&#xD;
      retrospectively with relevant information and a huge number of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study will be to explore a large database to assess the effect of&#xD;
      the use of statins and their relationship with cardiorespiratory capacity in physically&#xD;
      active and sedentary individuals (with and without heart failure).&#xD;

      The investigators will use the database of the Cardiovascular Rehabilitation and Exercise&#xD;
      Physiology Department at Heart Institute (Sao Paulo, Brazil) in an exploratory manner. The&#xD;
      investigators will use filters to perform different analyzes and sub-analyses with different&#xD;
      groups of patients. The investigators aimed to compare patients using statins and healthy&#xD;
      controls (not using medications). The analysis strategy will be as following: 1) physically&#xD;
      active and sedentary patients with normal cardiac function using statins and peak oxygen&#xD;
      consumption (peak VO2); 2) physically active and sedentary patients with cardiac dysfunction&#xD;
      (heart failure) using statins and peak VO2; 3) comparison between the hydrophilic and&#xD;
      lipophilic classes of statins; 4) comparison between men and women; 5) retrospective&#xD;
      information on clinical and laboratory variables and 6) test information on cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      capacity and several variables associated with the mortality outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing on a treadmill or bike&#xD;
      (SensorMedics - Vmax Analyzer Assembly, Encore 29S) following a ramp protocol with constant&#xD;
      load increase until exhaustion. Cardiorespiratory capacity will be determined by peak VO2,&#xD;
      assessed at maximum exercise intensity, with a respiratory exchange ratio &gt;1.10.&#xD;
