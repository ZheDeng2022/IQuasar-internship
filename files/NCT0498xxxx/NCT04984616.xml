  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chagas Disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi afflicts 7 million people in Latin&#xD;
      America, and due to migration, abroad. The diagnosis lies in clinical suspicion and serologic&#xD;
      detection of antibodies. Cardiac evaluation is essential because complications, including&#xD;
      heart failure and arrhythmias, are the main causes of disability and death. Heart involvement&#xD;
      is explained by a parasite-dependent, immune-mediated myocardial and microvascular injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment includes the administration of nifurtimox or benznidazole, although in the&#xD;
      chronic phase their efficacy is low and may induce severe adverse events, forcing the&#xD;
      suspension of the therapy. Therefore, finding innovative approaches to improve the efficacy&#xD;
      of the current antichagasic drugs by modifying the inflammatory response would render the&#xD;
      current treatment more effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-clinical evidence supports the idea that the cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, such as&#xD;
      atorvastatin, may contribute to decrease cardiac inflammation, reduce endothelial activation,&#xD;
      and improve cardiac function. Atorvastatin therapeutic and safety profiles are well known, as&#xD;
      is its mechanism of action, shared by the other members of the statin class.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial aims at evaluating whether atorvastatin, in combination with antichagasic therapy,&#xD;
      is safe and more efficacious in reducing general inflammation than an antiparasitic therapy&#xD;
      alone, by improving endothelial and cardiac functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proof-of-concept trial will be double-blinded, randomized, and multicentered with a&#xD;
      phase II design. To achieve this aim, it will be evaluated the efficacy of the combination of&#xD;
      atorvastatin and antichagasic therapy (nifurtimox or benznidazole) to reduce inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokine plasma levels, soluble endothelial cell adhesion molecules, and confirm the&#xD;
      improvement of the cardiac function by electrocardiogram and two-dimensional echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will set the safety and tolerability of the combination of atorvastatin with&#xD;
      antichagasic therapy by monitoring the incidence of adverse events and discontinuation of the&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be conducted with a sample size of 300 adult patients in four hospitals&#xD;
      located in Santiago and Valparaiso, Chile.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chagas disease (CD) afflicts 7 million people in 21 endemic countries in Latin America and is&#xD;
      increasing in non-endemic countries due to migration. Control programs are discontinuous and&#xD;
      current therapy is limited due to low efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different biomarkers have been proposed to evaluate progression, prognosis, or response to&#xD;
      treatment; but, none has demonstrated sufficient specificity to be a gold standard for CD&#xD;
      diagnosis. However, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) have been&#xD;
      proposed as useful biomarkers to predict progress towards left ventricular dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic Chagas Cardiomyopathy (CCC) is caused by a parasite-dependent, immune-mediated&#xD;
      myocardial damage, which is the most critical determinant of the disease where the T helper&#xD;
      1/T helper 2 /T regulatory response is a crucial feature, where the equilibrium between&#xD;
      excessive pro-inflammatory (Interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β) and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-10) cytokines is critical for cardiac damage development. Also,&#xD;
      microvascular abnormalities and ischemia secondary to platelet activation and endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction, as evidenced by increases in cell adhesion molecules Intercellular Adhesion&#xD;
      Molecule type 1 (ICAM-1), Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule (VCAM), and E-selectin, including&#xD;
      their soluble forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of CCC and improvement strategies: In Chile, the etiologic treatment of CD in Chile&#xD;
      is done with 5-10 mg/kg/day nifurtimox (NFX) or 5 mg/kg/day benznidazole (BZD) for 60 days.&#xD;
      Drug therapy during the acute phase, congenital disease, and early indeterminate phase has a&#xD;
      satisfactory efficacy and is considered curative. However, it is more difficult to declare a&#xD;
      cure for chronic infection because current evidence of drug efficacy in this phase is weak or&#xD;
      controversial, especially when mortality is considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are molecules involved in the natural resolution of inflammation. These specialized&#xD;
      pro-resolving mediators include several lipids that control the magnitude and duration of&#xD;
      local inflammation. These lipids are derived from essential fatty acids present in the plasma&#xD;
      membrane, such as arachidonic acid or docosahexaenoic acid. Interestingly, aspirin and&#xD;
      cholesterol-lowering statins, including atorvastatin can induce the synthesis of such&#xD;
      molecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, a combination of trypanocidal drugs and those inducing resolution of the inflammatory&#xD;
      process derived from parasite persistence could be a sound therapeutic strategy to prevent&#xD;
      chronic consequences of CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a general agreement that adults with chronic indeterminate CD are the population&#xD;
      with the most urgent requirements for the development of new treatments because of the&#xD;
      highest disease burden to these patients. Thus, improving the host's factors (e.g., the&#xD;
      immune reaction elicited) may increase the efficacy of the conventional antichagasic therapy,&#xD;
      probably by a decrease in the dose, a decrease in its duration, or both. The therapeutic and&#xD;
      safety profiles of atorvastatin are well known, as is its mechanism of action and&#xD;
      pharmacological actions, including the anti-inflammatory properties, shared by the other&#xD;
      members of the statin class. Importantly, due to the low incidence of severe adverse events&#xD;
      and efficacy, is one of the most widely used statins today. 20-80 mg/day atorvastatin is used&#xD;
      to decrease the so-called LDL cholesterol involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this trial aims at evaluating whether atorvastatin, in combination with antichagasic&#xD;
      therapy, is safe and more efficacious in reducing general inflammation than an antiparasitic&#xD;
      therapy alone, by improving endothelial and cardiac functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proof-of-concept trial will be double-blinded, randomized, and multicentered with a&#xD;
      phase II design. To achieve this aim, it will be evaluated the efficacy of the combination of&#xD;
      atorvastatin and antichagasic therapy (nifurtimox or benznidazole) to reduce inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokine plasma levels, soluble endothelial cell adhesion molecules, and confirm the&#xD;
      improvement of the cardiac function by electrocardiogram and two-dimensional echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will be conducted in four centers located in the cities of Santiago and&#xD;
      Valparaiso, Chile. In all those centers, well-established Programs for Chagas Control (PCC)&#xD;
      are ongoing.&#xD;
