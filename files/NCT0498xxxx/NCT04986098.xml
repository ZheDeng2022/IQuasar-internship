  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DCB can maximize the patency rate of blood vessels on the basis of intraluminal DA. DA+DCB&#xD;
      treatment is effective and safe [8], and the advantages of DA and DCB in the treatment of&#xD;
      severe calcification and occlusive disease across joints and lower extremities have been&#xD;
      confirmed. The combined application of DA and DCB in the treatment of peripheral arterial&#xD;
      disease has a good early and mid-term effect. Konstantinos et al. reported that DARRT has a&#xD;
      higher first-phase patency rate compared with DCB. A retrospective study by Sebastian et al.&#xD;
      showed that compared with PTA after DA, the combination of DA and DCB has a better event-free&#xD;
      survival rate after 12 months of follow-up. Therefore, DA combined with DCB therapy may be&#xD;
      one of the best and most promising methods for the treatment of lower extremity ASO.&#xD;
