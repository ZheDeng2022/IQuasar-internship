  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whereas 18F-PSMA-1007 has rapidly established itself as a radiotracer for the investigation&#xD;
      of prostate cancer, there are no studies confirming its diagnostic performance. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to determine the diagnostic performance for this radiotracer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective, single-armed diagnostic imaging study men undergoing standard-of-care&#xD;
      PSMA PET/CT using [18F]PSMA-1007 shall be studied. The primary objective is to confirm the&#xD;
      positive predictive value (PPV) of this tracer at a patient-based level by recruiting until&#xD;
      53 patients with follow-up to a composite reference standard are available. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes shall include patient based rate of pathological-scans stratified by PSA, the PPV&#xD;
      stratified by region , interrelate agreement, frequency of indeterminate lesions and the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of the examination.&#xD;

    <description>The interrater agreement (ordinal scale, no units) for PET-findings will be determined. The joint-interrate reliability will be compared by a combined assessment of Fleiss' kappa and Krippendorf's alpha.</description>

    <description>Patients will be contacted by phone one to three days post imaging and assessed for adverse events (AE). Any reported events will be followed up by a physician in the clinic for study related adverse events requiring further evaluation. Adverse events are as defined in supplementary materials and will be recorded using the AE form in the eCRF.</description>
