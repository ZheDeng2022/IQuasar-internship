      Among patients receiving dental implants, does the choice of antibiotics reduce the frequency&#xD;
      of early implant failure ?&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients were selected in the implant assessment clinic from a population on the implant&#xD;
      waiting list at the department of Maxillofacial surgery department , of Jordan University&#xD;
      Hospital. Those consecutively assessed patients that complied with both the inclusion and the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria and who had signed consent for participation in the study formed the study&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following inclusion criteria were applied: • Presence of a partial edentulous or&#xD;
      edentulous alveolar ridge. • Presence of a tooth or several teeth regarded as non-restorable&#xD;
      with the intention of immediate implant placement. • Periodontally healthy remaining&#xD;
      dentition. • Presence of a non-infected surgical site. • Presence of enough bone and soft&#xD;
      tissue for the implant to be placed without additional augmentation procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following exclusion criteria were applied: • Patients with medical conditions that&#xD;
      required antibiotic premedication such as prosthetic heart valve replacement, skeletal joint&#xD;
      replacement, previous history of infective endocarditis and a history of rheumatic fever. •&#xD;
      Patients with metabolic diseases such as type I or II diabetes mellitus. • Patients with past&#xD;
      and present neoplastic disease. • Previous radiotherapy in the head and neck area. •&#xD;
      Immunosuppressed patients. • Patients with blood coagulation impairment. • Patients with a&#xD;
      history of systemic steroid medication or recent systemic antibiotic therapy. • Pregnant and&#xD;
      lactating women • Patients with allergy to the antibiotic chosen Every patient that agreed to&#xD;
      participate was randomly assigned to one of the following two groups: • First group - 625mg&#xD;
      of AMOCLAN immediately postoperatively, three times a day for 5 days. • Secondl group - 600mg&#xD;
      of CLINDAMYCIN immediately postoperatively, three times a day for 5 days. Consecutively&#xD;
      treated patients received consecutive numbers correlating with the number of an envelope.&#xD;
      This envelope contained either the 625mg Amoclan, or 600mg Clindamycin An independent person&#xD;
      administered the antibiotic Neither the surgeon nor the patient knew which has been taken to&#xD;
      ensure a double-blind approach One Professor in MaxFAx surgery was the operator One implant&#xD;
      typr used: Blue Sky Bio, USA Implants were placed according to the manufacturers guidelines&#xD;
      using standard surgical procedures. The local anaesthetic used was Articaine 4% with&#xD;
      adrenaline 1 : 100,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following adequate local anaesthesia, a mucoperiosteal flap was raised with or without one or&#xD;
      two relieving incisions as determined by the local anatomy, including availability of bone,&#xD;
      presence of neighbouring tooth roots and aesthetics. Osteotomies were then carried out under&#xD;
      copious saline irrigation. Implants were then placed with a view to obtaining good primary&#xD;
      stability. A decision was then made placing a cover screw and opting for a two stage approach&#xD;
      . Closure of the surgical site with either resorbable or non-resorbable sutures was then&#xD;
      performed ensuring tension free closure of the flaps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient was personally instructed and handed out standardised forms on post-operative&#xD;
      care. Patients were advised on the use of post-operative pain medication. To minimise the&#xD;
      influence of independent variables, all patients were instructed to use paracetamol 500 mg&#xD;
      tablets as required to a maximum of 4 g/day and Ibuprofen 400mg tablets to a maximum of&#xD;
      2000mg. Patients were advised to remain on a soft diet for the first post-operative week.&#xD;
      Patients were instructed to use a chlorhexidine 0.2% mouthwash 4-5 times daily for the first&#xD;
      postoperative week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recordings of osseointegration failure or success were recorded three months post-operatively&#xD;
      or at 2nd stage surgery. Post-operative swelling was recorded on the 7th days.&#xD;

    <description>Failure of osseointegration is defined as having ANY ONE of the following during the first three months of implant placement.&#xD;
implant mobility: Measured using two metal instruments moving against each other.&#xD;
Acute surgical site infection: presence of erythema, swelling, pain, discharge at the site of implant.&#xD;
Radiographic Bone Loss &gt;50% of implant length: measured using calibrated digital tool on peri-apical radiograph.&#xD;
Pain on function: measured using a verbal analogue scale (VAS). Patients were asked to describe the amount of pain they felt by giving a number from 0 to 10, where 0 represented not feeling any sort of pain and 10 represented the maximum pain they could imagine.</description>
