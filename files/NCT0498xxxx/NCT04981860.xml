  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out how Avenova (0.01 % hypochlorous acid)&#xD;
      works compared to Betadine (Povidone iodide) for reducing bacteria and patient discomfort in&#xD;
      the eyes.&#xD;

      About two percent of the population have an iodine allergy 1. A percentage of this population&#xD;
      will also have a reaction to iodine-containing agents, including povidone iodine (PI)&#xD;
      (Betadine®), which is the current standard of care for anti-septic preparation for&#xD;
      conjunctival procedures. Despite being known to have a toxic effect on the cornea 2 and&#xD;
      causing allergic reactions in some individuals, povidone Iodine (PI) (Betadine®) is still the&#xD;
      most commonly used antiseptic agent for surgical scrub. Currently, there are no equivalent&#xD;
      alternative prep agents available, although chlorhexidine has occasionally served as an&#xD;
      alternative to povidone iodine (PI) (Betadine®) with variable results 2. Some studies have&#xD;
      reported significantly less pain in patients prepped with chlorhexidine compared to povidone&#xD;
      iodine (PI) (Betadine®) 2, and other studies have demonstrated that chlorhexidine has equal&#xD;
      efficacy to povidone iodine (PI)(Betadine®) in decreasing the colony forming units of&#xD;
      microbes both in vitro and in vivo 3. Although there have been no known reported allergies to&#xD;
      chlorhexidine, it is known to be toxic to the cornea (leading to severe keratitis) and has&#xD;
      proven to be less effective against MRSA 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of 0.01% hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in saline solution as an antiseptic agent has been&#xD;
      gaining popularity as a possible alternative to povidone iodine (PI) (Betadine®).&#xD;
      Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is produced in vivo by neutrophils and causes oxidation of microbial&#xD;
      nucleotides and inactivation of microbial enzymes, leading to cell death. Hypochlorous acid&#xD;
      (HOCl) has a faster optimal kill-time for flora common to the eye 4, and has proven to be&#xD;
      non-cytotoxic and well tolerated for continuous use 4,5,6. In vitro studies of 0.01%&#xD;
      hypochlorous acid (HOCl) were found to have equal or more efficacious antiseptic properties&#xD;
      compared with povidone iodine (PI) (Betadine®) and other potential antiseptic agents&#xD;
      including chlorohexidine and isopropyl alcohol 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, two concentrations of HOCl are available for commercial use: AvenovaTM with&#xD;
      Neutrox™ (0.01% HOCl) and an over the counter product (0.02% HOCl). Both concentrations are&#xD;
      used to treat blepharitis. Debabov et al5 presented toxicity data concluding that 0.01%&#xD;
      hypochlorous acid (HOCl) (Avenova™ with Neutrox™) proved to be non-cytotoxic in comparison to&#xD;
      the 0.02% hypochlorous acid (HOCl) product which was cytotoxic thus supporting the potential&#xD;
      benefit of HOCl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroman et al6 2017 concludes that hypochlorous acid (HOCl)in saline solution reduced&#xD;
      bacterial colony load significantly without altering the variation of remaining bacterial&#xD;
      species. Additionally, hypochlorous acid (HOCl) has been shown to reduce the population of&#xD;
      bacterial and fungal species common to the lids and lashes by ≥ 99.9% 7. Despite the use of&#xD;
      hypochlorous acid (HOCl) as a topical antiseptic on the eyelid, there have been no reports of&#xD;
      its use as an antiseptic agent for conjunctival procedures. Many studies have confirmed that&#xD;
      flora of the eyelid and eyelash only differ in their concentrations 8. Since hypochlorous&#xD;
      acid (HOCl) has been found to be effective in reducing colony forming units and since the&#xD;
      flora species of the conjunctiva, eyelid and eyelashes are equivalent, we propose that&#xD;
      hypochlorous acid (HOCl) may serve as an alternative to povidone iodine (PI) (Betadine®) as a&#xD;
      conjunctival procedure prep agent. Considering there were no reported negative side effects&#xD;
      of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) contact with the eye, hypochlorous acid (HOCl) may prove to be a&#xD;
      non-inferior alternative to povidone iodine (PI) (Betadine®). This may result in lower&#xD;
      irritation and toxicity compared to povidone iodine (PI) (Betadine®)&#xD;
