    <textblock>
      Clinical management of cochlear implant (CI) recipients involve programming, counselling,&#xD;
      performance evaluation and habilitation. This requires the recipients to travel to the clinic&#xD;
      for follow up appointments which can pose significant challenges for recipients, particularly&#xD;
      those who live far away from the clinic. Remote Assist (RA) is a new solution that allows the&#xD;
      clinician to make MAP and sound processor adjustments via the recipient's Nucleus Smart app&#xD;
      (NSA) installed on their smart phone. With RA the clinician can also perform counselling&#xD;
      using a video call directly via the NSA. As RA uses no specialized hardware and software that&#xD;
      needs to be sent and retrieved back from the recipient, it has the potential to further&#xD;
      improve the remote programming experience and convenience for both the recipient and the&#xD;
      clinician.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Clinical management of cochlear implant (CI) recipients involve programming, counselling,&#xD;
      performance evaluation and habilitation. The standard practice for this management involves&#xD;
      frequent clinical visits in the first year after implantation and annual visits for the rest&#xD;
      of the recipient's life. The need to travel to the clinic for follow up appointments can pose&#xD;
      significant challenges for recipients, particularly those who live far away from the clinic.&#xD;
      There have been reports of recipients being lost to follow up due to the difficulties in&#xD;
      travelling to the clinic. The inconvenience of scheduling a session and travelling to the&#xD;
      clinic might deter recipients from seeking help for some seemingly small / less troubling&#xD;
      issues and increase their tendency to somehow bear and live with the issues. Sometimes&#xD;
      clinicians schedule follow-up sessions with the primary purpose of following-up on progress&#xD;
      with strategies provided earlier to overcome real world problems. Such follow-up on progress&#xD;
      can easily be completed via a video call as well. Remote programming is one telehealth&#xD;
      solution known to be successful in addressing the challenges of travelling to the clinic for&#xD;
      appointments. During the Covid-19 pandemic there was a demonstrated increase in the uptake of&#xD;
      remote programming when traveling to the clinic posed a health and safety risk. Current&#xD;
      methods of remote programming of CI requires the use of special computer and programming&#xD;
      hardware as well as proprietary programming software to be installed on a personal computer&#xD;
      (PC) at the remote location. Although remote programming potentially reduces the travel&#xD;
      burden for some recipients, it involves substantial administrative effort and cost by clinics&#xD;
      to prepare, send, retrieve back, and clean remote programming hardware and software. This&#xD;
      also reduces the frequency with which remote programming appointments can be scheduled due to&#xD;
      time delays in sending and retrieving equipment. Remote Assist (RA) is a new solution that&#xD;
      allows the clinician to make MAP and sound processor adjustments via the recipient's Nucleus&#xD;
      Smart app (NSA) installed on their smart phone. With RA the clinician can also perform&#xD;
      counselling using a video call directly via the NSA. As RA uses no specialized hardware and&#xD;
      software that needs to be sent and retrieved back from the recipient, it has the potential to&#xD;
      further improve the remote programming experience and convenience for both the recipient and&#xD;
      the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study aims to assess recipients ease and experience with using Remote Assist to&#xD;
      receive remote programming of their CI.&#xD;
