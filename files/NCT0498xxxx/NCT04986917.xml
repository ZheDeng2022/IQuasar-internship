      Study includes 5 visits: Screening, Baseline/Surgery, and 14 days, 3 months, 12months&#xD;
      Follow-Ups post-surgery. The actual point of enrollment for each subject is considered the&#xD;
      day of surgery. Total study duration is up to 12 months post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery will be performed under general anesthesia. Standard antibiotic prophylaxis will be&#xD;
      administered 30 min prior to skin incision. A surgical assistant will be selected by the PI&#xD;
      from the surgical staff of the department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will involve placement of laparoscopic ports, reduction of the hernia sac,&#xD;
      closure of the defect with the Su2ura® approximation device and fixation of mesh with tacks&#xD;
      over the closed defect in an IPOM fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on surgeon consideration, primary umbilical hernia defects under 2 cm will be repaired&#xD;
      with or without mesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study follow-up visits will take place 14 days, 3 months and 12 months post-surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be performed in accordance with the design and specific provisions of this&#xD;
      protocol, in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration&#xD;
      of Helsinki, that are consistent with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), Title 21 of the Code of&#xD;
      Federal Regulations (21 CFR), part 812 (Investigational Device Exemptions), and the&#xD;
      applicable regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective, multi-center, open study, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      the Su2ura® approximation device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An abdominal hernia emerges through a preformed or acquired defect of the abdominal wall. The&#xD;
      defect may be congenital (primary), acquired as a result of wear and tear (primary), or&#xD;
      result from surgery or trauma, where failure of the abdominal wall to heal produces an&#xD;
      incisional (non-primary) hernia. Examples of abdominal hernia include epigastric, umbilical&#xD;
      and inguinal hernia. Patients may be asymptomatic or complain of a lump or pain. These&#xD;
      patients are offered elective surgery. Patients may also present with complications&#xD;
      necessitating emergency repair with or without additional resection of compromised viscera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventral hernias are very common and do present a challenge because of the risk of recurrence.&#xD;
      Besides the surgeon, these hernias are ideally managed by a dietitian, nurse, and a physical&#xD;
      therapist. Patient education has been a very popular topic in literature and hospital&#xD;
      settings. Giving patients literature and discussing outcomes with instructions on multiple&#xD;
      aspects throughout their encounters has shown to be very effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Su2ura Approximation Device is designed to deploy anchors threaded with stiches to&#xD;
      facilitate tissue approximation by eliminating the need for the passing of a needle from one&#xD;
      side of the tissue to the other as performed in traditional suturing. Utilizing the anchor&#xD;
      feature allows a single action placement of a suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator from each medical center participated in an appropriate training&#xD;
      program. This training included the surgery procedure in an animal. The Principal&#xD;
      investigators will train the sub investigators in this procedure. The sponsor will also&#xD;
      provide training on the laparoscopic simulator to the principal investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 patients will be recruited to the study. Patients with a primary umbilical&#xD;
      hernia under 2 cm will be recruited to the study and the hernia will be repaired with or&#xD;
      without mesh according to the PI's decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients with a primary or secondary ventral hernia, desiring an elective surgical&#xD;
      repair, who amply the inclusion/Exclusion criteria will be offered to participate in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study includes 5 visits: Screening, Baseline/Surgery, and 14 days, 3 months, 12months&#xD;
      Follow-Ups post-surgery. The actual point of enrollment for each subject is considered the&#xD;
      day of surgery. Total study duration is up to 12months post-surgery.&#xD;
