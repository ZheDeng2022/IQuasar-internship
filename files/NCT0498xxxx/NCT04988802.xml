  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothyroidism is a common disease that is successfully treated with the replacement of&#xD;
      thyroid hormones in the form of levothyroxine. Levothyroxine is drug used in the first line&#xD;
      of substitution therapy because it appropriately mimics physiological secretion of thyroxine&#xD;
      (T4) and its peripheral conversion to triiodothyronine (T3). However, due to its narrow&#xD;
      therapeutic index, and because it is administered at very low doses (micrograms - μg), it is&#xD;
      particularly sensitive to the absorption phase interactions, which are due to its narrow&#xD;
      therapeutic index, mainly clinically significant. In pregnancy, one of the goals is to&#xD;
      maintain the values of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in the lower part of the reference&#xD;
      interval (below 2,5 milli-International units - mIU/L) for a proper child development. Also,&#xD;
      due to increased nutritional needs during pregnancy, nutritional supplements are commonly&#xD;
      used by pregnant women on their own initiative, but also often recommended by healthcare&#xD;
      personnel. Reviewing the literature, we did not find high quality evidence to suggest the&#xD;
      existence or to refute the interaction between dietary supplements for pregnant women and the&#xD;
      absorption of levothyroxine. The aim of this study is to investigate this potential&#xD;
      interaction between dietary supplements used in pregnancy and levothyroxine absorption in&#xD;
      order to test the safety of the use of these preparations in pregnant women who are on&#xD;
      replacement therapy with levothyroxine.&#xD;

      Hypothyroidism is a common disease that is successfully treated with the replacement of&#xD;
      thyroid hormones in the form of levothyroxine. Levothyroxine is drug used in the first line&#xD;
      of substitution therapy because it appropriately mimics physiological secretion of thyroxine&#xD;
      (T4) and its peripheral conversion to triiodothyronine (T3). However, due to its narrow&#xD;
      therapeutic index, and because it is administered at very low doses (μg), it is particularly&#xD;
      sensitive to the absorption phase interactions, which are due to its narrow therapeutic&#xD;
      index, mainly clinically significant. In pregnancy, one of the goals is to maintain the&#xD;
      values of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in the lower part of the reference interval&#xD;
      (below 2,5 mIU/L) for a proper child development. Also, due to increased nutritional needs&#xD;
      during pregnancy, nutritional supplements are commonly used by pregnant women on their own&#xD;
      initiative, but also often recommended by healthcare personnel. Reviewing the literature, we&#xD;
      did not find high quality evidence to suggest the existence or to refute the interaction&#xD;
      between dietary supplements for pregnant women and the absorption of levothyroxine. The aim&#xD;
      of this study is to investigate this potential interaction between dietary supplements used&#xD;
      in pregnancy and levothyroxine absorption in order to test the safety of the use of these&#xD;
      preparations in pregnant women who are on replacement therapy with levothyroxine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary goal is to asses if taking of the food supplement for pregnant women with&#xD;
      levothyroxine diminishes the absorption of levothyroxine, which is measured through values of&#xD;
      TSH, FT4 and FT3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary and other objectives are to determine whether the use of dietary supplements&#xD;
      intended for pregnant women, due to its mineral-vitamin composition, can affect body weight,&#xD;
      waist circumference and lipogram values of patients diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study would include subjects diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism over the age of 18 and&#xD;
      on stable LT4 therapy for at least 6 months. Although the study is intended to examine&#xD;
      dietary supplements for pregnant women, the said population will be excluded from the study&#xD;
      for safety reasons. Given that the mechanism of the vast majority of LT4 interactions is&#xD;
      based on the adsorption of levothyroxine on the interfering substance, we believe that&#xD;
      potential differences in LT4 absorption between pregnant women and the study population&#xD;
      should not affect the clinical interpretation of the results of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, patients with thyroid cancer as well as patients at high cardiovascular risk will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study. Patients with proven lactose intolerance will also not participate&#xD;
      in this study. Patients with proven celiac disease and Giardia Lamblia infection will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study. Also, patients diagnosed with atrophic gastritis or H. pylori&#xD;
      infection will be excluded from the study. Although the evidence for the effect of bariatric&#xD;
      surgery on LT4 absorption is not entirely clear, this group will not be included in the study&#xD;
      due to the potential hazard of the effect of said surgery on absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the calculated required sample size, for 90% strength of the study, it will be&#xD;
      necessary to include at least 37 patients to determine clinically significant interference of&#xD;
      these preparations with LT4 absorption. Analysis of the required sample size is shown later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon entering the study, patients would undergo a medical examination to examine satisfactory&#xD;
      inclusive and exclusion criteria for the study, blood sampling for TSH, FT3, FT4, total and&#xD;
      ionized calcium, iron, UIBC, TIBC, ferritin, folic acid, vitamin B12, KKS , total&#xD;
      cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, as well as by measuring anthropometric variables such&#xD;
      as body height, body weight, and waist circumference. Waist circumference will be measured&#xD;
      according to WHO recommendation at a point located between the lower edge of the lowest&#xD;
      palpable rib and the lateral ridge (iliac crest) using a non-extensible measuring tape at the&#xD;
      end of normal exhalation in two consecutive measurements. Upon inclusion, subjects will be&#xD;
      informed of the study, including that changes in TSH, FT3, and FT4 levels are possible and&#xD;
      that they report to the study leader if they experience any disturbances. The study will also&#xD;
      be discontinued, subject blindness, and therapy corrected if TSH is greater than or equal to&#xD;
      10mIU / L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After inclusion, patients will be randomized into two groups in a 1: 1 ratio - one group will&#xD;
      take the selected dietary supplement for pregnant women for 8 weeks at the same time as LT4&#xD;
      which will be taken according to the method recommended in the Summary of Product&#xD;
      Characteristics-SmPC (half an hour before breakfast with a glass of water), while the second&#xD;
      tablet of the preparation intended for pregnant women will be taken in the evening - 12 hours&#xD;
      after the morning dose (29). The second group of subjects will take a placebo tablet whose&#xD;
      composition will be based on starch. The selected dietary supplement for pregnant women is&#xD;
      Prenatal nutrients from Solgar. The preparation was selected from several other preparations&#xD;
      based on the widespread use in the pregnant population of our region and beyond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization as well as the procedure in which the study will be blinded for the involved&#xD;
      doctors, but also patients, will be performed in a pharmacy under the supervision of a&#xD;
      pharmacist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to emphasize that when entering the study, patients will be informed about&#xD;
      the influence of certain foods (dietary fiber, soy, coffee, grapefruit, vitamin C) on the&#xD;
      absorption of LT4 (28). Because these interactions can be avoided by separating the intake of&#xD;
      these foods and LT4, patients will be informed by the physician who included them in the&#xD;
      study upon entering the study. They will also complete a questionnaire during study entry as&#xD;
      well as during follow-up examinations to check their eating habits related to foods that may&#xD;
      have an impact on LT4 absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 8 weeks, a control examination will be performed, during which a blood sample will be&#xD;
      taken to determine thyroid hormones and other findings, as well as when included in the&#xD;
      study, the aforementioned anthropometric variables will be checked and the doctor will&#xD;
      perform examinations to evaluate patient safety. Subsequently, patients who were randomized&#xD;
      to the group taking LT4 with dietary supplementation will continue to take LT4 along with&#xD;
      placebo, while patients who took LT4 with placebo will continue to take LT4 along with&#xD;
      dietary supplement intended for pregnant women. At the end of the second part of the study, a&#xD;
      blood sample will be taken again, the examined anthropometric variables will be checked, and&#xD;
      the patient will leave the study and continue to take LT4 according to the usual way of&#xD;
      taking it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study used a period of 8 weeks for each intake regimen as it is a time period that has&#xD;
      been proven in several studies to be sufficient to determine changes in LT4 absorption at TSH&#xD;
      values (10,11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipidogram values will be measured due to literature data suggesting a beneficial effect of&#xD;
      biotin on lipid values, and in the test preparation biotin is present in a dose higher than&#xD;
      the recommended daily dose (30, 31, 32, 33).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon entering the study, patients will fill out an informed consent in which they will be&#xD;
      explained the purpose, procedures and duration of the study. At the time of enrollment in the&#xD;
      study and at the end of each observed period of 8 weeks, patients would have a blood sample&#xD;
      taken to examine the required parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FT4 and fT3 concentrations will be measured by radioimmunochemical methods, TSH values by&#xD;
      immunochemical methods, while anthropometric measurements of body height and weight and waist&#xD;
      circumference will be made using calibrated measuring instruments. Determining the values of&#xD;
      the required laboratory parameters as well as taking samples will be done according to the&#xD;
      standard protocols of the Clinical Institute for Laboratory Diagnostics at the Clinical&#xD;
      Hospital Dubrava.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomization scheme will be generated at http://www.randomization.com. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to a dietary supplement intended for pregnant women or placebo, and after 8 weeks&#xD;
      of the study will cross-replace the active preparation with placebo and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The required number of 37 subjects was obtained using a t-test for paired samples (MedCalc&#xD;
      ver. 18.11.6), error type 1 of 0.05, error type 2 of 0.1 (90% strength), standard deviation&#xD;
      of differences of 1, 81 and a clinically significant difference in TSH between the two groups&#xD;
      of 1.0 mIU / L (11,12). A similar number of subjects were included in earlier studies by&#xD;
      other authors that showed the influence of certain substances in the diet on LT4 absorption&#xD;
      (13-16, 18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normality of the distribution of numerical variables will be tested by the Shapiro-Wilk&#xD;
      test. Normally distributed numerical variables will be presented as the arithmetic mean ±&#xD;
      standard deviation, and a t-test for paired samples will be used to compare them between the&#xD;
      active preparation and the placebo. Non-normally distributed numerical variables will be&#xD;
      presented as median and interquartile range, and the Wilcoxon pairwise test will be used to&#xD;
      compare them between the active preparation and the placebo. The category variables will be&#xD;
      presented as a ratio and a percentage and will be compared between the active preparation and&#xD;
      the placebo by the McNemar test. The t-test or Mann Whitney U test for numerical variables,&#xD;
      depending on the normality of their distribution, and the χ2 test or Fisher's test for&#xD;
      categorical variables will be used to compare patient characteristics at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study and parameters of interest at individual time points during the study. P values &lt;0.05&#xD;
      will be considered statistically significant. The MedCalc statistical program (MedCalc&#xD;
      Statistical Software version 18.11.6 or later; MedCalc Software bvba, Ostend, Belgium) /&#xD;
      licensed to Marko Lucijanić will be used for all analyzes.&#xD;
