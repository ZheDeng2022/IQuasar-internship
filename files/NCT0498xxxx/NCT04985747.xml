      The palatal rugae, refer to asymmetrical and irregular elevations of the mucosa located in&#xD;
      the anterior third of the palate, on each side of the median palatal raphe and behind the&#xD;
      incisive papilla. The lack of the rugae area on the polished areas of the dentures has been&#xD;
      suggested to impact phonetics in denture patients due to lack of tactile feedback. Therefore,&#xD;
      the aim of this randomized crossover clinical trial was to compare patients' reported&#xD;
      satisfaction with their complete dentures and oral health related quality of life, when&#xD;
      provided with a denture with a rough palatal surface in the rugae area compared with a&#xD;
      polished palatal surface or an open palatal surface.&#xD;

      The use of dentures could impact the patients' phonetics which could impact their speech.&#xD;
      Phonetics could be affected by multiple factors such as having a proper occlusal vertical&#xD;
      dimension, proper occlusal plane, correctly positioned anterior and posterior teeth, and&#xD;
      adequate contouring of the palatal surface. The lack of the rugae area on the polished areas&#xD;
      of the dentures has been also suggested to impact phonetics in denture patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The palatal rugae, refer to asymmetrical and irregular elevations of the mucosa located in&#xD;
      the anterior third of the palate, on each side of the median palatal raphe and behind the&#xD;
      incisive papilla. In addition to enhancing phonetics, the precise reproduction of the rugae&#xD;
      in the complete dentures has been suggested to enhance mastication, deglutition and better&#xD;
      taste perception. However, these suggestions were based on empirical evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have described methods for replicating the patients rague on complete dentures&#xD;
      or modifying the palatal area, however there are no clinical study to ascertain or negate the&#xD;
      impact of this procedure. Therefore, the aim of this randomized crossover clinical trial was&#xD;
      to compare patients' reported satisfaction with their complete dentures and oral health&#xD;
      related quality of life, when provided with a denture with a rough surface in their rugae on&#xD;
      the anterior palatal area as opposed to a polished palatal surface or an open palatal&#xD;
      surface. The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference in patients' reported&#xD;
      satisfaction rate using visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oral Health Impact Profile for&#xD;
      Edentulous Patients (OHIP-EDENT) Questionnaire response between the three types of palatal&#xD;
      contours after using each type for two month post-delivery.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will randomly be allocated to either group P/R/O. Group P: Patients receiving a smooth palatal surface. Group R: Patients receiving a rough surface in the rugae area. Group O: Patients receiving an open surface in the rugae area&#xD;
After insertion, all participants will be followed up for a minimum of 1 week to correct any issues with the dentures and eliminate patient complaints.&#xD;
All patients will be recalled at 2 month after insertion to answer questions using the VAS and to fill out the Oral Health Impact Profile-20 EDENT (OHIP-EDENT), and receive the other type of palatal contour.&#xD;
After the second and third period the same process will be repeated.</intervention_model_description>
