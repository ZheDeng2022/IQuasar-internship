  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco use disorder is a chronic disease. This is particularly true for people living with&#xD;
      mental illness, who are more likely to smoke and make more unsuccessful quit attempts than&#xD;
      those without. The current study is designed to test a package of two chronic disease&#xD;
      management strategies to treatment tobacco in community mental health centers: regular&#xD;
      provider interventions during routine mental healthcare visits, and proactive outreach by&#xD;
      community mental health center staff to offer connections to tobacco cessation treatment. 50&#xD;
      patients at a community mental health center will receive provider intervention at their&#xD;
      regular visits as well as 3 outreach calls over 9 months from trained staff to offer to&#xD;
      connect them with stop smoking treatment. The investigators will measure the effect of these&#xD;
      interventions on tobacco use over the next year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      BACKGROUND: The US Public Health Service (USPHS) designated tobacco dependence as a chronic&#xD;
      disease. This is especially true for smokers with serious mental illness (SMI) who make more&#xD;
      cessation attempts and are less successful sustaining long-term abstinence than the general&#xD;
      population. There is a significant health disparity wherein individuals with SMI have a&#xD;
      higher tobacco use prevalence and a greater risk for tobacco-related mortality than the&#xD;
      general population. Chronic care models suggest chronic disease management requires a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary care team to assess tobacco use, administer treatment, support patient&#xD;
      self-management, and monitor progress. Proactive telephone outreach to smokers and brief&#xD;
      provider interventions are two effective chronic disease management strategies. Community&#xD;
      based mental health centers (CMHCs) are a primary treatment access point for many smokers&#xD;
      with SMI. However, rates of intervention with smoking by CMHC providers are low. In order to&#xD;
      implement the chronic care model for tobacco dependence for CMHCs, comprehensive&#xD;
      implementation strategies are needed. OBJECTIVE: to conduct a feasibility pilot trial to&#xD;
      adapt an implementation strategy developed by the SAMHSA-funded network of Addiction&#xD;
      Technology Transfer Centers (ATTCs) to integrate a proactive, chronic care model of tobacco&#xD;
      cessation treatment into CMHCs. AIM: To conduct a pilot trial to assess the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability and initial effectiveness of the implementation strategy. DESIGN: The&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a pilot hybrid type 2 implementation-effectiveness trial in 3&#xD;
      CMHCs (N=50 patients; 96-130 providers). The investigators will conduct 2 baseline&#xD;
      assessments (3 months apart) and outcomes will be assessed at 3, 6, and 12-months post&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes include feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness of the implementation strategy on&#xD;
      tobacco cessation treatment utilization (counseling and medication) and patient effectiveness&#xD;
      on tobacco cessation (CO confirmed 7-day point prevalence abstinence). SIGNIFICANCE: An&#xD;
      effective implementation strategy for tobacco cessation treatment in CMHCs, a widespread&#xD;
      model of care delivery, would have enormous public health impact.&#xD;
