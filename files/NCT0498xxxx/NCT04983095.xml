  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open label, multi-centre, randomized phase III study. The patients will be&#xD;
      randomised in a 2:1 ratio to treatment consisting of&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: MD-SBRT in addition to standard treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: Standard treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients with hormone sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) with oligometastatic&#xD;
      disease detected by PSMA-PET/DT. This includes patients with de novo oligometastatic HSPC and&#xD;
      recurrent HSPC after primary RT or prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Failure free survival (time to castration resistant prostate cancer, CRPC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Predictive value of investigated biomarkers in blood and imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute and late toxicity after MD-SBRT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PROM at 3 months, 1, 3 and 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Differences in outcome between patients by strata&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification: To avoid imbalance between treatment arms the minimisation method will be&#xD;
      used to achieve balance between de novo oligo-metastatic and oligo-recurrent patients, as&#xD;
      well as treatment site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluation: Adverse events and side effects graded according to CTCAE v5.0 will be&#xD;
      collected every 6th month. Serious Adverse Events are to be reported within 24 hours&#xD;
      throughout the study duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods: Survival endpoints will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method with&#xD;
      differences compared using the stratified log-rank test. Randomization time is set as&#xD;
      baseline time. Pre-planned subgroup analysis will occur based on pre-specified stratification&#xD;
      variables. A Cox multivariable regression model will be used to determine factors predictive&#xD;
      of survival. Safety analysis will be performed with Mann-Whitney U-test or Fishers exact&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for evaluation: Per protocol (patients that have started study treatment) and&#xD;
      Intention to treat (all included patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned sample size: 114 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point will be analysed after pre-specified number of events have occurred or&#xD;
      at 60 months of follow up. Safety analysis of acute toxicity will take place after median&#xD;
      follow up of 6 months. Safety analysis of late toxicity will be analysed after study closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three to five years inclusion. 60 months of follow-up after randomization of the last&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;

      Standard treatment (arm A and B): ADT is considered the gold standard for this patient group.&#xD;
      This includes medical castration with GnRH-agonist and 30-day antiandrogen (flare protection)&#xD;
      or GnRH-antagonist. If the patient is de novo oligo-metastatic, RT to the prostate is&#xD;
      considered as standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study intervention (arm A): MD-SBRT to all PSMA-PET/CT positive metastatic target volume(s)&#xD;
      with 30 Gy in 3 fractions or 40 Gy in 5 fractions in addition to standard treatment. For&#xD;
      recurrent patients post prostatectomy with PSMA-PET-positive finding at prostate bed (without&#xD;
      prior local RT) salvage RT with SIB to the PSMA+ GTV is to be delivered. Concurrent&#xD;
      PSMA-PET-positive regional lymph nodes are to be treated for all patients in the intervention&#xD;
      arm (sum of SBRT-targets maximum 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening procedure:Inclusion/exclusion criteria evaluation including evaluation of&#xD;
      feasibility of SBRT to all positive lesions on PSMA-PET/CT performed within 30 days of&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study specific procedure: Recording/collecting of baseline data including baseline PROM and&#xD;
      pre-ADT testosterone and PSA. Standard treatment with ADT administered at randomization to&#xD;
      all study patients. Start of study intervention with MD-SBRT within 21 days of randomization&#xD;
      to patients in arm A. Additional RT as specified in study intervention started within 90&#xD;
      days. Follow up according to protocol, minimum 60 months.&#xD;
