      Pyrotinib is an important drug for the treatment of breast cancer, but the incidence of&#xD;
      diarrhea is very high. At present, there is no particularly effective drug for diarrhea&#xD;
      induced by pyrotinib. Trying to intervene with traditional Chinese medicine may bring better&#xD;
      results to patients.&#xD;
