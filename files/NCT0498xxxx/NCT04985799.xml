      To assess to the non-inferiority of the retropubic Neomedic Knotless Incontinence Mesh (KIM)&#xD;
      sling compared to the Gynecare Tension-free Vaginal Tape (TVT) Exact sling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Women 21 years or older with a diagnosis of stress urinary incontinence (SUI)&#xD;
      or mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) with objective evidence of SUI planning surgery for&#xD;
      stress urinary incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): Patients will be randomized to receive either the Gynecare TVT Exact&#xD;
      sling or the retropubic Neomedic KIM sling. Patients will be followed for 1 year&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Midurethral slings (MUS) are recognized as a minimally invasive treatment of SUI. The&#xD;
      retropubic route of MUS placement has a cure rate of 89.1% with long term subjective cure&#xD;
      rates ranging from 51-88%. The Neomedic Knotless Incontinence Mesh (KIM) sling is a&#xD;
      tension-free macroporous monofilament polypropylene knotless mesh designed to be resistant to&#xD;
      elongation and deformation over time. The KIM sling also offers a reusable trocar, which&#xD;
      results in less waste and cost- savings. KIM sling trocars are available for the retropubic&#xD;
      route or trans-obturator (TOT) route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While studies have been performed comparing the TOT approach of the KIM sling to other&#xD;
      slings, no studies have been performed to date with the retropubic (RP) approach. The RP and&#xD;
      TOT approaches to MUS have been shown to be equivalent in the treatment of SUI. Since the&#xD;
      same mesh material of the KIM sling is used for both the TOT and RP approach, it can be&#xD;
      hypothesis that the RP route would show similar treatment success rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A type 1 macroporous (&gt; 75um) polypropylene mesh is the most appropriate material for vaginal&#xD;
      implantation. However, literature has suggested that the design and weave of synthetic mesh&#xD;
      material can also have a significant effect on efficacy and safety; therefore, the novel&#xD;
      design of the KIM may be beneficial to reduce complications. If there is similar efficacy&#xD;
      with the RP approach of the KIM sling to the TVT Exact, there will be benefit of reduced&#xD;
      costs and the potential for less complications. With this study, the objective is to show&#xD;
      non-inferiority of the KIM sling to the Gynecare TVT Exact.&#xD;
