  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness in people over 50&#xD;
      years old. Neovascular AMD, the most severe form and the most severe is characterized by the&#xD;
      appearance, spread and growth of subretinal neovessels. One of the major molecular mediators&#xD;
      is the endothelial growth factor vascular (VEGF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-vitreous (IVI) injection of an anti-VEGF may slow the progression of Neovascular AMD&#xD;
      and stabilize vision in the majority of cases. Ranibizumab (Lucentis®) is one of the&#xD;
      anti-VEGF molecules approved in Belgium to treat neovascular AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of its use, ranibizumab was first injected monthly and then according to the&#xD;
      &quot;reactive&quot; protocol. Over time, a new strategy of treatment was born: the &quot;treat-and-extend&quot;&#xD;
      (T&amp;E). This is 'made to measure' protocol for each patient aiming to reduce the frequency of&#xD;
      injections while guaranteeing inactivity of the disease. It starts with the loading dose,&#xD;
      i.e. 3 injections given 4 weeks apart. Subsequently, the interval is lengthened by slices of&#xD;
      1 or 2 weeks provided that the visual and anatomical results remain stable. In the event of&#xD;
      deterioration, the interval is shortened while keeping a minimum of 4 weeks between each IIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and safety of ranibizumab, when used in a proactive regimen of T&amp;E, has been&#xD;
      shown in the CANTREAT randomized controlled trial. However, there is a lack of more data on&#xD;
      T&amp;E used in current practice, and particularly on the number of injections and treatment&#xD;
      intervals over a minimum treatment period of 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this retrospective study carried out at the CHU Brugmann Hospital is to determine&#xD;
      the number of injections and the intervals necessary to have encouraging results in visual&#xD;
      acuity over a treatment period of at least two years.&#xD;
