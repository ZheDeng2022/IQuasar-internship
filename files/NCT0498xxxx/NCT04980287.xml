      Complete mesocolic excision is currently recognized as a standard procedure for colon cancer.&#xD;
      Controversy remains on the presence of right gastroepiploic mesentery metastasis in patients&#xD;
      with colon cancer locating at or close to the hepatic flexure. The investigators design this&#xD;
      study in order to define the incidence of mesogastrium metastasis and analyse the safety and&#xD;
      surgical outcome in these patients who undergo complete mesocolic excision with right&#xD;
      gastroepiploic mesentery resection.&#xD;

      The development of gastrointestinal surgery has passed over three periods: organ resection,&#xD;
      radical resection based on vascular blood vessel center and functional radical organ&#xD;
      resection based on membrane anatomy. Using high-definition laparoscopy, surgeons could&#xD;
      observe the membrane structure that cannot be identified in traditional open surgery. Total&#xD;
      mesocolic excision or complete mesocolic excision has been widely recognized in clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2009, hohenberger et al. proposed the concept of complete mesocolic excision (CME) for the&#xD;
      first time. They retrospectively analyzed the data of 1329 patients with colon cancer who&#xD;
      underwent radical resection from 1978 to 2002. They found that the 5-year local recurrence&#xD;
      rate decreased from 6.5% to 3.6%, and the 5-year survival rate increased from 82.1% to&#xD;
      89.1%.In 2015, Jianping Gong further introduced the anatomy of mesentery, and highlighted&#xD;
      that the radical operation of gastrointestinal tumor should not only complete the traditional&#xD;
      D2 or D3 lymph node dissection, but also need the complete excision of the mesentery within&#xD;
      the right presumed metastatic tumor cells existingbearing range. On the one hand, its&#xD;
      clinical significance lies in reducing intraoperative severe complications; On the other&#xD;
      hand, better radical operation and due to avoiding &quot;cancer leakage&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete mesocolic excision is currently recognized as a standard procedure for colon cancer.&#xD;
      According to the theory of membrane anatomy, the right gastroepiploic mesentery and the&#xD;
      mesentery of colon are independent which act as separate envelope. As right gastroepiploic&#xD;
      mesentery metastases were classified as distant metastaticmetastasis, radical resection of&#xD;
      colon cancer under CME combined with resection of the right gastroepiploic mesentery is not&#xD;
      appropriate for patients with colon cancer locating at or close to the hepatic flexure. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, literatures on the surgical methods and boundary of lymph node dissection for&#xD;
      colon cancer are all retrospective studies, and lack of RCT evidence. Controversy remains on&#xD;
      the presence of mesogastrium metastasis in patients with colon cancer locating at or close to&#xD;
      the hepatic flexure. Therefore, the following questions remain to be addressed: will cancer&#xD;
      malignant tumors located locating at or close to hepatic flexure or transverse colon close to&#xD;
      flexures metastasize to the right gastroepiploic mesentery (including but not limiting No.6&#xD;
      lymph nodes)? The No.6 lymph node metastasis of No.6 lymph nodes in the patients with colon&#xD;
      cancer locating at the hepatic flexure have been reported, but whether the &quot; No.6 lymph nodes&#xD;
      &quot; were mixed with lymph nodes in the colon mesentery was unknown. The investigators design&#xD;
      this study in order to define the incidence of mesogastrium metastasis in colon cancer&#xD;
      locating at or close to the hepatic flexure, and analyse analyze the safety and surgical&#xD;
      outcome in these patients undergoing complete mesocolic excision plus right gastroepiploic&#xD;
      mesentery resection.&#xD;
