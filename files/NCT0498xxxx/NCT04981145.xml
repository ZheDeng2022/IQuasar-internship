  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of SSRI-30 between the two groups at 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SS Responder Index (SSRI) is a composite endpoint, investigators defined an SSRI-30 response as a ≥30% improvement in at least two of five outcome measures (patient-assessed visual analogue scale scores for fatigue, oral dryness and ocular dryness, unstimulated whole salivary flow and ESR at 24 weeks</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjogren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI) score from Baseline to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ESSPRI is composed of 3 scales - dryness, fatigue, and pain. Each scale is measured 0 - 10, 0 being no symptoms, 10 being maximal imaginable dryness, fatigue or pain. The total score is the mean score of the three scales. Baseline ESSPRI total score will be compared to week 24, end of treatment, ESSPRI total score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in total score of the EULAR Sjogren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI) from baseline to week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ESSDAI is a disease activity measurement that has 12 domains. The score of each domain is the product of the weight of the domain by the level of activity. Activity levels are 0 - 3, 0 being no activity, 3 being high activity. The total score is the sum of the score of all domains. Change in total score from BL to week 24 will be measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Schimer's test</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline in Schimer's test at 24 weeks. The Schirmer's test assesses tear secretion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>10 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline in IgG concentration at 10 and 24 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in serum complements C3 and C4 concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>10 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline in serum complements C3 and C4 concentrationat 10 and 24 weeks.</description>
