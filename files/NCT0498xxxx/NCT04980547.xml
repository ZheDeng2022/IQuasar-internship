      This study is a prospective, multi-centre, non-randomized, and non-blinded follow-up study to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy and effectiveness of the ACUMED® Scapholunate Repair System in primary&#xD;
      scapholunate interosseous ligament (SLIL) reconstruction.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The scapholunate interosseous ligament (SLIL) of the wrist can be likened to the ACL of the&#xD;
      knee as an often-injured ligament causing joint instability that frequently impairs function&#xD;
      and requires surgical reconstruction. Yet wrist surgeons are significantly behind knee&#xD;
      surgeons in their ability to achieve consistent and reliable outcomes with surgical&#xD;
      reconstruction of this ligament. This ligament is often treated using a surgical procedure of&#xD;
      reduction and association of scaphoid and lunate (RASL). However, this procedure is&#xD;
      accompanied with technical challenges regarding proper screw placement and trajectory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ACUMED® Scapholunate Repair System presents as a novel and innovated device that has the&#xD;
      potential to improve surgeon proficiency with the RASL procedure. The purpose of this trial&#xD;
      is to assess the efficacy and effectiveness of the ACUMED® Scapholunate Repair System in&#xD;
      primary scapholunate interosseous ligament (SLIL) reconstruction. The study will assess the&#xD;
      surgeon learning curve with the ACUMED® Scapholunate Repair System, record safety,&#xD;
      complications, outcomes and adverse events for 2 years after surgery. This study will&#xD;
      generate clinical evidence to support and maintain product registration in global markets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting with sub-acute or chronic (&gt;8 weeks) primary SLIL instability that will&#xD;
      be treated surgically at up to 20 study sites across Canada. A total of 50 wrists will be&#xD;
      enrolled into the study and surgeons will utilize the ACUMED® Scapholunate Repair System&#xD;
      during the surgical procedure. The study is expected to enroll all subjects within a 2-year&#xD;
      time frame, and patients will be followed for 2 years after surgery. Subjects for whom the&#xD;
      informed consent process has been completed and have been implanted with the study product&#xD;
      will be considered enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, research staff will obtain data regarding participant demographics, injury&#xD;
      characteristics, and medical history. Pre-operatively, participants will also be assessed for&#xD;
      range of motion and grip strength and will have completed radiographs and three wrist&#xD;
      function questionnaires, the DASH, the PRWE, and the PROMIS. Surgeons will answer&#xD;
      questionnaires at the start of the study, after each surgical case, and at the end of the&#xD;
      study to provide an assessment of the repair system's utility. The quality of screw placement&#xD;
      will be graded on a newly created scale (from retrospective chart review of prior RASL&#xD;
      procedures) to measure screw trajectory and final placement. Participants will have follow&#xD;
      standard of care follow up timeline with preoperative visits at 2-, 8-, 12, 24- weeks, 1&#xD;
      year, 18 months, and 2 years. At each follow up visit, range of motion data, grip strength&#xD;
      (after 24 weeks), and questionnaires will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be reported as numbers and percentages of total for categorical data, and as mean&#xD;
      and standard deviation of the mean with 95% confidence intervals for continuous variables.&#xD;
      Ordinal data from the Likert scale surgeon questionnaire and screw placement grading scales&#xD;
      will also be analyzed using parametric statistics (1, 2). Total scores from the scale items&#xD;
      will be analyzed using the Kappa statistics. Independent sample t-tests will be used to&#xD;
      compare the mean DASH, PRWE and PROMIS scores and for time to return to work, school, and&#xD;
      sports. For secondary analysis, an analysis of variance will be completed for the DASH, PRWE&#xD;
      and PROMIS scores, range of motion data and grip strength at each follow-up time interval.&#xD;

    <description>To address the technical difficulties associated with the RASL procedure, Dr. Mel Rosenwasser developed an external over-the-top jig that in theory enables accurate and easy scapholunate-axis screw placement. The Acumed Scapholunate Repair System was designed treat patients with acute or chronic, static or dynamic scapholunate instability in the absence of significant capitolunate osteoarthritis, scapholunate ligament repair, scapholunate reduction, lunotriquetral ligament repair, lunotriquetral reduction, and carpal instability. This new Scapholunate Repair System features a targeting guide designed to enable the surgeon to reproducibly place the implant in optimal position. The implant allows physiologic intercarpal scapholunate rotation by means of a free rotation design. The procedure can forestall progressive osteoarthritis and the need for secondary salvage procedures.</description>
