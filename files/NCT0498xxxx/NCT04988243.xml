      This study is a prospective / retrospective, multicenterstudy after listing. The researchers&#xD;
      preliminarily confirmed that they could be enrolled in this study according to the diagnosis&#xD;
      of the subjects' medical history. After fully informed, they signed the informed consent, and&#xD;
      met the TAVR inclusion requirements (see the inclusion criteria for details). At the same&#xD;
      time, they registered the subjects in multiple centers. After the start of the trial, the&#xD;
      participants were enrolled in the study, All the subjects who met the inclusion criteria but&#xD;
      did not meet the discharge criteria were registered in the central registration system. The&#xD;
      patients were followed up for 30 days, 6 months and 12 months, and followed up by telephone&#xD;
      for 2, 3, 4 and 5 years.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Retrospective subjects were subjects who had completed transcatheter aortic valve replacement at the beginning of the study. Previous data such as demography and treatment of subjects before the start of the study will be realized by reviewing medical records. Follow up data not traceable to medical records and follow-up data after the start of the study, Prospective subjects were those who were undergoing or planned to undergo transcatheter aortic valve replacement at the beginning of the study. Subjects were enrolled from the beginning of the first case to one year later. The demographic, treatment and follow-up data of subjects will be collected through clinical follow-up or telephone follow-up</intervention_model_description>
