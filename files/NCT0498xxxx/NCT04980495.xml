  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open-label study is to investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability&#xD;
      of a continuous regimen of efgartigimod compared with a cyclic regimen in participants with&#xD;
      Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study details include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration will be up to 128 weeks (including screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part A (regimen comparison period) - 21 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part B (extension period) - up to 105 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visit frequency, including virtual visits, will be weekly through Week 21 and every 5&#xD;
      weeks for the remainder of the study.&#xD;
