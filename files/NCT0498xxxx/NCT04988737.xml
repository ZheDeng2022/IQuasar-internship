  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare the usability of a novel, medication-related clinical&#xD;
      decision support (CDS) application to the current standard medication administration and&#xD;
      documentation workflow. The study will occur in a simulation setting, using a manikin and&#xD;
      test patient data - no actual patients will participate. Forty clinician participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either the CDS group (who will complete simulation tasks using the CDS&#xD;
      prototype) or the Control group (who will complete simulation tasks using the standard&#xD;
      medication administration workflow).&#xD;

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>System Usability Scale (SUS) score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at the conclusion of study participation, an average of 15 minutes after the participant's start time</time_frame>
    <description>SUS is designed and validated only for first-time system users, so it will be completed by the CDS group only. SUS scores range from 0 to 100 (higher score indicates higher usability). The scores are not percentiles, but are interpreted using benchmark comparisons to industry standards.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of usability issues.</measure>
    <time_frame>Identified continuously over the duration of study participation, a cumulative average of 15 mins</time_frame>
    <description>Usability issues are defined as aspects of the system that prevent the user from accomplishing their goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. Usability issues will be identified for the CDS group only. Usability issues will be identified by a usability expert.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Single Ease Question score for each simulation task.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at the end of each of the 7 tasks (each task requires an average of 3 minutes to complete)</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;Overall, how difficult or easy did you find this task?&quot; Answers will be recorded on a 7-point Likert scale (1= &quot;very difficult&quot;; 7= &quot;very easy&quot;).</description>

    <description>Clinicians complete tasks using the CDS prototype. Briefly, the clinician scans the barcode on the syringe label immediately prior to medication administration. The scan triggers the CDS to display a dosing window with pertinent patient-specific information and/or alert(s) when necessary to prevent a medication error (ME) prior to the medication being administered. Medication data are then sent from the CDS application to the patient's anesthesia record for automatic documentation in real-time, eliminating the need to manually document the medication in the Anesthesia Information Management System (AIMS). When necessary, the CDS application generates alerts to prevent medication errors. Upon receiving an alert, the anesthesia clinician may accept the alert and revise the action that generated the alert, or override the alert and continue with the planned action.</description>
