  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examined the effect of adults' facial expressions (FEs) whilst eating raw broccoli&#xD;
      on children's acceptance and intake of a typically less preferred vegetable. Investigating&#xD;
      others' FEs in isolation (e.g., without statements about food tastiness) will improve&#xD;
      understanding of the role of FEs in modelling of eating and contribute to developing&#xD;
      strategies to help children learn pleasure from nutritious foods. Based on previous&#xD;
      literature, it was hypothesised that children's acceptance (willingness to try, and frequency&#xD;
      of taste exposures) and intake of raw broccoli would be higher after exposure to models&#xD;
      eating raw broccoli with positive FEs, compared to models consuming raw broccoli with neutral&#xD;
      FEs, or a non-food control video.&#xD;

      Research has shown that seeing positive facial expressions towards food are effective for&#xD;
      increasing children's desire to eat foods rated as disliked. However, the effect of adults'&#xD;
      positive facial expressions whilst eating a raw vegetable on children's acceptance and&#xD;
      consumption of nutritious foods that are less preferred (e.g., vegetables) remains to be&#xD;
      established. This study examined the effect of unfamiliar adult models' facial expressions&#xD;
      eating raw broccoli on children's acceptance and consumption of raw broccoli. Children aged&#xD;
      4-6-year-olds were randomised to watch a video of unfamiliar adult models eating raw broccoli&#xD;
      with a positive or neutral facial expression, or a non-food control video. Children's&#xD;
      acceptance (willingness to try and frequency of taste exposures) and consumption of raw&#xD;
      broccoli was assessed. Data about parent and child characteristics was provided by parents.&#xD;
