  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current treatments for patients with drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms&#xD;
      (DRESS) include supportive care, steroids and cyclosporine. No randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT) exists in comparing these treatments and all available literature comes in the form of&#xD;
      case reports and case series. These two treatments are considered standard of care and this&#xD;
      trial seeks only to compare outcomes of DRESS between these two therapies. No additional&#xD;
      labs, therapies or procedures will be used apart from those that are routinely done for&#xD;
      patients with this diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a pilot study to determine efficacy of the two therapies with particular&#xD;
      endpoints in mind so that the investigators can study the safety of these two therapies in&#xD;
      patients with DRESS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data suggests a potential benefit for adults with DRESS using either steroids or cyclosporine&#xD;
      but the investigators are seeking a comparison of efficacy of these two therapies. The study&#xD;
      population will include adults with a Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reaction&#xD;
      (RegiSCAR) score of greater than 4 (i.e. a likely diagnosis of DRESS). The investigators will&#xD;
      exclude patients with sepsis, active Hepatitis B or C, active tuberculosis, a documented&#xD;
      allergy to steroids or cyclosporine, and patients with an estimated glomerular filtration&#xD;
      rate (eGFR) &lt; 30 (unless on dialysis in which case the participants will be included).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Current treatments for patients with drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms&#xD;
      (DRESS) include supportive care, steroids, cyclosporine and to a lesser extent, intravenous&#xD;
      immunoglobulin (IVIG). Regarding IVIG, a recent case series suggests no improved benefit in&#xD;
      adults. No randomized controlled trial (RCT) exists in comparing these treatments and all&#xD;
      available literature comes in the form of case reports and case series. These two treatments&#xD;
      are considered standard of care and this trial seeks only to compare outcomes of DRESS&#xD;
      between these two therapies. No additional labs, therapies or procedures will be used apart&#xD;
      from those that are routinely done for patients with this diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a pilot study to determine efficacy of the two therapies with particular&#xD;
      endpoints in mind so that the investigators can study the safety of these two therapies in&#xD;
      patients with DRESS. Hopefully, this study will allow the investigators to better power a&#xD;
      full prospective trial in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a potentially life-threatening severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR) with&#xD;
      significant potential morbidity. Data suggests a potential benefit for adults with DRESS&#xD;
      using either steroids or cyclosporine but the investigators are seeking a comparison of&#xD;
      efficacy of these two therapies. The study population will include adults with a Registry of&#xD;
      Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reaction (RegiSCAR) score of greater than 4 (i.e. a likely diagnosis&#xD;
      of DRESS). The investigators will exclude patients with sepsis, active Hepatitis B or C,&#xD;
      active tuberculosis, a documented allergy to steroids or cyclosporine, and patients with an&#xD;
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 30 (unless on dialysis in which case the&#xD;
      participants will be included).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized using a randomization protocol at all sites. Primary&#xD;
      endpoints will include percentage of participants with complete or near complete resolution&#xD;
      of organ involvement as well as erythema resolution at day 7 and day 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. fever presence, resolution of facial edema, resolution of pruritus, lymphadenopathy,&#xD;
           eosinophil count at days 7 and 30&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. days of hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. mortality at days 7, 30 and 90&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. viral reactivation at days 30, 60 and 90&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. those with autoimmune development by day 30 and day 90&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 30 day re-admission rate.&#xD;
