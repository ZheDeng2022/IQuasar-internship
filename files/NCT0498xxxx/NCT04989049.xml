      Oral ulcerations are usually reported with pain and discomfort while eating and drinking at&#xD;
      times while talking. Ulcers are usually described as erythematous surroundings, raised&#xD;
      margins, with yellowish-white necrotic pseudomembranous centre. Healing process of ulcers&#xD;
      usually starts nearly after 24-48 h of its onset. The initial inflammatory stage is enriched&#xD;
      by leukocytes, after 48 hours of injury, mature monocytes in connective tissue turn into&#xD;
      macrophages which until day 3 tend to increase in numbers. Oral ulcers are one of the&#xD;
      commonest lesions of oral cavity; around 83.6% people have suffered from the ulcers.&#xD;
      Frequency of traumatic ulcers fluctuates from 3 to 34% around the globe. Traumatic ulcers are&#xD;
      usually caused by mechanical irritaation. Various studies have been conducted till date for&#xD;
      the treatment of oral ulcers such as anti-inflammatory gels, propolis extract gel, topical&#xD;
      steroids such as triamcinolone acetonide paste and silver nanoparticle gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Folic acid (vitamin b9) belongs to the water soluble class of vitamins called B-complex. It&#xD;
      is an essential component of metabolic pathways of carbohydrates, fats and proteins which are&#xD;
      important compounds in various functions such as cardiovascular and nervous system. This&#xD;
      vitamin is also important for DNA methylation and biosynthesis of nucleotide. Dietary foliate&#xD;
      deficiency is a problem of developing country. Folic acid daily requirement of an adult is&#xD;
      400 mg/day whereas during pregnancy it's required up to 600mg and in nursing mother daily&#xD;
      required dosage of foliate is 500mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference between folic acid and foliate is that the foliate is a natural form which is&#xD;
      found in mushrooms, green leafy vegetables and livers whereas folic acid is synthetically&#xD;
      produced and is used to fortify processed foods and supplements in a fully reduced&#xD;
      biologically active form dihydrofolate reductase. Humans lack the enzyme which is required to&#xD;
      produce foliate that is why they depend on dietary and supplemental form of this essential&#xD;
      vitamin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective while treating the ulcers is to reduce the discomfort and accelerate healing.&#xD;
      Thus the purpose of the study is to find out therapeutic role of topical folic acid on oral&#xD;
      ulcerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients falling in the inclusion criteria will be asked to participate in the study, consent&#xD;
      will be obtained from the patients. Demographic feature, history and examination will be&#xD;
      noted on a research questionnaire. After examination patients will be given topical folic&#xD;
      acid in tablet form to be applied by themselves twice a day on ulcers. Patients will be asked&#xD;
      to visit the dental out patients department of oral medicine at Isra University Hyderabad on&#xD;
      7th day for follow up. Specific questions will be asked from the patients and examination&#xD;
      will be done on the day of follow, the information will be recorded on a follow up form.&#xD;
