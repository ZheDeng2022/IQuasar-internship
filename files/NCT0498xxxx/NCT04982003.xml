  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience difficulty with gait, postural instability,&#xD;
      and lack of movement coordination and rhythmic timing. Non-motor functions affected by PD&#xD;
      include time perception, feelings of apathy, depression, decreased self-efficacy, and&#xD;
      decrease self-reported quality of life. There is currently a lack of information on how a&#xD;
      therapeutic drumming class that uses whole-body large-amplitude movements to music would&#xD;
      impact these motor and non-motor impairments in individuals with PD. The primary purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to assess the feasibility of a 10-week whole-body drumming class to music&#xD;
      specifically selected for its rhythmic structure, and effects on movement rhythm and time&#xD;
      perception in individuals with PD. The secondary purpose is to assess the effects of the&#xD;
      drumming class on apathy, depression, self-efficacy and health-related quality of life.&#xD;
      Participants will be included if they have a diagnosis of PD and are able to move for an hour&#xD;
      with rests, either standing or seated. Participants are tested before and after the class&#xD;
      series and one month following.&#xD;
