  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidural anaesthesia involves the administration of numbing medication (local anaesthetics)&#xD;
      close to the spinal canal, and is regarded as the best method for providing pain relief&#xD;
      during labour and childbirth. The use of ultrasound to guide epidural insertion and placement&#xD;
      has been shown to improve pain relief and reduce the risk of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, after identifying the desired needle insertion site via ultrasound, current practice&#xD;
      involves demarcating the insertion site using marker pens, which is time-consuming,&#xD;
      inaccurate, and may be inadvertently removed by skin sterilisation. Furthermore, the desired&#xD;
      needle angulation determined by ultrasound cannot be accurately measured and maintained&#xD;
      during the epidural procedure. Both issues limit the benefits of using ultrasound to guide&#xD;
      the epidural procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these issues, the investigators developed a Position and Angular Marking System&#xD;
      (PAMS) that attaches on to the ultrasound probe. When the desired insertion site is&#xD;
      identified by ultrasound, the doctor gently presses PAMS into the patient's back to create&#xD;
      skin indentations demarcating the needle insertion point. These indentations are not affected&#xD;
      by skin sterilisation, and may improve accuracy and reduce the time taken to perform the&#xD;
      epidural procedure. Next, the angle between the ultrasound probe and the patient's back can&#xD;
      be measured using PAMS, and this angle can be maintained using a needle guide during the&#xD;
      epidural procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this randomised study is to evaluate the usability of PAMS and to identify&#xD;
      areas for further improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve up to 10 healthy simulated patients, and up to 30 volunteer&#xD;
      ultrasound operators. After undergoing a standardised training session with a mannequin, the&#xD;
      ultrasound operators will be randomly assigned to perform skin marking on the simulated&#xD;
      patients as though they are performing an ultrasound-guided epidural anaesthesia procedure&#xD;
      (no needle puncture will be made) using either PAMS, or standard clinical practice with&#xD;
      marker pens. After completing the procedure, the ultrasound operators will cross over and&#xD;
      perform the procedure again using either PAMS or standard clinical practice with marker pens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the ultrasound operators and simulated patients will be asked to complete satisfaction&#xD;
      and usability surveys regarding their experience with the procedures.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The volunteer ultrasound operators are women's anaesthesiologists trained in the use of&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided neuraxial procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulated patients are healthy volunteers from other departments, without spine&#xD;
      abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultrasound operators will be asked to complete a questionnaire regarding your prior&#xD;
      experience with neuraxial ultrasonography and undergo structured training on the use of PAMS&#xD;
      using a mannequin. Next, they will be asked to perform the following two procedures (the&#xD;
      order at which they will perform the procedures will be randomised):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ultrasound scan using PAMS&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After attaching PAMS to the ultrasound probe, they will perform a lumbar ultrasound&#xD;
                scan on a simulated patient to identify the desired needle insertion site and&#xD;
                gently press PAMS into the simulated patient's back to create skin indentations&#xD;
                demarcating the desired needle insertion site.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Next, adjust the angulation of the ultrasound probe to optimise the image of the&#xD;
                simulated patient's lumbar spine, and read the angle between the ultrasound probe&#xD;
                and patient's back off a graduated scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Remove the ultrasound probe, and position the needle-insertion guide corresponding&#xD;
                to the skin indentations. Needle angulation can be simulated by mounting a blunt&#xD;
                needle on to the insertion guide.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Finally, they will be asked to complete a usability questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ultrasound scan without PAMS (standard clinical practice)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Perform a lumbar ultrasound scan to identify the desired needle insertion site,&#xD;
                followed by demarcation using skin markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Next, adjust the angulation of the ultrasound probe to optimise the image of the&#xD;
                simulated patient's lumbar spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Remove the ultrasound probe and simulate needle insertion by touching the tip of a&#xD;
                blunt needle to the patient's back, at the desired angle.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Finally, they will then be asked to complete a usability questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both procedures are non-invasive (i.e. no skin punctures will be made). No follow up is&#xD;
      required for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No new research medications are involved in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, video recordings may be made of the procedures. Any video or ultrasound images&#xD;
      obtained during the course of this study will be stored and analysed only for the purposes of&#xD;
      this study for a period not exceeding 7 years, and will be destroyed after completion of the&#xD;
      study. Technical data such as the scanning duration and success rate will also be documented.&#xD;
