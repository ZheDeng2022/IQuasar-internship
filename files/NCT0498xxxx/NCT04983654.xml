  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle Cell Disease is the most frequent genetic disease in the world (representing one birth&#xD;
      over 1900, in France). The polymerization of the abnormal hemoglobin (i.e., HbS) when&#xD;
      deoxygenated is at the origin of a mechanical distortion of red blood cells (RBC) into a&#xD;
      crescent-like shape. Sickled RBCs are very fragile and rigid, which lead patients to have&#xD;
      severe anemia and to develop frequent and repeated painful vaso-occlusive crises.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the repetition of sickling-unsickling cycles causes irreversible damages to the&#xD;
      RBCs, which shorten their half-life. Accumulation of free hemoglobin and heme in the plasma&#xD;
      is involved in blood vessels lesions in both the macro- and micro- circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resulting vascular dysfunction could explain why limb ulcers are 10 fold more frequent in&#xD;
      patients with sickle cell disease compared to the general population and may happen at a&#xD;
      younger age. Limb ulcers induce significant morbidity (delay of healing between 9 and 26&#xD;
      weeks in the french cohort), and are associated to significant pain (needing opioid&#xD;
      pain-killer) and increase the risk of infection. Cost of care is also increased. Moreover,&#xD;
      ulcers induce missed school and work days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on cutaneous microcirculation and ulcers physiopathology in patients with sickle cell&#xD;
      disease are scarce. We want to realise a microcirculatory and neurological functional study&#xD;
      of patients with with and without ulcers and a characterization of biomarkers present in the&#xD;
      blood or in the wound fluid which can participate to ulcers physiopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure healing, adapted therapeutics are essential. Several strategies are proposed such&#xD;
      as: lifestyle measures (venous compression, lower limb elevation, rest), dressings,&#xD;
      hyperbaric oxygenotherapy (also used in diabetic ulcers). The project is devoted to study the&#xD;
      mechanisms involved in leg ulcers and the effects of therapeutical/behavioral strategies.&#xD;
