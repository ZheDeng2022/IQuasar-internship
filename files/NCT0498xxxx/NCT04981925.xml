  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to better understand how Mindfulness-based Stress&#xD;
      Reduction (MBSR) is the most helpful in terms of management of chronic pain symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studies hypothesis is that an Interventional Response Phenotyping study (light&#xD;
      phenotyping) can identify individuals with different underlying mechanisms for their pain who&#xD;
      thus respond differentially to evidence-based interventions for chronic pain disorders.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants enrolled in this study will receive 8 weeks of MBSR therapy and complete surveys&#xD;
      at various time points pre-treatment - post treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>PROMIS physical function 6b</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks (after MSBR)</time_frame>
    <description>Physical Function 6b questionnaire will assess self-reported capability with 6 qualitatively scaled questions ranked on a 5-point scale, from &quot;without any difficulty&quot; to &quot;unable to do&quot; or &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;cannot do.&quot; The minimum raw summed score is 6 and the maximum score is 30. Lower scores suggest better outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-treatment), 8 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PCS is a 13-item questionnaire that inquires about thoughts and feelings a patient experiences when in pain. Responses are recorded on a 5-point Likert scale (&quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;all the time&quot;). A total score is yielded ranging from 0-52. Higher score is associated with worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ)-8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks (after MSBR)</time_frame>
    <description>CPAQ-8 is an 8-item questionnaire with a score range 0-48 with higher scores indicating better status. Change score is computed by subtracting baseline CPAQ-8 score from score at time of reassessment. Improvement is indicated by change scores with positive values.</description>

Participants will also be asked to practice daily formal mindfulness at home using assigned audio recordings of 30-45 minute guided mindfulness exercises. Participants will complete surveys during treatment as well as after treatment and then at 2 months follow-up.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A form of chronic pain disorder other than chronic lower back pain (cLBP) - examples&#xD;
             include chronic pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, neuropathy,&#xD;
             neuralgia, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Forms of cLBP not allowed in Back Pain Consortium Research Program Study Mechanistic&#xD;
             Research Center(sacroiliitis or a spondyloarthropathy, e.g. ankylosing spondylitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Definition of chronic pain suggested by the 2014 NIH Pain Consortium, i.e. pain&#xD;
             present at least six months, and present more than half of those days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals must have a pain interference score of â‰¥60 on Patient-Reported Outcomes&#xD;
             Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain Interference. The normal population mean&#xD;
             for pain interference is 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to speak and write English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Visual or hearing difficulties that would preclude participation&#xD;

          -  Chronic pain from cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe psychiatric disorders that in the opinion of the investigative team would&#xD;
             interfere with participation in the study. This includes any active suicidal ideations&#xD;
             or history of suicide attempts, because of safety issues concerning administering&#xD;
             duloxetine to such individuals&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current severe substance use disorder (mild or moderate substance use that is being&#xD;
             managed / treated will be accepted)&#xD;
