  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are designing and rigorously evaluating the first Virtual Reality-therapy&#xD;
      program for people with dementia (PwD) living at home, administered by their informal&#xD;
      caregivers (family/friends). Virtual Reality (VR) presents a unique opportunity to transport&#xD;
      people to a world outside of their confined spaces, into calming and stimulating settings&#xD;
      (lush forest, peaceful beach, cheerful playground). Virtual Reality-therapy is a&#xD;
      non-pharmacological approach that uses VR &quot;experiences'' to stimulate brain function, improve&#xD;
      psychological health, engage, and relax. It has potential to reduce symptoms of dementia such&#xD;
      as apathy, depression, loneliness, sundowning, and the use of sedating medications with known&#xD;
      negative side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers of PwD are more likely to feel worried, tired, overwhelmed, and depressed than&#xD;
      non-PwD caregivers. Symptoms of dementia and caregiver stress often result in early&#xD;
      institutionalization of PwD; management of challenging symptoms may help PwD remain in their&#xD;
      homes for longer while improving their, and their caregivers', Quality of Life (QoL).&#xD;
      Addressing the wellbeing of caregivers is an often overlooked, yet integral part of&#xD;
      interventions for PwD. It ensures intervention feasibility but also has a distinct impact on&#xD;
      our system, reducing healthcare needs of caregivers and allowing them to continue&#xD;
      contributing as caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study the investigators will train and assist caregivers to conduct Virtual&#xD;
      Reality-therapy with their loved-ones at home using two devices: a head-mounted display and a&#xD;
      tablet. This pilot study will assess: (1) the acceptability of the VR devices (2) feasibility&#xD;
      of the study methods, (3) the impact of VR-therapy on PwD and caregiver outcomes. These&#xD;
      findings will be used to inform a future randomized controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot trial will be a mixed-methods, parallel arm RCT with a target total recruitment of&#xD;
      30 participants (15 dyads of PwD and caregivers). Each dyad will participate in the study for&#xD;
      a total of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, the research coordinator will set up a time convenient to&#xD;
      both parties (the researcher and participant dyad) to conduct a baseline semi-structured&#xD;
      interview that collects demographics as well as a questionnaire consisting of validated&#xD;
      instruments on the outcome measures of interest (e.g. quality of life, apathy, etc.) Once&#xD;
      baselines data collection is complete, the dyad will be randomized into one of two study&#xD;
      arms, determining which VR technology they will be using first: (A) HMD first (immersive VR),&#xD;
      or (B) Tablet first (non-immersive VR). Those assigned to Group A will use the HMD for weeks&#xD;
      1-2 and the tablet for weeks 3-4. Those assigned to Group B will use the tablet for weeks 1-2&#xD;
      and the HMD for weeks 3-4. After randomization, the participants, caregivers, and research&#xD;
      personnel will not be blind to treatment allocation given the nature of the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of this randomized crossover design include the: (1) ability to compare the&#xD;
      outcomes between immersive VR (HMD system) and non-immersive VR (tablet-only system) where&#xD;
      each dyad serves as their own control, reducing the effects of inter-individual variability&#xD;
      or disease progression, (2) opportunity for all participants to use the VR HMD, and (3)&#xD;
      ability to explore whether the intervention &quot;washes-out&quot; soon after each therapy period or if&#xD;
      it has a carryover effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irrespective of experimental arm (Group A or Group B), the intervention consists of therapy&#xD;
      sessions administered five times per week, at times agreeable to the dyad, for a total of 120&#xD;
      minutes per week (24 minutes per viewing, 5 times per week). Prior to each session, the&#xD;
      caregiver-participant will commence video-recording via the video-conferencing application&#xD;
      (as taught during the training session). Once the recording is confirmed, the participants&#xD;
      may start their session. During each session, PwD should be seated in a comfortable and&#xD;
      secure chair of their choice. Caregiver-participants will help PwD equip the device and&#xD;
      launch the films. The participant dyad will be able to select from a wide range of films&#xD;
      available on each device. Once the selected film starts to play, the caregiver-participant&#xD;
      will be seated nearby to ensure the safety of the PwD and to jointly experience VR. Once the&#xD;
      dyad has finished using VR and their discussions/interactions about VR have concluded, the&#xD;
      caregiver-participant may stop the video recording. The video recording will be stored&#xD;
      securely automatically. Each member of the study dyad will then complete a personal&#xD;
      reflection about the study session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the video-recording (used to analyze participant interaction and conduct&#xD;
      conversation analysis) some data collection tools are meant to be filled in after each&#xD;
      session. The remaining data is collected via a structured questionnaire containing validated&#xD;
      instruments and open-ended questions filled in at Baseline (T0), at the end of Weeks 1-2&#xD;
      (T1), and at the end of Weeks 3-4 (T2), to gather experiences using both the VR and tablet&#xD;
      devices, and potential impact on clinical outcomes. The usability of each VR technology will&#xD;
      be assessed at the end of T1 and T2.&#xD;

The CarerQoL-7D is a 7-item questionnaire employing 3-point Likert scales that provides a comprehensive description of the caregiving situation. The CarerQoL-VAS is a VAS ranging from 0-10 that provides a valuation of informal care in terms of well-being. The CarerQoL-VAS is an optional addition to the CarerQoL-7D and is not used when calculating scores. Calculated QoL scores range from 0-100 where higher scores indicate better caregiving situations.</description>

The PAC is a 9-item questionnaire that measures feelings of reward in Alzheimer's caregiving and has two subcomponents: self affirmation and outlook on life. Total scores range from 9-45 where higher scores indicate greater feelings of caregiver reward.</description>

At the beginning of T2 (weeks 3 &amp; 4), they will then be trained to use the tablet-system, which will be used for the duration of T2. At the completion of T2, the dyad will again complete the same standardized questionnaires and will participate in a semi-structured interview about their experiences. All throughout T1 and T2, the participant dyad will complete personal reflections each instance a session occurs (5 sessions/week). Each session is expected to include 24 minutes of VR exposure. Each session throughout T1 and T2 is to be video-recorded by the caregiver-participant so that reactions and interactions can later be analyzed.</description>
