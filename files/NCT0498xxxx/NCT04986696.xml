  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center phase I, first-in-human, dose escalation study of FLASH therapy in&#xD;
      patients with metastases of melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is based on escalating single doses of FLASH therapy administered to skin melanoma&#xD;
      metastases using the Mobetron® with high dose rate (HDR) functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate a dose escalation of high dose rate radiotherapy (FLASH&#xD;
      therapy) as single dose treatment for skin melanoma metastases that progress locally despite&#xD;
      systemic treatments. Melanoma is a typically radio-resistant tumor type, which can justify&#xD;
      such a dose escalation with a new type of radiotherapy that appears much better tolerated&#xD;
      than conventional radiotherapy.&#xD;
