      Cross over randomised exposure response experimental study in 10 healthy children and&#xD;
      adolescents, to measure the effects of interrupting prolonged sitting with brief standing&#xD;
      physical activity interventions on their physical and cognitive performance, mobility, health&#xD;
      and wellbeing. The study will assess the extent of the immediate and short-term effects of&#xD;
      interrupting sitting with brief moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) breaks compared to&#xD;
      a sitting only condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary analysis and metabolic and cognitive tests after acute exercise will be performed on&#xD;
      the participants to compare the FreeStyle Libre responses between those with and without&#xD;
      disabilities.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Executive Functioning - Eriksen Flanker Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Maximum of two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The main outcome will be change in executive functioning from the start to the end of the session using the Eriksen Flanker Task. The test measures selective attention and executive control and measures speed (milliseconds) and accuracy (number of responses correct). This will be performed before the oral glucose tolerance test and again at the end of each session.</description>

    <measure>Working Memory - WISC Digit Span</measure>
    <time_frame>Maximum of two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) Digit Span will test attention and working memory. The total score is calculated by the number of correct responses. This will be performed before the oral glucose tolerance test and again at the end of each session.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Maximum of two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>On arrival an OGTT, simulating insulin and glucose response comparable to that following a meal will be given. Children will follow an identical protocol for OGTT during all conditions. Children will be asked to fast the night before, for 10 hours prior to the test. They will arrive fasted, have a baseline glucose reading taken and will be given the OGTT, followed by sit only or sit in addition to physical activity breaks regimens. For the OGTT the stimulus is 1.75g/kg body weight of glucose solution. A Freestyle Libre glucose monitoring system will be placed on the participants' arm and glucose readings will be monitored at timed intervals.</description>
