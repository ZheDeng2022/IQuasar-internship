  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aerobic exercise has been shown to trigger a variety of body responses which then trigger&#xD;
      physiological adaptations. One of the physiological adaptations that occur is an increase in&#xD;
      mitochondrial biogenesis. Mitochondria are organelles in cells that play a role in providing&#xD;
      energy. An increase in the number of mitochondria will increase the supply of energy for&#xD;
      muscle cell contraction, so that muscles do not get tired easily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitochondrial biogenesis is known to be regulated by Peroxisome proliferator-activated&#xD;
      receptor gamma co-activator-1 alpha (PGC-1Î±), by inducing transcription of genes encoded by&#xD;
      the nucleus and mitochondria. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1&#xD;
      alpha is a protein which encoded by the PPARGC1A gene. PPARGC1A gene expression itself can be&#xD;
      influenced by microRNA, a short non-coding RNA that can regulate gene expression by&#xD;
      suppressing or degrading the target gene. In vitro studies show that PPARGC1A gene is a&#xD;
      direct gene target of microRNA (miR)-23a.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In human studies, aerobic exercise has been shown to reduce miR-23a levels in human muscles&#xD;
      immediately after exercise. Another study found an increase in muscle PGC-1 alpha levels&#xD;
      after exercise. In addition to being detectable in muscle, both miR-23a and PGC-1 alpha can&#xD;
      be measured in blood plasma. However, whether exercise can reduce miR-23a levels while&#xD;
      increasing PGC-1 alpha levels in circulation, still needs further research. Therefore, this&#xD;
      study aims to examine whether aerobic exercise will reduce miR-23a levels and PGC-1 alpha&#xD;
      levels in plasma. In addition, this study will also compare whether exercise intensity&#xD;
      affects the expression of miR-23a and PGC-1 alpha.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, measurements will be made on blood plasma to reduce the level of invasiveness.&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to come to the laboratory three times. The first meeting consisted of&#xD;
      an examination, while in the second and third meetings the subjects would be asked to run at&#xD;
      a moderate or high intensity. Blood sampling will be done before and after exercise.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized cross-over trial with a pre and post intervention measurement. In&#xD;
      general, each subject will be asked to run with moderate and vigorous intensity in a random&#xD;
      order. Healthy males aged 18-25 were recruited through announcements on social media.&#xD;
      Subjects who are willing to join are asked to fill out a form via google forms. Subjects who&#xD;
      meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be asked to come to the laboratory. At the&#xD;
      first meeting, participants will be examined to ensure the subject meets the criteria. The&#xD;
      examinations conducted including measurement of body weight, body height, blood pressure,&#xD;
      lung function, and electrocardiography. Body weight will be measured using a digital weight&#xD;
      scale, while body height will be measured three times using a stadiometer. For measuring the&#xD;
      a blood pressure, the subject was asked to lie down for at least 5 minutes. Blood pressure&#xD;
      will be measured three times on the right arm using the Omron digital sphygmomanometer. Lung&#xD;
      function examination including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1&#xD;
      second (FEV1) and maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) will be measured using a spirometer.&#xD;
      Following the standard procedure from American Thoracic Society/ European Respiratory Society&#xD;
      regarding spirometry examination, measurements will be performed in an upright sitting&#xD;
      position. Measurement of FVC and FEV1 will be performed at least three times, while MVV will&#xD;
      be performed at least twice to obtain reliable and acceptable results. Only healthy subject&#xD;
      will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 48 hours to 14 days after the first meeting, subjects will be asked to come to the&#xD;
      second and third meetings to do moderate or high intensity exercise in randomized order.&#xD;
      Before and after exercise, 3 ml of blood will be drawn from the cubital vein and put in an&#xD;
      Ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) tube to collect the plasma. The plasma will then be&#xD;
      centrifuged to separate the plasma from the blood cells. Plasma is stored in the freezer -80&#xD;
      degrees celsius until it will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microRNA levels before and after exercise will be measured using real time polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction (qPCR). In general, RNA extraction will be conduct using the plasma extraction&#xD;
      kit, following by complement DNA synthesis and qPCR. Normalization will be conduct by adding&#xD;
      3.5 micro liters of cel-miR-39 spike in control to each sample. Quantification of the&#xD;
      microRNA level will be expressed as 2-[(CT microRNA)-(CT cel-miR-39)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normality test will be performed using Shapiro-Wilk test. If the data is normally&#xD;
      distributed, the statistical test of the measurement results before and after exercise at&#xD;
      both intensities will be analyzed using independent t-test. Meanwhile, if the data is not&#xD;
      normally distributed, statistical analysis will be done using Mann Whitney test.&#xD;
