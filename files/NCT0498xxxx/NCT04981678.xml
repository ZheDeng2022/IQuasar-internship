  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is limited guidance on the optimal management of buprenorphine perioperatively and both&#xD;
      buprenorphine discontinuation and continuation are acceptable standards of care. However,&#xD;
      there is the risk for opioid cravings and relapse when buprenorphine is discontinued.&#xD;
      Conversely, there is the risk of inadequate pain control necessitating opioid escalation in&#xD;
      when buprenorphine is continued. Preliminary clinical observations support buprenorphine&#xD;
      continuation at low analgesic doses (8mg) can adequately facilitate postoperative pain&#xD;
      management without interrupting opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment, however to date, no&#xD;
      prospective trial has investigated this treatment strategy in comparison to buprenorphine&#xD;
      discontinuation. Since optimal perioperative dosing strategies remain unknown, the purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to investigate if buprenorphine continuation at analgesic dosing is superior to&#xD;
      buprenorphine discontinuation in individuals presenting for elective surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether buprenorphine continuation at analgesic&#xD;
      dosing is superior to buprenorphine discontinuation in individuals presenting for elective&#xD;
      surgery. Adults scheduled for elective surgery who are taking â‰¥8mg buprenorphine for OUD&#xD;
      treatment will be eligible for this study. Enrolled participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either a reduced analgesic dose of buprenorphine (8mg) or to discontinue&#xD;
      buprenorphine on the day of surgery until postsurgical pain subsides and they can be&#xD;
      transitioned to their full buprenorphine dose. The investigators hypothesize there will be a&#xD;
      clinically significant increase in pain scores when buprenorphine is discontinued compared to&#xD;
      when it is continued at a lower analgesic dose. Clinical significance will be defined as&#xD;
      composite pain scores of greater than 20% between groups. The investigators also hypothesize&#xD;
      that opioid consumption, opioid dispensing and OUD related withdrawal symptoms will be&#xD;
      greater with buprenorphine discontinuation compared to low-dose continuation.&#xD;
