    <textblock>
      The principal aim of this study was to adapt pain neuroscience education to dyspnea, Dyspnea&#xD;
      Neuroscience Education (DNE), and measure its effect on dyspnea perception, physica l&#xD;
      activity level, disability, quality of life and ventilatory and functional capacity through a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial. The secondary objectives were to evaluate its feasibility and&#xD;
      its effect on emotional state (anxiety and depression), medical atten dance, number of&#xD;
      exacerbations and the willingness to exercise.&#xD;
