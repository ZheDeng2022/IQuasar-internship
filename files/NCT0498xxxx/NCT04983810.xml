  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part, phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, PGx, and efficacy of fadraciclib administered orally BID.&#xD;
      This study consists of Phase 1 and Phase 2 components in subjects with advanced solid tumors&#xD;
      and lymphoma who have progressed despite having standard therapy or for which no standard&#xD;
      therapy exists.&#xD;

      confirmed advanced solid tumors or lymphoma, who have failed all standard therapies or for&#xD;
      whom standard therapy does not exist, into 8 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Endometrial or Ovarian cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Biliary tract cancer&#xD;

&#xD;
      Group 5: B-cell lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 6: T-cell lymphoma (CTCL and PTCL)&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Diseases that significantly affect GI absorption of fadraciclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects who have impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Presence of active chronic inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's&#xD;
             disease) or GI perforation within 6 months of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Presence of an active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Presence of known history of human immunodeficiency virus-1/2 with uncontrolled viral&#xD;
