  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to study the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      mRNA-engineered anti-Mesothelin (MESO) Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell (CAR-T cells) therapy&#xD;
      in patients with mesothelin expression-positive, advanced solid tumors that have failed at&#xD;
      least first-line or second-line therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase I study is being conducted to establish safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of intravenous (IV) mRNA electroporated fully-humanized anti-MESO re-directed&#xD;
      autologous T cell administration in patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will adopt the &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation design exploring two doses of 1×109 and 3×109.&#xD;
      The administration is planned to infuse 3 times a week for 2 consecutive weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • The subjects will receive a total dose of 1x109 RNA transduced anti-MESO CAR-T cells in the&#xD;
      first week, following lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2/day and&#xD;
      fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day given over 3 days by intravenous infusion. If there is no obvious&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) after the first week of infusion, three times consecutive&#xD;
      infusions of 1x109 anti-MESO CAR-T cells each time is planned in the second week. Each&#xD;
      subject needs to be observed for at least 2 weeks (14 days) after completing the last&#xD;
      infusion. Lymphodepleting chemotherapy will not be repeated prior to additional infusions of&#xD;
      anti-MESO CAR-T cells.&#xD;

    <description>The subjects in this arm will receive Cyclophosphamide 300mg/m2/d and Fludarabine 30mg/m2/d from day-4 to day-2. Subjects will be treated with six administrations of anti-MESO CAR-T cells three times weekly (Monday-Wednesday-Friday) for two weeks. In the first week, total 1×109 or 3×109 will be infused, the second week is to plan three times consecutive infusions of 1x109 or 3×109 anti-MESO CAR-T cells each time.&#xD;
Subjects will be enrolled serially. For subject safety, the preceding subject must have completed therapy and be 28 days from their last infusion before the next subject can be treated.&#xD;
