  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#xD;
      CoV-2), an emerging coronavirus, which has already infected 192 million people with a case&#xD;
      fatality rate close to 2%. About 5% of patients infected with SARS CoV-2 have a critical form&#xD;
      with organ failure. Among critical patients admitted to intensive care, about 70% of them&#xD;
      will require ventilatory assistance by invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) with a mortality&#xD;
      rate of 35% and a median MV duration of 12 days. The most severe lung damage resulting from&#xD;
      SARS CoV-2 infection is the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The virus infects&#xD;
      alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells leading to an activation of&#xD;
      endothelium, hypercoagulability and thrombosis of pulmonary capillaries. This results in&#xD;
      abnormal ventilation / perfusion ratios and profound hypoxemia. To date, the therapeutic&#xD;
      management of severe SARS CoV-2 pneumonia lay on the early use of corticosteroids and&#xD;
      Interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist, which both reduce the need of MV and mortality. The&#xD;
      risk factors of death in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) are: advanced age, severe obesity,&#xD;
      coronary heart disease, active cancer, severe hypoxemia, and hepatic and renal failure on&#xD;
      admission. Among MV patients, the death rate is doubled in those with both reduced&#xD;
      thoracopulmonary compliance and elevated D-dimer levels. Patients with severe alveolar damage&#xD;
      are at risk of progressing towards irreversible pulmonary fibrosis, the incidence of which&#xD;
      still remain unknown. The diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis is based on histology but there are&#xD;
      some non-invasive alternative methods (serum or bronchoalveolar biomarkers, chest CT scan).&#xD;
      We aim to assess the incidence of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with severe SARS CoV-2&#xD;
      related pneumonia. We will investigate the prognostic impact of fibrosis on mortality and the&#xD;
      number of days alive free from MV at Day 90. Finally, we aim to identify risk factors of&#xD;
      fibrosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medical charts of patients admitted at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the European Hospital&#xD;
      of Marseille between March 2020 and June 2021 will be collected retrospectively using&#xD;
      electronic database. Data collected will focus on demography, clinical variables, biological&#xD;
      analyses, lung biopsies, and chest CT scans performed during the hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our routine protocol for COVID-19 management follows the &quot;Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)&#xD;
      Treatment Guidelines&quot; including the early use of corticosteroids (Dexamethasone) and IL-6&#xD;
      receptor antagonist (Tocilizumab). Additionally, we routinely perform, on a weekly basis,&#xD;
      measurements of SARS CoV-2 viral load by PCR, SARS CoV-2 antibodies production, and&#xD;
      biomarkers of fibrosis including hyaluronic acid (HA) and amino-terminal type I (PINP) and&#xD;
      type III (PIIINP) peptides of procollagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aim to determine the proportion of patients encountering non-invasive&#xD;
      criteria of pulmonary fibrosis as defined by either typical CT scan patterns (reticulation&#xD;
      and/or bronchiectasia), or increased serum concentration of PIIINP above 16 µg/L, or&#xD;
      increased bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) concentration of PIIINP above 9 µg/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A definitive diagnosis of lung fibrosis will be established according to lung pathology&#xD;
      findings in patients for whom a lung biopsy have been performed during the hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis will be compared with those without fibrosis,&#xD;
      both in the population of mechanically ventilated patients and in those remained&#xD;
      spontaneously breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-point will be the number of days alive and free from the ventilator&#xD;
      (ventilator-free days) at Day 90. The others outcomes of interest will be the duration of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, the duration of ICU stay, the ICU mortality, the in-hospital&#xD;
      mortality, the Day 28 mortality, and the Day 90 mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study also aims to determine the risk factors of pulmonary fibrosis occurence,&#xD;
      focusing on mechanical ventilatory settings, daily dose of corticosteroids, and the occurence&#xD;
      of nosocomial pneumonia with special attention to lung reactivation of herpesviridae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the relation between antibodies production and viral clearance (defined as the time&#xD;
      to the first negative SARS CoV-2 PCR) or ICU survival will be investigated.&#xD;
