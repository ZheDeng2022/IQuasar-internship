  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a common headache disorder and affects 1 in 5 adults during their lifetime. It is&#xD;
      a disorder which leads to significantly impaired quality of life, absence from work, loss of&#xD;
      productivity in workplace and reduced vitality in social functioning. One of the important&#xD;
      cornerstones in the management of migraine is the maintenance of a good headache diary. A&#xD;
      headache diary enables the physician to understand the headache characteristics as well to&#xD;
      establish the triggers causing the precipitation of episodes. The other important measure to&#xD;
      ensure good outcomes is compliance to medications in those who have been prescribed&#xD;
      prophylaxis. Migraine prophylaxis is by pills that have to be taken everyday at fixed time to&#xD;
      ensure best outcomes. However, it is known that patients with migraine often are not adherent&#xD;
      to prophylactic medications. A meta-analysis of 33 studies found that observational studies&#xD;
      (n = 14) showed adherence ranging from 41% to 95% at 2 months after initiation of medication&#xD;
      and 21% to 80% at 6 months. Pooled rates of persistence derived from 19 RCTs on propranolol,&#xD;
      amitriptyline, and topiramate showed adherence rates of 77%, 55%, and 57%, respectively, at&#xD;
      16-26 weeks of initiation. The real world adherence is expected to be lower than that in the&#xD;
      ideal settings of randomized trials. Regular pill reminders issued through smartphone based&#xD;
      applications can improve medication adherence and thus improve headache outcomes. Though&#xD;
      smartphone based migraine tracker digital applications are available, they mostly are aimed&#xD;
      at capturing headache characteristics. The efficacy of providing pill reminders along with&#xD;
      patient educational materials and community blog to enable migraineurs share their&#xD;
      experiences with each other has not been studied in controlled trials. It is known that&#xD;
      patients who are well informed about their chronic diseases such as migraine often have&#xD;
      better outcomes. Busy clinicians often resort to providing pamphlets regarding the disease,&#xD;
      triggers, acute pain relief medications, prophylactic therapy etc. However, it is yet to be&#xD;
      studied if a digital application with all these inbuilt features, which are easily accessible&#xD;
      at the finger tips would lead to better information uptake and improved compliance and self&#xD;
      management. This RCT would try to assess this gap in knowledge.&#xD;

      Migraine is a common headache disorder which leads to significantly impaired quality of life,&#xD;
      absence from work, loss of productivity in workplace and reduced vitality in social&#xD;
      functioning. A structured migraine diary can be a valuable aid for improving communication&#xD;
      between patients and physicians regarding migraine disability and treatment outcomes. The&#xD;
      other possible measure to ensure improved outcome in migraine patients is better adherence to&#xD;
      prophylactic treatment of migraine. Migraine prophylaxis is by pills that have to be taken&#xD;
      every day at fixed time to ensure best outcomes. However, it is known that patients with&#xD;
      migraine often are not adherent to prophylactic medications. Regular pill reminders issued&#xD;
      through smartphone based applications may help improve medication adherence and hence,&#xD;
      headache outcomes. Though smartphone based migraine tracker digital applications are&#xD;
      available, they mostly are aimed at capturing headache characteristics. The efficacy of&#xD;
      providing pill reminders along with patient educational materials and community blog to&#xD;
      enable migraineurs share their experiences with each other has not been studied in controlled&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A run-in period of 4 weeks prior to randomization to optimize therapy and to document the baseline frequency and severity of headaches.&#xD;
At the end of run-in period, the patients will be randomly allocated into the smartphone based digital App first arm or the paper diary first arm. The digital app and paper diary- are available in Hindi as well as English.&#xD;
Randomization will be done by computer generated random number table.&#xD;
Concealment: The sequence of allocation will be held concealed by opaque sealed envelopes.&#xD;
Participant and investigator both will be aware of the allocated group - it is an open label study.&#xD;
Participants will be followed up at 4 weeks and the headache characteristics and outcome parameters would be captured from the app and paper diary respectively.&#xD;
Subsequently patients would be crossed over to the other arm and 4 weeks after the cross over, parameters would again be assessed.</intervention_model_description>
