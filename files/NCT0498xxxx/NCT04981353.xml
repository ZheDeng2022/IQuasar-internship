    <textblock>
      this study will test a novel indication for bilateral erector spinae plane block (painless&#xD;
      1st stage normal vaginal delivery) it depends on the hypnosis that the erector spinae plane&#xD;
      block blocks the visceral pain also by affecting the ventral rami, dorsal rami and rami&#xD;
      communicants.&#xD;

      Aim of the work In this article, the efficacy of bilateral thoracic (ESP) to provide painless&#xD;
      delivery without affecting the motor power (walking painless labor) will be studded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. numerical rating pain score (NRS) during the course of delivery will be recorded and&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the total doses of pethidine needed through-out delivery will be measured&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the incidence of failed delivery and need of cesarean section will be assessed&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the incidence of transient fetal bradycardia or deceleration after the administration of&#xD;
           the block will be recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. ABGAR score of the neonate immediately after delivery and after 5min, 10min,15min after&#xD;
           delivery. Will be recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant ladies aged 20-40 years, ASA 2, either prime or multipara , 37-40 weeks of gestation&#xD;
      scheduled for vaginal delivery will be included in the study Exclusion criteria Pregnant&#xD;
      ladies with complicated pregnancy eg; IUGR, accidental hemorrhage, preeclampsia Pregnant&#xD;
      ladies scheduled for cesarean section Place of work: Labor ward in obstetric Department, Ain&#xD;
      Shams University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: all patients legible for the study will be enrolled and randomly allocated into&#xD;
      one of the two groups. sample size was calculated using PASS 11.0 and based on a study&#xD;
      carried out by Boules,2020. Group sample size of 15 in group 1 and 15 in group 2 achieves&#xD;
      100% power to detect difference of -4.0 between the null hypothesis that both group means are&#xD;
      2.0 and the alternative hypothesis that the mean of group 2 is 6.0 with estimated group&#xD;
      standard deviations of 0.3 and a significance level (alpha ) of 0.05000 using a two-sided&#xD;
      two-sample t-test. Sample size was inflated by 20% to account for attrition problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      After taking the approval from Ain shams university ethical committee and informed consent&#xD;
      from the pregnant ladies that will be legible for the study, detailed medical history of the&#xD;
      patient will be taken and patient will be transported to operating room and basic monitors&#xD;
      including ( ECG, pulse oximetry, NIBP)will be attached and basic reading of CTG will be&#xD;
      recorded after that patient will be enrolled in two groups :(group 1) will be putted in&#xD;
      sitting position and disinfecting her back. A real-time high-frequency linear ultrasound will&#xD;
      be used to do the thoracic (ESP) at the level of T11 by visualizing the transverse process of&#xD;
      T11 thoracic vertebrae and erector spinae muscle and injecting a 20 ml of bupivacaine 0.25%&#xD;
      bilaterally using an in-plane technique, a 20-gauge, 70-mm needle (Tuoren, Henan, China) will&#xD;
      be advanced into the plane below (ESM) after injecting lidocaine 1% 2ml at the site of&#xD;
      injection, Needle will be advanced with a cranial to caudal direction (Boules et al,2020).&#xD;
      (group 2) patients will receive pethidine 25mg doses if NRS &gt;4. Patients of both groups will&#xD;
      be positioned semi setting and CTG will be attached to her , blood pressure and maternal&#xD;
      pulsations will be recorded every 15min throughout the delivery process. CTG records all over&#xD;
      the labor time will be printed. Numerical rating scale (NRS) are the simplest and most widely&#xD;
      used scale. The numerical scale is most commonly 0 to 10, with 0 being &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 being&#xD;
      &quot;the worst pain imaginable.&quot; The patient draws a circle around the number that best describes&#xD;
      the pain intensity. Advantages of NRS include simplicity, reproducibility, easy&#xD;
      comprehensibility, and sensitivity to small changes in pain. It will be assessed every 30&#xD;
      min. throughout the delivery process. 25mg pethidine iv will be given if NRS &gt;4 in both&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hour after delivery of the newborn.&#xD;
