  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the use of Ion robotic bronchoscope with a mobile computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scanner to biopsy tumors and inject a fluorescent dye called indocyanine&#xD;
      green to mark the tumor during surgery in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer or&#xD;
      cancer that has spread to the lung (lung metastases). Sometimes small tumors or those that&#xD;
      are not on the surface of the lung can be challenging to remove without making larger&#xD;
      incisions. Injecting the dye, may help doctors see the tumor more easily, which may allow for&#xD;
      smaller incisions and by being able to see the tumor, doctors may be better able to decide&#xD;
      where to make the incisions in order to get all of the tumor out.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the feasibility of using the Ion Endoluminal Platform (IEP; Intuitive,&#xD;
      Sunnyvale, California [CA]) with the Cios Spin - a mobile cone-beam C - (Siemens Medical&#xD;
      Solutions, Malvern, Pennsylvania [PA], United States [US]) in the operating room setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During standard of care surgical resection, patients undergo robotic bronchoscopy and CT.&#xD;
      Patients also receive indocyanine green via injection.&#xD;
