  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study to assess [18F]PT2385 Positron Emission Tomography/Computed&#xD;
      Tomography (PET/CT) in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This is an open-label,&#xD;
      nontherapeutic trial. The main objective is to correlate hypoxia-inducible factor-2alpha&#xD;
      (HIF2α) levels as determined by an investigational [18F]PT2385 PET/CT scan with the levels on&#xD;
      subsequently obtained tissue by HIF2α immunohistochemistry (IHC). There will be two cohorts.&#xD;
      The first pre-surgical cohort will have [18F]PT2385 PET/CT prior to nephrectomy. The uptake&#xD;
      and retention on Positron Emission Tomography (PET), quantified as standardized uptake value&#xD;
      (SUV) max and mean, abbreviated SUV henceforth will be correlated with HIF2α levels by IHC on&#xD;
      the primary tumor. The second cohort will comprise patients with metastatic clear cell renal&#xD;
      carcinoma (ccRCC). SUV will be correlated with HIF2α levels measured by IHC on a biopsy&#xD;
      sample from a metastasis. Both low- and high-avidity sites will be biopsied and tracer uptake&#xD;
      correlated with HIF2α IHC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIF2α is an emerging therapeutic target in RCC. Proof-of-principle experiments in mice have&#xD;
      demonstrated the feasibility of PET/CT imaging with novel radiotracers, [11C] and&#xD;
      [18F]PT2385, to assess HIF2α expression in RCC. [18F]PT2385 has been proposed in this study&#xD;
      for practical imaging of HIF2α.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-therapeutic research study. Patients with localized or metastatic RCC will&#xD;
      undergo imaging with [18F]PT2385. Patients will have the opportunity to ask questions&#xD;
      regarding the procedure. A peripheral intravenous line will be placed for [18F]PT2385&#xD;
      administration. Patients will be injected with [18F]PT2385 intravenously and evaluated by&#xD;
      PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 10 subjects will undergo a dynamic PET scanning and multi-time point whole body imaging&#xD;
      to determine the intratumoral tracer kinetics, the optimal time point for whole body imaging,&#xD;
      as well as to calculate human dosimetry. In the first 3 subjects, a dynamic scan over the&#xD;
      kidneys will be performed for approximately 25 minutes. Upon completion of the dynamic scan,&#xD;
      a whole-body scan will be acquired to yield a whole body distribution at approximately 35&#xD;
      minutes. These 3 subjects will be asked to return for delayed whole body images at 120 and&#xD;
      240 minutes post injection. In up to 7 additional subjects, a dynamic scan will be acquired&#xD;
      for 55 minutes followed by an immediate whole body scan to yield whole body distribution at&#xD;
      approximately 65 minutes. Additional whole-body images will be acquired at 120 and 240&#xD;
      minutes post-injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-surgical cohort of 20 subjects will receive one PET/CT scan at the optimal time point&#xD;
      determined from the first 10 subjects. Subsequently, surgery will be performed and SUV from&#xD;
      the PET scans will be correlated with HIF2α levels by IHC on the surgical specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second cohort of 20 subjects with metastatic RCC will be evaluated. Patients with&#xD;
      metastatic disease should all have a previous tissue diagnosis, and this cohort will focus on&#xD;
      ccRCC patients. Subjects with metastatic ccRCC will be injected with [18F]PT2385 by&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) push and will have a whole-body [18F]PT2385 PET/CT at a time considered&#xD;
      optimal based on imaging studies performed in cohort 1. A mandatory biopsy will be performed,&#xD;
      and up to 4 suitable core tissue samples will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following dosimetry studies, a subset of patients may undergo repeat [18F]PT2385 PET studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both cohorts will receive standard or experimental treatment for RCC at the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with suspected primary RCC with planned surgery (cohort 1) or patients with&#xD;
             tissue-confirmed metastatic ccRCC with a site accessible for biopsy (cohort 2). (In&#xD;
             standard clinical practice, biopsy is not routinely performed in patients who will be&#xD;
             having surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent that&#xD;
             includes study interventions (PET/CT and, if cohort 2, mandatory biopsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to lie still for a 30- to 60-minute PET/CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Cohort 1. Patients with suspected RCC planned for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Cohort 2. Patients with metastatic ccRCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential must agree to undergo and have documented a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test on the day of [18F]PT2385 administration. A female of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal&#xD;
             ligation, or celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e.,&#xD;
                  has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled severe and irreversible intercurrent illness or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital&#xD;
             abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Claustrophobia or other contraindications to PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not weigh more than the maximum weight limit for the table for the&#xD;
             PET/CT scanner where the study is being performed (&gt;200 kilograms or 440 pounds).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For cohort 2 patients, lack of suitable sites for mandatory biopsy. For example,&#xD;
             patients with metastatic disease restricted to the lungs that would require&#xD;
             percutaneous biopsies with associated risk of bleeding and pneumothorax will be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
