      In the literature, it has been observed that there is an increase in respiratory muscle&#xD;
      activity in individuals with COPD due to the increase in respiratory workload and in response&#xD;
      to the loads given by respiratory muscle training devices. However, no study has been found&#xD;
      in the literature comparing the activation of respiratory muscles during constant threshold&#xD;
      load endurance test and increasing threshold load endurance test performed with respiratory&#xD;
      muscle training devices, which are important for respiratory muscle function evaluation. With&#xD;
      this planned study, it is aimed to contribute to the literature by examining the changes in&#xD;
      muscle activation during the constant threshold load and increasing threshold load endurance&#xD;
      tests where different workloads are given and by comparing these changes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, preventable and treatable disease&#xD;
      characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airway limitation due to airway and/or&#xD;
      alveolar abnormality that is affected by many factors that cause abnormal lung development&#xD;
      resulting from exposure to harmful gases or particles. COPD is known as the fourth most&#xD;
      common cause of death in the world and is expected to rise to third place by the end of 2020.&#xD;
      Physiopathological changes such as airflow limitation, bronchial fibrosis, increased airway&#xD;
      resistance, ciliary dysfunction, gas exchange abnormalities and air trapping occur in COPD.&#xD;
      While smoking is the most common risk factor in COPD; Occupational dust and chemicals, air&#xD;
      pollution, lung growth and development, genetic predisposition such as age and gender, and&#xD;
      exposure to environmental effects. Symptoms such as shortness of breath (dyspnea), cough, and&#xD;
      sputum are common in COPD. In addition to pulmonary changes such as an increase in&#xD;
      respiratory workload in individuals with COPD, there are also extrapulmonary changes such as&#xD;
      respiratory muscle dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      respiratory muscle dysfunction; It is a decrease in respiratory muscle strength, endurance,&#xD;
      or both, resulting from factors such as elongated diaphragm fibers, increased respiratory&#xD;
      workload, changes in muscle mass and abdominal weight. Strength is defined as the muscle's&#xD;
      capacity to produce power, while endurance is defined as the muscle's ability to sustain a&#xD;
      given force over time (the capacity to resist fatigue). Loss of strength and/or endurance&#xD;
      contributes to diaphragm weakness and impaired performance. Today, respiratory muscle&#xD;
      strength parameters (MIP, MEP) are widely used in the evaluation of respiratory muscle&#xD;
      function. However, evaluation of respiratory muscle endurance is more effective than&#xD;
      respiratory muscle strength in the evaluation of submaximal respiratory muscle contraction,&#xD;
      which is valid for daily activities, and in the clinical, functional and prognostic&#xD;
      evaluation of respiratory muscles. Respiratory muscle endurance can be measured with constant&#xD;
      threshold load and increased threshold load endurance tests. The imbalance between the&#xD;
      function of the respiratory muscles and the respiratory workload they face chronically plays&#xD;
      an important role in the formation of dyspnea and hypercapnia. Neural respiratory impulse&#xD;
      (NRD), which is indirectly measured by electromyogram (EMG) of respiratory muscles, has&#xD;
      attracted attention as a potential physiological marker indicating clinical deterioration due&#xD;
      to imbalance between workload and capacity of respiratory muscles. The neural respiratory&#xD;
      drive (NRD) is the output of the brainstem respiratory centers. NRD is not affected by the&#xD;
      patient's will, is associated with symptoms such as dyspnea, and is usually increased in&#xD;
      COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical abnormalities such as airflow obstruction, static and dynamic hyperinflation, and&#xD;
      intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure increase the load on respiratory muscles in&#xD;
      individuals with COPD. Inspiratory muscle contraction is impaired as a result of pressure&#xD;
      changes, muscle shortening, increased contraction rate, change in geometry, and decreased&#xD;
      compliance of the respiratory system. As a result, an increase in muscle activation and NRD&#xD;
      is observed. Those with severe COPD require significantly higher muscle activations, both&#xD;
      electrical and mechanical, to breathe and overcome the respiratory workload than those with&#xD;
      mild to moderate COPD. In individuals with COPD, NRD increases when the load on the&#xD;
      respiratory muscles increases as a result of an increase in respiratory workload, a decrease&#xD;
      in capacity, or a combination of both. Studies have shown that, in addition to respiratory&#xD;
      workload, workloads given with respiratory muscle training devices lead to an increase in the&#xD;
      activation of respiratory muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, it has been observed that there is an increase in respiratory muscle&#xD;
      activity in individuals with COPD due to the increase in respiratory workload and in response&#xD;
      to the loads given by respiratory muscle training devices. However, no study has been found&#xD;
