  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Eva-PED-t project will evaluate implementation of a new therapy for eating disorders,&#xD;
      called PED-t (Physical Exercise and Dietary therapy), in a new treatment arena for such&#xD;
      illnesses. By this, Eva-PED-t evaluates effectiveness- and efficacy outcomes, with the latter&#xD;
      highlighting both the user-, the therapists- and the management perspectives. The research&#xD;
      group behind this initiative comprises the founders of the PED-t, and holds extensive&#xD;
      expertise on research methodology, eating disorders, health science, and exercise medicine,&#xD;
      affiliated high-ranked research-intensive universities. Previous documentation of poor&#xD;
      implementation of evidence-based knowledge in public health services reveal poor or no&#xD;
      translation of new research findings for improved screening, treatment or medical procedures&#xD;
      into real life settings. This may impair public health service outcomes, as less effective or&#xD;
      ineffective treatment or procedures are routinely preferred. In a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial, the Eva-PED-t partnership recently found a new therapy for eating disorders (PED-t) to&#xD;
      be comparable effective to the currently recommended treatment (NCT02079935). Specific&#xD;
      advantages with PED-t, are the use of professionals not currently used in therapy of mental&#xD;
      disorders, and the efficiency of arranging therapy in groups, hence effectively dealing with&#xD;
      the high request for therapy. The Eva PED-t collaborative is motivated by the knowledge of&#xD;
      high prevalence of mental illnesses, for which there is a need to improve treatment access&#xD;
      and -efficiency. Adding to this scenario, is the new and more prevalent diagnosis of eating&#xD;
      disorders, binge eating disorder, for which specialized health services have no&#xD;
      prioritization for treatment. Addressing requirements for improved therapy access demands&#xD;
      investigation of new treatments and new ways of delivery. The PED-t responds to this request,&#xD;
      still recommendation for a broad implementation necessitate exploration of implementation&#xD;
      strategies and experiences.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Implementation research intends to identify facilitating and obstructing elements in the&#xD;
      process of transferring evidence-based practices from controlled settings to naturalistic&#xD;
      settings. Unfortunately, the implementation of evidence-based knowledge is challenged by lack&#xD;
      of institutional resources and insufficient prioritization by the management, and lack of&#xD;
      prioritization by funders and academic researchers. As such, a lag time before evidence-based&#xD;
      knowledge from research is translated in to real world practice is typically estimated to be&#xD;
      about 14-20 years. The delay in implementation of evidence-based practice is found to be&#xD;
      specifically relevant in health care services, hence, ultimately depriving patients from best&#xD;
      practice. Exercise referral centers (ERC, also known as Healthy Living Centers) are part of&#xD;
      the municipally public health care, providing support for improved healthy living behavior.&#xD;
      Service users are confident by the professional skills in the ERC, and trust the service to&#xD;
      be evidence-based. However, there are a wide variety in program approaches and methodology,&#xD;
      most with no evidence-based foundation, and a lack of documentation on effects. Hence&#xD;
      originally, the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommended&#xD;
      not to commission ERC in primary health care other than in well-designed research studies.&#xD;
      The ERC's are in an early progress, still exploring their role in public health care and&#xD;
      having stakeholders requesting evidence-based methods, and as such, identification of&#xD;
      successful interventions at the ERC's is necessitated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Eva-PED-t has the potential to pick up on the shortfalls in documentation of&#xD;
      effectiveness outcomes and exploration of efficacy of evidence-based interventions at the&#xD;
      ERC's, and the poor implementation of evidence-based treatment in public health services in&#xD;
      general. The EVA_PED intend to evaluate the implementation of the PED-t in the public health&#xD;
      care services ERC in terms of effectiveness and efficacy, and by a mixed methods design. By&#xD;
      relying on the original team behind the development of the PED-t to train the therapists,&#xD;
      inform and supervise the management, and to provide support during implementation, this&#xD;
      project has the potential to ease the implementation process. As such, the EVA-PED aim to&#xD;
      follow the request to evaluate the total implementation success (i.e. the sum of the&#xD;
      effectiveness of treatment and the experiences of implementation within the organization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers behind the EVA-PED finalized the evaluation of effectivity from PED-t on&#xD;
      treatment of eating disorders in 2018 (NCT02079935), bringing optimism on increased therapy&#xD;
      access, lowering barriers for treatment seeking behavior, and facilitating a more effective&#xD;
      treatment delivery. Having the PED-t research team initiating Eva-PED-t, this project will&#xD;
      bypass the delay in translation of evidence-based knowledge to real life settings. The&#xD;
      Eva-PED-t has the potential to identify any elements undermining optimal uptake of this&#xD;
      evidence-based treatment in public health services. Informed on previous challenges on&#xD;
      successful implementation of evidence-based procedures, Eva-PED-t grasp on these most&#xD;
      critical elements. Providing practical training and adequate time for preparations, mentoring&#xD;
      during therapy operation, relying on therapy elements similar to what the therapists have&#xD;
      practiced in their regular work, and by communicating, involving and motivating several&#xD;
      levels in the organizations (management and therapists); the EVA_PED target the most critical&#xD;
      elements previously found to impair successful implementation. Additionally, by involving&#xD;
      former patients and therapists from the PED-t intervention as user groups, combined with the&#xD;
      findings from in depth interviews in the corresponding groups of patients and therapists, the&#xD;
      EVA-PED will evaluate adjustments of the therapy and arrangement according to their&#xD;
      experiences and advices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EVA-PED-t project aims to evaluate the success of adopting and operating the&#xD;
      evidence-based PED-t in naturalistic settings like ERC's, physiotherapy clinics and&#xD;
      multidisciplinary medical centers. By this, the project intends to study effectiveness&#xD;
      outcomes and efficacy outcomes, with the latter highlighting both the user perspectives, the&#xD;
      therapists- and the management perspectives. A part of the efficacy outcomes, is evaluation&#xD;
      on the treatment fidelity by individual therapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This generate the following main- and secondary research questions (RQ):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main RQ:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Which elements promotes or discourages the implementation of PED-t according to; a) the&#xD;
      therapists, and b) the management at the therapy cites?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary RQ's:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How well is the implementation quality concerning treatment fidelity in a naturalistic&#xD;
           setting?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are the experiences amongst the patients receiving PED-t in a naturalistic setting?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How effective is the PED-t in a naturalistic setting, evaluated in remission from&#xD;
           diagnosis, in rating of quality of life, in intensity of symptoms for depression,&#xD;
           anxiety and symptoms of an eating disorder, and in changes of eating- and exercise&#xD;
           behavior?&#xD;

Eligible participants with bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder are recruited for therapy in the ECR. Their expectations to- and experiences from having therapy in the ECR are the main research questions, in addition to evaluation of therapy success.&#xD;
A previous RCT has evaluated the treatment efficiency by comparing it to a control group and another standardized treatment intervention. As such, the main focus of the current study is to evaluate experiences from arranging PED-t in a naturalistic setting, and secondly to evaluate if treatment efficiency can be replicated.</intervention_model_description>
