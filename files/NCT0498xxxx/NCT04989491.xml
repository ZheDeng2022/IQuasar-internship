  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epstein Barr virus infects over 90% of human population and persists during lifetime. After&#xD;
      infecting B lymphocytes, EBV remains latent in memory B cells. In immunocompromised patients,&#xD;
      primary infection could lead to an uncontrolled EBV infected B cells proliferation because of&#xD;
      impaired T cell specific cytotoxicity. The latent EBV infection is characterized by&#xD;
      expression of restricted latent gene products, which drive cell proliferation and progression&#xD;
      to PTLD. As a consequence, EBV seronegativity and EBV mismatch are major risk factors for&#xD;
      developing PTLD. The investigators reported in a previous work from the French Registry that&#xD;
      the incidence of PTLD was multiplied by ten in adult EBV negative kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients. Moreover, even if the event is relatively rare after transplantation, the&#xD;
      prognosis is severe with high morbidity and an overall mortality rate around 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, few and inconsistent data exist regarding beneficial preventing strategies like&#xD;
      antiviral therapy, reduction of immunosuppression or immunoglobulin infusion in this&#xD;
      high-risk population of EBV negative recipients. Therefore, an efficient and safe preventive&#xD;
      treatment is still lacking to decrease PTLD incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rituximab, has been already proposed in stem cell transplant recipients as a preemptive&#xD;
      therapy in patients with a persistent EBV viremia independently of their EBV status. A pilot&#xD;
      study was performed in EBV negative kidney transplant recipients but in a very small&#xD;
      population. Schachtner60 reported the cases of 5 EBV negative recipients receiving kidney&#xD;
      from EBV positive donors after a treatment with Rituximab. Only 2 patients showed a&#xD;
      seroconversion and no patients developed neither a viremia nor a PTLD after 49 months of&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the investigators study is to evaluate the efficacy of early infusion&#xD;
      of Rituximab in the prevention of EBV primary infection and post-transplant&#xD;
      lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) occurrence in adult EBV negative kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients transplanted with an EBV positive donor.&#xD;
