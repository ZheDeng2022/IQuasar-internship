    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/IIa study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of IBC0966 for&#xD;
      the treatment of subjects with advanced malignant tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study includes three phases: dose escalation (Phase Ia), dose extension (Phase Ib), and&#xD;
      clinical exploration (Phase IIa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the Phase Ia dose escalation will be carried out. After switching to the 3+3&#xD;
      escalation mode, the Phase Ib dose extension study can be carried out at the same time. After&#xD;
      Phase Ia is completed and RP2D is obtained, Phase IIa clinical exploratory research can be&#xD;
      carried out.&#xD;
