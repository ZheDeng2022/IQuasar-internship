    <textblock>
      To determine if deferred or delayed implantation of Impella device based on shock severity&#xD;
      index is non-inferior with respect to 1 month and 1 year mortality compared to standard&#xD;
      clinical protocols that do not differentiate based on shock severity in adult patients&#xD;
      following an initial diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic&#xD;
      shock (AMICS).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Carolinas Cardiogenic Shock Initiative is a clinical pathway and process improvement&#xD;
      protocol already agreed upon by participating sites, to improve care by using a standardized&#xD;
      algorithm to treat patients with AMI and CS. This prospective registry will capture data from&#xD;
      this protocol as a multi-site research project in parallel with this standardized&#xD;
      non-research clinic workflow protocol. Participating providers will follow the clinical&#xD;
      protocol as standard of care for AMICS patients, as clinically appropriate. Patients who have&#xD;
      been admitted and diagnosed with AMICS and meet all eligibility criteria will have their data&#xD;
      entered in this registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients who are discharged alive from the hospital will be entered into the&#xD;
      registry and follow-up via the EMR and/or SSDI will occur at 30 days and one year to assess&#xD;
      mortality. No additional provider appointments or further testing will be required as a part&#xD;
      of this Registry, other than what each provider feels is medically necessary and indicated as&#xD;
      a part of the patients' care plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment decisions and timing will follow an approved clinical protocol and algorithm (see&#xD;
      Appendix A) based on shock severity classification. The research team at each site will&#xD;
      capture data generated during standard of care lab tests and clinical procedures, as well as&#xD;
      data collected during clinical visits from eligible patients. Our target accrual is&#xD;
      approximately 672 patients, cumulative across all participating sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of the patient specific outcomes and variables of interest for this study, are already&#xD;
      submitted to the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR). Some additional data elements,&#xD;
      as described in Apendix C, will also be captured. There are no benefits in participation&#xD;
      other than the scientific knowledge gained, and the only alternative to participation is not&#xD;
      participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.1 Primary Outcome Variable The primary outcome variable will be 30-day all cause&#xD;
      mortality. 4.1.2 Secondary Outcome Variable(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key secondary outcome variables for analysis may include but are not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One year mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  length of ICU care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  requirement for renal replacement therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dose and duration of catecholamine therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  requirement for implantation of an active LVAD or referral for cardiac transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  time to support (arrival to tertiary facility to implantation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  use of right heart catheterization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attainment of TIMI III flow post reperfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attainment of Cardiac power &gt; 0.6 watts after completion of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction or elimination of vasopressors and inotropic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood products during admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hemolysis requiring device discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  vascular complication requiring surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All inpatient data on eligible patients will come from the hospital inpatient records. Once&#xD;
      the patient is deemed eligible, their clinical data will be entered or migrated into the&#xD;
      research registry. Additional data will be collected at approximately one month and one year&#xD;
      following AMICS, using the EMR and the SSDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following are some of the variables which will be collected and recorded within the&#xD;
      registry:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnostic values&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure dates and times&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-procedure information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discharge survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival at 1 month from AMICS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival at 12 months from AMICS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional Quality Metrics&#xD;

        We have no reason to assume the patients who present with AMICS, will not be representative&#xD;
        of the demographics of the region in which the participating site(s) are located. For this&#xD;
        reason, we will not prioritize enrollment or recruitment based on demographics. Patients&#xD;
        who present to the cardiac catheterization lab with AMICS at participating sites, and who&#xD;
        meet inclusion criteria, will be included in the registry upon discharge. Data will be&#xD;
        gathered in the usual manner for clinical purposes, for patients who die during their&#xD;
        admission. The duration of the patient's enrollment in the registry is anticipated to last&#xD;
        1 year from AMICS. Recording of data in the registry is anticipated to last approximately 3&#xD;
        years.&#xD;
