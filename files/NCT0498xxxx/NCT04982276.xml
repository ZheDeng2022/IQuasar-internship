  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS defined as the time from the first dose to death from any cause. Subjects who do not die at the end of the extended follow-up period, or were lost to follow-up during the study, were censored at the last date they were known to be alive.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Observed pharmacokinetics (PK) exposure of AK109 and AK104</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of AK109 and AK104 through 90 days after last dose of AK109 and AK104</time_frame>
    <description>The endpoints for assessment of PK of AK109 and AK104 include serum concentrations of AK109 and AK104 at different timepoints after AK109 and AK104 administration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of AK109 and AK104 through 90 days after last dose of AK109 and AK104</time_frame>
    <description>The immunogenicity of AK104 and AK109 will be assessed by summarizing the number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)</description>
