  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a Stage I successive cohort trial intended to adapt Acceptance and&#xD;
      Commitment Therapy (ACT) to meet the specific needs of stroke survivors with aphasia (&quot;ACT&#xD;
      for Aphasia&quot;). It will do so by incorporating communication supports and compensatory&#xD;
      speech-language treatment. The goal of developing this integrated treatment is to improve&#xD;
      successful communication participation, psychosocial adjustment, and quality of life for&#xD;
      stroke survivors with aphasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first phase of the project, the investigators will create a treatment manual with&#xD;
      input from a stakeholder advisory board consisting of caregivers and stroke survivors with&#xD;
      aphasia. The investigators will then recruit an initial cohort of five stroke survivors with&#xD;
      aphasia to undergo the initial version of the treatment based and provide feedback. This will&#xD;
      aid revision of the manual, which the investigators will then evaluate using a second cohort&#xD;
      of 16 stroke survivors with aphasia. The investigators predict that ACT for Aphasia will be&#xD;
      acceptable and feasible based on measures of participant satisfaction and treatment&#xD;
      adherence. The investigators will also measure pre- to post-treatment changes in&#xD;
      psychological distress, functional disability, quality of life, and communication&#xD;
      participation and functioning to establish preliminary effect size estimates for this&#xD;
      intervention, in preparation for a subsequent Stage II efficacy trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goals of this research are to improve psychosocial adjustment, quality of&#xD;
      life, and successful communication participation by developing Act for Aphasia, a&#xD;
      patient-centered, manualized behavioral intervention in Stage I research. Stroke survivors&#xD;
      with aphasia in their first year post stroke will complete a 10-session intervention. In&#xD;
      study Aim 1, the investigators will engage a Stakeholder Advisory Board (SAB) of people with&#xD;
      aphasia (PWA) and caregivers to provide input to develop a treatment manual. The&#xD;
      investigators will then use an iterative design process and two successive participant&#xD;
      cohorts to refine the manual. Cohort 1 (N=5) will participate in the initial version of the&#xD;
      treatment, then help inform its revision by being invited to join the SAB. Cohort 2 (N=16)&#xD;
      will participate in the revised version. In Aim 2a the investigators will establish&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of this intervention. In Aim 2b the investigators will estimate&#xD;
      preliminary effect sizes for a subsequent Stage II efficacy trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant assignment: given the early phase of this research and the lack of control&#xD;
      conditions or groups, there will be no random assignment. Participants will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the study as they are referred and found to be eligible, with the first five participants&#xD;
      being enrolled in the first study cohort during year 1 while the remainder of participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the second cohort across years 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention description: the ACT for Aphasia treatment manual will be a 10-session&#xD;
      intervention created by modifying an existing ACT manual provided by Dr. Meyer. To meet the&#xD;
      specific needs of stroke survivors with aphasia, ACT will be modified in two main ways.&#xD;
      First, the intervention will include modified language and communication supports to address&#xD;
      the unique communication challenges faced by people with aphasia that could impede engagement&#xD;
      with ACT content. Multi-modality communication supports will be provided by the treating&#xD;
      clinician (e.g., writing out key words to support verbal content, summarizing and providing&#xD;
      repetitions, providing session summaries to review between sessions). Manual creation will&#xD;
      follow existing practice recommendations for modifying counseling interventions for PWA&#xD;
      (e.g., simplifying language and increasing use of visual metaphors) which will be reviewed by&#xD;
      the SAB. Second, ACT will be further augmented via individualized language compensation&#xD;
      training and a focus on identifying and addressing communication-based barriers to life&#xD;
      participation. Language training will focus on active compensatory strategies such as&#xD;
      self-cuing, use of alternative modalities (gesture, writing), and use of commonly available&#xD;
      technology (e.g., smartphone dictionaries, text-to-speech). The details of this language&#xD;
      compensation training will also be determined based on input from the SAB, and will be&#xD;
      revised after reviewing performance and interview feedback from each successive cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention administration procedures: all aspects of the treatment protocol will be&#xD;
      administered by Dr. Evans or a licensed speech-language pathologist on study staff who has&#xD;
      received training in providing ACT. The intervention will consist of 10 weekly treatment&#xD;
      sessions. Post-treatment interviews providing feedback for protocol revision will be&#xD;
      administered by Dr. Evans within 2 weeks of study completion. Interviews will use a&#xD;
      semi-structured, ethnographic interview approach and be video-recorded. These interviews will&#xD;
      ask specific questions about the participant's experience and perspective regarding each&#xD;
      functional domain of the intervention (i.e., the &quot;Open Up,&quot; &quot;Be Present,&quot; and &quot;Do What&#xD;
      Matters&quot; components of ACT and the individualized language compensation training), and will&#xD;
      be asked for suggestions and improvements about the specific content and techniques employed.&#xD;

    <description>The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire - 8 (CSQ-8) is a brief questionnaire demonstrated to provide &quot;efficient, sensitive, and reasonably comprehensive&quot; measures of patient satisfaction. It has 8 questions rated on a 4-point scale (summed scores range from 8 to 32). High scores indicate high satisfaction and low scores indicate low satisfaction. The CSQ-8 is the primary measure which will determine acceptability of the proposed pilot intervention.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Post-Treatment (within one week of completing the treatment phase)</time_frame>
    <description>The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire II (ACQ-II) is a self-report measure of psychological flexibility, acceptance, and experiential avoidance. It has 7 items rated on a 7-point scale (summed scores range from 7 to 49). Higher total scores reflect less psychological flexibility, while lower total scores reflect more flexibility. The ACQ-II will evaluate changes in psychological flexibility, the hypothesized mechanism of action underlying ACT for aphasia.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean scores on the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire - Acquired Brain Injury</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post-Treatment (within one week of completing the treatment phase)</time_frame>
    <description>The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire - Acquired Brain Injury (ACQ-ABI) is a 15 item self-report measure adapted from the ACQ-II specifically for people with acquired brain injury based on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 15-75 where higher scores indicate greater levels of acceptance. While the ACQ-II addresses psychological flexibility generally, the ACQ-ABI measures psychological flexibility relating specifically to the consequences of acquired brain injury and is therefore an informative addition. Similar to the ACQ-II, it will also evaluate changes in psychological flexibility, the hypothesized mechanism of action underlying ACT for aphasia.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean scores on the Values Tracker</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post-Treatment (within one week of completing the treatment phase)</time_frame>
    <description>The Values tracker is a two-item measure of values engagement. Items are rated on a 1-10 scale, then averaged to produce a score with higher scores indicating more values-consistent behavior. It is particularly useful in tracking changes in value-based action and engagement across treatment sessions. The values tracker will evaluate changes in value-based action, an additional hypothesized mechanism underlying ACT for aphasia.</description>

    <measure>Change in mean scores on the Kessler K6 non-specific distress scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post-Treatment (within one week of completing the treatment phase)</time_frame>
    <description>The Kessler K6 is a brief, validated instrument that assesses non-specific psychological distress experienced over the past 30 days. It has 6 items rated on a 0 to 4-point scale (summed scores range from 0 to 24). Higher total scores reflect greater psychological distress.</description>

    <measure>Change in mean scores on the Stroke and Aphasia Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post-Treatment (within one week of completing the treatment phase)</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroke and Aphasia Quality of Life Scale is a 39-item patient reported measure of qualify of life adapted specifically for people with aphasia from the stroke survivor quality of life scale. The SA-QOL-39 provides a broad measure of changes in stroke-related quality of life over time in response to the proposed intervention and is aligned with both the World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health. It is scored on a 1-5 scale, with lower scores indicating lower quality of life.</description>
