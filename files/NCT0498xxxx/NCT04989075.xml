  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-eclampsia (PE) remains a major source of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      especially in low- and middle-income settings. PE, a pregnancy-specific hypertensive&#xD;
      disorder, characterized by the development of placental endothelial dysfunction resulting in,&#xD;
      among the most common diagnostic features, concomitant hypertension and proteinuria that may&#xD;
      evolve into organs with fluctuating clinical specificities. Current studies indicate that&#xD;
      periodontal disorders during pregnancy and particularly periodontal pathogens may be related&#xD;
      to the risk of PE. Standard oral hygiene methods, based mainly on the joint use of&#xD;
      toothbrushes and interdental brushes, reduce periodontal inflammatory risk, modulate of the&#xD;
      dysbiotic oral microbiome. The purpose of the present study is to compare the PE outcomes in&#xD;
      high-risk pregnant women receiving oral prophylactic measures to a control group. One&#xD;
      specific question is addressed as follows according to the PICO principles: In high-risk&#xD;
      pregnant women (Population), does oral prophylactic measures (Intervention) have a beneficial&#xD;
      effect on PE parameters (Outcome) compared to pregnant women without any specific oral&#xD;
      prophylactic measures (Control)?&#xD;

    <description>To determine if pregnant women suffer from pre-eclampsia, several indices are measured (diastolic or systolic pressure and proteinuria or urinary protein/creatinine ratio).&#xD;
The combination of the results of pressure and proteinuria permits to classify of a woman as suffering from pre-eclampsia if:&#xD;
the diastolic pressure is higher than 90 mm Hg on two 4 hours intervals, or &gt; 110 mm Hg once, or systolic pressure &gt; 140 mm Hg on two 4 hours intervals, or &gt; 160 mm Hg once, after 20 weeks of gestation and,&#xD;
the proteinuria measured is of 2+ or more, or &gt; 300mg/24 hours, or &gt; 500mg/L or urinary protein/creatinine ratio &gt; 0.034g/mmol.</description>

    <description>For the study group, the oral prophylactic intervention will consist of provision of specfic package including soft-bristled manual toothbrush, toothpaste, and a kit of calibrated interdental brushes (IDBs)(Curaprox CPS; Curaden) of sizes corresponding to the diameter of their interdental spaces. The participants will be instructed to brush their teeeth twice-daily and to realise a daily interdental brushing until delivery. The instructions for the use of the toothbrush and IDBs comprised verbal instructions supported by practical demonstration. The first use of the material will be conducted under the supervision of a qualified public health professor.</description>
