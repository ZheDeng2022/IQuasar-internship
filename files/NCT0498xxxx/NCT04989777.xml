  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the most common cause of cardiogenic shock (CS), and CS&#xD;
      is the most common cause of death in patients with AMI. Percutaneous mechanical circulation&#xD;
      is one of the most important techniques in the treatment of AMICS. Intra-aortic balloon pump&#xD;
      (IABP) is the most commonly used mechanical circulatory assist device in clinic. However, the&#xD;
      existing clinical evidence shows that IABP can not improve the clinical outcome of patients&#xD;
      with AMICS. As for impella and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) system, there was&#xD;
      still no difference in overall mortality compared with IABP in AMICS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, IABP-shock II study is the largest randomized controlled study so far. However,&#xD;
      this study has limitations. In a recent retrospective study, the project team investigated&#xD;
      the use of IABP and the outcomes of more than 300 AMI cases in three provincial capitals of&#xD;
      Northeast China in 2016. It was found that the 28 day survival rate of patients in the early&#xD;
      use of IABP group was significantly higher than that in the late use group. The investigators&#xD;
      speculate that IABP may significantly improve the clinical outcomes of patients with AMICS if&#xD;
      it can be used in the earlier stage of CS (stage B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled study will involve 512 participants in&#xD;
      about 15 centers. Patients diagnosed with AMI (including STEMI and NSTEMI) complicated with&#xD;
      shock stage B (SCAI definition criteria) received early revascularization (PCI or CABG) and&#xD;
      standardized drug treatment according to the current guidelines before meeting the study&#xD;
      inclusion criteria. After reviewing the inclusion criteria, participants were randomized to&#xD;
      two groups (IABP group and control group) in a ratio of 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators speculated that IABP could significantly improve the clinical outcomes of&#xD;
      patients with AMICS if it could be used in the earlier stage of CS (stage B). At present,&#xD;
      there is no clinical study on the use of IABP in AMICS (stage B). It is worth carrying out&#xD;
      the corresponding clinical research, in order to study the real role of IABP in patients with&#xD;
      AMICS and explore the treatment strategy of AMICS in line with China's national conditions.&#xD;

      (A).Background AMICS is the most common cause of death in patients with coronary heart&#xD;
      disease. Even with modern treatment, including early reperfusion combined with mechanical&#xD;
      assistive devices, the 30-day mortality of AMICS is still close to 50%. At present,&#xD;
      mechanical assistive devices mainly include IABP, ECMO, and impalla.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As far as China's national conditions are concerned, IABP is still the most easily available&#xD;
      mechanical assistive device for clinical operation and management. IABP can reduce cardiac&#xD;
      afterload, decrease myocardial oxygen consumption and increase cardiac output in patients&#xD;
      with AMICS, which is helpful to protect the myocardium and improve end-organ perfusion. In&#xD;
      previous registration studies or retrospective analyses on IABP, the mortality of CS patients&#xD;
      using IABP was significantly lower than that of the control group. Therefore, the use of IABP&#xD;
      in patients with AMICS are class I recommendations in the early (before 2012) American and&#xD;
      European guidelines. Until 2012, the results of IABP-SHOCK II study were released, the effect&#xD;
      of IABP on patients with AMICS began to be questioned. IABP-SHOCK II study is the largest&#xD;
      randomized controlled study so far. Compared with traditional treatment, IABP did not improve&#xD;
      AMICS mortality in 30 days, 1 year, and 6 years. Subsequently, European guidelines did not&#xD;
      recommend routine use of IABP (level III recommendation) in AMICS, while American guidelines&#xD;
      changed from level I recommendation to level IIb recommendation . However, the IABP-SHOCK II&#xD;
      study has some limitations: (1) the severity of CS in the patients included in this study&#xD;
      varies greatly; (2) IABP was used relatively late (most patients received IABP treatment&#xD;
      after revascularization and severe tissue hypoperfusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CS patients are a heterogeneous population, and the prognosis may vary greatly with the&#xD;
      severity of shock. In order to guide treatment and predict clinical outcomes more accurately,&#xD;
      the consensus statement of clinical experts on classification of cardiogenic shock SCAI was&#xD;
      issued at the 42nd Annual Meeting of angiocardiography and intervention (SCAI) in 2019, which&#xD;
      divided CS into five stages: a (risk stage), B (initial stage), C (typical stage), D&#xD;
      (deterioration stage) and E (end stage). In the IABP-SHOCK II study, the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      of CS patients were (1) systolic blood pressure &lt; 90mmHg for more than 30min or the need for&#xD;
      catecholamine drugs to maintain systolic blood pressure &gt; 90mmHg with signs of pulmonary&#xD;
      congestion; (2) The symptoms of organ hypoperfusion (at least in accordance with the&#xD;
      following 1 item): (a) change of mental state; (b) The limbs and skin are cold and wet; (c)&#xD;
      The decrease of urine volume was less than 30ml / h; (d) Lactic acid &gt; 2.0mmol/l. Therefore,&#xD;
      patients with CS of stage C (typical stage) or more severity were included in IABP-SHOCK II&#xD;
      study. According to the &quot;Chinese expert consensus on diagnosis and treatment of cardiogenic&#xD;
      shock (2018)&quot;, it is emphasized that IABP should be implanted as soon as possible and&#xD;
      maintained for enough time in patients with AMICS. In addition, in a recent retrospective&#xD;
      study, the project team investigated the use of IABP and the outcomes of more than 300 AMI&#xD;
      cases in three provincial capitals of Northeast China in 2016. It was found that the 28-day&#xD;
      survival rate of patients in the early use of IABP group was significantly higher than that&#xD;
      in the late use group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators speculated that IABP could significantly improve the clinical outcomes of&#xD;
      patients with AMICS if it could be used in the earlier stage of CS (stage B). At present,&#xD;
      there is no clinical study on the use of IABP in AMICS (stage B). It is worth carrying out&#xD;
      the corresponding clinical research, in order to study the real role of IABP in patients with&#xD;
      AMICS and explore the treatment strategy of AMICS in line with China's national conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (B).Preliminary Data The clinical data of all patients receiving IABP treatment in 8 top&#xD;
      three hospitals in three provincial capitals of Northeast China. The reasons for receiving&#xD;
      IABP treatment, the duration of treatment and the clinical outcomes of patients were&#xD;
      recorded. At the same time, the high-risk PCI patients were analyzed according to early IABP&#xD;
      implantation (before PCI or at the same time) and late implantation (after PCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one of the eight hospitals is a heart center with more than 2000 cases of operation and&#xD;
      more than 200 cases of IABP implantation. The 28 day survival rate of patients with IABP&#xD;
      implantation is 87.9%, which is significantly higher than that of other hospitals. IABP is&#xD;
      widely used in high-risk PCI patients (77.5% of left main coronary artery disease, 13.9% of&#xD;
      multi vessel disease), patients with acute myocardial infarction ventricular septal&#xD;
      perforation and unable to carry out revascularization, and patients with severe myocarditis.&#xD;
      IABP treatment time is 12-186 hours, 28 day survival rate is 78.2%. Especially, the survival&#xD;
      rate of early IABP implantation was significantly higher than that of late group (89% vs.&#xD;
      63%, P &lt; 0.05) in high risk AMI with left main and multi-vessel lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
      (C). Research Design and Methodology This multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled&#xD;
      study will involve 512 participants in about 15 centers. Patients diagnosed with AMI&#xD;
      (including STEMI and NSTEMI) complicated with shock stage B (SCAI definition criteria)&#xD;
      received early revascularization (PCI or CABG) and standardized drug treatment according to&#xD;
      the current guidelines before meeting the study inclusion criteria. After reviewing the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria, participants were randomized to two groups (IABP group and control group)&#xD;
      in a ratio of 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inclusion criteria (1) Patients aged 18-85 years with AMI (STEMI or NSTEMI) and shock&#xD;
           stage B (SCAI definition criteria); (2) Plan to implement revascularization (PCI or&#xD;
           CABG) (3) Hypotension: SBP &lt; 90mmHg or map &lt; 60mmhg or decrease &gt; 30mmhg from baseline,&#xD;
           more than 30min under the condition of sufficient blood volume; (4) No signs of&#xD;
           hypoperfusion (if one of the following conditions is met): :1) Good mental state; 2) The&#xD;
           extremities were warm without cold and wet; 3) Lactic acid ≤ 2 mm; 4) Normal renal&#xD;
           function or mild renal impairment (creatinine increase less than one time or GFR&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. Exclusion criteria (1) Age &gt; 85; (2) CPR &gt; 30 min; (3) Stage C-E in SCAI shock&#xD;
           definition criteria; (4) Acute pulmonary embolism; (5) Mechanical complications, such as&#xD;
           ventricular septal perforation, acute mitral regurgitation; (6) Non drug induced severe&#xD;
           central nervous system dysfunction; (7) Other causes of shock, such as septic shock,&#xD;
           hemorrhagic shock, ketoacidosis; (8) Aortic insufficiency above grade II; (9) Difficulty&#xD;
           in IABP implantation due to severe peripheral vascular disease; (10) Combined with other&#xD;
           serious diseases and life expectancy &lt; 12 months; (11) Refusal to sign informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Primary endpoint: 30 day all-cause death (2) Secondary endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Key secondary endpoints: all cause death, cardiac death, readmission of heart failure,&#xD;
           NYHA I / II ratio of cardiac function, KCQQ score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Other secondary end points: ① Monitoring treatment parameters: the proportion of shock&#xD;
           progressing to SCAI stage C / D / E, the time required for hemodynamic stability, the&#xD;
           dosage and type of vasoactive drugs, the length of stay in CCU unit, and the use rate of&#xD;
           more advanced cardiac assistive devices (ECMO and impalar). ② Myocardial perfusion and&#xD;
           microcirculation flow score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (3) Primary safety end point: Gusto defined massive or life-threatening bleeding, disabling&#xD;
      stroke, peripheral vascular complications requiring surgical or interventional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sample size estimation According to the results of previous studies on SCAI shock, the&#xD;
           retrospective statistical results of the three northeastern provinces in the early stage&#xD;
           of IABP and the recommendations of the expert group, it is estimated that the event rate&#xD;
           of the control group is 34%, and that of the IABP group is 22%. In order to detect the&#xD;
           relative risk of 35% reduction in bilateral α According to the statistical power&#xD;
           calculation of 5% and 80%, and considering the shedding rate of 10%, 256 patients /&#xD;
           group (a total of 512 patients) were calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Effectiveness and safety analysis The measurement data and counting data passed t test,&#xD;
           chi square test or Fisher test. Survival analysis was used to describe the primary and&#xD;
           secondary endpoints. Log rank sum test was used for comparison between the study groups.&#xD;
           Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the risk ratio of each&#xD;
           endpoint.&#xD;
