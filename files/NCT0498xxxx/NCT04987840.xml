  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate implementation of diagnostic stewardship programs&#xD;
      as a strategy to safely reduce antibiotic use, and to generate evidence and tools to support&#xD;
      dissemination of diagnostic stewardship programs to a large and diverse group of hospitals.&#xD;

      The Bright STAR Collaborative, or Testing STewardship to reduce Antibiotic Resistance&#xD;
      Collaborative, is a prospective multicenter quality improvement (QI) program with the goal of&#xD;
      implementing diagnostic stewardship interventions to reduce bacterial culture use as a&#xD;
      strategy to reduce antibiotic overuse. Investigators will use data collected by participating&#xD;
      sites to determine whether reliable implementation of clinical practice guidelines for&#xD;
      evaluation of patients can decrease antibiotic use in pediatric intensive care units.&#xD;
      Investigators will perform a quasi-experimental study to compare outcome data in pre- and&#xD;
      post- periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Greater than or equal to 10 institutions will participate in this collaborative.&#xD;
      Participating institutions will develop and implement an evidenced-based clinical&#xD;
      decision-making tool as part of their quality improvement (QI) program in their pediatric&#xD;
      intensive care unit (PICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Evaluate whether locally devised quality improvement programs focused on&#xD;
      diagnostic stewardship of respiratory cultures lead to a reduction in respiratory cultures&#xD;
      and antibiotic use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine whether these quality improvement initiatives are associated&#xD;
      with unintended consequence of patient harm such as mortality, length of stay, readmissions,&#xD;
      ventilator associated infections, sepsis and septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables: total respiratory culture rates, culture results, ICU length of stay, mortality&#xD;
      rates, hospital and ICU readmission, cause of death, ventilator-associated&#xD;
      infection/ventilator-associated condition rate, sepsis, septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: The analytic approach equates to estimating and comparing the respiratory culture&#xD;
      incidence during the &quot;baseline/pre-implementation&quot; and &quot;post-implementation&quot; periods, using a&#xD;
      generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) assuming a Poisson distribution for the monthly number&#xD;
      of respiratory cultures with the monthly number of ventilator days as an offset. Similar&#xD;
      analyses will be performed for secondary outcomes.&#xD;
