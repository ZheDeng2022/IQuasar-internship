    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by permanent bronchiectasis,&#xD;
      its main clinical symptoms are cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis and recurrent respiratory tract&#xD;
      infections. The incidence and prevalence of bronchiectasis have assumed continuously grows in&#xD;
      global. Different from overseas, bronchiectasis is common disease in China. In 2013, the&#xD;
      prevalence rate of bronchiectasis in Chinese residents over 40 years old was 1,200/100,000.&#xD;
      As lack of large epidemiological data in China, the prevalence rate may still be&#xD;
      underestimated, which needs more attention and research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchiectasis has heavy disease burden, characterized by recurrent acute exacerbations, high&#xD;
      mortality, poor prognosis and heavy economic burden. The key points of bronchiectasis&#xD;
      treatment strategy include exacerbation prevention, number of exacerbations reduction,&#xD;
      prognosis improvement and then the quality of patients' life improvement. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      important to describe the clinical features and prognosis of bronchiectasis (especially the&#xD;
      incidence of acute exacerbations and the proportion of frequent exacerbations), and it would&#xD;
      be helpful to understand the characteristics of bronchiectasis and standardize related&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will collect data from the real-world bronchiectasis database and follow up for&#xD;
      one year, describe the bronchiectasis exacerbation rate and proportions for frequent&#xD;
      exacerbation, clinical features and prognosis of bronchiectasis exacerbation, the treatment&#xD;
      pattern (when clinically stable) during follow-up period; and describe characteristics of&#xD;
      bronchiectasis at baseline. This study will also explore potential baseline risk factors for&#xD;
      bronchiectasis exacerbation during follow-up period.&#xD;

        It is designed that from 2021 Q4 to 2022 Q2, 1,250 bronchiectasis patients will be enrolled&#xD;
        from 30 participating sites in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
        *Bronchiectasis exacerbation defined as patients have three or more of the following six&#xD;
        symptoms including cough, expectoration, purulent sputum, dyspnoea, fatigue, haemoptysis,&#xD;
        and these symptoms persist more than 48 hours, and physicians prescribe systemic&#xD;
        antibiotics due to these symptoms.&#xD;
