  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In our Supplement Aim we will conduct a two-arm randomized pilot test of the adapted&#xD;
      intervention compared to a usual care control group among 30 African American/Black women&#xD;
      with HIV (15/arm) to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the mindfulness-based stress&#xD;
      reduction among women with HIV with mild cognitive impairment. Feasibility will be assessed&#xD;
      by our ability to (1) recruit, randomize, and retain participants and (2) deliver the&#xD;
      intervention per the manual, as well as (3) participants adherence to home practices and&#xD;
      assignments. Acceptability will be assessed via qualitative data (focus group input regarding&#xD;
      participants' satisfaction with the intervention and intent to continue using the practices),&#xD;
      as well quantitative data (satisfaction survey).&#xD;

    <measure>Feasibility of the mindfulness intervention in women with mild cognitive impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately post-intervention or 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will be assessed through the following: recruitment of 30 participants over a period of 12 weeks (3 months); completion of post-intervention survey and exit interview by 75% of participants; 66% (n=9-10) of participants will attend 6 out of 8 sessions remotely or face-to-face and 50% (n= 7-8) of participants will attend the all-day retreat; and 80% of participants (n=24) will be retained throughout the study. We will assess fidelity with the goal of 80% or greater adherence to the intervention manual. Percent of home practice completed over 8 weeks will be assessed via self-report.</description>

    <ipd_description>The University of Alabama at Birmingham maintains the following universal data sharing policy for all investigators:&#xD;
Data will be made available, in accordance with the NIH Data Sharing Policy (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing) to all researchers in both the private and public sector free or for a nominal charge and with minimal restriction. In some cases the institution may determine that the public and the research community are better served by a licensing program whether or not patents have been filed. This may be relevant, for example, if a tool is best distributed under license to guarantee reagent availability and quality.&#xD;
As a means of sharing knowledge, NIH encourages grantees to arrange for publication of NIH-supported original research in primary scientific journals. We therefore will strive to publish our findings in a timely manner and acknowledge that the research was supported by the NIH.</ipd_description>
