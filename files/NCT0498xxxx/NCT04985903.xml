  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a combined intervention that pairs SMS smoking cessation&#xD;
      messages for patients with individualized training for OB clinicians to improve quit rates&#xD;
      among pregnant smoking. The aim is to determine the effect of the intervention versus control&#xD;
      on smoking cessation outcomes on patient smoking cessation. The investigators will recruit&#xD;
      patients at their first OB visit who report smoking at Duke and Pitt. Patients in both the&#xD;
      control and intervention arm will receive smoking cessation support messages throughout their&#xD;
      pregnancy. OB clinicians in the intervention arm will receive tailored smoking cessation&#xD;
      counseling training. Clinicians in both arms will receive a one-time 5 A lecture. The&#xD;
      investigators will analyze smoking cessation outcomes and audio recordings. This is a minimal&#xD;
      risk study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a two-arm cluster randomized controlled design, in which the unit&#xD;
      of randomization is the OB clinician. 50 OB clinicians will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      the intervention or control condition. Although the unit of randomization is the clinician,&#xD;
      the unit of evaluation is the patient: 15 patients per clinician (4 Pre-intervention and 11&#xD;
      Post-intervention) who receive prenatal care from enrolled OB clinicians at Duke and UPitt.&#xD;
      The investigators will collect 4 Pre-Intervention audio-recorded initial OB visit encounters&#xD;
      to assess pre-intervention levels of clinician communication skills and also to tailor the&#xD;
      clinician training program. After the Pre-Intervention Phase, the investigators will&#xD;
      randomize OB clinicians to either the intervention or control arm (see details of cluster&#xD;
      randomization below). All OB clinicians will attend a lecture about the consequences of&#xD;
      smoking during pregnancy and the elements of the 5 A's. Only OB clinicians randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention arm will receive an individually-tailored, user-friendly, web-based program that&#xD;
      teaches the 5 A's. In the Post-Intervention Phase, the investigators will assess the effect&#xD;
      of the communication program by audio recording initial OB visits for 11 pregnant women who&#xD;
      smoke for each OB clinician in both arms (n=750 total). The investigators will provide all&#xD;
      patients the SMS text-delivered intervention. Additionally, the investigators will survey&#xD;
      these patients before their visit, immediately after their visit, at the end-of-pregnancy,&#xD;
      and 6-weeks postpartum. Due to anticipated study attrition, the investigators will recruit up&#xD;
      60 clinicians and 900 patients at both sites until the investigators reach a complete data&#xD;
      set for our desired sample size. Biochemically validated smoking cessation at&#xD;
      end-of-pregnancy is the primary outcome (Aim 1). To assess Aim 2, investigators will code for&#xD;
      clinician use of the 5 A's in the audio-recorded encounters and analyze patient perceptions&#xD;
      of the communication from post-encounter data and the post-study survey for clinicians. To&#xD;
      assess Aim 3, investigators will collect smoking status at 6 weeks postpartum.&#xD;
