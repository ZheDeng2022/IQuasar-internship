      This prospective, multicenter, two-arm, 1:1 randomized controlled trial (RCT) will enroll&#xD;
      approximately 250 males at approximately 25 sites located within the United States. All&#xD;
      enrolled subjects will be 45 years of age or older diagnosed with symptomatic benign&#xD;
      prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). They will be randomized to one of two readily available,&#xD;
      marketed BPH therapies; Prostatic Urethral Lift procedure with the UroLift System (PUL Arm)&#xD;
      or 0.4mg tamsulosin HCl (MED Arm).&#xD;

      hyperplasia (BPH). BPH symptoms may range from mild (8) to severe (35) on the IPSS scale. All&#xD;
      enrolled men must meet selection criteria and be candidates for therapy with both UroLift&#xD;
      System and 0.4 mg tamsulosin HCl.&#xD;

    <description>The primary study analysis compares the change in BPH symptoms in the PUL Arm to the change in BPH symptoms in the MED Arm measured 3 months after BPH therapy initiation. This will be measure by International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) percent change. IPSS ranges from 0-35, healthier patients have lower scores than patients more effected by BPH symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life (QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after BPH Therapy Initiation</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary analysis assesses the change in quality of life (QoL) due to urinary symptoms between the PUL and MED Arms measured 3 months after initiation of BPH therapy. This will be measured by change in QoL, ranging from 0-6. Healthier patients have lower scores than patients more effected by BPH symptoms.</description>
