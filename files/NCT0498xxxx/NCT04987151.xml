  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Numerous studies support the practice of different physical exercise modalities&#xD;
      as an effective treatment to address the different problems associated with schizophrenia,&#xD;
      reporting that they result in significant improvements in patient symptoms and quality of&#xD;
      life. Given the lack of studies comparing different types of training in controlled&#xD;
      environments, the aim of this proposed study will be to compare the effects of three physical&#xD;
      exercise programs (strength, aerobic, and mixed) on the symptoms, body composition, level of&#xD;
      physical activity, and health-related quality of life of patients with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and dissemination: This study was approved by the ethics committees for Biomedical&#xD;
      Research at the CEU Cardenal Herrera University of Valencia in Spain (reference number:&#xD;
      CEI18/215). Participants will be fully informed of the purpose and procedures of the study,&#xD;
      and written informed consent will be obtained from every participant. The results from this&#xD;
      study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented in scientific conferences.&#xD;

      The aim of this proposed study will be to compare the effects of three physical exercise&#xD;
      programs (strength, aerobic, and mixed) on the symptoms, body composition, level of physical&#xD;
      activity, and health-related quality of life of patients with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicentre, single-blinded (evaluator), randomised, wait-list controlled (ratio 2:2:2:1)&#xD;
      trial will be conducted with 105 patients recruited from different psychosocial care centres.&#xD;
      The participants will be randomised into three 16-week training groups comprising 48 sessions&#xD;
      lasting one hour each, or to the wait-list control group. The training groups will complete&#xD;
      aerobic, strength, or mixed (aerobic + strength) training. The participants will be assessed&#xD;
      before, immediately after, and 6 months after the end of the intervention. All the patients&#xD;
      in the wait-list control group (n = 15) will receive one of the three trainings immediately&#xD;
      after the intervention. The study variables will include positive symptomatology, negative&#xD;
      symptomatology, and general symptomology (using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) as&#xD;
      the primary outcome; as secondary outcome: body composition (by assessing body mass index,&#xD;
      body fat mass and waist circumference), physical activity levels (International Physical&#xD;
      Activity Questionnaire-Short Form), and quality of life (abbreviated World Health&#xD;
      Organization Quality of Life questionnaire).&#xD;
