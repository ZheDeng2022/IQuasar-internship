  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the nap duration that achieves maximal cognitive gain with practicality of&#xD;
      implementation, the present work employs a within-subject design comparing nap durations of&#xD;
      10 minutes, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes with a no nap condition on benefits to alertness,&#xD;
      vigilance, mood, speed of processing and memory over post-nap intervals of 5 minutes, 30&#xD;
      minutes, 60 minutes and 240 minutes. The effect of nap duration on memory encoding will also&#xD;
      be examined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Naps are a global phenomenon and a commonly adopted lifestyle countermeasure to reduce&#xD;
      sleepiness and performance impairments. Experimental studies have also shown that naps can&#xD;
      improve cognitive functioning and enhance memory and mood. However, the implementation of&#xD;
      naps is highly varied amongst individuals, and it remains uncertain what duration of naps&#xD;
      achieves the greatest cognitive benefit. Given the potential for naps to boost productivity&#xD;
      in societies such as ours where insufficient nocturnal sleep is prevalent and where work&#xD;
      hours are long, an investigation of the optimal nap duration is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies suggest that the benefits of brief naps (5-15 minutes) occur immediately&#xD;
      after the nap and last a limited period (1-3 hours). Longer naps (&gt;30 minutes) are more&#xD;
      likely to produce some temporary decrements due to sleep inertia but have the potential to&#xD;
      improve cognitive performance for a more sustained period. These findings need to be&#xD;
      strengthened through replication and extended to include memory measures that are evaluated&#xD;
      over a longer post-nap testing period. To evaluate the nap duration that achieves maximal&#xD;
      cognitive gain with practicality of implementation, the present work employs a within-subject&#xD;
      design comparing nap durations of 10 minutes, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes with a no nap&#xD;
      condition on benefits to alertness, vigilance, mood, speed of processing and memory over&#xD;
      post-nap intervals of 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes and 240 minutes. The effect of nap&#xD;
      duration on memory encoding will also be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's findings are expected to inform theoretical models of sleep and cognition&#xD;
      and will aid in the design of practical lifestyle strategies to alleviate sleepiness and&#xD;
      improve cognitive performance that may be adopted in an everyday context to boost societal&#xD;
      well-being and productivity.&#xD;

    <measure>Picture encoding task</measure>
    <time_frame>In total: 35-45 min</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will observe pictures of non-famous people, landscapes, scenes and objects. Later they are tested on whether they remember seeing the picture previously or not. The encoding session will take 20-30 min, and the retrieval session will take 15 min.</description>

    <measure>Levels of sleepiness</measure>
    <time_frame>1 min</time_frame>
    <description>Karolinska Sleepiness Scale. Participants rated their level of subjective sleepiness on a 9-point Likert scale (1 - very alert, 9 - very sleepy, great effort to keep awake).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood</measure>
    <time_frame>1 min</time_frame>
    <description>Positive and Negative Affect Scale. On the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), participants responded to 20 adjectives describing positive and negative mood states on a 5-point Likert scale (1 - very slightly, 5 - extremely). Positive and negative affect scores are represented by the sum of the item responses.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Vigilance</measure>
    <time_frame>3 min</time_frame>
    <description>Psychomotor Vigilance Test. The 3-min PVT assessed levels of sustained attention. At intervals varying randomly from 2000 ms to 10000 ms, a counter on the screen appeared and participants were to press a key as quickly as possible. Lapses were defined as responses exceeding 500 ms.</description>

    <measure>Speed of processing</measure>
    <time_frame>2 min</time_frame>
    <description>Digit Symbol Substitution Test. The 2-min DSST was used as a measure of speed of processing. In this task, participants were required to match symbols to digits as quickly as possible following a key shown on screen. The total number of correct trials was used as the critical measure.</description>
