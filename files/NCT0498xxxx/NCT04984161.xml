  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project; It is a quasi-experimental prospective study in a single group pre-test&#xD;
      post-test order. No randomization will be made in the selection of the sample, and 30 nurses&#xD;
      working in the Pediatric Surgery Clinic in hospitals in Izmir and meeting the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be included in the study. The data of the study will be collected through the&#xD;
      Nurse Descriptive Characteristics Questionnaire and the Pediatric Stoma Care Knowledge and&#xD;
      Skills Questionnaire. Pre-training introductory characteristics and pediatric stoma care&#xD;
      knowledge and skill level of all nurses participating in the study will be measured. After&#xD;
      the measurement, the nurses participating in the study will be given training on pediatric&#xD;
      stoma care. Immediately after the training and three months later, the pediatric stoma care&#xD;
      knowledge and skill levels of the nurses participating in the study will be re-measured. The&#xD;
      introductory characteristics of the nurses involved in the project will be given as number&#xD;
      and percentage distributions. Comparisons between nurses' introductory characteristics and&#xD;
      Stoma Knowledge and Skills Questionnaire before and after education; It will be evaluated by&#xD;
      non-parametric or parametric appropriate test. Comparisons between nurses' Stoma Knowledge&#xD;
      and Skills Questionnaire scores in the pre- and post-education period will be evaluated by&#xD;
      non-parametric or parametric appropriate test in dependent groups. The statistical&#xD;
      significance value of the project was determined as pâ‰¤0.005. It is planned that the results&#xD;
      of the project will mediate an international article and statement in which the effect of&#xD;
      stoma care education on the knowledge and skill level of pediatric surgery nurses is&#xD;
      presented. As a result of the project, if it is determined that stoma care education has an&#xD;
      effect on the knowledge and skill level of pediatric surgery nurses, it is predicted that the&#xD;
      quality of care of children with stoma who receive care in other institutions and&#xD;
      organizations can be increased and the comfort of the child can be increased.&#xD;
