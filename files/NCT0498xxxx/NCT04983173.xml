  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of suboptimal ovarian responders remains a challenging task in IVF. These&#xD;
      patients are frequently managed with an intense stimulation protocol of ovarian stimulation&#xD;
      in order obtain the maximum number of embryos and, therefore, maximize the cumulative live&#xD;
      birth rate. However, the concept of &quot;the more the better&quot; has been recently defied by the one&#xD;
      of &quot;mild stimulation&quot;. Defenders of this protocol state that with mild stimulation only the&#xD;
      best quality oocytes are allowed to grow and, therefore, higher quality embryos will be&#xD;
      obtained. However, the impact of the intensity of ovarian stimulation on embryo quality is&#xD;
      far from consensual. Moreover, its effect on early embryo development has never been&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators set out to perform this randomized controlled trial comparing&#xD;
      the number of GQB and the morphokinetic parameters of early embryo development in infertile&#xD;
      patients undergoing two different intensities of ovarian stimulation, a milder approach (CC&#xD;
      plus 150 IU daily dose of rFSH) and a more intense approach (300 IU daily dose of rFSH).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the lack of a consistent definition for &quot;mild stimulation&quot; (MS), the International&#xD;
      Society for Mild Approaches in Assisted Reproduction defined it as a protocol performed with&#xD;
      gonadotropins, alone or with oral compounds, at lower doses or for a shorter duration, with&#xD;
      the aim of achieving 2-7 oocytes. One of the strategies proposed for MS is the use of&#xD;
      Clomiphene Citrate (CC). CC acts as a selective estrogen-receptor modulator. By blocking&#xD;
      estrogen receptors in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, it increases the production of&#xD;
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and, as a result, FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH).&#xD;
      Moreover, CC increases the pituitary sensitivity to GnRH and granulosa cell sensitivity to&#xD;
      pituitary gonadotropins. Taking these actions into account, several protocols have adopted a&#xD;
      combination of CC and exogenous gonadotropins with the aim of improving follicular&#xD;
      recruitment and, therefore, ovarian response to stimulation, in patients undergoing in vitro&#xD;
      fertilization (IVF). The available evidence has allowed for the inclusion of CC in&#xD;
      international guidelines as a treatment option, alone or in combination with gonadotropins,&#xD;
      equally recommended in the management of poor responders when compared to gonadotropin&#xD;
      stimulation alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept behind MS is that, with this approach, only the healthier follicles with higher&#xD;
      quality oocytes are allowed to grow. Proponents of this protocol state that MS reduces the&#xD;
      risk of multiple pregnancy and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), as well as patient&#xD;
      dropout rate and treatment costs. However, evidence regarding clinical outcomes is far from&#xD;
      consensual. The best available evidence regarding MS in predicted poor responders comes from&#xD;
      the OPTIMIST trial, showing no difference in the cumulative live birth rates when a mild&#xD;
      approach, using 150 IU of rFSH, was compared to an individualized protocol of 225/450 IU&#xD;
      rFSH. However, several methodological inconsistencies have been pointed out in this&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial. In particular, a black hole was left in the management of&#xD;
      predicted low responders with an intermediate prognosis (antral follicle count between 8-10),&#xD;
      taking into account the allowance for dose adjustments in the second cycle in the 150 IU&#xD;
      group. Considering that the control group was treated with rFSH 225 IU daily, a comparison of&#xD;
      two identical doses might have been provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence regarding the effect of MS on embryo quality is also conflicting. Baart et al. first&#xD;
      reported a lower aneuploidy rate following MS when compared to conventional protocols and&#xD;
      concluded that mitotic segregation errors might increase with growing gonadotropin dosages.&#xD;
      However, this has not been confirmed in recent studies. As for the number of good quality&#xD;
      embryos, while previous studies have shown no difference regarding MS and conventional&#xD;
      protocols, Vermey et al found a positive correlation between the number of retrieved oocytes&#xD;
      and the embryo quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although these previous studies provide some valuable information, the heterogeneity of the&#xD;
      available evidence cannot be disregarded. Moreover, to the best our knowledge, the effect of&#xD;
      the intensity of ovarian stimulation on early embryo development has not been previously&#xD;
      described. Therefore, the investigators set out to perform this randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      comparing the number of good quality blastocysts (GQB) and morphokinetic parameters of early&#xD;
      embryo development in patients with a predicted suboptimal ovarian response undergoing two&#xD;
      different intensities of ovarian stimulation, a milder (CC 50 mg/day from cycle D2-6 + rFSH&#xD;
      150 IU daily from D2 onwards) and a more intense approach (300 IU daily dose of rFSH starting&#xD;
      on cycle D2).&#xD;
