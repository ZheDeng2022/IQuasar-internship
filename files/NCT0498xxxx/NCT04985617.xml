  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: This study was conducted to examine the effect of warmed intravenous fluids (WIVF)&#xD;
      on the core body temperature and the patients' thermal comforts during the postoperative&#xD;
      period in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This was a prospective, randomized controlled experimental study. Methods: A total of&#xD;
      105 male patients undergoing TURP surgery and bladder irrigation were randomized to one of&#xD;
      either room temperature (n=51) or warmed intravenous fluids (n=54) groups in postanesthesia&#xD;
      care unit. The fluids in the experimental group were warmed until the body temperature was&#xD;
      reached 36.0°C.&#xD;

    <description>Thermal Comfort Scale (TCS): This is a Likert type scale which was developed by Wagner et. al. (2006) and the validity and reliability in Turkish was tested by Özsaban (2017). The evaluation of thermal comfort was made by the face to face interview method for all patients. The TCS evaluates the patient's temperature comfort perception subjectively. The scale consists of 13 items in total, and each item is scored between 1 and 6 points. A high score indicates a high temperature comfort level.</description>

    <ipd_description>When patients recovered from the effect of anesthesia, awakened and were able to switch to normal spontaneous breathing, they were taken from the sober unit to the service or intensive care unit, and subsequent follow-ups were carried out by the researcher in these units. The IV fluid given to the patients in the intervention group was heated to 36ºC using the medical heating device, and the IV fluid given to the patients in the control group was given at room temperature without heating. The environment temperature of the room was the same in the service, intensive care, and recovery units on the same day. The environment temperature of the room varied between 20ºC and 25ºC on the different days on which the research was implemented. The air humidity level was between 32% and 45%. Body temperature was measured as soon as the infusion started and was repeated every 60 minutes using a &quot;tympanic thermometer&quot;.</ipd_description>
