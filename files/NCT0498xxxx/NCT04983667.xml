  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism and associated entities, grouped under the Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is the&#xD;
      fastest growing intellectual disability in the world, statistics signal for a 1 to 3%&#xD;
      prevalence on infants. The cause is unknown, although some data suggest that zinc deficiency&#xD;
      during pregnancy may have an important role in its presentation. This study seeks to&#xD;
      supplement the nutrition of randomly selected prospective and actually pregnant women with a&#xD;
      zinc-Amino-acid complex (Zn-AA), during pregnancy and early lactation, and compare the rate&#xD;
      of ASD in their offspring with the rate in a similar and also randomly selected cohort of non&#xD;
      supplemented women, to assess if Zn-AA supplementation during pregnancy has any effect on&#xD;
      this outcome&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Autism and associated disorders (Autism Spectrum Disorders, ASD) is the fastest growing&#xD;
      disability in the world, statistics indicate a prevalence of between 1 and 3%. This entity is&#xD;
      the one that generates more stress in families, four times more than in a neuro-typical&#xD;
      family and twice more than in a family with any other disability. Besides, this condition&#xD;
      increases health spending for the family, the state and the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By not knowing the cause, and witnessing the growth of this disability, with the prevalence&#xD;
      described, and the births reported in 2019 in Mexico (2,092,214), we expect between 20,922&#xD;
      and 62,766 new cases in our country each year. In Nuevo León, a state in the northeast of&#xD;
      Mexico, the average birth rate per year from 2017 to 2019 (latest official data available) is&#xD;
      91,484, which makes us estimate an incidence of 915 to 2744, for the same period. ASD is also&#xD;
      a family stressful disability, associated to a high rate of separations, social isolation and&#xD;
      divorces, which leads to social problems of alarming dimensions. In the United States, for&#xD;
      2025 the cost of Autism is projected at 1 trillion dollars, associated with medications,&#xD;
      interventions and educational expenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Mexico, the lack of universal diagnostic screening, detection and intervention programs&#xD;
      before the age of three years makes those affected to require important support throughout&#xD;
      their lives, since the benefits of early intervention are lost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project consists of two parts. The first is the Primary Study. It consists of&#xD;
      establishing whether the supplementation of Zinc-AA complexes, in women during pregnancy and&#xD;
      lactation, has any effect on the prevalence of Autism and if it favorably modifies the&#xD;
      immunological and metabolic status of the mother and the progeny; seeks to confirm the&#xD;
      findings that our group of investigators has obtained in published pre-clinical&#xD;
      investigations that found that a Zinc deficiency in the mother (mice and human erythrocytes),&#xD;
      caused by dietary factors, provokes changes in the morphology of the intestine of the&#xD;
      progeny, as well as modifications in the microbiota and increased inflammatory markers in the&#xD;
      blood and brain, similar to those reported in people with Autism. In Latin America, the diet&#xD;
      is based on cereals, and i so abundant in dietary fiber and phytates. These factors, along&#xD;
      supplements usually recommended to mothers who plan to become pregnant (Calcium, Iron and&#xD;
      Folic Acid), predispose these women to Zinc deficiency. We are also proposing a Secondary&#xD;
      Study, to establish the zinc status and the characteristics of the intestinal microbiome in&#xD;
      young, non-pregnant adult women, as a comparative reference standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, there are no projects in the world that seek to partially or totally solve the&#xD;
      causes of Autism, this is the first study that seeks to prevent the problems associated with&#xD;
      autism and could be the first to influence the reduction of the incidence of Autism. This&#xD;
      project will involve Mexican researchers from Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores&#xD;
      de Monterrey (ITESM), as well as researchers from the University of Limerick, Ireland, from&#xD;
      the University Clinic of the Autonomous University of Nuevo León, in the northeast of Mexico;&#xD;
      as well as the Laboratory of Dr. Fanis Missirlis, of the National Polytechnic Institute, in&#xD;
      Mexico City.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project has the financial support of the International Zinc Association (IZA), managed&#xD;
      by Zinpro Corp., represented in Mexico by Elemend Salud, representative Ing. Guillermo Vela&#xD;
      Staines (g.vela@zinpro.com).&#xD;
