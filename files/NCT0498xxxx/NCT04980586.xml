      Cheeks Appearance for Sleep Apnea (CASA score) is a screening tool developed to observe&#xD;
      adults people cheeks appearance to identify volume, being 0 for no volume, 1 for mild volume,&#xD;
      2 for moderate volume and 3 for severe volume; or flaccidity, being 0 for no flaccidity, 1&#xD;
      for mild flaccidity, 2 for moderate flaccidity and 3 for severe flaccidity. In the end of&#xD;
      CASA score screening we sum up the score of volume with the score and the flaccidity score to&#xD;
      reach the CASA score, the final result that can range from 0 to 6 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was applied in three moments, being the first one only the application of CASA&#xD;
      score and a facial imaging to facilitate the replicability. The data collection and&#xD;
      enrollment of 248 participants were made in a sleep private clinic in participants undergoing&#xD;
      polysomnography. All this part of data collection was applied for a 3 months period. This&#xD;
      first part was the validation of CASA score protocol with internal validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part was carried out 1 year after in which all participants enrolled were&#xD;
      evaluated by CASA score and facial imaging, as the first part, in a sleep private clinic&#xD;
      while doing polysomnography. Additionally, procedures such as ultrasonography images of&#xD;
      specific orofacial muscles, followed by tongue and cheeks pressure evaluation were carried&#xD;
      out just after the CASA score and facial imaging based on photography registers. In this&#xD;
      second part, others 71 participants were recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third and last part was a case-control study in which 20 of the 71 anterior part of the&#xD;
      data collection were invited to take part in the last part of the study, that was the&#xD;
      fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing, so 10 non obstructive sleep apnea&#xD;
      participants and 10 obstructive sleep apnea participants were chosen and invited, 19 accepted&#xD;
      and carried out the last part. This last part was underwent in an outpatient clinic of an&#xD;
      otorhinolaryngologist or ear, nose and throat physician (ENT) with a Speech and Language&#xD;
      Therapist (SLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasonography was made with a portable device which was positioned in the face of the&#xD;
      participant and slide for the direction needed to capture the image of the muscle targeted&#xD;
      like masseter, buccinator and tongue. Those were the three muscles evaluated by the&#xD;
      ultrasonography exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tongue and cheeks pressure evaluation was made with IOPI medical equipment which had a small&#xD;
      bulb coupled in the device and its bulb was positioned inside the mouth of the participant in&#xD;
      the tongue and the participant was instructed to press as hard as he could against the hard&#xD;
      palate. In the cheeks was positioned in the oral vestibule between the cheek and the teeth,&#xD;
      and the pressure was applied by the cheeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES): a micro camera of a endoscopy was&#xD;
      inserted in the participant nose to look the nasopharynx and oropharynx. The fiberoptic was&#xD;
      kept in the nasopharynx to see the participant eating, first a liquid consistency (5 and 10&#xD;
      ML), pureed consistency (5 and 10 ML) and solid food (half cracker and 1 whole cracker). The&#xD;
      whole exam lasted 15 to 20 minutes, maximum.&#xD;
