  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To expand the access and delivery of COVID-19 Vaccines in Africa (ECOVA), the investigators&#xD;
      will conduct a phase 3, individually randomized, observer-blind, controlled (influenza&#xD;
      vaccine) trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the BBIBP-CorV vaccine against any&#xD;
      severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV- 2) infection among adults 18 years and older.&#xD;
      The BBIBP-CorV vaccine is an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Vero cell) manufactured by the&#xD;
      Beijing Institute of Biological Products (BIBP), China National Biotec Group (CNBG),&#xD;
      Sinopharm, Beijing, People's Republic of China and received emergency use authorization (EUA)&#xD;
      from World Health Organization (WHO).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized, observer-blind, controlled, phase 3 trial will&#xD;
      be conducted to assess the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of two doses of intramuscular&#xD;
      BBIBP-CorV vaccine, followed by a booster dose, in adults 18 years of age and older. . Study&#xD;
      Arms 1 and 2 will have two groups: group 1 - HIV-uninfected receiving BBIBP-CorV or Flu&#xD;
      Quadrivalent; group 2 - HIV-infected receiving BBIBP-CorV or Flu Quadrivalent. Arm 3 will&#xD;
      have 1 group - HIV-uninfected co-administration group receiving both vaccines. The&#xD;
      randomization will be stratified by HIV status. Active surveillance for covid-19 will be&#xD;
      carried out and immunogenicity will be assessed for a subset of population.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The PI, study staff, and participants will be blinded as to receipt of study vaccine or comparator. The pharmacy staff preparing the vaccine syringes and the study nurse who is administering the vaccine will not be involved in the safety assessment of participants and will be instructed not to comment on the experimental agent to study staff. Enrollment numbers will be assigned sequentially by the study nurse/pharmacist upon confirmation of eligibility and enrollment into the study according to their Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) stratification by the Investigator. All case report forms (CRFs) and source documents will be labeled with the enrollment number and study visit number. Personal identifying information linking the study number to an individual volunteer will not be captured on case report form (CRF) as study data.</masking_description>
