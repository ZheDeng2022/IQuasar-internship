    <measure>SjS participants: Change from baseline in Eular Sjögren's Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) after 24 weeks of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The ESSDAI is an established disease outcome measure for Sjögren's syndrome that classifies disease activity in 3-4 levels according to their severity (i.e., no, low, moderate, high), over each of 12 organ-specific domains. These scores are then summed across the 12 domains in a weighted manner to provide the total score: biologic (1), hematologic (2), articular (2), glandular (2), cutaneous (3), constitutional (3), lymphadenopathy (4), renal (5), pulmonary (5), PNS (5), CNS (5) and muscular (6). The maximum possible score is 123, where a higher ESSDAI score indicates more severe symptoms. A negative change score from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, weeks 4, 8, 12, 20 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-F v4 is a short, 13-item patient-reported measure, easy-to-administer tool that measures an individual's level of fatigue during their usual daily activities over the past week. The level of fatigue is measured on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = not at all, 1 = a little bit, 2 = somewhat, 3 = quite a bit, 4 = very much). To score the FACIT-fatigue, all items are summed to create a single fatigue score with a range from 0 to 52, where a higher FACIT-F score indicates more severe symptoms. A negative change score from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>SjS participants: Change from baseline in Eular Sjögren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, weeks 4, 8, 12, 20 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The ESSPRI is an established disease outcome measure for Sjögren's syndrome. The ESSPRI is a patient-reported, subjective symptom index which consists of three questions covering the cardinal symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome: dryness, fatigue and pain (articular and/or muscular). The participant can assess severity of symptoms they experience on a single numerical scale of 0-10 (0 =no symptom at all and 10 = worst symptom imaginable) for each of the three domains. The overall ESSPRI score is calculated as the mean of the three individual domains where all domains carry the same weight. Minimum score can be 0 and maximum score can be 10, where a higher ESSPRI score indicates more severe symptoms. A negative change score from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>SjS participants: Change from baseline to the Schirmer's test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, weeks 4, 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Schirmer's test is used to determine whether the eye produces enough tears to keep it moist especially for those who suffer from dry eye syndrome. A strip is placed in the lower eyelid for 5 minutes to assess tear production. After 5 minutes, the filter paper is removed and the distance between the leading edge of wetness and the initial fold is measured, using a millimeter ruler. Tear deficiency is defined as &lt;5 mm wetting of the paper after 5 minutes.</description>
