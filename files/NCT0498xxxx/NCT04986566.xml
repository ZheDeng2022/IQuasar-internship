      This study aims to see whether an at-home monitoring program that collects health, symptoms,&#xD;
      and quality of life data in real-time can be included as part of the care of surgery patients&#xD;
      in order to provide better recovery. Patient-generated health data (weight, temperature,&#xD;
      oxygen level, heart rate, blood pressure, daily steps, symptoms, quality of life) using&#xD;
      at-home monitoring devices (thermometer, a pulse oximeter, a digital scale and a Vivofit 4&#xD;
      watch) and smart device applications are used more and more to measure value and quality in&#xD;
      cancer care. However, measuring patient-generated health data is not currently part of&#xD;
      standard care following cancer surgery. An at-home monitoring program may improve the care of&#xD;
      patients after hospital discharge from surgery and may help reduce complications by&#xD;
      identifying issues early.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To conduct a pilot randomized trial of a remote, perioperative telemonitoring intervention&#xD;
      to improve patient-centered outcomes, surgical outcomes, and healthcare resource use in&#xD;
      English and Spanish-speaking patients scheduled to undergo major abdominal gastrointestinal&#xD;
      (GI) cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. Assess the feasibility, retention, and acceptability of the remote perioperative&#xD;
      telemonitoring intervention as measured by the percentage of patients who a) agree to&#xD;
      participate; b) complete &gt;= 70% of the telemonitoring; and c) report satisfaction with the&#xD;
      intervention through structured exit interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ib. Determine the preliminary efficacy of the remote perioperative telemonitoring&#xD;
      intervention on surgical outcomes, healthcare utilization, patient-reported outcomes (PROs),&#xD;
      and functional recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I (TELEMONITORING): Patients wear a Vivofit 4 daily for 30 days after hospital discharge&#xD;
      for steps monitoring, and complete questionnaires over 5-7 minutes about symptoms and quality&#xD;
      of life using the Aetonixx application (app) up to 7 days before surgery, before being&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital after surgery, and on days 2, 7, 14, 30 after discharge.&#xD;
      Patients also complete pulse oximetry, temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and weight&#xD;
      assessment using at-home monitoring devices before surgery, then on days 2, 7, 14, 30 after&#xD;
      discharge. Patients assessments are monitored by the surgical team in real-time to identify&#xD;
      outcome trends, including onset, worsening/improving measures, and sporadic versus consistent&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II (ENHANCED USUAL CARE): Patients wear a Vivofit 4 for daily steps monitoring, and&#xD;
      complete questionnaires over 5-7 minutes about symptoms and quality of life using the&#xD;
      Aetonixx app up to 7 days before surgery, before being discharged from the hospital after&#xD;
      surgery, and on days 2, 7, 14, 30 after discharge. Patients also complete pulse oximetry,&#xD;
      temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and weight assessment using at-home monitoring&#xD;
      devices before surgery, then on days 2, 7, 14, 30 after discharge. Patients use standard&#xD;
      procedures for reporting problems.&#xD;
