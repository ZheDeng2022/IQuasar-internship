  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective interventional Phase II multi center study, open label, preceded by a&#xD;
      retrospective non-interventional period, to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      alpelisib, in pediatric and adult participants with PROS.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll males and females aged ≥2 years who previously participated in EPIK-P1&#xD;
      study and who continued to receive treatment with alpelisib after the cut-off date used in&#xD;
      EPIK-P1 (NCT04285723).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has an initial retrospective period and a subsequent prospective period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retrospective period, is a non-interventional study period and will start one day after&#xD;
      the EPIK-P1 data cut-off date (i.e. 10-Mar-2020). It will end the day before the first&#xD;
      interventional dose of alpelisib is administered in the prospective period of this study (Day&#xD;
      -1). Key safety and efficacy information that was previously collected as per local medical&#xD;
      practice and recorded in the medical charts of eligible participants will be longitudinally&#xD;
      abstracted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective period, is an interventional study period and will start on the day of the&#xD;
      first interventional dose administration in the prospective period. It will end after all&#xD;
      participants have completed at least 5 years of treatment in the prospective period of the&#xD;
      study or discontinued earlier, whichever occurs earlier. During this study period, safety and&#xD;
      efficacy data will be prospectively collected following a structured plan that is common to&#xD;
      all participants.&#xD;
