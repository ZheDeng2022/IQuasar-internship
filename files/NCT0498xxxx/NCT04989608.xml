      Context:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive impairment is common after a stroke. Out of 100 patients who have suffered a&#xD;
      stroke, 50 will develop cognitive impairment. For 16 of them, they will be responsible for an&#xD;
      impact on autonomy (major cognitive disorder). They are conventionally attributed either to&#xD;
      the location of the lesions or to their general volume. However, recent literature emphasizes&#xD;
      the presence of cognitive impairment after a transient ischemic attack (TIA), when by&#xD;
      definition the symptoms are transient and imaging without recent ischemic injury. The&#xD;
      mechanisms of cognitive impairment in TIA are therefore poorly understood at present. There&#xD;
      is evidence in animal models and humans for persistent brain toxicity from ischemia even in&#xD;
      the absence of established necrosis. However, to what extent this toxicity may explain the&#xD;
      cognitive impairment seen in TIA is not known. Indeed, the latter could just as much have the&#xD;
      effect of vascular risk factors which significantly increase cognitive risk even in the&#xD;
      absence of an acute event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the Cog-TIA program is therefore to identify whether the transient ischemic&#xD;
      attack may be responsible for long-term structural changes in neuroimaging in the ischemic&#xD;
      territory and whether these changes are correlated with changes in cognitive efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is based on the Normandy-Stroke population cohort which includes patients from&#xD;
      Caen and the surrounding area who have had a stroke or TIA. The protocol provides for&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests evaluating the main cognitive domains at 1 year and 3 years after&#xD;
      the initial event. The Cog-TIA project is designed as an ancillary study to the&#xD;
      Normandy-Stroke project with the objective of including 50 patients from this cohort who&#xD;
      presented with a transient ischemic attack. Each patient will receive a structural MRI at the&#xD;
      same time as the neuropsychological assessments scheduled for the Normandy-Stroke study.&#xD;
      Analyzes will be performed from T1 sequences, Proton density with centered on the hippocampus&#xD;
      and diffusion tensors. For the T1 and proton density sequences, the analyzes will compare the&#xD;
      volumes of the different structures longitudinally (in particular: the total hippocampal&#xD;
      volume and of the subfields, lobar, thalamic and pallidal volumes). For the diffusion tensor&#xD;
      analyzes, the anisotropy maps will be compared longitudinally. For each structure showing&#xD;
      significant variation during follow-up, correlations will be made with the decline in&#xD;
      performance on neuropsychological tests calculated using composite scores. Cognitive decline&#xD;
      may be partly attributed to TIA if it is correlated with abnormalities in the affected&#xD;
      hemisphere.&#xD;
