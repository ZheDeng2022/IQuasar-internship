  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-stress testing (NST) is one of the most commonly used methods to assess fetal health in&#xD;
      the prenatal period because it is an easily interpreted, non-invasive, painless, and&#xD;
      short-term diagnostic method. Although NST is a non-invasive and painless diagnostic method,&#xD;
      pregnant women may feel anxiety during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is supported by studies that listening to music causes relaxation and reducing anxiety.&#xD;
      Therefore, the use of music as a non-pharmacological practice will increase the quality of&#xD;
      care of individuals. There are many studies suggesting that music reduces anxiety in low-risk&#xD;
      pregnancies during NST application. Different instruments such as ney, rebab, kopuz, dombra&#xD;
      are used in Turkish music. In particular, ney has come to the fore in music therapy. The ney,&#xD;
      which has different types in history, is an instrument that is closest to the human voice. In&#xD;
      a compilation about the music used in music therapy in Turkey, it was stated that there are&#xD;
      many social and health studies made with the sound of ney. Determining the effect of music on&#xD;
      NST and anxiety in high-risk pregnant women will contribute to the literature.&#xD;

    <masking_description>In order to ensure randomization in the study, a random numbers table was created by dividing them into two groups based on the number determined on the site https://www.randomizer.org/. In order to prevent bias, in order to divide the women into groups according to the randomization list, the groups were written and sealed in two separate opaque envelopes as intervention (the ney sound is played during the NST procedure) and control (the routine NST procedure was applied). Double blinding was done on request.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Non stress test evaluation form</measure>
    <time_frame>up to one hour</time_frame>
    <description>It was created by researchers in order to record and evaluate the findings related to the NST procedure. In the NST evaluation form, fetal heart rate and variability, which were followed for at least 20 minutes, number of accelerations, decelerations and fetal movements, test result (reactive or nonreactive) were included.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)-Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>up to one hour</time_frame>
    <description>STAI was used to measure the anxiety level of pregnant women. It was developed by Spielberger et al. (Spielberger et al., 1970) and Öner and Le Compte conducted a Turkish validity and reliability study of the scale (Öner &amp; LeCompte, 1983). In the scale, individuals are provided to express their feelings with 40 expressions. With the state anxiety scale, it is possible to determine how the individual feels at the moment and in the conditions, and with the trait anxiety scale, how he feels outside of the current situation and conditions. The scale is a 4-point Likert type.The last score obtained shows the anxiety level of the individual. High scores from the scale indicate an increased level of anxiety, low scores indicate a decrease.</description>
