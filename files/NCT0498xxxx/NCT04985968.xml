  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of cobitolimod treatment compared to&#xD;
      placebo in inducing clinical remission, in participants with moderate to severe active&#xD;
      left-sided UC and to evaluate the efficacy of cobitolimod maintenance treatment compared to&#xD;
      placebo in inducing or maintaining clinical remission at week 52, in participants with&#xD;
      clinical response at week 6 after induction treatment with cobitolimod.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase III study protocol includes an induction study for 6 weeks and a maintenance study&#xD;
      for an additional 45 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the induction study there will be an initial phase to explore the best dose, between&#xD;
      cobitolimod 250 mg and cobitolimod 500 mg using adaptive design.&#xD;
