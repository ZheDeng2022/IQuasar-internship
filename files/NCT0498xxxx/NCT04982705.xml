  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, first-in-human, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-and active-controlled&#xD;
      study to assess the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, efficacy, and food-effect of IDG-16177 in&#xD;
      healthy male subjects and patients with T2DM at different dose levels.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of 2 parts: Part 1 is a dose-escalation study in healthy male subjects in&#xD;
      single ascending dose (SAD) (Part 1.1) including food-effect and multiple ascending dose&#xD;
      (MAD) (Part 1.2) cohorts to determine the highest allowable dose (HAD) for patients with&#xD;
      T2DM; and Part 2 is a placebo- and active-controlled efficacy exploration in patients with&#xD;
      T2DM, insufficiently controlled with metformin alone.&#xD;
