  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental illness with high prevalence and global&#xD;
      burden. Previous studies revealed that over 70% patients in remission still had decreased&#xD;
      quality of life, severe function impairment, low positive mental health score and poor coping&#xD;
      ability. However, few studies focus on working and school age patients with MDD. A GBD survey&#xD;
      showed that over 40% MDD patients are 15-50 years old. Therefore, we initiate the present&#xD;
      multi-center cross-sectional survey to investigate the associations between clinical&#xD;
      symptoms, cognitive function, occupational/study ability, and quality of life in Chinese&#xD;
      working and school age population with MDD who are in remission.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center cross-sectional study. Patients with MDD who received medication&#xD;
      treatment and achieved remission for at least 8 weeks will be enrolled. For all the&#xD;
      participants, demographic information will be collected; clinical symptoms, cognitive&#xD;
      function, occupational/study ability, and quality of life will be evaluated by using 17-items&#xD;
      HAMD, PHQ-9, HAMA, PSQI, SHAPS, HCL-32, SDS, LEAPS, QOL-6, PFQ and THINC-it toolkit.&#xD;
