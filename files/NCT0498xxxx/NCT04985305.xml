  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of psychotropic medication on behavioral and psychological symptoms in&#xD;
      dementia (BPDS) is limited, while they are associated with a higher risk of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Non-pharmacological treatment of BPSD is advocated as treatment of first choice.&#xD;
      However, many general practitioners (GPs) find it difficult to initiate deprescribing and&#xD;
      when attempting to discontinue psychotropic drugs in nursing home residents, they can face&#xD;
      substantial barriers both among nursing home staff and relatives. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators have developed an intervention specifically aimed at increasing knowledge on&#xD;
      deprescribing and improving communication and collaboration between GPs, nursing home staff,&#xD;
      relatives and patients to optimize the pharmacological treatment of BPSD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that more than 87.000 in Denmark are living with dementia, with more than&#xD;
      8000 new cases each year. The majority of older persons with dementia are living at home but&#xD;
      in a minority problems with daily activities necessitates relocation to a nursing home.&#xD;
      Besides cognitive impairment, up to 90 % of the institutionalized older people with dementia&#xD;
      may experience behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as anxiety,&#xD;
      agitation, hallucinations, depression, and apathy. An overuse of antidepressants is reported&#xD;
      and in Denmark, about half of all nursing home residents receive at least one antidepressant&#xD;
      and many receive other psychotropic drugs such as antipsychotics, anxiolytics and hypnotics&#xD;
      in addition to the antidepressants. However, recent research has shown that the benefits of&#xD;
      treatment with antidepressants in patients suffering from dementia are limited while&#xD;
      increasing the risk of falls and cardiovascular adverse events in institutionalized older&#xD;
      persons. Given the limited effectiveness of psychotropic medication and its high risk of&#xD;
      side-effects such as dizziness and falls, the use of antipsychotics and anxiolytics have been&#xD;
      recommended against for a long period, while recommendations considering antidepressants have&#xD;
      been more mixed. Danish national guidelines recommend against the use of antidepressants in&#xD;
      older people suffering from dementia and advocate non-pharmacological treatment of BPSD as&#xD;
      treatment of first choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However in contradiction with the guidelines, a recent study showed that moving into a&#xD;
      nursing homes, was accompanied with an increase in the number of new drug treatments&#xD;
      including antidepressants and that this number remained unchanged for at least two years.&#xD;
      Studies on the implementation and retention of strategies to discontinuation of psychotropic&#xD;
      medication have shown varying effects. A recent qualitative systematic review has shown that&#xD;
      discontinuation is often hindered by 1) the GP not getting the necessary information from the&#xD;
      staff, 2) both relatives and staff can have concerns about the reduction or discontinuation&#xD;
      of psychotropic medication or 3) the GP does not feel sufficiently competent/confident on&#xD;
      their knowledge of the medication to make adjustments. These factors complicate the&#xD;
      evaluation and adjustment of pharmacological treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms. A Danish&#xD;
      national strategy to try to reduce antipsychotics have been initialized in 2020, but to our&#xD;
      knowledge there is no focused initiative to reduce antidepressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Denmark each patient has a General Practitioner (GP), and the majority of nursing homes in&#xD;
      the Capital Region has a GP who is affiliated with the nursing home. The patients may choose&#xD;
      to accept this GP as their nursing home physician when moving to the nursing home. A nursing&#xD;
      home physician helps improve continuity and reduces the risk of hospitalization for the&#xD;
      patients when compared to patients without a nursing home physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore chose to apply the intervention to the nursing home physicians&#xD;
      and their patients since more and more patients are having a nursing home physician and&#xD;
      research has shown that is reduces amongst other things, hospitalization. Since the study is&#xD;
      a cluster randomized controlled study set place in the Capital Region of Denmark, the&#xD;
      investigators first invited nursing home physicians to participate. In order to be included,&#xD;
      they had to have at least 10 patients at a nursing home.&#xD;
