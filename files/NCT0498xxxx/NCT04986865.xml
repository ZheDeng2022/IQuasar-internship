      This is a First-in-Human Phase I trial of ATG-101 in Patients with Metastatic/Advanced Solid&#xD;
      Tumors and Mature B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas. Dose Escalation Phase: Approximately 40-50&#xD;
      subjects with a maximum number of 62; 1-20 subjects for enhanced PDx cohort. Dose Expansion&#xD;
      Phase: Estimated 100-400 subjects depending on the number of cohorts to be expanded.&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate the safety of ATG-101. It is the responsibility of the investigator to record and document all AEs (occurring from the first dose of study treatment on C1D1) throughout the study. Clinically significant symptoms and signs related to disease progression will be reported as AEs and meet one or more of the following criteria:&#xD;
With clinical symptoms.&#xD;
Leading to the change of study treatment (eg, dose adjustment, dose interruption, or study drug withdraw).&#xD;
Leading to the change of concomitant treatment (eg, adding, interrupting, or terminating concomitant medications, therapies, or treatments, or any other changes).</description>

    <description>To evaluate the safety of ATG-101. It is the responsibility of the investigator to record and document all SAEs (occurring from the signing of the informed consent form) throughout the study. A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs at any dose (including SAEs occurred after the ICF is signed and prior to dosing):&#xD;
Results in death.&#xD;
Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death).&#xD;
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.&#xD;
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.&#xD;
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. These should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsive that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.</description>
