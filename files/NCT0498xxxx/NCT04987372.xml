    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery for the adult, performed by sternotomy is associated with moderate to severe&#xD;
      acute postoperative pain. Postoperative pain is the primary reason for prolonged&#xD;
      convalescence and one of the main concerns of the surgical patient in the Intensive Care Unit&#xD;
      (ICU). This pain is multifactorial and multifocal; and can be caused by incision,&#xD;
      intraoperative tissue retraction and dissection, surgical manipulation of the parietal&#xD;
      pleura, posterior rib dislocation or fracture, possible brachial plexus injury, chest tube&#xD;
      insertion and harvesting of the saphenous vein and internal mammarian artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common analgesic schemes for postoperative pain in cardiac surgery are based on&#xD;
      intravenous opioids by bolus, with patient- or nurse-controlled delivery systems. Although&#xD;
      there is no doubt they have a beneficial effect on pain, opioids are associated with&#xD;
      dose-related side effects including &quot;over&quot;sedation, ileus, urinary retention, nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, pruritus, mental confusion and respiratory depression leading to a prolonged&#xD;
      extubation time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last decades many has been written about the value of multimodal pain protocols to&#xD;
      treat acute postoperative pain in non-cardiac surgery. This is not only to reduce the dose&#xD;
      and side effects of opioids. By blocking both the central and peripheral pain mechanisms the&#xD;
      aim is to find a holy grale, by which the patient suffers the least, by which central neural&#xD;
      hyper-excitability that increases postoperative pain is minimized and by which the&#xD;
      transformation of acute into chronic pain is reduced to a minimum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregabalin has his role in treating various neuropathic pain syndromes. It inhibits central&#xD;
      neuronal sensitization and prevents hyperalgesia by decreasing excitatory amino acid&#xD;
      neurotransmission in the spinal cord through a direct postsynaptic or presynaptic inhibition&#xD;
      of Ca²+ influx. It has been shown that gabapentin reduced pain scores and opioid requirements&#xD;
      in different surgical settings. Literature is not conclusive and because of conflicting&#xD;
      results the routine use of gabapentin and pregabalin to reduce opioid consumption in the&#xD;
      cardiac surgical patients is not yet recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that can be directly applied to the&#xD;
      peripheral nervous system, causing a dose-dependent inhibition of C-fibers and Aα-fibers. It&#xD;
      is widely used for sedation and anxiolysis in ICU settings. The clinical efficacy has been&#xD;
      proven in non-cardiac surgery by augmenting anesthesia and analgesia, and allowing a&#xD;
      reduction in opioid requirements. Additionally, there was a significantly lower incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine isn't only an anesthetic agent but also has an analgesic effect. The exact mechanism&#xD;
      is not yet known but some of the pathways are already identified. It binds to the opioid&#xD;
      receptors κ(kappa) δ(delta) μ(mu) and it was proven that ketamine induces phosphorylation of&#xD;
      mitogen-activated protein kinases by 2-3 times that of traditional opioid drugs. Another way&#xD;
      of producing its analgesic effect is by the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the central&#xD;
      nervous system. Ketamine also effects other ion channels including sodium channels and&#xD;
      voltage sensitive calcium channels leading to local anesthetic and gabapentin like effects.&#xD;
      Because of the unique effect of keeping hemodynamic stability during induction, ketamine can&#xD;
      be useful in cardiac surgery. The analgesic effect, the absence of respiratory depression and&#xD;
      hemodynamic stability make it an excellent drug to use in the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous lidocain during the perioperative period has many beneficial effects in open&#xD;
      procedures, such as an earlier return of gastrointestinal tract function, less postoperative&#xD;
      opioid consumption, improvement of postoperative cognitive dysfunction and reduced stay in&#xD;
      the hospital. The exact working mechanism isn't 100% identified but the anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      effects of LA mediated through interactions with polymorphonuclear cells and the inhibition&#xD;
      of G protein-coupled receptors may play a crucial role for the observed effects in the&#xD;
      perioperative setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnesiumsulphate's analgesic mechanisms are also not fully identified, but it is thought&#xD;
      that the NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptor is blocked by calcium regulation mechanisms.&#xD;
      Because the NMDA receptor plays a role in the transmission of pain, magnesium has become a&#xD;
      subject of interest as potential use in postoperative painschemes. It was proven that&#xD;
      peri-operative intravenous magnesium can reduce opioid consumption especially in the first&#xD;
      24h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's goal is to compare standard &quot;Fentanyl - Tramadol - Paracetamol - Oxycodon&quot;&#xD;
      regimen to a multimodal painmanagement &quot;pregabalin- magnesiumsulphate - minimal&#xD;
      fentanyl-ketamine-lidocain-dexmedetomidine- paracetamol&quot; to determine which therapy provides&#xD;
      the most comfort, the fastest extubation time, the least pain and the least delirium.&#xD;

Zero usually represents 'no pain at all' whereas the upper limit represents 'the worst pain ever possible'.</description>
