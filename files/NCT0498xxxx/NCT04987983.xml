  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methods and techniques to improve the quality and safety of oral feeding in preterm infants&#xD;
      are still a significant challenge in modern neonatology. One of the areas that can help&#xD;
      improve feeding is choosing the optimal feeding position for premature babies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      PURPOSE: The aim of the study is to compare the advantages of side-lying positioning on the&#xD;
      right (SLP-R) and left side (SLP-L) of infant's body, during bottle-feeding of preterm&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD: The study will include eight neonates (n=8) born ≤34 weeks of gestational age. Four&#xD;
      bottle-feeding sessions will be tested in each of the newborns: two in the SLP-R and two in&#xD;
      the SLP-L. The position for the first study will be randomly assign, then positioning will be&#xD;
      change after each feeding session. In one day, only two consecutive feeding sessions will be&#xD;
      tested which will be included to the study in order to minimize fatigability as a disrupting&#xD;
      factor. The levels of saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR) will be measured as the&#xD;
      parameters indicative of the newborn's physiological stability. The factors determining the&#xD;
      qualitative aspect of feeding include the total time of declines of SpO2 ≤85%, level of the&#xD;
      newborn's alertness according to the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS), and the&#xD;
      occurrence of choking episodes. The proportion of milk consumed (volume of milk eaten&#xD;
      relative to the expected volume) and the duration of the feeding and feeding session were&#xD;
      also will be record. Maximum time of feeding session will be 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also the posseting during/after feeding and regurgitations will be record in each tested&#xD;
      positions.&#xD;
