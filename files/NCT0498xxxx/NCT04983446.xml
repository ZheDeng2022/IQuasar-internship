  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, proof-of-concept study of&#xD;
      intranasal foralumab in hospitalized subjects with severe COVID-19 and pulmonary&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Foralumab is a fully human second generation anti-CD3 mAb with a modified Fc unit (two amino&#xD;
      acid substitutions) composed of 2 heavy chains with an immunoglobulin (Ig) G1constant region&#xD;
      and 2 light chains with a kappa constant region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a separate Phase 2 randomized, controlled, pilot trial conducted to assess safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and efficacy in 39 patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 in Brazil, showed&#xD;
      that intranasal foralumab may be of benefit in modulating immune reactivity and in reducing&#xD;
      pulmonary inflammation. Importantly, intranasal administration of foralumab was well&#xD;
      tolerated with no clinically significant changes in blood cell counts (including blood&#xD;
      lymphocytes), no evidence of hypersensitivity, and no serious adverse events (SAEs) were&#xD;
      reported in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 80 hospitalized subjects with severe COVID-19 and evidence of pulmonary&#xD;
      involvement on a computed tomography (CT) scan at screening will be enrolled in this study&#xD;
      over 4 months, depending on enrollment. Up to 7 centers in Brazil will conduct this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main study objective is to evaluate the effect of intranasal foralumab on evolution of&#xD;
      pulmonary infiltrates in hospitalized subjects with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive intranasal foralumab 100 µg (50 µg in 0.1 ml&#xD;
      solution into each nostril) or placebo (0.1 ml vehicle solution into each nostril). All&#xD;
      subjects will receive continued Standard of Care (SoC) therapy (per hospital/study site&#xD;
      policies and guidelines) together with intranasal foralumab or placebo for the entire 14-day&#xD;
      treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will participate in the study approximately 35 days (from screening to completion).&#xD;

    <description>It is determined based on change from baseline in semiquantitative chest CT severity score.A chest CT severity score was calculated by assessing the degree of lobe involvement for each of the five lung lobes separately as follows: 0% (no involvement), 1%-25% (minimal involvement), 26%-50% (mild involvement), 51%-75% (moderate involvement), and 76%-100% (severe involvement). Higher the score the worse the outcome.</description>
