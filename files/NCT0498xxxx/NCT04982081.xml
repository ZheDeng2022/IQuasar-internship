  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Currently drug&#xD;
      treatments for heart failure manage the symptoms, but not restore the loss cardiomyocytes due&#xD;
      to the very limited regenerative capability in the adult heart. Novel reparative therapies&#xD;
      that replace the cardiomyocytes loss are highly demanded to restore the cardiac function. The&#xD;
      main purposes of this explanatory study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      catheter-based endocardial delivery of human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes in patients with&#xD;
      congestive heart failure.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with severe congestive heart failure will be treated with allogeneic human&#xD;
      iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (HiCM-188) through the catheter-based injections. HiCM188,&#xD;
      produced by Help therapeutics with cGMP condition, will be transplanted into the myocardium&#xD;
      through a transcatheter endocardial injection system with two dosage (100 million cells or&#xD;
      400 million cells). The safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted at1, 3, 6 and 12&#xD;
      months after the cell transplantation.&#xD;
