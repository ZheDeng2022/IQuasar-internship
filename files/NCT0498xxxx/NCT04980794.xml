  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test the effectiveness of a psychoeducation-based program to&#xD;
      address communication and conflict resolution in families, thereby supporting mental health&#xD;
      in children and their caregivers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a program to improve mental health&#xD;
      in families by reducing stress and supporting effective communication and conflict&#xD;
      resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: in the self-study condition,&#xD;
      families will receive information to review on their own, paired with regular (weekly)&#xD;
      contact from a family coach; in the second condition, families will receive information to&#xD;
      review on their own, regular contact from a coach, and will participate in video sessions&#xD;
      with a family coach who will provide feedback on their interactions and coaching on their use&#xD;
      of a communication technique. Data collection, management and analysis will be conducted by&#xD;
      researchers at the University of Notre Dame, but the intervention will occur through&#xD;
      community organizations in three cities in Indiana, allowing for tests of the effectiveness&#xD;
      of the program when it is implemented in community settings. Families will participate in a&#xD;
      pre-test assessment, a four-week intervention, a post-test assessment, and a one-year follow&#xD;
      up assessment. Also evaluated will be organizational factors and factors that impact ultimate&#xD;
      implementation and scalability of the program in community settings.&#xD;
