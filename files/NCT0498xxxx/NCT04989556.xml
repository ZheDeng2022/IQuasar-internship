      This trial investigates technology-enhanced palliative care for patients in phase I trials&#xD;
      with cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced). The goal of this study is&#xD;
      to learn if the technology-enhanced palliative care symptom-monitoring program, when combined&#xD;
      with in-person clinic visits and standard remote care visits (by phone or video call), helps&#xD;
      increase quality of life and care for patients with advanced cancer participating in phase 1&#xD;
      immunotherapy trials.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the effect size of each palliative care intervention technology-enhanced&#xD;
      palliative care, standard palliative care [SPC]) on the symptom burden of patients prior to&#xD;
      or while on a phase I trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I To estimate the effect size of each palliative care intervention (TEC, SPC) on symptom&#xD;
      burden over a 12-week period of a phase I trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the effect size of each palliative care intervention (TEC, SPC) on clinical&#xD;
      outcomes at 6 months post-enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To qualitatively assess patients' and caregivers' perceptions of receiving each&#xD;
      TEC-based palliative care (PC) Intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive standard symptom management by palliative care team once every 4&#xD;
      weeks for 12 weeks. Patients and caregivers also may participate in an interview with&#xD;
      supportive care nurse over 30-45 minutes during week 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients in Phase I immunotherapy trials will receive in-person clinic visits or&#xD;
      standard remote care encounters at least once every 4 weeks and the e-ESAS and PC&#xD;
      provider-initiated remote contact every week. Patients and caregivers may participate in an&#xD;
      interview with supportive care nurse over 330-45 minutes during week 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III: Patients in Phase I non-immunotherapy clinical trials will receive in-person clinic&#xD;
      visits or standard remote care encounters at least once every 4 weeks and the e-ESAS and PC&#xD;
      provider-initiated remote contact once a week. In all 3 arms, follow-up communication will&#xD;
      occur as deemed necessary by the PC team. Patients and caregivers may participate in an&#xD;
      interview with supportive care nurse over 30-45 minutes during week 8.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in global distress score (GDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will consist of paired t-tests for the global distress score (GDS, calculated as a sum of 9 physical and psychosocial ESAS items, scored from 0-90 in which a range over 35 indicates high distress) between baseline and 2 weeks if the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) scores are approximately normally distributed. If the data are clearly not normally distributed will conduct Wilcoxon signed rank tests.</description>

    <measure>Effect size of each palliative care (PC) intervention, utilizing FAMCARE-P-13 (PRO tool assessing patient satisfaction with outpatient palliative oncology care).</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure incremental change in the scores of patient satisfaction using FAMCARE-P13 from the baseline values.&#xD;
We also will measure the change in the scores every 4 weeks from the baseline score at time-point T0 to the 12 study weeks: weeks 4 (T4), 8 (T8), and 12 (T12). We will additionally measure at 6 months after enrollment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect size of palliative care (PC) intervention, utilizing Global Distress Score (GDS) derived from Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure incremental change in the scores for GDS using ESAS, a validated score of overall symptom intensity and burden derived from the ESAS. The GDS (range 0-90) is comprised of 9 symptoms: (1) the six physical ESAS symptoms (pain, fatigue, nausea, drowsiness, appetite, shortness of breath), (2) the two psychosocial symptoms (depression, anxiety), and (3) overall sense of wellbeing..&#xD;
We also will measure the change in the scores every 4 weeks from the baseline score at time-point T0 to the 12 study weeks: weeks 4 (T4), 8 (T8), and 12 (T12). We will additionally measure at 6 months after enrollment.</description>
