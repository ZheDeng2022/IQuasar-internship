  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have suggested that the endogenous electric field and its polarity stimulate&#xD;
      the proliferation and migration of epithelial cells and therefore promote wound healing.&#xD;
      WoundEL® will reproduce the endogenous electrical current to stimulate all the factors&#xD;
      contributing to healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrostimulation of wounds, including the WoundEL® device, is a therapy listed but not yet&#xD;
      reimbursed in France. The aim of this study is to show that the WoundEL® electrostimulation&#xD;
      device is superior to the reference treatments recognized by the HAS.&#xD;

      Patients with a leg ulcer will be randomized to the &quot;usual treatment&quot; or &quot;WoundEL&quot; group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The progress of the leg ulcer will be monitored every 2 weeks for 8 weeks or sooner if wound&#xD;
      healing occurs. All leg ulcers will be examined at 10 weeks to check for healing or the&#xD;
      condition of the leg ulcer if it has not healed. A third-blind party will also assess the&#xD;
      ulcer condition at 10 weeks, based on standardized photographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consumption of analgesics, pain and quality of life will be compared in the 2 groups.&#xD;

    <description>The WoundEl system is composed by: a class IIa device , a class IIb dressing electrode and a class I disperser electrode.&#xD;
Applied to the leg ulcer, WoundEL® reproduces the endogenous electrical current to stimulate all the factors contributing to healing. Electrical current is evenly spread over the Dressing Electrode which also maintains a moist wound healing environment.</description>
