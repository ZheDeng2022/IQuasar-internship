  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean section operations are increasing in rates worldwide. A proper anesthetic technique&#xD;
      is required to maintain the safety of both the mother and the fetus. This study examines the&#xD;
      adverse hemodynamic effects associated with general and regional anesthesia and proposes a&#xD;
      superior technique from the hemodynamic perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective cohort study with a five-year study period was conducted on patients who&#xD;
      underwent cesarean section with general anesthesia (GA) and regional anesthesia (RA) after&#xD;
      obtaining ethical committee approval. Data (hypotension, bradycardia, and blood loss) was&#xD;
      collected from hospital information system records of the patients who underwent cesarean&#xD;
      section from January 2015 to December 2019. The significance of the variables was determined&#xD;
      using the Chi-square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 2500 patients were studied. 1379 patients underwent cesarean section with RA&#xD;
      meanwhile 1121 patients with GA.&#xD;

      Cesarean section Over the past few decades, cesarean section (CS) rates have been increasing&#xD;
      tremendously; it is the most called for surgery in the obstetric department, for instance; in&#xD;
      the US, there was an increase of CS by 14% from 1998 to 2001 with a 53% increase in elective&#xD;
      primary CS rates and a 13% increase in medically advised primary CS rates (Alnour et al.,&#xD;
      2015). The term primary CS is used when the operation is done for the first time on a&#xD;
      pregnant patient (Saha and Chowdhury, 2011). This increase in CS rates can be explained by&#xD;
      the increased demand for the comfort aspect during labor and the lifesaving properties of&#xD;
      this operation in certain conditions for both the mother and the baby (Chen et al., 2019;&#xD;
      Tadevosyan et al., 2019). A superior anesthetic method should ease surgical discomfort,&#xD;
      decrease postoperative adverse effects, and should have excellent intraoperative analgesia&#xD;
      (Alnour et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2019). An anesthetic is used to alleviate the pain of CS&#xD;
      operation using either general (GA) or regional (RA) (spinal (SA) and epidural (EA))&#xD;
      anesthetics; sometimes, they can be used together (Alnour et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy-induced hypotension The physiological changes associated with pregnancy and&#xD;
      aortocaval compression or supine hypotension syndrome are the primary cause of hypotension&#xD;
      during pregnancy (Mavridou et al., 2013). Aortocaval compression associated with natural&#xD;
      pregnancy decreases cardiac output (CO) and venous return (VR). It starts at 20 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation when the patient is lying flat in the supine position. Blood flow from the lower&#xD;
      extremities will be disrupted and delayed from reaching the central circulation and the&#xD;
      maternal heart; this happens due to the compression force applied by the uterus on the&#xD;
      inferior vena cava and the abdominal aorta. This could restrain blood flow to the uterus,&#xD;
      increases the risk of morbidity and mortality for both the mother and the fetus. Therefore,&#xD;
      choosing a proper anesthetic technique that will not cause further hypotension during the&#xD;
      process of CS is important (Mavridou et al., 2013; Alnour et al., 2015; Šklebar et al.,&#xD;
      2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia-induced hypotension There are two definitions of anesthesia-induced hypotension&#xD;
      based on studies. It is a decrease to 80% from the baseline blood pressure value or a&#xD;
      decrease of systolic arterial pressure (SAP) to &lt;100 mm Hg. A report led in the UK in 1999&#xD;
      found that most expert obstetric anesthetists utilize a hypotension limit of either 100 or 90&#xD;
      mm Hg of SAP (Šklebar et al., 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anesthesia GA is either inhaled or injected, causing a state of unconsciousness&#xD;
      carefully controlled. It is clinically useful due to its ability to induct rapidly, therefore&#xD;
      useful in emergency situations. GA drugs can cross the placenta affecting the fetus.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it was commonly believed that it could cause birth asphyxia. GA-induced&#xD;
      hypotension was noted as 28% in participants in one study, with systolic and diastolic BP not&#xD;
      notably contrasting with the SA group; however, it was more hemodynamically stable and had a&#xD;
      minor impact on Apgar score along with umbilical cord blood gas. ICU admissions can happen&#xD;
      due to hypotension in GA but less than SA (Alnour et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional anesthesia SA is given for a local anesthetic effect lasting for 2-3 hours; it is&#xD;
      widely used. However, rejection by patients for this method is due to anxiety, tension, fear&#xD;
      of visualizing the operating room environment, and the thought of being paralyzed. SA-induced&#xD;
      hypotension was a research subject for more than 50 years (Alnour et al., 2015; Chen et al.,&#xD;
      2019; Šklebar et al., 2019). The decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR), which is&#xD;
      caused by loss of sympathetic tone in SA reduces CO and SVR. This effect will be compounded&#xD;
      by fall in BP due to supine hypotension syndrome (Mavridou et al., 2013). The hypotension&#xD;
      rate in SA significantly fluctuates between 7.4% and 74.1%, and in another study, 64% - 100%&#xD;
      (Nikooseresht et al., 2016; Šklebar et al., 2019). Hypotension was noted as 48% of&#xD;
      participants having CS under SA in a study in Libya (Alnour et al., 2015). Interestingly, it&#xD;
      was reported by one of the studies that SA increased CO by 13%, with no significant changes&#xD;
      observed in total peripheral resistance (TPR) or mean arterial pressure (MAP) (Ram et al.,&#xD;
      2017). Hypotension was also seen in participants undergoing CS with techniques where both SA&#xD;
      and EA were used together. (Chen et al., 2019). Prolonged SA-induced hypotension accompanied&#xD;
      by decreased SAP can inadequately affect fetal circulation leading to fetal acidosis and&#xD;
      hypoxia (Alnour et al., 2015; Šklebar et al., 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no studies done to compare GA and RA specifically in terms of the hemodynamic&#xD;
      perspective alone (Alnour et al., 2015; Šklebar et al., 2019). Therefore, the present study&#xD;
      aimed to find a superior anesthetic technique from a hemodynamic standpoint and proposed a&#xD;
      better technique for managing hemodynamic instabilities of pregnant patients undergoing CS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this study To examine and find a better technique of anesthesia for the cesarean&#xD;
      section from a hemodynamic perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study adverse hemodynamic effects associated with general versus regional anesthetic&#xD;
           techniques for cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To propose a superior anesthetic technique from the hemodynamic perspective for cesarean&#xD;
           section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Setting and design A five-year retrospective cohort study on patients who&#xD;
      underwent CS from 1st January 2015 to 31st December 2019 at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital&#xD;
      (SQUH) in the Department of Anesthesia and Intensive care, after obtaining ethical approval&#xD;
      from the Medical Research committee at SQUH in July 2020 (MREC #2178). The &quot;TrakCare&quot;&#xD;
      hospital information system was used to acquire patients' demographic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients The inclusion criteria of this study were all the patients that underwent CS in SQUH&#xD;
      during the study period, and the exclusion criteria were missing data. The sample size of&#xD;
      this study included all the patients who underwent CS in this study period, as there were no&#xD;
      prior similar studies to calculate the sample size from. A total of 2500 patients were&#xD;
      included and coded for identity. This study was not based on any previous studies. Therefore,&#xD;
      the population was regarded as all of the patients included in the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection The data was obtained from the hospital information system &quot;TrakCare.&quot; Data&#xD;
      like age, the urgency of surgery, and the type of anesthesia were all recorded before each&#xD;
      surgery, along with the ASA physical status classification system grade. Intraoperative data&#xD;
      included heart rate (HR) measured as beats per minute (bpm) and blood pressure (BP) measured&#xD;
      as (mm Hg) were obtained from the anesthesia records in the attached Electronic Patient&#xD;
      Record (EPR) documents. Blood loss measured in liters (L) and APGAR scores of newborns were&#xD;
      also obtained from the surgery notes and clinical notes along with the use of vasopressor&#xD;
      intraoperatively. Postoperative anesthesia-related complications were recorded along with the&#xD;
      postoperative length of stay (Days) and the mortality of the mother and the baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Data was collected, and the patient's identity was coded. Individual data&#xD;
      coding was done and analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social sciences (SPSS)&#xD;
      software (version23). Descriptive statistics were used to present the data. The Chi-Square&#xD;
      test was used to determine the association between different variables under investigation&#xD;
      with a p-value of &lt;0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Continuous variables were&#xD;
      suitably analyzed using means+/- SD. Missing data was ignored if the percentage of the&#xD;
      missing data was less than 10%. The graphical representation tools of SPSS software such as&#xD;
      bar charts, pie charts, and cross-tabulation were used to describe the analyzed data and&#xD;
      present the categorized and uncategorized variables.&#xD;
