  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to see if the drug Inqov is effective in reducing the chance of&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) relapsing after&#xD;
      standard of care stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This research study involves the study drug Inqovi, which is a combination of the drugs&#xD;
           decitabine and cedazuridine.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, open-label, phase Ib study of oral&#xD;
      Inqov-decitabine/cedazuridine, given as maintenance therapy following allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell transplantation for patients with myeloid neoplasms&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Inqovi for myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
      (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) relapse but it has not been investigated in&#xD;
      the post-transplant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inqovi is made up of the two study drugs decitabine and cedazuridine. Decitabine is believed&#xD;
      to work by stopping cancer cells from growing and spreading. Cedazuridine is believed to work&#xD;
      by slowing down how quickly the body breaks down decitabine, which normally breaks down too&#xD;
      quickly to be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment,&#xD;
      including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the study is looking for the highest dose of Inqovi that can be administered safely&#xD;
      without severe or unmanageable side effects not everyone will receive the same dose of the&#xD;
      study drug. Dosage will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the&#xD;
      study before and how well they have tolerated their doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatment for up to 12 months and will be followed for up to&#xD;
      24 months after starting the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 22 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taiho Oncology, Inc., a pharmaceutical company, is supporting this research study by&#xD;
      providing funding for the study, including the study drug.&#xD;

                  case of 2 UCB units, both units must have been at least 4/6 matched with the&#xD;
