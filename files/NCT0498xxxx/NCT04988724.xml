      Aims and Hypotheses Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to investigate associations between an intelligent exercise training intervention and&#xD;
           clinical health parameters, well-being, sick leave and productivity at Nordsjællands&#xD;
           Hospital (NOH)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to generate data and experiences to a larger cluster randomized trial with more included&#xD;
           departments at NOH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to analyze how the intervention could be successfully implemented in the organization to&#xD;
           ensure long-term effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aerobic capacity (Åstrand's ergometer test)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure and heart rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body composition (DEXA scan)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity (steps measured by tracker)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-reported health (questionnaire EQ-5D)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-reported physical activity (questionnaire IPAQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Well-being (questions from the Danish Health and Morbidity Survey)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Musculoskeletal pain and use of anti-pain medications (Numeric Rating Scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monetized value of productivity loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Productivity using an employer´s perspective (scale 1-10)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sick leave (days in short term (≤14 days) and long term (&gt;14 days), data will be&#xD;
           delivered by The Department of HR)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The concept of intelligent training at the worksite is an individualized&#xD;
      exercise training where the exercises are: 1) balanced to the physiological capacity of the&#xD;
      employees relative to their occupational exposure, 2) tailored to the individual capacities&#xD;
      and disorders to improve employees' health, 3) motivating by offering evidence based and&#xD;
      enjoyable programs implemented with care, and 4) cost-effective for the company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention period is three months of intelligent exercise training. Every week, several&#xD;
      exercise sessions will be offered to the participants in the intervention group during the&#xD;
      working hours. The exercise sessions will be of 30 min durations twice a week and include&#xD;
      aerobic exercise with high intensity (≥16 on the Borg scale, rate of perceived exhaustion),&#xD;
      resistance training and/or functional training. In addition, there will be a number of&#xD;
      intelligent exercise sessions of 30 min durations before and after the most common working&#xD;
      hours with a primary focus on aerobic exercise. The exercise sessions will be supervised by&#xD;
      exercise experts (education in sport or physiotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intelligent exercise interventions will be adjusted to the individual participant's&#xD;
      physical capacity and limitations; thus, as one participant may perform aerobic exercise,&#xD;
      another person may perform resistance training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, we will investigate the potential of physical training at a department&#xD;
      at NOH. A large university hospital covering a population of 1,7 mio citizens in the Northern&#xD;
      Region of Zealand, and one of eight new Danish &quot;super-hospitals&quot;. We will invite all health&#xD;
      care workers from one of the clinical departments at the hospital to be enrolled in the study&#xD;
      and apply the &quot;intelligent exercise&quot; intervention where each participant will receive a&#xD;
      tailored intervention (exercise plan) based on an individual assessment including the mapping&#xD;
      of the participant's needs and motivation (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      References can be found at the end of the document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants The 234 employed at Department of Pulmonary and Infectious Diseases will be&#xD;
      invited to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All employees (nurses, doctors, secretaries and other staff) in the department will be&#xD;
      invited to the study. The recruitment will follow a strategy with local information at the&#xD;
      department regarding the study intervention and tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The concept of intelligent training at the worksite is an individualized&#xD;
      exercise training where the exercises are: 1) balanced to the physiological capacity of the&#xD;
      employees relative to their occupational exposure, 2) tailored to the individual capacities&#xD;
      and disorders to improve employees' health, 3) motivating by offering evidence based and&#xD;
      enjoyable programs implemented with care, and 4) cost-effective for the company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention period is three months of intelligent exercise training. Every week, several&#xD;
      exercise sessions will be offered to the participants in the intervention group during the&#xD;
      working hours. The exercise sessions will be of 30 min durations twice a week and include&#xD;
      aerobic exercise with high intensity (≥16 on the Borg scale, rate of perceived exhaustion),&#xD;
      resistance training and/or functional training (12). In addition, there will be a number of&#xD;
      intelligent exercise sessions of 30 min durations before and after the most common working&#xD;
      hours with a primary focus on aerobic exercise. The exercise sessions will be supervised by&#xD;
      exercise experts (education in sport or physiotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intelligent exercise interventions will be adjusted to the individual participant's&#xD;
      physical capacity and limitations; thus, as one participant may perform aerobic exercise,&#xD;
      another person may perform resistance training (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A goal will be that as many as possible will participate in minimum 60 min intelligent&#xD;
      exercise training per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the intervention the participants will also be offered motivational support by a&#xD;
      special educated staff to increase the level of leisure time physical activity and the level&#xD;
      of general physical activity at work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be offered intelligent exercise interventions to those on evening duties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intervention periods, the participants will be supported by trained exercise&#xD;
      ambassadors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation The study will be performed without a sample size calculation, as it&#xD;
      is a pilot trial to generate data before the intervention is tested in a larger cluster&#xD;
      randomized trial with sufficient power to assess the validity of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses The analyses of the changes of the numeric outcome variables during the&#xD;
      study will be assessed using Student's t test if data are normally distributed or Wilcoxon&#xD;
      Signed Ranks Test if data are not normally distributed. Changes of categorical variables will&#xD;
      be analysed using a Chi2 test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The associations between groups of staff (nurses, medical doctors and other) and changes of&#xD;
      outcome variables (physical activity, productivity, sick leave, physical capacity) will be&#xD;
      tested in multiple linear regression models with confounder adjustments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results are considered significant (2-tailed) when p&lt;0.05. The statistical analyses will be&#xD;
      performed in collaboration with a statistician from Section of Biostatistics, Department of&#xD;
      Public Health, University of Copenhagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Every employee (e.g. nurses, doctors, secretaries, lab technician) from the&#xD;
      Department of Pulmonary and Infectious Diseases at NOH will be invited to the study, but only&#xD;
      those who agree in writing will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short-term and long-term risks, side effects and disadvantages Participants who have not&#xD;
      previously been physically active may experience transient side effects such as sore muscles,&#xD;
      shortness of breath, etc. There are no immediate risks associated with the intervention, as&#xD;
      it is adapted to the physical ability of the individual subject. The therapeutic benefit for&#xD;
      participants and future employees justifies an intervention like this. Participation in the&#xD;
      study includes DEXA scanning, which is an X-ray examination with a low radiation dose (&lt;&#xD;
      1mSv) corresponding to approximately one week's background radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological material All non-fasting blood samples will be collected and analyzed as part of&#xD;
      the standard, existing routine setup in hospital. Standard hospital regulations and&#xD;
      guidelines will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples (6 ml divided in two tubes of 4 ml + 2 ml, respectively) will be drawn before&#xD;
      and after the intervention. The 4 ml samples will be centrifuged to separate plasma. The&#xD;
      plasma samples will be analyzed for total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. HbA1c (glycemic&#xD;
      control) will be analyzed in full blood (the 2 ml samples).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Processing of personal data in the project The study will be approved by the Danish Data&#xD;
      Protection Agency. The collected data will be stored in RedCap according to rules of the data&#xD;
      protection agency in the Capital Region. All project data collected, will be handled in&#xD;
      accordance with the rules of the Capital Region, in relation to current legislation. No data&#xD;
      are sent abroad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding The initiative to plan and execute the study is done by senior researcher associate&#xD;
      professor Stig Mølsted and other researchers employed at NOH. The study is supported by NOH&#xD;
      with a grant of 50,000 DKK to the initial analysis. In addition, NOH supports the study with&#xD;
      other payments including the costs related to the participants' exercise training during the&#xD;
      working hours. To ensure the realizability of this study, several funding application&#xD;
      initiatives are in the pipeline for 2021 and forth, including Danish national and private&#xD;
      funds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grants will be deposited into a hospital account. Members of the study group will have no&#xD;
      financial affiliation with donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remuneration No remuneration is paid to the project participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of subjects and informed consent Potential study participants in the selected&#xD;
      department will receive written information about the project explaining the intervention.&#xD;
      Oral information will be provided at joint meetings at the hospital to which test subjects&#xD;
      are invited. Interested participants will also receive a written consent form. Prior to&#xD;
      obtaining the informed consent, it will be ensured that the participants will have time and&#xD;
      opportunity to read the information, ask questions and consider whether to participate. If&#xD;
      the participant wishes to be included in the study, the consent declaration is dated and&#xD;
      signed by the study participant and by the health care professional who provided the&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presentation of the results The results should have special interest to hospitals in Denmark&#xD;
      and worldwide. The results of the study will also be of interest in other public and private&#xD;
      companies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study results will be presented at national and international meetings and congresses, in&#xD;
      international peer reviewed journals and in public media. Both positive, negative and&#xD;
      inconclusive results will be published. The study will be registered at&#xD;
      www.clinicaltrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics In this scientific experiment, all participants receive a training program tailored to&#xD;
      the individual. Each individual participant is being physically pressured to an extent that&#xD;
      one must not assume will be of any long-term burden to the participant. If any test results&#xD;
      call for further investigations of a participant, the participant will be encouraged to&#xD;
      consult the person's general practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse effects related to the exercise interventions will be registered and evaluated in the&#xD;
      study. The therapeutic benefit for participants and future employees justifies an&#xD;
      intervention like this, as this intervention is expected to raise public health in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of DEXA scanning measures gives a radiation dose that corresponds to a week&#xD;
      background radiation. This negative effect may be exceeded by the positive effect for the&#xD;
      participant of knowing her/his bone mineral density and body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse effects related to the exercise interventions will be registered and evaluated in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
