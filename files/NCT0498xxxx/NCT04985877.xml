  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia, which refers to the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, shares&#xD;
      many characteristics with other disease states typically associated with risks of falling and&#xD;
      fracture, including osteoporosis, frailty, and obesity. Sarcopenia often is linked to an&#xD;
      increase in connective tissue, muscle steatosis, impaired muscle metabolism, an increase in&#xD;
      inflammatory markers (e.g., TNF-a and IL-6), an increased stiffness of myofibers, slower&#xD;
      kinetics in establishing myosin-actin crossing bridges, increased oxidative stress,&#xD;
      mitochondria dysfunction, hormonal imbalance, and decreased capillary flow. In addition to&#xD;
      the Lactobacillus casei strain, Shirota is a well-known probiotic strain that has been&#xD;
      approved and is generally recognized as safe by the United States Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration. L. casei strain Shirota (LCS) has been suggested to confer health benefits.&#xD;
      Investigators found that LCS decelerated age-related muscle loss via ensuring mitochondrial&#xD;
      function in Senescence-Accelerated Mouse Prone 8 (SAMP8) mice. Investigators also found that&#xD;
      3-Indolepropionic Acid (IPA) is a microbiota-derived metabolite from a healthy intestinal&#xD;
      gut. IPA is also a protective factor for the progression of chronic kidney disease in the&#xD;
      Chinese population. This clinical trial focuses on the effect of fermented milk containing&#xD;
      LCS on sarcopenia in elderly Taiwanese individuals. Investigators focus on the topic of the&#xD;
      interaction of LCS with the diversity of the gut microbiota, microbiota-derived metabolites,&#xD;
      and protein utilization. The proposal will have four research goals. First, investigators try&#xD;
      to investigate whether long term supplementation LCS could restructure the gut microbiota&#xD;
      composition and gut microbial metabolites to against Aging related -Gut Dysbiosis in elderly.&#xD;
      Second, investigators also try to link the LCS play an important role on muscle loss and&#xD;
      alternation of gut microbiota composition. Third, investigators try to study the LCS effect&#xD;
      of muscle deterioration with aging, and highlight the two underpinning mechanisms (ROS and&#xD;
      protein utilization) regulating declines in muscle mass and function. Fourth, Since IPA is&#xD;
      important Microbiota-derived metabolites in health gut, investigators try to investigate&#xD;
      whether LCS could play an important role on modulation of IPA production in GI. Fifth,&#xD;
      investigators hope that investigators can through gut microbiota composition found some&#xD;
      selective microbiota clusters perform positively correlation with IPA.&#xD;

      1. Subject Enrollment The definition of sarcopenia is based on the algorithm of Asian Working&#xD;
      Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Muscle mass: measured by using Inbody S10 and standardized by height, shown by skeletal&#xD;
           muscle index [SMI=appendicular muscle mass (kg)/height (m2)]. Low muscle mass was&#xD;
           defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Men: SMI &lt;7.0 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Women: SMI &lt;5.4 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Handgrip strength: measured by electronic hand grip dynamometer. Low handgrip strength&#xD;
           was defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Men: &lt;28 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Women: &lt;18 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Limb strength: measured by Time for 5 times for chair stand method. Low limb strength&#xD;
           was defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time for 5 times for chair stand: ≧12s Sarcopenia was defined by (1) and one of&#xD;
                (2), or (3)&#xD;
&#xD;
                2. Study intervention Test beverages included Fermentation Milk fermented with L.&#xD;
                casei strain Shirota YIT9029 (LCS) provided by the Yakult Company (Taipei, Taiwan).&#xD;
                The beverages were distributed and stored at temperatures ranging from 0-10°C. The&#xD;
                Fermentation Milk contained LCS at more than 3x10^8 CFU per 100 ml bottle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants would take 2 bottles per day (104 Kcal/day). Study intervention should be&#xD;
      taken twice daily at approximately the same time. All milks would be sent to participant&#xD;
      weekly (14 bottles/week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Study assessment 3-1 Anthropometric measurement and Body Composition Assessment&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurement data was detected height, weight, waist circumference, arm muscle&#xD;
      circumference, hip circumference, and calf circumference using measure tape and weight scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition was detected using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) as a non-invasive&#xD;
      test instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-2 BIA Subjects stand on met without shoes and socks. Arms do not touch the trunk part of&#xD;
      body, and are spread naturally to a 15 degree angle away from trunk. The hand electrodes are&#xD;
      marked THUMB for the thumb and MIDDLE for the middle finger. The foot electrodes should be&#xD;
      positioned between examinee's anklebone and heel. Electric current was supplied from the&#xD;
      electrodes on the tips of the heels of both feet and the fingertips of both hands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-3 Muscle strength Grip strength measured in standard conditions with a well-studied model&#xD;
      of a handheld dynamometer with reference populations can be a reliable surrogate for more&#xD;
      complicated measures of muscle strength in the lower arms or legs. The measurement uses&#xD;
      electronic hand grip dynamometer. Low handgrip strength is defined in Men: &lt;28 kg ; Women:&#xD;
      &lt;18kg. Limb strength measured by Time for 5 times for chair stand. Subjects sat and stood for&#xD;
      five times, and calculated time by timer. Low limb strength is defined in time for Time for 5&#xD;
      times for chair stand: ≧12s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-4 Physical performance Physical performance was assessed by using 6-meter usual gait speed,&#xD;
      TUG, and SPPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-5 Gait speed Participants were instructed to walk from a standing start at a pace that was&#xD;
      normal and comfortable for them or to walk as fast as participants could until participants&#xD;
      reached the end of the marked path. A trained examiner walked behind the participant and&#xD;
      stopped timing when the participant's foot contacted the floor at the end of the walking&#xD;
      course. Participants were provided rest breaks as needed throughout the testing session. Low&#xD;
      Physical performance is defined &lt; 1 m/s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-6 TUG Participants were instructed to stand up from the chair, walk 3 meters forward and go&#xD;
      back to sit on the chair. Low Physical performance is defined ≧ 20s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-7 SPPB Participants were followed to SPPB to do the test. Low Physical performance is&#xD;
      defined ≦ 9 scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-8 Total bacteria count, Gut Microbiota Composition and Microbiota-derived Metabolite&#xD;
      Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-8-1 16S V1-V2 Sequencing Total genome DNA from samples was extracted from stool samples&#xD;
      using the CTAB/SDS method. The V1-V2 regions of 16S rRNA gene were selected for&#xD;
      pyrosequencing analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-8-2 16S rRNA Gene Sequence Analysis 16S rRNA gene sequence data were processed with QIIME v&#xD;
      1.8.0 using default parameters. The sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units&#xD;
      (OTUs) at 97% similarity and then assigned Greengenes taxonomy using the uclust consensus&#xD;
      taxonomy classifier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-8-3 Fecal Short Chain Fatty Acids The fecal samples were diluted in deionized water and&#xD;
      homogenized. For short chain fatty acid (SCFA) analysis, a supernatant was used. Diethyl&#xD;
      ether extraction was carried out using the method of Adorno et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-8-4 IPA and TMAO Determination Investigators analyzed serum and fecal levels of IPA using&#xD;
      LC-MS/MS (4000 QTRAP, City, State, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plasma TMAO concentrations were detected by stable isotope (DLM4779-1, Andover, MA, USA)&#xD;
      dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (Ke et al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-8-5 Total bacterial count by qPCR Total bacterial counts were determined by qPCR analysis&#xD;
      according to the method described by Shima et al. (Beneficial Microbes, 2019) using a forward&#xD;
      primer (UniF: GTGSTGCAYGGYYGTCGTCA) and a reverse primer (UniR: ACGTCRTCCMCNCCTTCCTC) sets.&#xD;
      Faecalibacterium prausnitzii ATCC27768T was used as a standard strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-9 Blood Biochemical Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-9-1 Blood Sampling Blood samples was collected from the subjects at before-test and&#xD;
      after-test. The blood samples were placed in collection tubes containing anticoagulant EDTA&#xD;
      and heparin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-9-2 Metabolic Parameters All of the metabolic measurements were performed one day prior to&#xD;
      the start of the intervention and at the end of intervention. CBC, TSH, Free T4, Vit-D, Total&#xD;
      cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, fasting&#xD;
      insulin, blood urea, nitrogen, plasma prealbumin, albumin, ALT, AST, HbA1c, HS-CRP,&#xD;
      osteocalcin, adiponectin, leptin, serotonin, and creatinine were measured after fasting at&#xD;
      least 8 hrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-9-3 Plasma Amino Acid Analysis Investigators used a Hitachi L-8900 Amino Acid Analyzer&#xD;
      (Location) to detect and quantify the alanine, phenylalanine, cysteine, aspartic acid,&#xD;
      asparagine, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, histidine, leucine, isoleucine, lysine,&#xD;
      proline, arginine, serine, threonine, valine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and methionine in the&#xD;
      plasma samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-9-4 Inflammatory Cytokines Analysis The inflammation-associated serum cytokines TNF-α,&#xD;
      TGF-β, IL-6, IL-17, and IL-10 were analyzed using colorimetric kits (Elabscience, China). The&#xD;
      procedures followed the kit instructions and were measured using an ELISA reader (Bio Tek,&#xD;
      PowerWave XS2, City, State, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-9-5 Anti-oxidant marker analysis Many anti-oxidant enzymes in human bodies, like Superoxide&#xD;
      dismutase (SOD) (Elabscience, China), Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (biovision, City, State,&#xD;
      USA), and Catalase (CAT) (biovision, City, State, USA). Enzymes in the serum were evaluated&#xD;
      for the activity by ELISA kit. The procedures followed the kit instructions and were measured&#xD;
      by the ELISA reader (Bio Tek, PowerWave XS2, City, State, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-9-6 Trace elements Approximately 1 mL of each whole blood sample was microwave digested&#xD;
      with 3 mL of 65 % nitric acid (Ultrapure Reagent, J.T. Baker). Subsequently, investigators&#xD;
      washed the residuals in microwave tubes with 2 % nitric acid and then filtered the digested&#xD;
      fluids with 0.22 μm filter. The total filtered solutions were stored in 15 mL centrifuge&#xD;
      tubes. The levels of Pb, Cd, As, Hg, Mn, Al, Tl, V, Na, K, Mg, Ca, Fe, Zn, Se were determined&#xD;
      using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Agilent 7800).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-9-7 Immune function analysis In T-cells infiltrating skeletal muscle, Regulatory T cells&#xD;
      (Tregs) are a major subset. Tregs can regulate inflammation in muscle and promote the&#xD;
      regeneration of muscle; however, the catabolic effect of inflammation was promoted by the&#xD;
      dysfunctional Tregs in aged muscle.[EbioMedicine. 2019 Nov;49:381-388.] The blood cells were&#xD;
      stained with monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD4, -CD25 and -FoxP3) and analyzed by flow&#xD;
      cytometry.&#xD;
