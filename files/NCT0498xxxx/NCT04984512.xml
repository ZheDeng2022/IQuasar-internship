  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 and 3 adaptive design study for Mitizodone Phosphate,to find out an optimal&#xD;
      dose in phase 2 period and confirm the result an efficacy and safety in phase 3&#xD;
      period.Dose-finding will be done after 8 weeks of double-blinded treatment in phase 2 period&#xD;
      and will be assessed by both efficacy and safety from 3 dose groups of Mitizodone&#xD;
      Phosphate.The dose be found in phase 2 period will be evaluated on efficacy and safety when&#xD;
      compared with placebo in phase 3 period with a duration of 8 weeks treatment.The target&#xD;
      subjects are patients with MDD.&#xD;
