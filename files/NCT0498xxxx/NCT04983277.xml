  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to include 3000 diabetic patients in our hospital to collect complete&#xD;
      medical history data, comprehensively improve the screening of diabetic complications and&#xD;
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk assessment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the economic development and lifestyle change, the incidence and prevalence of diabetes&#xD;
      are increasing year by year in both China and the world. Diabetics are associated with a&#xD;
      significantly increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a cross-sectional study. This study intended to include about 3000 adult patients with&#xD;
      previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus, then collect their anthropometric data (age, gender,&#xD;
      weight, height, waist circumference, hip circumference and etc.), life history (diet,&#xD;
      exercise, smoking, drinking and etc.), medical history, familial medical history, clinical&#xD;
      testing results about their diabetes complication, and make a comprehensive assessment of&#xD;
      their cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risks. These data will be used to make further&#xD;
      research about the diabetes complication and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease.&#xD;

    <measure>Framingham Risk Scose</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Framingham risk score calculates an individual's risk of coronary heart disease over the next 10 years based on cholesterol levels and non-cholesterol factors. Non-cholesterol factors are subdivided into risk factors, major risk factors, and other factors.&#xD;
Risk factors include: diabetes; evidence of coronary heart disease; evidence of atherosclerosis outside the heart. Major risk factors include: male older than 45 years old, female older than 55 years old; Smoking; Hypertension (higehr than 140/90mmHg or being treated for hypertension); High-density lipoprotein lower than 40 mg/dl; First-degree relatives, male younger than 55 years old, or female younger than 65 years old, with a history of coronary heart disease.&#xD;
A higher score corresponds to a higher 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>UK Prospective Diabetes Study risk score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>This scale provides an estimate of the risks for a new coronary heart disease(CHD) event and stroke (fatal and nonfatal). The data used to calculate the UK Prospective Diabetes Study(UKPDS) risk scores (available at http://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/riskengine/download.php) included HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, serum total cholesterol and HDL-C, atrial fibrillation, sex, age, ethnicity, smoking status, and diabetes duration. The risks of CHD, fatal CHD, stroke, and fatal stroke were estimated for 10 years.&#xD;
A higher score corresponds to a higher 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease.</description>
