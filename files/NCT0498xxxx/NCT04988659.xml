  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Femoral acetabular impingement (FAI) is a common disease of the hip joint. In this study,&#xD;
      whole-genome sequencing was used to further explore the pathogenesis of this disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Femoral acetabular impingement (FAI) is a group of chronic hip pain caused by the impact&#xD;
      between the proximal femur and the edge of the acetabulum due to the anatomical abnormality&#xD;
      of the hip joint, which damages the labrum and adjacent cartilage, and causes limited hip&#xD;
      movement, especially limited flexion and internal rotation. However, the specific etiology of&#xD;
      FAI is still unknown at present. The application of genome-wide, exon and transcription&#xD;
      research methods to the study of hip impaction syndrome can uncover key differentially&#xD;
      expressed genes and provide a theoretical basis for the study of FAI.&#xD;
