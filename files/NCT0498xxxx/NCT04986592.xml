      In patients undergoing total thyroidectomy, intraoperative nerve monitoring according to the&#xD;
      International Standards Guideline Statement may detect nerves more susceptible to injury. The&#xD;
      aim of our study was to evaluate the independent risk factors of vocal cord palsy, including&#xD;
      those related to pre-dissection nerve monitoring values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Prospective observational study in 95 consecutive adult patients undergoing elective&#xD;
      total thyroidectomy in Spain. A single experienced phonologist performed a videostroboscopy&#xD;
      (VS) exam preoperatively and one week after surgery to assess vocal cord mobility. Each&#xD;
      surgical procedure was performed with intermittent intraoperative neuromonitoring. Latency&#xD;
      and amplitude values were obtained for the vagal and recurrent laryngeal nerves before&#xD;
      surgical dissection and compared with the postoperative VS exam.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      After ethics committee approval (PR AG 129/2014), a prospective observational study was&#xD;
      carried out at Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, a tertiary hospital in Barcelona, Spain, in&#xD;
      accordance with the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD), including all&#xD;
      consecutive adult patients undergoing total thyroidectomy during a 12-month period. All&#xD;
      patients understood the various aspects of the study and gave written informed consent.&#xD;
      Patient characteristics recorded were age, sex, body mass index, ASA grade, and reason for&#xD;
      surgery, among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative neuromonitoring: Neural monitoring was performed once the carotid&#xD;
      neurovascular bundle had been identified and throughout the surgical dissection process to&#xD;
      ensure functional integrity of the nerve. We used Avalanche XT® (Dr Langer Medical GmbH,&#xD;
      Waldkirch, Germany) equipment fitted with paired electrodes on the tracheal tube, in contact&#xD;
      with the vocal cords (7-10 mm above the upper edge of the tube). Intermittent neuromonitoring&#xD;
      was performed in each patient according to the international standard guidelines for&#xD;
      electrophysiological monitoring20. The VN and RLN were stimulated following the four-step&#xD;
      technique (V1: initial vagal stimulation, prior identification and dissection of the VN, R1:&#xD;
      initial stimulation of the RLN, R2: post-dissection RLN stimulation, V2: post-dissection&#xD;
      vagal stimulation). Vagal stimulation confirmed proper functioning of the entire neuronal&#xD;
      circuit, while also avoiding false negatives through stimulation of an injured distal RLN at&#xD;
      the lesion site. All signals were recorded on a monitor and collected for evaluation. Vagal&#xD;
      and RLN stimulation was programmed at 3 mA and 1 mA, respectively. The event threshold was&#xD;
      set to 70-100 uV, and increased to 200 uV, to avoid false-positive events appearing on the&#xD;
      monitor due to spontaneous low-level respiratory waves &lt; 100 uV. Electromyographic signals&#xD;
      (latency and amplitude) as well as biphasic and triphasic waves were displayed on the&#xD;
      monitoring screen. Lack of signal occurred when the monitor showed low-amplitude waves,&#xD;
      disturbance of the isoelectric line, multiple waves of variable and scant amplitude,&#xD;
      interference or substantial reduction in electromyography response (&lt; 100 uV), and a&#xD;
      high-pitched warning sound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vocal cords were assessed using VS (Laryngeal Strobe 9400, Pentax Medical, USA) by a single&#xD;
      experienced phonologist blinded to the IONM results. The VS exam was performed preoperatively&#xD;
      and repeated one week after surgery. The diagnosis of palsy (absence of motion) was made on&#xD;
      the basis of an observation of asymmetrical laryngeal motion. Patients with postoperative VCP&#xD;
      began voice therapy and were monitored periodically to assess their progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the present study was to identify independent risk factors for VCP, including&#xD;
      those related with pre-dissection IONM values. Continuous variables are expressed as the mean&#xD;
      (standard deviation) or the median and interquartile range (i.q.r.) prior to verification of&#xD;
      normality by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and categorical variables are expressed as the&#xD;
      absolute value (percentage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IONM results (response amplitude in uV and latency in ms) were compared with VS findings&#xD;
      and classified as true positives (TP) when IONM values were abnormal and VCP was confirmed by&#xD;
      VS, as true negatives (TN) when IONM values were normal and vocal cord mobility was normal on&#xD;
      VS, as false positives (FP) when IONM values were obviously abnormal but vocal cord mobility&#xD;
      was normal on VS, and as false negatives (FN) when IONM values were normal but VS revealed&#xD;
      VCP. These IONM results were used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive&#xD;
      value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), Youden incidence, with the respective 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval (CI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative variables included sex, age, BMI, ASA grade, neoplasm diagnosis,&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy, and surgery. The bivariate relationship between each factor and the VCP&#xD;
      results was analysed using an independent sample t test or the Mann-Whitney U-test, as&#xD;
      appropriate, for continuous variables, and using the χ2 or Fisher exact test for dichotomous&#xD;
      categorical variables. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were also plotted to&#xD;
      determine the best cut-off points for pre-dissection latency and response amplitude for both&#xD;
      VN and RLN to predict postoperative palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These cut-off points were then included in the forward stepwise multivariate logistic&#xD;
      regression to identify independent risk factors for VCP. Candidate variables for the logistic&#xD;
      regression included sex, age, BMI, neoplasm diagnosis, lymphadenectomy, surgery duration,&#xD;
      American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, and IONM-related predictive&#xD;
      factors such as pre-dissection VN latency, pre-dissection VN response amplitude,&#xD;
      pre-dissection RLN latency, and pre-dissection RLN response amplitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI were also calculated for all exposure factors. In all cases,&#xD;
      the level of significance was set at less than 0.05. The statistical analysis was performed&#xD;
      using the software package SPSS version 23.0 (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA).&#xD;
