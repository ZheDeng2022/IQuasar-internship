  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no known cure or regulatory agency approved drug therapy for nonalcoholic fatty&#xD;
      liver disease (NAFLD), the leading cause of liver disease worldwide, and its progressive&#xD;
      type, NASH. This places increased importance on using exercise to treat NAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While physical activity is recommended for all with NAFLD, how to best prescribe exercise as&#xD;
      a specific treatment remains unknown, including what dose of exercise is most effective.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mechanism explaining how exercise training benefits patients with NAFLD and NASH is&#xD;
      unclear. The AMPK pathway may be responsible for the benefits seen with exercise training&#xD;
      because: 1) AMPK has a liver-specific role in hepatic de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid&#xD;
      oxidation, 2) AMPK activity is abnormally low in NAFLD and 3) NAFLD animal models demonstrate&#xD;
      exercise changes the liver-specific AMPK pathway, leading to less liver fat accumulation by&#xD;
      reducing lipogenesis and increasing fatty acid oxidation (This has not been studied in&#xD;
      patients). Importantly, exercise-induced AMPK activation appears to be dose dependent.&#xD;
