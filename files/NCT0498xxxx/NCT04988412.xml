  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, one-period effectiveness study&#xD;
      is to compare the effects of multiple-dose 12 weeks daily dietary supplementation with 10 g&#xD;
      collagen alone or 5 g or 10 g of collagen in combination with MSM on skin in healthy human&#xD;
      subjects in comparison to placebo product. The main objective is to show that test products&#xD;
      have beneficial effects on dermis density, and also on other skin parameters and to&#xD;
      investigate differences in the effects among test products.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled four-way study comparing the efficacy&#xD;
      of multiple-dose dietary intake of three test products on skin parameters, that will be&#xD;
      conducted in Slovenia in one research center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed on 100 adult women, between the ages 40 and 65 years and will&#xD;
      include daily dietary supplementation over 12-weeks period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be divided in four groups, 25 in each. Test group 1 (TG1) will receive&#xD;
      investigational product 1 (IP1, daily dose 25 mL: collagen 5 g, MSM: 1,5 g, vitamin C: 80&#xD;
      mg), test group 2 (TG2) will receive investigational product 2 (IP2, daily dose 25 mL:&#xD;
      collagen 10 g, vitamin C: 80 mg), test group 3 (TG3) will receive investigational product 3&#xD;
      (TP3, daily dose 25 mL: collagen 10 g, MSM: 1,5 g, , vitamin C: 80 mg) and the placebo group&#xD;
      (PG) will receive placebo product without those active ingredients (25 mL: 0 g collagen, 0 g&#xD;
      MSM). Participants will test continuous administration of placebo or investigational products&#xD;
      for 12 weeks in order to demonstrate and assess multiple-dose effects. Their influence on&#xD;
      skin appendages via self-evaluations questionnaires will also be assessed.&#xD;

    <description>For assessments of elasticity viscoelasticity measurements will be performed. Significant changes from baseline in test groups, in comparison to placebo group after 12 weeks of dietary supplementation is expected. Differences between test groups will also be evaluated. Along viscoelasticity the measurement sinchronosusly gives also retraction and Young modulus values, as well as U-values: Uf (final deformation), Ue (skin exstensibility), Uv (delayed distension), Ur (immediate retraction), Ua (total recovery). R5 (Ur/Ue) parameter will also be calculated.</description>
