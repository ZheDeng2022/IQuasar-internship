  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, Phase 2b study of ZEN003694 in combination with&#xD;
      enzalutamide vs. enzalutamide monotherapy in patients with mCRPC who have progressed on prior&#xD;
      abiraterone by PCWG3 criteria. Disease must have progressed on only abiraterone by PCWG3&#xD;
      criteria prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient population will be separated into two cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A: Patients with poor response to prior abiraterone defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abiraterone started in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) disease setting: &lt; 12&#xD;
           months duration on abiraterone or failure to achieve PSA nadir of 0.2 ng/mL while taking&#xD;
           abiraterone, or;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abiraterone started in castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) disease setting: &lt; 6&#xD;
           months duration on abiraterone or failure to achieve PSA50 response while on abiraterone&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B: Patients with response to prior abiraterone, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abiraterone started in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) disease setting: ≥ 12&#xD;
           months duration on abiraterone and nadir PSA &lt; 0.2 ng/mL, or;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abiraterone started in castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) disease setting: ≥ 6&#xD;
           months duration on abiraterone and confirmed PSA50 response&#xD;

    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30: cancer-specific instrument with 30 questions to assess the participant QoL. First 28 questions used to evaluate 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain) and other single items (dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). Each question assessed on a 4-point scale (1= not at all, 2= a little, 3= quite a bit, 4= very much); functional scales: higher score = better level of functioning; symptom scale: higher score = more severe symptoms; for single items: higher score= more severe problem. Last 2 questions used to evaluate global health status (GHS)/QoL. Each question was assessed on 7-point scale (1= very poor to 7= excellent). Scores averaged, transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score=better quality of life/better level of functioning.</description>

Each question assessed on a 4-point scale (1= not at all, 2= a little, 3= quite a bit, 4= very much).
