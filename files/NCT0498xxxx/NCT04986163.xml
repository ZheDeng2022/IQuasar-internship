  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The randomized controlled trial study aims to validate a new pain monitor during general&#xD;
      anesthesia by comparing the new ANSPEC-PRO monitor (non-CE marked) with already CE-marked&#xD;
      pain monitors (Medstorm and Medasense). One hundred and eighty patients will be randomized&#xD;
      into six groups, wherein each group has 30 patients. Patients preparing for a surgical&#xD;
      operation under general anesthesia will be included to be monitored for pain during surgery&#xD;
      procedure, while the standard monitoring, medication, and standard care will not be&#xD;
      disturbed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain monitoring is done with the ANSPEC-PRO, MEDASENSE, or MEDSTORM in the operation room,&#xD;
      before and during general anesthesia: the pain monitor will record data continuously, while&#xD;
      the following will be recorded in parallel: blood pressure, heart rate, saturation, CO2, O2&#xD;
      end-tidal concentrations, electromyogram, signal quality, the given amount of analgesics and&#xD;
      hypnotics, and TOF (train-of-four).&#xD;

      Primary Objective: Validation of ANSPEC-PRO as pain monitor during general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of quality of monitoring ANSPEC-PRO compared with other pain monitors&#xD;
           (Medasense and Medstorm);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the correlation between measurements of pain monitors (ANSPEC-PRO,&#xD;
           Medstorm and Medasense) and the level of analgesia represented as TCI infusion of&#xD;
           Remifentanil;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the most suitable device for the development of a MIMO pharmacodynamic&#xD;
           interaction model of Propofol and Remifentanil for use in closed- loop drug-delivery&#xD;
           systems for anesthesia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the interaction between analgesics and hypnotics measured by ANSPEC-PRO&#xD;
           and BIS/Neurowave.&#xD;
