  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of antioxidant docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in patients with&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis. Half of participants will receive DHA, while the other half will receive&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies show that patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) usually have, compared to the&#xD;
      normal population, low levels of linoleic acid (LA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and&#xD;
      increase in arachidonic acid (AA), which is pro-inflammatory. Normalization or modification&#xD;
      of this fatty acid pattern (AP) could reduce chronic inflammation. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to assess the effect of oral supplementation with DHA for one year in pediatric patients&#xD;
      (6-18 years) with CF, on inflammatory parameters, AP profile, lung function (spirometry) and&#xD;
      number of exacerbations.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline differencial cell counts in sputum at 6 and 12 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months and 12 monts</time_frame>
    <description>An equal volume of sterile dithiothreitol (DTT), freshly diluted to 10% by the addition of sterile saline, was added to the sputum. This step was performed under a Bio-safety hood using sterile technique. The samples were then incubated in a shaking water bath at 37° C for 5-10 min, and gently mixed using a transfer pipette at 5-min intervals. The weight of the remaining sputum mixture was measured, and a further three times the volume of both DTT and phosphate-buffered saline (Dulbecco's; Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY) were added. The mixture was incubated once again in the 37° C shaking water bath for another 5-10 min to ensure complete homogenization. Ten microliters of the homogenized sputum samples, mixed with Trypan Blue stain, was used to calculate total cell counts, using a standard hemacytometer. A further 0.25-0.50 ml of both samples was used to prepare cytospin slides for differential cell counts.</description>
