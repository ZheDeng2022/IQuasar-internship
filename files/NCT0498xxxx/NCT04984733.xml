  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the ELEVATE trial is to determine the activity and safety of maintenance TMZ&#xD;
      dosing followed by nivolumab treatment to evaluate the potential for a future randomised&#xD;
      trial against a standard of care control arm. The rationale to continue TMZ for 3 months or&#xD;
      until PD is to evaluate the emergence of mismatch repair deficiency both with and without&#xD;
      radiological PD, as clinically relevant MMRd may emerge before radiological progression. This&#xD;
      will also reduce the number of patients who drop out due to symptomatic progressive disease.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Haemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L&#xD;

                  disease ≤ 1.5 x ULN or direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All toxicities (exception alopecia, and grade 2 fatigue, neuropathy and lack of&#xD;
             appetite /nausea) attributed to prior anti-cancer therapy must have resolved to grade&#xD;

             Pregnancy test must be within 24 hours prior to starting treatment. (A woman is&#xD;
             considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile, following menarche and&#xD;
             until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilisation&#xD;
             methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. A&#xD;
             postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative&#xD;
             medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal&#xD;
             range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal&#xD;
             contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However in the absence of 12 months of&#xD;
             amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient).&#xD;

          -  WOCBP should use one highly effective and one effective method of birth control during&#xD;
             the study treatment period and for at least 5 months after the last dose of the study&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects who are breast feeding should discontinue nursing prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study treatment and until 5 months after the last dose of the study treatment.&#xD;

          -  Men who are sexually active with a WOCBP must adhere to contraception during and for a&#xD;
             period of 7 months after the last dose of the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical conditions&#xD;
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those&#xD;
             conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial.&#xD;
