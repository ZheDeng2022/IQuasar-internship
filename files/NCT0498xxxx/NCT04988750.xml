    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single arm, prospective, and pilot study. Eligible patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled after acquiring the signed informed consent and then will receive the treatment of&#xD;
      re-RT combined with FUS (FUS + re-RT) on an outpatient basis. The re-RT in FUS + re-RT&#xD;
      treatment will include fractioned stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) treatment (FUS + SRS) or&#xD;
      conventional radiotherapy (cRT) treatment (FUS + cRT). The treatment of SRS or cRT treatment&#xD;
      given to patients is determined by the investigator depending on the volume and location of&#xD;
      the treatment region.&#xD;
