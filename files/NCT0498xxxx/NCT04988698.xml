  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis is a frequent condition whose prevalence is estimated at 7.6% of the&#xD;
      French population aged 40 to 75, or approximately 2 million individuals .&#xD;
      Viscosupplementation (VS) is a symptomatic treatment of knee osteoarthritis recommended by a&#xD;
      large number of learned societies. It consists of the intra-articular injection (IA) of&#xD;
      hyaluronic acid (HA), to reduce knee pain by restoring normal joint homeostasis impaired by&#xD;
      endogenous HA deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IA administration of HA can be performed using 2 protocols: repeated weekly injections&#xD;
      (3, sometimes 5 injections) and single injections. To date and there is no argument to favor&#xD;
      either protocol. Regardless of the formula used, the safety of HA is excellent (RR of adverse&#xD;
      reaction versus saline = 1.01, 95% CI 0.96-1.07, P = 0.6). The indication for&#xD;
      viscosupplementation is the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis&#xD;
      after failure and / or intolerance of analgesics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
      (NSAIDs). In this indication, after HA injection the responder rate is in the order of 70% to&#xD;
      75% at 6 months and approximately 50% at 12 months. However, the predictors of the duration&#xD;
      of effectiveness of SV are still unknown. The objective of the study is to research the&#xD;
      factors influencing the duration of the effectiveness of SV, under real life conditions.&#xD;
