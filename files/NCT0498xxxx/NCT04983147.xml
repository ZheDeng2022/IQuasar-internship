      This study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of the training provided to women with&#xD;
      obesity based on the Health Belief Model on women's beliefs regarding obesity and obesity&#xD;
      management of the women. Study population included 18 to 65 years old women with obesity and&#xD;
      the study sample included 128 women (64 in the control group and 64 in the experimental&#xD;
      group) determined by power analysis. Randomized controlled, single-blind clinical study&#xD;
      included a total of 128 obesity woman&#xD;

      Research data were collected by the researcher in the community health center. Research data&#xD;
      were completed in 4 months. women in the experimental and control groups in collecting test&#xD;
      data; Introductory Features consisting of 15 questions The form, which includes the Obesity&#xD;
      health belief model scale and anthropometric measurements, was applied.Interventions were&#xD;
      made on the women in the experimental situation, and no intervention was made on the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health Belief Model Scale in Obesity evaluates beliefs and attitudes towards. The scale&#xD;
      consisting of 32 items in total The cronbach alpha coefficient is 0.80. Health Belief Model&#xD;
      Scale in Obesity , sensitivity, seriousness, benefit and five sub-dimensions that can be used&#xD;
      independently of each other, including perception of disability The importance of health; the&#xD;
      level of importance individuals give to their health shows and consists of eight items (1, 2,&#xD;
      3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). Perceived sensitivity; health problems and complications that may develop&#xD;
      due to obesity. to what level they find themselves susceptible, and the interventions to be&#xD;
      made for obesity. evaluates at what level they find useful, and takes four items (12, 13, 14,&#xD;
      16) consists of. Perceived seriousness; To what extent do individuals have obesity and&#xD;
      consists of four items (9, 10, 11, 17). Perceived benefit; what individuals gain in terms of&#xD;
      their health when they manage obesity shows the level of awareness of the benefits and&#xD;
      consists of 8 items (21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 32). Perceived obstacle; people's health&#xD;
      recommendations for obesity. shows the level of the obstacles they perceive in practice and&#xD;
      (15, 18, 19, 20, 23, 29, 30, 31).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scale is a 5-point Likert type scale for each item. The importance of health in scale sub&#xD;
      for the size; 1 for &quot;Never&quot;, 2 for &quot;Sometimes&quot;, 3 for &quot;Frequently&quot;, 4 for &quot;Very often&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;Every evaluation is made by giving 5 points for &quot;time&quot;. Perceived sensitivity, seriousness,&#xD;
      obstacle and for perceptions of benefit; By giving 1 points for &quot;absolutely disagree&quot;, 2 for&#xD;
      &quot;disagree&quot;, 3 for &quot;indecisive&quot;, 4 for &quot;agree&quot;, 5 for &quot;absolutely agree&quot; evaluation is done.&#xD;
      total scale point average is not calculated. Each sub of the scale The scores of the items&#xD;
      belonging to the subscale of the subscale are summed up and the number of items in each&#xD;
      subscale is calculated. is divided. If every item in the scale was not answered, the number&#xD;
      of items answered the corresponding ratings are summed up and the responses on that subscale&#xD;
      are divided by the number of items. Sensitivity perception: Women see obesity as a disease&#xD;
      and The definition of obesity in the educational content, how is it is evaluated and why it&#xD;
      is an important health problem. Towards the perception of seriousness: Women should consider&#xD;
      obesity as a serious health problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After evaluating the visual conditions, the educational content caused by obesity Health&#xD;
      problems such as physical and mental illnesses are included. For the perception of benefit:&#xD;
      It is important for women to manage obesity well. After evaluating the usefulness of the&#xD;
      educational content, obesity health benefits of obesity management, proper nutrition and&#xD;
      physical The benefits of the activity are included. Barrier perception: Perceived barriers by&#xD;
      women in managing obesity After evaluating the obstacles encountered in managing obesity in&#xD;
      the educational content what happened was discussed with the group, the things that could be&#xD;
      done to overcome these obstacles were listed. education that includes the ability of women to&#xD;
      manage obesity using appropriate ways For the perception of barriers: Perceived barriers by&#xD;
      women in managing obesity After evaluating the obstacles encountered in managing obesity in&#xD;
      the educational content what happened was discussed with the group, the things that could be&#xD;
      done to overcome these obstacles were listed. education that includes the ability of women to&#xD;
      manage obesity using appropriate ways program has been created. İmportance of health in&#xD;
      scale, perceived usefulness, perceived the increase in the mean scores of the sensitivity and&#xD;
      perceived seriousness sub-dimensions, The decrease in the average score of the perceived&#xD;
      disability sub-dimension indicates that the applied training yields a positive result. Weight&#xD;
      measurements of women, by placing the scales on a flat surface without slope, his thick&#xD;
      clothes and shoes were removed, and it was made upright without moving.his thick clothes and&#xD;
      shoes were removed, and it was built upright without moving.Women's height measurements with&#xD;
      feet united and on the frankfort plane (head the angle between the neck and the neck is 90&#xD;
      degrees)Women's waist circumference measurements should be kept on a flat surface and&#xD;
      excessive pressure by keeping the tape measure. hands and arms at both sides, feet close to&#xD;
      each other (12-15 cm near) and the weight is evenly distributed on two feet from the belly&#xD;
      button level. measured. A decrease in height, weight and BMI indicates that training is&#xD;
      effective IMPACT STATEMENT What is already known on this subject? Behavior change is an&#xD;
      important factor in obesity What the results of this study add? There are behavioral change&#xD;
      initiatives by providing training, but by integrating the model use and training areas into&#xD;
      the model, providing behavioral and attitude change will provide more effective and&#xD;
      sustainable lifestyle changes in obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?&#xD;
      Studies about obesity patients, it is recommended that nursing interventions be carried out&#xD;
      within the framework of models, and their training should be aimed at cognitive, affective&#xD;
      and psychomotor areas and applied to different groups.In studies to be intended for obesity&#xD;
      patients, it is recommended that nursing interventions be carried out within the framework of&#xD;
      models, and their training should be aimed at cognitive, affective and psychomotor areas and&#xD;
      applied to different groups. Its use in the Health belief model-based of obese with chronic&#xD;
      diseases also contributes to disease. Health belief model-based training to be given to&#xD;
      healthy individuals will contribute to the prevention of obesity.&#xD;
