  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In women who undergo mastectomy for the treatment of breast cancer, autologous reconstruction&#xD;
      using the deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap is a common surgical procedure that&#xD;
      aims to restore both the appearance and texture of the breast(s). Specifically, this requires&#xD;
      the transfer of skin, fat, and perforator vessels from the abdomen to a recipient artery and&#xD;
      vein in the chest to create a viable breast mound. Post-operatively, the abdominal donor site&#xD;
      is routinely monitored for wound dehiscence, which has a reported incidence of up to 39% in&#xD;
      this patient population; however, this incidence typically varies from 3.5% to 14%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the investigators' academic institution, patients who undergo DIEP breast reconstruction&#xD;
      typically have closed incision negative pressure therapy (ciNPT) or traditional tape&#xD;
      dressings applied to the closed abdominal donor site. These dressings are selected according&#xD;
      to surgeon preference and typically remain in-situ until hospital discharge. As there remains&#xD;
      clinical equipoise regarding the ability of ciNPT to reduce abdominal wound dehiscence,&#xD;
      further research in the form of a parallel, two-arm RCT is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a pilot study comparing ciNPT to standard tape dressings to the&#xD;
      abdominal donor site incision for patients undergoing autologous DIEP breast reconstruction.&#xD;
      As a pilot trial, the primary objective of the study is to assess feasibility outcomes. The&#xD;
      design and conduct of the proposed pilot study will mirror the methodology of the definitive&#xD;
      trial including randomization, interventions, and clinical outcomes. The secondary objective&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate clinical outcomes comparing ciNPT to standard tape dressings&#xD;
      applied to the abdominal donor site incision. Clinical outcomes will include: 1) the&#xD;
      incidence of abdominal wound dehiscence at 4 weeks following DIEP breast reconstruction; 2)&#xD;
      the incidence of seroma formation and surgical site infection at 4 weeks; 3) quality of life&#xD;
      as measured by BREAST-Q physical well-being abdomen and EQ-5D-5L pre-operatively, 1-month,&#xD;
      6-months, and 12-months postoperatively; 4) Scar appearance as measured by the SCAR-Q at&#xD;
      12-months postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot RCT will demonstrate feasibility of a definitive trial comparing ciNPT to standard&#xD;
      tape dressings for the abdominal donor site of patients undergoing DIEP breast&#xD;
      reconstruction. A priori hypotheses for each feasibility outcome will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Eligibility: At least 90% of screened patients will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recruitment: At least 85% of eligible patients will be enrolled. To be considered fully&#xD;
           enrolled patients must sign the informed consent form, complete baseline demographic&#xD;
           questionnaires, and be randomized to a study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Retention: At least 85% of randomized patients will complete the study, defined as&#xD;
           completion of 12-month follow-up&#xD;

Completion of the study will be defined as completion of 12 month follow-up questionnaires. This criteria will be determined to be feasible if at least 85% of randomized patients complete the study.&#xD;
As per Thabane et al., the investigators will collate the results of all three of the aforementioned primary outcomes to determine study eligibility. If all three criteria are met, the authors will decide that the study is feasible and continue without modifications. If one or more criteria is not met, the investigators will either decide to:&#xD;
Stop - main study not feasible, or Continue, but modify protocol - feasible with modifications, or Continue without modifications, but monitor closely - feasible with close monitoring</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L essentially consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). This scale is a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) designed to measure overall health status. The EQ-5D measures 5 health states measured from 1-5, with 1 being the best and 5 being the worst. An overall score can be generated from this with the best health at the minimum score of 5, and the worst health state at the maximum score of 25. The EQ VAS is an analogue scale from 0-100, with 100 being the best health and 0 being the worst health that you can imagine.</description>

    <description>Following closure of the abdominal donor site, the closed incision will be dressed with the ciNPT system [V.A.C.ULTA™ Negative Pressure Wound Therapy System (KCI, USA)] applied by the operating surgeon in a sterile fashion. The ciNPT device will be set at -125mmHg of continuous negative pressure for a period of 7 days or until patient discharge from hospital. Removal of the ciNPT dressing will be performed by the surgical team at the time of discharge.
