  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 of this multi-centre, prospective study aims to obtain a precise estimate of the&#xD;
      local incidence of PMPS and identify biopsychosocial risk factors contributing to the&#xD;
      development of PMPS. Recognition of the impact of PMPS on function and mood and quality of&#xD;
      life in cancer survivors, and identification of risk factors would help physicians institute&#xD;
      appropriate pre-operative counselling and preventive measures to reduce the development of&#xD;
      PMPS. The investigators aim to follow up on the long-term multi-dimensional effects of PMPS,&#xD;
      and continue to develop and validate a risk prediction model for patients at risk of PMPS in&#xD;
      the next phase of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) has been reported to occur in 25-60% of patients&#xD;
      following surgeries for breast cancer, the highest occurring cancer in women worldwide. There&#xD;
      is a lack of an accepted standard definition of PMPS which has resulted in the wide range of&#xD;
      estimates of its occurrence. While there has been much research interest in this condition,&#xD;
      there is still a paucity of standardized and effective treatment at this point, and our&#xD;
      understanding of this condition, its exact incidence and risk factors, is still incomplete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local incidence of PMPS after breast cancer surgery is presently unknown and often&#xD;
      under-reported, although breast cancer surgery is common and is carried out in almost all&#xD;
      Singhealth institutions. Risk factors for PMPS in the local context may differ from that&#xD;
      postulated in the West due to cultural, racial and societal differences. Breast cancer has a&#xD;
      high survival rate, with data from the CONCORD-2 study showing a 5-year survival rate of&#xD;
      ≥85%in developed countries. Despite high survival rates in cancer survivors, PMPS has been&#xD;
      shown to have a negative impact on the quality of recovery(QoR), patient satisfaction, and&#xD;
      can be severe enough causing the diminished quality of life (QoL) including poor sleep,&#xD;
      long-term disability, mood disorders and interference with activities of daily living (ADL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite widespread recognition of PMPS, it is often untreated or undertreated. Some possible&#xD;
      reasons suggested for inadequate management of PMPS are the lack of quality information about&#xD;
      optimal treatment, and incomplete understanding of the mechanisms and risk factors for&#xD;
      chronic pain development and prognosis. There is therefore a knowledge gap in the&#xD;
      understanding of risk factors leading to PMPS, the lack of a validated risk prediction model&#xD;
      for development of PMPS, and hence limiting the institution of preventive analgesia in high&#xD;
      risk patients. It is therefore timely to conduct a local multi-centre, prospective study to&#xD;
      look at the local incidence of PMPS after breast surgery, the multi-dimensional effects of&#xD;
      PMPS on the patient as well as to identify modifiable biopsychosocial risk factors leading to&#xD;
      PMPS.&#xD;

The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) defines PMPS as persistent pain soon after mastectomy/lumpectomy affecting the anterior thorax, axilla, and/or medial upper arm. The primary outcome will be the local incidence of PMPS at 4 months follow-up after surgery.</description>
