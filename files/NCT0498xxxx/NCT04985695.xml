  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implementation of fast-track rehabilitation surgery was essential in patient care, specially&#xD;
      in oncological point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this way, uses of the technic of local anesthesia, include epidural analgesia, was&#xD;
      essential, but this one is associated with few complications. Emergence of new technic of&#xD;
      anesthesia with a comparative analgesia and without side effects should be a better&#xD;
      alternative than epidural analgesia. Thus, bilateral rectus sheath block has been reported to&#xD;
      be effective in management of postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing of the informed consent, two postoperative analgesia techniques were&#xD;
      investigated in patients undergoing midline laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to compare the influence of analgesic technique on the&#xD;
      Quality of Recovery-15 score. The study design was a prospective, randomized trial with 2&#xD;
      parallel arms (epidural analgesia vs bilateral rectus sheath block).&#xD;

    <description>The Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR-15) included five dimensions: physical comfort, emotional state, pain, psychological support and physical independence. Each item was assessed using an 11-point numerical rating scale (for positive itel, 0=&quot;none of the time&quot; to 10=&quot;all the time&quot;; for negative items the scoring was reversed).</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1, 2, 3 and 30</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of postoperative analgesia was compared between the two groups with the visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS intensity rating consisted of a 100-mm line with the end points no pain (0 mm) and worst pain (100 mm). Study participants were asked to evaluated with a mark on the line their current pain intensity. The difference between each postoperative treatment VAS score was compared.</description>
