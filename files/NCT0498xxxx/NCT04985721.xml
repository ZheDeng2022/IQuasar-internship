  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will describe the efficacy of pamiparib in combination with tislelizumab in&#xD;
      patients with advanced tumours harbouring molecular profiles consistent with homologous&#xD;
      recombination deficiency (HRD), agnostic of tumour origin. A tumour-agnostic approach has&#xD;
      been adopted in this study due to the broad activity of PARP inhibitors across multiple&#xD;
      tumour types. In addition, response to PARP inhibitors has been demonstrated in patients with&#xD;
      genomic features associated with HRD, even in the absence of germline BRCA1 or BRCA2&#xD;
      mutations. These results suggest that the presence of HRD itself is the key predictive&#xD;
      biomarker for PARP inhibitor efficacy. This paves the way for a precision-oncology,&#xD;
      tumour-agnostic approach to patient selection for treatment, rather than the traditional&#xD;
      tumour site-of-origin basis for which the current PARP inhibitor approvals exist. To&#xD;
      investigate this, cohort A of this study includes patients with genomic features of HRD, but&#xD;
      without a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Demonstration of clinical efficacy in this cohort&#xD;
      will provide strong support to the tumour-agnostic, precision-oncology approach for patient&#xD;
      selection for PARP inhibitor or PARP inhibitor combination treatment. This forms the primary&#xD;
      objective of the study. The study will consist of two cohorts, broadly, cohort A - patients&#xD;
      without a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation but with other germline or somatic mutations in&#xD;
      other HRD genes; cohort B- patients with a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2&#xD;
