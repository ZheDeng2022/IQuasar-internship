  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In preterm infants with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), exogenous pulmonary&#xD;
      surfactant(PS) replacement therapy is one of the most important therapeutic breakthrough to&#xD;
      reduce neonatal incidences of bronchopulmonary dysplasia(BPD) and/or death. But not all&#xD;
      preterm infants with RDS can be beneficial. Otherwise, the international neonatal acute RDS&#xD;
      (NARDS) collaborative group provides the first consensus definition for NARDS in 2017. And&#xD;
      whether or not PS being beneficial in preterm infants with NARDS remains unknown.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, the optimal dose of PS is inconsistent, although the recommended dose of PS is given&#xD;
      in the 2019 update guideline. PS is not recommended to adult and pediatric ARDS. Systematic&#xD;
      review indicates that PS does not reduce the incidences of BPD and death in infants with&#xD;
      meconium aspiration syndrome(MAS, a subtype of NARDS). A reasonable speculation is that&#xD;
      preterm infants with NARDS do not benefit from PS. And the speculation can explain why not&#xD;
      all preterm infants with RDS can be beneficial from PS. In the era of pre-NARDS, the preterm&#xD;
      infants fulfilling the definition of NARDS may have been considered as RDS in the first three&#xD;
      days after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meantime, the dose of PS given to infants with NARDS remains unknown. the aim of the present&#xD;
      study is to assess the optimal dose of PS. the control group: PS is given according to the&#xD;
      European RDS management guideline in 2019 edition. The study group: PS is stopped when the&#xD;
      pressure is equal between before patent ductus arteriosus(bPDA) and after PDA(aPDA). the&#xD;
      primary outcomes are the closure rate of PDA within 7 days, the incidence of BPD and/or&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
