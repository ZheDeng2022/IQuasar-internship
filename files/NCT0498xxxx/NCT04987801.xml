  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poisoning is a medical emergency representing a health problem all over the world with an&#xD;
      incidence rate that is variable from one place to another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nature of poison used varies in different parts of the world and may vary even in&#xD;
      different parts of the same country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pattern of poisoning within a country depends on several factors such as the&#xD;
      accessibility of various poisons, socio-economic status of the population, religious and&#xD;
      cultural influences and drug prescription manners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug overdose continues to be the most common cause of acute poisoning all over the world. An&#xD;
      estimated 2 to 5 million poisonings and drug overdoses occur annually in the United States of&#xD;
      America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overdose is the most common manifestation of deliberate self-harm behavior, and is a common&#xD;
      cause of presentation to hospital Emergency Departments (EDs). It starts to get global&#xD;
      attention due to its higher rate of morbidity and mortality in spite of being a preventable&#xD;
      cause of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute drug overdosing is an important cause of organ dysfunction and metabolic derangements&#xD;
      and the patients often require intensive care admission. Among patients admitted to hospital&#xD;
      following drug overdoses, approximately 13-22% will require Intensive Care Unit (ICU)&#xD;
      admission. Overdoses have been reported to account for 3.8-13.8% of all ICU admissions with&#xD;
      79.5-84% requiring mechanical ventilation in Australia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment and complications of patients with acute drug intoxication in ICU vary&#xD;
      according the nature of the substance ingested, individual amount of drug, and the&#xD;
      concomitant use of other substances. The interventions requiring critical care in acute&#xD;
      drug-poisoned patients include the need for airways protection and mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
      hemodynamic stabilization and needs for vasopressors, and specific procedures that would&#xD;
      enhance the clearance of the toxins involved.&#xD;
