  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a deadly infectious disease&#xD;
      and major global public health problem. Recent evidence from animal studies suggests that the&#xD;
      microbiome plays a role in TB pathogenesis and immune response. However, until now, no&#xD;
      similar study has been performed in humans and thus any influence of the microbiota on TB or&#xD;
      vice versa remains unknown.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis is among one of the most difficult to treat infections that require multidrug&#xD;
      therapy for prolonged periods, in most cases 6-9 months. Treatment failure is still common&#xD;
      and frequently observed (even where adherence to antibiotic therapy is maintained) in 15% of&#xD;
      drug-susceptible infections and 31% for drug-resistant cases. Although poor patient&#xD;
      compliance and the emergence of drug-resistant Mtb strains are generally implicated as a&#xD;
      major cause of TB treatment failure, other factors such as the role of the microbiome in TB&#xD;
      pathogenesis and reactivation are poorly considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human microbiome is a consortium/collection of all microorganisms (bacteria, archaea,&#xD;
      viruses, and fungi) colonizing different habitats in the human body such as skin, gut, and&#xD;
      mucosal surfaces and living in a commensal relationship with each other. Emerging evidence&#xD;
      suggests a crucial role of the microbiome in hosts physiology, nutritional status, and&#xD;
      development of the functional immune system. Microbial dysbiosis is the change in microbial&#xD;
      composition or functional potential that has been implicated both in infectious diseases&#xD;
      status as well as the development of non-communicable disease in hosts ranging from immune&#xD;
      mediated diseases to intergenerational obesity and even cancers. Microbial dysbiosis at&#xD;
      different body sites has also been reported in TB-associated comorbidities such as diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus and malnutrition. However, to date, the role of the microbiome and microbial&#xD;
      dysbiosis is not clear in the context of TB infections in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study aims to dissect the relationship between the microbiomes and its&#xD;
      interaction with the immune system during TB infection, and anti-tuberculosis therapy in&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;
