      This will be a semi-experimental study on constipation predominant IBS patient. One group of&#xD;
      patient will receive prucalopride 2mg daily and another group of patient will receive&#xD;
      lubiprostone 8 microgram twice daily. IBS-SSS and IBS-QOL score will be recorded at baseline&#xD;
      and at follow up at 3 week and 6 week. Effectiveness of both drug will be evaluated by&#xD;
      comparing the baseline data with data at 3 week and 6 week(IBS-SSS and IBS-QOL).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients of both sexes age between 18-50 years attended the outpatient department&#xD;
      of Gastroenterology, BSMMU, meeting the inclusion Criteria entered a 2 week screening period.&#xD;
      During this period, patients were required to discontinue all laxative medications. All&#xD;
      participants will be advised to maintain a stable diet with no significant changes in their&#xD;
      consumption of liquids or fiber or in their level of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening period, patients accessed and diary system on a daily basis to report&#xD;
      the occurrence and time of all spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs), defined as those that&#xD;
      occurred without the use of rescue medications. If the patient did not experience a SBM for 3&#xD;
      or more consecutive days and needed relief, the study investigator could authorize the&#xD;
      patient to administer a rescue medication. Initial rescue treatment consisted of a 10 mg&#xD;
      bisacodyl. If this was not successful a Fleet enema could then be used. If both of these&#xD;
      treatment options were unsuccessful, an alternative medication could be prescribed after&#xD;
      consultation with the investigator. At the end of the screening period, patients were&#xD;
      assessed by medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests (CBC, ESR, CRP, RBS,&#xD;
      S. creatinine, S.TSH and ECG) will be done. ECG will be done from cardiology OPD, BSMMU, and&#xD;
      rest of the investigations from Department of Laboratory Medicine, BSMMU. Report will be&#xD;
      noted in the standard data sheet. Any alternative diagnosis if proven by clinical examination&#xD;
      or laboratory investigation will be excluded from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be recruited according to sample size. Selection into two groups will be&#xD;
      performed non probability sampling method. An independent treatment codes and allocation will&#xD;
      be maintained. Patients enrolled in trial were selected to receive either or prucalopride 2&#xD;
      mg once daily at morning before breakfast or lubiprostone 8 mcg twice daily after meal.&#xD;
      Before starting treatment each individual will undergo a baseline assessment during which&#xD;
      demographic data, IBS symptoms and QOL data will be recorded. Each drug was administered&#xD;
      after with at least 8 ounces of water for a period of 6 weeks. A reduction to once-daily&#xD;
      dosing was allowed, at the discretion of the investigator, if the patient experienced nausea&#xD;
      or diarrhea for more than 2 days or if patients experienced other adverse events. During&#xD;
      treatment, patients were prohibited from taking prescription or OTC medications for&#xD;
      constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non constipation-related prescriptions and other OTC medications were allowed and their usage&#xD;
      was documented as was as any medication change. As in the screening period, the use of rescue&#xD;
      medications was allowed in those who failed to have a spontaneous bowel movement for 3 or&#xD;
      more consecutive days and thus needed relief. During the 6-week study phase, clinic visits&#xD;
      were conducted at weeks 3 and 6 week and phone interviews were performed at 1 week after&#xD;
      starting and 2 week after the end at study period. At each clinic visit, the daily diary&#xD;
      information was reviewed and discussed with the patient, adverse events were recorded,&#xD;
      remaining capsules were collected to assess compliance and assessments of vital signs and&#xD;
      laboratory parameters were performed. Patients also completed the IBS-QOL and IBS-SSS at week&#xD;
      3 and 6 visits. Patients will be asked to return with the strips of the ingested drugs at the&#xD;
      end of the treatment to count &amp; ensure compliance. Any adverse effect due to drugs will also&#xD;
      be noted at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBS-SSS is a 5 item tools. It is primarily a measure of IBS symptoms including abdominal pain&#xD;
      and distension as well as bowel satisfaction. This scale evaluates IBS symptoms: abdominal&#xD;
      pain, abdominal distension, stool frequency and consistency and interference with life in&#xD;
      general. The IBS-SSS calculates the sum of these 5 items scored on a visual analogue scale&#xD;
      from 0-100. Determination of severity of each symptoms is determined by patient. The nature&#xD;
      of the items on IBS-SSS is appropriate to be used in clinical trials. The items are summed&#xD;
      and thus the total score can range from 0 to 500 points. IBS severity has the following&#xD;
      defined ranges: mild 75-174, moderate 175-300, and severe &gt; 300&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IBS-QOL questionnaire is a 34-item instruments which assess QOL impairment due to IBS&#xD;
      symptoms. Each item is scored on a five-point scale (1 = not at all, 5 = a great deal) that&#xD;
      represents one of eight dimensions (dysphoria, interference with activity, body image,&#xD;
      health-related worries, food avoidance, social reactions, sexual dysfunction, and&#xD;
      relationships). Items are scored to derive an overall total score of IBS related QOL. To&#xD;
      facilitate score interpretation, the summed total score is transformed to a 0-100 scale&#xD;
      ranging from zero (poor QOL) to 100 (maximum QOL). The QOL instrument will be given to each&#xD;
      patient before treatment is started; the patient will complete the form according to schedule&#xD;
      and all data will be recorded and entered onto a data sheet.&#xD;
