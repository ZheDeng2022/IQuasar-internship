  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Today, billions of people are struggling with the pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus. The&#xD;
      pandemic causes many psychosocial and mental health problems in humans. (Montano and Acebes&#xD;
      2020, Guo, Feng et al. 2020, Ostacoli, Cosmo et al. 2020, Carmassi, Foghi et al. 2020,&#xD;
      Heitzman 2020, Sun, Sun et al. 2021, Yuan ,Gong et al. 2021, Taylor, Landry et al 2020 ).&#xD;
      Many people have faced problems such as stress, depression and anxiety (Liu, Yang et al&#xD;
      2020). Compared to other segments of the society, health workers experience these problems&#xD;
      more frequently and more severely. The reason for this is that healthcare professionals&#xD;
      undertake the task of providing health care services to people infected with the virus, being&#xD;
      together with patients, having close contact and meeting their health needs. This situation&#xD;
      triggers the risk of contact with patients, fear of death, concerns about the health of&#xD;
      themselves and their family members, and psychological problems (Aykurt and Aykurt 2020).&#xD;
      Therefore, healthcare workers are considered to be a high-risk group in which the&#xD;
      psychological consequences of COVID-19 are significant and persistent (Fiorillo and Gorwood&#xD;
      2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in the literature have shown that healthcare workers experience severe anxiety due to&#xD;
      COVID-19. (Yanez, Jahanshahi et al 2020, Sahebi, Nejati et al 2021, Lai, Ma et al 2019, Ataç,&#xD;
      Sezerol et al 2020, Luo, Liu et al 2021).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is very important to screen health workers who provide uninterrupted service in pandemic&#xD;
      conditions in terms of anxiety and other psychological problems and to plan remedial&#xD;
      interventions. In this context, music therapy, which is known as an effective method to&#xD;
      reduce the anxiety level of individuals and reduce stress, comes to mind. Music therapy&#xD;
      studies with healthcare professionals are limited in the literature. In this context, it is&#xD;
      aimed that this study will contribute to filling this gap in the literature and creating a&#xD;
      database.&#xD;

The scale consists of a total of 40 items in two separate parts. The scale includes direct and reversed statements. The total score that can be obtained from the scale is a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 80 points, and an increase in the score indicates an increase in the level of anxiety (Öner and Le Compte 1983).</description>
