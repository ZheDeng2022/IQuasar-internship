      The overall objective of the proposed randomized trial is to test whether implementation of&#xD;
      intensively integrated care of microvascular risk factors (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1C],&#xD;
      urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio [ACR], blood pressure [BP], estimated glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate [eGFR], uric acid [UA] and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL]) will&#xD;
      improve and reduce diabetic kidney disease events (DKD morbidity and mortality) among&#xD;
      patients with diabetes and additional microvascular risk factors compared to usual care in&#xD;
      public primary care setting (community health service center) in Xiamen, China.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most patients with diabetes, which has reached epidemic proportions in China, have multiple&#xD;
      uncontrolled microvascular risk factors due to suboptimal care. Diabetic kidney disease&#xD;
      events (DKD) is one of the most common microvascular complications and has been becoming the&#xD;
      leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of the proposed randomized trial is to test whether implementation of&#xD;
      intensively integrated care of microvascular risk factors (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1C],&#xD;
      urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio [ACR], blood pressure [BP], estimated glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate [eGFR], uric acid [UA] and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL]) will&#xD;
      improve and reduce diabetic kidney disease events (DKD morbidity and mortality) among&#xD;
      patients with diabetes and additional microvascular risk factors compared to usual care in&#xD;
      public primary care setting (community health service center) in Xiamen, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Prevention In Community Clinics From Diabetic Kidney Disease (PICK) study is an&#xD;
      open-label randomized controlled trial which will be conducted in one public primary care&#xD;
      setting (Lianqian community health service center) in Xiamen, China. The proposed trial will&#xD;
      recruit 1240 patients with diabetes and additional microvascular risk factors but without DKD&#xD;
      at baseline. Approximately 620 participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention&#xD;
      group and similar participants to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intensively integrated care, which will provide a standardized, combined, multi-component&#xD;
      intervention according to clinical guideline treatment for diabetes and comorbidities in a&#xD;
      primary care setting, will be delivered by trained primary care physicians, health managers&#xD;
      and diabetes specialists. Diabetic microvascular risk factors (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1C],&#xD;
      urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio [ACR], blood pressure [BP], estimated glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate [eGFR], uric acid [UA] and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL]) will be&#xD;
      tested every 3 month for the intervention group and clinical treatment decisions based on the&#xD;
      test results will be implemented accordingly when necessary. The intensively integrated care&#xD;
      intervention will last for 36 months. HbA1C, ACR, BP, eGFR, UA, LDL, other variables and&#xD;
      co-morbidities will be measured at baseline and follow-up visits every 3 month. Meanwhile&#xD;
      management of the diabetic microvascular risk factors for the control group will be conducted&#xD;
      as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1, the primary outcomes are mean reductions in HbA1C, ACR, BP, eGFR, UA and LDL&#xD;
      levels over the 18-month intervention between intervention and control groups. Net change in&#xD;
      HbA1C, ACR, BP, eGFR, UA and LDL levels will be simultaneously modeled using a scaled&#xD;
      marginal model which allows estimation of a single overall intervention effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2, the primary outcome is differences in DKD morbidity and mortality over the&#xD;
      36-month intervention between intervention and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes are the cumulative incidence rates of albuminuria and renal impairment&#xD;
      over 36-months of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed trial is designed to provide 80% statistical power to detect a 4% reduction in&#xD;
      the cumulative incidence of DKD at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. An 90% follow-up&#xD;
      rate is assumed and is taken into consideration in the power calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This implementation research project has a high impact in public health, because it will&#xD;
      generate urgently needed data on an effective, practical, and sustainable intervention&#xD;
      program aimed at reducing DKD burden among diabetes patients in developing countries.&#xD;
