  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is emerging evidence suggesting that the pulmonary vasculature and right heart may play&#xD;
      a role in the limitation of exercise capacity in healthy individuals. It is well established&#xD;
      that aerobic training improves cardiovascular function. While the pulmonary system is&#xD;
      integral to the function of the cardiopulmonary system, it has been traditionally accepted&#xD;
      that lung function does not respond to exercise training. However, recent research suggests&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular function adaptations may occur with aerobic training, and this may&#xD;
      contribute to enhanced exercise tolerance. Research has highlighted that increased capillary&#xD;
      blood volume (Vc) and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) are correlated with&#xD;
      higher cardiorespiratory fitness at rest. Additionally, endurance trained participants have&#xD;
      increased exercise DLCO concomitant to higher resting Vc when compared to untrained&#xD;
      participants, and during exercise this difference seems to be driven by higher membrane&#xD;
      diffusing capacity (Dm), independent of Vc or VA (alveolar volume). Of importance is also the&#xD;
      evidence that highlights endurance trained participants having reduced pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      pressures at rest and during exercise. Reduced pulmonary arterial pressure in endurance&#xD;
      trained participants despite endurance trained participants consistently displaying increased&#xD;
      diffusion capacity/pulmonary perfusion at rest and during exercise suggests a lower threshold&#xD;
      pressure for pulmonary capillary recruitment. Together, this cross-sectional evidence&#xD;
      suggests improvements in the pulmonary circulation due to exercise training in order to&#xD;
      facilitate gas exchange. Whether this apparent improvement in pulmonary circulation is due to&#xD;
      enhanced pulmonary vascular function via NO mediated vasodilation must be determined&#xD;
      experimentally. If sildenafil administration improves DLCO, Vc, and Dm, this would provide&#xD;
      evidence that the NO mediated vasodilatory pathway plays a role in the regulation of vascular&#xD;
      tone, function, and perfusion across the pulmonary vasculature. Should a larger response to&#xD;
      sildenafil be observed in untrained persons, this would suggest better baseline vascular&#xD;
      function in trained participants compared to untrained. This would provide strong evidence&#xD;
      that aerobic training improves pulmonary vasculature function which is contrary to the&#xD;
      conventional understanding of aerobic training on the cardiopulmonary system.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is emerging evidence suggesting that the pulmonary vasculature and right heart may play&#xD;
      a role in the limitation of exercise capacity in healthy individuals. It is well established&#xD;
      that aerobic training improves cardiovascular function. While the pulmonary system is&#xD;
      integral to the function of the cardiopulmonary system, it has been traditionally accepted&#xD;
      that lung function does not respond to exercise training. However, recent research suggests&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular function adaptations may occur with aerobic training, and this may&#xD;
      contribute to enhanced exercise tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has highlighted that increased capillary blood volume (Vc) and diffusion capacity&#xD;
      for carbon monoxide (DLCO) are correlated with higher cardiorespiratory fitness at rest.&#xD;
      Additionally, endurance trained participants have increased exercise DLCO concomitant to&#xD;
      higher resting Vc when compared to untrained participants, and during exercise this&#xD;
      difference seems to be driven by higher membrane diffusing capacity (Dm), independent of Vc&#xD;
      or VA (alveolar volume). Of importance is also the evidence that highlights endurance trained&#xD;
      participants having reduced pulmonary arterial pressures at rest and during exercise. Reduced&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial pressure in endurance trained participants despite endurance trained&#xD;
      participants consistently displaying increased diffusion capacity/pulmonary perfusion at rest&#xD;
      and during exercise suggests a lower threshold pressure for pulmonary capillary recruitment.&#xD;
      Together, this cross-sectional evidence suggests improvements in the pulmonary circulation&#xD;
      due to exercise training in order to facilitate gas exchange. Whether this apparent&#xD;
      improvement in pulmonary circulation is due to enhanced pulmonary vascular function via NO&#xD;
      mediated vasodilation must be determined experimentally. If sildenafil administration&#xD;
      improves DLCO, Vc, and Dm, this would provide evidence that the NO mediated vasodilatory&#xD;
      pathway plays a role in the regulation of vascular tone, function, and perfusion across the&#xD;
      pulmonary vasculature. Should a larger response to sildenafil be observed in untrained&#xD;
      persons, this would suggest better baseline vascular function in trained participants&#xD;
      compared to untrained. This would provide strong evidence that aerobic training improves&#xD;
      pulmonary vasculature function which is contrary to the conventional understanding of aerobic&#xD;
      training on the cardiopulmonary system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some investigations on the pulmonary vasculature have been completed with the known pulmonary&#xD;
      vasodilator, sildenafil. Sildenafil administration has been shown to reduce pulmonary artery&#xD;
      pressure and improve exercise tolerance in normobaric hypoxic conditions in young healthy&#xD;
      individuals. Further, one of these investigations determined sildenafil did not alter maximal&#xD;
      oxygen consumption (VÌ‡O2peak) in normoxia in moderately fit participants; however, this study&#xD;
      was likely underpowered to detect a response. While some sildenafil interventional work has&#xD;
      been conducted, no study to date has determined the effect of sildenafil on DLCO, Vc, and Dm&#xD;
      during exercise in untrained vs. trained participants. If sildenafil administration improves&#xD;
      DLCO, Vc, and Dm, this would provide evidence that the NO mediated vasodilatory pathway plays&#xD;
      a role in the regulation of vascular tone, function, and perfusion across the pulmonary&#xD;
      vasculature. Should a larger response to sildenafil be observed in untrained persons, this&#xD;
      would suggest better baseline vascular function in trained participants compared to&#xD;
      untrained. This would provide strong evidence that aerobic training improves pulmonary&#xD;
      vasculature function which is contrary to the conventional understanding of aerobic training&#xD;
      on the cardiopulmonary system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the effects of the pulmonary vasodilator sildenafil on DLCO, Vc, and Dm in trained&#xD;
      and untrained participants at rest and during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      If sildenafil administration improves DLCO, Vc, and Dm, this would provide evidence that the&#xD;
      NO mediated vasodilatory pathway plays a role in the regulation of vascular tone, function,&#xD;
      and perfusion across the pulmonary vasculature. Should a larger response to sildenafil be&#xD;
      observed in untrained persons, this would suggest better baseline vascular function in&#xD;
      trained participants compared to untrained. This would provide strong evidence that aerobic&#xD;
      training improves pulmonary vasculature function which is contrary to the conventional&#xD;
      understanding of aerobic training on the cardiopulmonary system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled cross-over design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Sildenafil (oral), 50 mg Placebo: Medical grade placebo pill&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over, cross-sectional study will&#xD;
      include 6 sessions and will be a crossover design with participants acting as their own&#xD;
      controls. All exercise protocols will be conducted on an electronically braked cycle&#xD;
      ergometer and will begin with a standardized warm-up and end with a standardized cool-down.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1) During session 1, participants will provide informed consent and health screening&#xD;
      (PAR-Q+), be familiarized to the laboratory and experimental measurement protocols, conduct a&#xD;
      pulmonary function test, and conduct an incremental maximal exercise test to determine&#xD;
      VÌ‡O2peak on the cycle ergometer. A small blood sample will be collected via finger prick to&#xD;
      measure hemoglobin (to correct DLCO). Specific relative workloads will be calculated&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory and power output data obtained from the VÌ‡O2peak protocol conducted during&#xD;
      session 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 2 and 3) During sessions 2 and 3, participants will ingest either a placebo or 50 mg&#xD;
      sildenafil, then rest a minimum of 30 minutes. Testing will start with measurement of resting&#xD;
      diffusion capacity, pulmonary capillary blood volume (Vc), and membrane diffusion capacity&#xD;
      (Dm) using the multiple fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2)-DLCO technique, with the order of&#xD;
      FIO2 administration randomized and the participant in supine position. Supine DLCO&#xD;
      measurements are to determine maximal resting DLCO and to quantify the impact of postural&#xD;
      change on participant DLCO. Next, participants will complete resting baseline DLCO&#xD;
      measurements seated on the cycle ergometer, followed by an absolute workload protocol with&#xD;
      the exercise intensity set at 60 Watts for a duration of ten minutes. A small blood sample&#xD;
      will be collected via finger prick to measure hemoglobin (to correct DLCO). During the&#xD;
      absolute workload protocol, measurements will occur after the 4th minute of exercise, in&#xD;
      order to allow verification of measurement equipment operation during exercise and to give&#xD;
      the participant sufficient time to warm-up and hit steady state. Steady state will be defined&#xD;
      as minute-by-minute change in heart rate â‰¤ 5 bpm. A minimum of 9 and no more than 12&#xD;
      breath-holds will be performed during this session. The order of sessions 2 and 3 will be&#xD;
      randomized and the participant and laboratory technicians will be blinded to the&#xD;
      administration of the pharmacological intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 4 and 5) During sessions 4 and 5, participants will ingest either a placebo or 50 mg&#xD;
      sildenafil, rest a minimum of 30 minutes, and then complete exercise DLCO sessions. The&#xD;
      exercise DLCO sessions will include exercise intensities set at 30%, 60%, and 90% of&#xD;
      individual VÌ‡O2peak with the order of FIO2 administration and workload randomized. A minimum&#xD;
      of 9 and no more than 12 breath-holds will be performed during this session. DLCO&#xD;
      measurements will be taken after participants have attained steady-state at each workload. A&#xD;
      small blood sample will be collected via finger prick to measure hemoglobin (to correct&#xD;
      DLCO). Participants will complete active recovery (&lt;100W) between workloads to minimize&#xD;
      fatigue and metabolite accumulation similar to previous work. The order of sessions 4 and 5&#xD;
      will be randomized and the participant and laboratory technicians will be blinded to the&#xD;
      administration of the pharmacological intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 6) During session 6, participants will undergo echocardiography measurements at rest&#xD;
      and during exercise after taking placebo and sildenafil. The order of drug administration&#xD;
      during this session will not be randomized. Resting echocardiography will be conducted during&#xD;
      quiet seated rest and exercise will be conducted exercising at 60 Watts, both on the same&#xD;
      cycle ergometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1 is anticipated to take ~2 hours. Sessions 2 and 3 are anticipated to take ~1.5&#xD;
      hours. Sessions 4 and 5 are anticipated to take 2 hours. Session 6 is anticipated to take 2&#xD;
      hours. The anticipated total study duration is ~11 hours. All sessions will be planned within&#xD;
      a 6-week timeframe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using commercially available software. A priori Î± = 0.05. Diffusion&#xD;
      capacity response will be analyzed by group mean analysis with a two-way repeated measures&#xD;
      ANOVA with the groupings as HI-FIT and LO-FIT (key variables DLCO, Dm, Vc) across all&#xD;
      exercise intensities, consistent with previous work with similar methods and primary&#xD;
      outcomes. Post-hoc testing will be conducted via Holm-Sidak method. The same approach will be&#xD;
      used to determine differences in key variables from echocardiography (e.g. PASP).&#xD;
