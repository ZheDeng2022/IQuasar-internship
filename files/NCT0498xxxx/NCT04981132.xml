    <textblock>
      The presented study investigates the effects of pain and exercise training via&#xD;
      telerehabilitation method on pain, pain beliefs, spinal mobility, functionality, and quality&#xD;
      of life in individuals with low back pain caused by facet joint arthrosis. Forty - five&#xD;
      individuals are planning to include in the study. Participants will randomly assign to one of&#xD;
      the three groups: Group 1: Pain education group, Group 2: Exercise training group, and Group&#xD;
      3: Control group. The same physiotherapist will make evaluations. Group 1 will have pain&#xD;
      neuroscience education, and Group 2 will have progressive therapeutic exercise training for&#xD;
      six weeks, twice a week, for 40 minutes, in total twelve sessions. Group 3 participants will&#xD;
      be taken to the waiting list. Clinical and demographic data of the 45 participants in the&#xD;
      study will be taken pre and post interventions. The primary outcomes are; the Visual analog&#xD;
      Scale (VAS) and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Secondary outcomes are Lumbar range of&#xD;
      motion (L-ROM), the Active Straight Leg Raise Test (A- SLR), The Pain Belief Questionnaire&#xD;
      (PBQ), and the Short Form Quality of Life Form (SF-12). Statistical analysis will be run&#xD;
      through the SPSS 20.0 package program.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      'Pain Neuroscience Education' (PNE) is one of the cognitive approaches among conservative&#xD;
      treatments, has been one of the most inquisitive approaches. The content of the education&#xD;
      includes the physiology of pain, types of pain, the areas in which it is represented in the&#xD;
      brain, its effect on body image, and psychosocial dimensions. Education aims to break the&#xD;
      patient's misinformation and perception about pain and teach how to manage pain. It aims to&#xD;
      inform patients about the neurophysiological and neurobiological processes related to the&#xD;
      pain experience and help change their misinformation about pain conditions. Improved pain&#xD;
      knowledge changes attitudes and beliefs about pain, reduces destructive thoughts, fear of&#xD;
      pain, and improves physical performance. It is known to reduce pain and disability according&#xD;
      to short-term results in patients with chronic pain with central sensitization. According to&#xD;
      systematic reviews, PNE is moderately effective in patients with chronic musculoskeletal&#xD;
      pain. In addition, it is stated that the use of educational approaches based on the&#xD;
      neurophysiology of pain offers clinical benefits not only in physical terms but also in&#xD;
      psychosocial terms. Since maladaptive psychosocial factors (for example, negative emotions,&#xD;
      poor self-efficacy, maladaptive beliefs) are associated with pain behaviors, it is thought&#xD;
      that increasing pain knowledge will have an impact on pain perception. In a study conducted&#xD;
      on patients with musculoskeletal pain who experience different types of pain, an inverse&#xD;
      relationship between pain intensity and knowledge level was shown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the interest in the telerehabilitation method has increased,&#xD;
      and it has become reachable easier with more evidence value on this subject. However,&#xD;
      physiotherapists are healthcare professionals who work face-to-face with patients; depending&#xD;
      on the pandemic curfews, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended not to continue&#xD;
      face-to-face practices, except in emergencies, to protect patients' and physiotherapists'&#xD;
      health. While digital options such as sensors, wearable technologies, virtual reality, and&#xD;
      artificial intelligence are considered a solution, Tele-Rehabilitation (TR) can be the most&#xD;
      practical, reachable, and cheaper solution to existing problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systematic researches and meta-analyses examining the effect of the telerehabilitation method&#xD;
      and comparing it with traditional rehabilitation have revealed similar gains in outcome&#xD;
      measures such as pain intensity and quality of life. It has been reported that simultaneous&#xD;
      TR has comparable and effective results with face-to-face rehabilitation on pain and function&#xD;
      in musculoskeletal problems. The telerehabilitation method is effective and cost-effective,&#xD;
      especially in low back pain. Revealing the effects with more specific patient groups is the&#xD;
      common recommendation of the studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with this information, the study's primary purpose is to determine the effects of PNE&#xD;
      and progressive therapeutic exercise training given by the physiotherapist with the&#xD;
      telerehabilitation method on pain, spinal mobility, pain beliefs, functionality, and quality&#xD;
      of life. The secondary aim is to compare the effectiveness of PNE and progressive therapeutic&#xD;
      exercise training.&#xD;

    <description>It is a frequently used scale with proven validity and reliability (Clark 2003, Boonstra 2008), consists of a horizontal line 100 mm long. There are two marks at the beginning and end of the line. The mark at the beginning of the line indicates 0 mm - no pain; the mark at the end of the line - 100 mm - unbearable pain. Subjects will be asked to place a mark on this horizontal line for the maximum pain they feel during rest and activity, and the results will be recorded in cm.</description>

    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index(ODI) is an extremely important tool that researchers and disability evaluators use to measure a patient's permanent functional disability. The test is considered the 'gold standard' of low back functional outcome tools. Scores between 0-5 are given for each question on the scale consisting of 10 questions. Questions are on travel, social life, sex life, sleeping, standing, sitting, walking, lifting things and personal precautions. Maximum score is 50, minimum score is 0.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre - intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Lumbar flexion, extension, and lateral flexions will be measured with an application called 'Angulus', which the DPP company developed in 2016 with physiotherapists (DPP 2016). For measurements, the patient will be asked to complete the movement, and the photograph will be taken at the endpoint. Then, the angle measurement will be performed by marking the reference points and planes on the photograph.</description>

    <measure>Active Straight Leg Raise Test (Laseque)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre - intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The test is a provocative test that evaluates pain in the lumbar region with the mobility and stability of the lumbopelvic region. It is generally used in the physical examination for the differential diagnosis of low back pain due to neurological origin irritation, disc pathologies, sacroiliac dysfunction, and facet joint arthrosis. It is interpreted as pain that develops due to the hip flexion and whether or not irritation occurs in the nerve root. While the patient is lying in the supine position, knees are extended, and hip flexion is asked. The angles at which pain starts, spreads, and ends with flexion are recorded. The cases that pain usually start below 45 degrees and disappears with flexion of the knee at the starting angle are positive or a laseque sign.</description>

    <measure>The Pain Beliefs Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre - intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Edwards et al. in 1992 developed to evaluate beliefs about the cause and treatment of pain (Edwards et al. 1992), validity in Turkish patients, and reliability study of the scale was conducted by Berk in 2006 (Berk, 2006). There are 12 items on this scale covering pain beliefs. Accordingly, it consisted of two test areas: Organic Beliefs consisting of 8 items and Psychological Beliefs consisting of 4 items. There is no cut-off point in the score. As the score increased, the internal consistency scores were measured with the Cronbach Alpha coefficient and reported as 0.71 for the Organic Beliefs subtest and 0.73 for the Psychological Beliefs subtest. The patient is asked to mark the most appropriate one for each item from 6 Likert-type options between 1: never and 6: always. The score for each subtest is calculated by adding the scores obtained from the items and dividing the number of items.</description>
