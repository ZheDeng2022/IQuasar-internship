  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral Veno-Arterial Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (VA ECMO) is a temporary&#xD;
      assistance that provides a mechanical circulatory support in patients victim of cardiogenic&#xD;
      shock (CS) or refractory cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During VA-ECMO support, hypotension may frequently occur due to deteriorated cardiac&#xD;
      function, vasoplegia, or hypovolemia. Volume expansion is a common means to correct&#xD;
      hypotension and improve systemic perfusion, but inappropriate fluid therapy is associated&#xD;
      with adverse outcomes. As other intensive care unit (ICU) patients, VA-ECMO assisted patients&#xD;
      have been shown to have higher mortality in case of large early fluid administration.&#xD;
      Prediction of fluid responsiveness could achieve a lower fluid balance and improve outcomes&#xD;
      of patients treated with VA-ECMO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several dynamic hemodynamic parameters based on cardio-pulmonary interactions (stroke volume,&#xD;
      pulse pressure or inferior vena cava variations induced by invasive ventilation cycles) have&#xD;
      been described and validated for predicting fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the VA-ECMO conditions (native cardiac circulation by-pass, low pulsatility,&#xD;
      presence of drainage canulation in the inferior vena cava, the use of low tidal volume) make&#xD;
      this parameters less reliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulation of a fluid loading by shifting blood from the lower limbs and splanchnic&#xD;
      compartment thanks to a revisable maneuver is another feasible approach to assess fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness. Whereas the use of different maneuvers have been validated in the classical&#xD;
      ICU population, very few data exist in the ECMO population and their application is&#xD;
      questioning because blood transfer may be modified by the preload dependence of the ECMO.&#xD;
      Recently, Luo et al showed that the variation of aortic Velocity Time Integral (VTI) measured&#xD;
      using echocardiography induced by a Trendelenburg maneuver was predictive of fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness during VA-ECMO support. However, their study excluded patients with low&#xD;
      cardiac ejection (pulse pressure &lt; 15 mmHg) so that their data may not be extrapolated to the&#xD;
      acute phase of heart failure requiring full mechanical support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, aortic VTI measurement suffers from low reproducibility in case of low native&#xD;
      cardiac output (NCO) and arrythmia; and can be time-consuming. The investigators previously&#xD;
      demonstrated in an observational prospective study that End-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) and Pulse&#xD;
      Pressure (PP) were strongly correlated to NCO during VA-ECMO when NCO &lt; 2l/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to study the variations of aortic VTI, EtCO2 and PP induced by Passive&#xD;
      Leg Rising (PLR) and their ability to predict fluid responsiveness in patients under VA-ECMO.&#xD;

      Settings :&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective non interventional study is conducted since february 2020 in the&#xD;
      investigators' ICU and has been approved by their hospital's institutional review board.&#xD;
      Informed consent is obtained from all patients or their surrogates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients :&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who receive VA-ECMO support and mechanical ventilation for refractory&#xD;
      cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest of any etiology (acute myocardial infarction, end-stage&#xD;
      dilated cardiomyopathy, heart surgery, fulminant myocarditis…) are screened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients conditioning :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are sedated by propofol/dexmedetomidine and sufentanyl and under invasive mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation. Continuous blood pressure is monitored via a radial arterial catheter. PP is&#xD;
      defined as systolic arterial pressure-diastolic arterial pressure. Central venous catheter is&#xD;
      placed at the upper body for central venous oxygen saturation (ScVO2) monitoring. Lung&#xD;
      ventilation is managed with low levels of respiratory rate (10-14 breaths/min) and tidal&#xD;
      volume (4-6mL/ kg), and with a modest level of positive end- expiratory pressure (8-10 cmH2O)&#xD;
      to ensure protective ventilation. EtCO2 is measured noninvasively from exhaled breath on a&#xD;
      ventilator circuit and monitored using a ventilator CO2 analyzer (Maquet servo U, Drager&#xD;
      Evita Infinity V500).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECMO circuit settings and patients management under ECMO :&#xD;
&#xD;
      VA-ECMO consist of polyvinyl chloride tubing with a membrane oxygenator (PH.I.S.I.O and EOS;&#xD;
      Sorin Group, Clamart, France), a centrifugal pump (Stockert; Sorin Group), and percutaneous&#xD;
      or surgically inserted arterial and venous femoral cannulae (Fem-Flex and Fem-Track, Edwards&#xD;
      Life- sciences, Guyancourt, France) with or without an additional 7 F cannula inserted&#xD;
      distally into the femoral artery to prevent lower limb ischemia. An oxygen-air blender&#xD;
      (Sechrist Industries, Anaheim, CA) ventilate the membrane oxygenator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfractionated heparin is administrated to maintain an anti-factor-Xa activity of between 0.2&#xD;
      and 0.3 IU/mL. In the initial phase of the circulatory assistance, VA-ECMO flow is set to&#xD;
      provide adequate tissue perfusion (ScVO2 ≥ 65%) and to obtain correction of metabolic&#xD;
      acidosis (serum lactate clearance). Thereafter, the VA-ECMO flow is set at the lowest rate&#xD;
      necessary to ensure adequate tissue perfusion, while the highest NCO is wanted. Respiratory&#xD;
      minute ventilation and ECMO sweep gas flow are adjusted to maintain baseline PaCO2 in a&#xD;
      normal range, of around 40 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following data are recorded before inclusion :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age, gender, weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VA-ECMO indication and reason to perform vascular expansion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vasopressive support : noradrenaline mg/h, dobutamine mg/h; inhaled nitric oxyde.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Richmond agitation-Sedation scale (RASS) and Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS) levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ventilatory settings : tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol steps :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol include four sequential steps :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline position: semirecumbent position (45°)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Supine position with a 0° angulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Passive leg raising (after securing of VA ECMO tubing) : using an automatic bed&#xD;
           elevation technique, the lower limbs are raised to a 45° angle while the patient's trunk&#xD;
           is lowered in supine position&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Return to baseline and realization of a fluid challenge (administration of 500 mL of&#xD;
           isotonic saline serum over 15 min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection :&#xD;
&#xD;
      All following data are recorded after 1 minute of stabilization at step 1, 3 and at the end&#xD;
      of step 4 :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical data : heart rate, systolic, diastolic, mean and pulse arterial pressures,&#xD;
           EtCO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Doppler echocardiography (transthoracic or trans-esophageal) data : E and A waves&#xD;
           measured with mitral inflow Doppler (ratio E/A), Velocity Time Integral (VTI) at the&#xD;
           level of the left ventricular outflow, using the 5-chamber apical view. Three&#xD;
           consecutive measurements are recorded to calculate a mean VTI value.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECMO data : pump outflow (PO, in mL/min), pump rotation speed (round/min). Left&#xD;
           ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) diameter is measured by echocardiography at step 1&#xD;
           Central venous pressure is measured at step 2 and 3 Tele-expiratory inferior vena cava&#xD;
           diameter is measured at step 1 and 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical variables (expressed as absolute value and percentage) will be compared using the&#xD;
      chi-squared test. Continuous variables (expressed as median [25th-75th percentile]) will be&#xD;
      compared with Student's t test or the Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate according to the&#xD;
      normality distribution assessed graphically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid responsiveness will be defined by a 15% increase of aortic VTI (ΔVTI&gt;15%) between step&#xD;
      1 (half sitting position) and the end of step 4 (after fluid expansion). Linear regression&#xD;
      analysis will be used to demonstrate relationships between percent change of VTI (ΔVTI), PP&#xD;
      (ΔPP), EtCO2 (ΔEtCO2) induced by PLR maneuver and fluid challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves will be generated to evaluate percent changes&#xD;
      in VTI, PP and EtCO2 induced by the PLR maneuver to predicts fluid responsiveness. The area&#xD;
      under ROC curve will be compared using the DeLong test. Sensitivity, specificity, positive&#xD;
      and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV), and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI)&#xD;
      will be calculated based on the cutoff value as determined by the Youden Index&#xD;
      (specificity+sensitivity - 1). Statistical significance will be defined as p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
