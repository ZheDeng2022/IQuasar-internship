      This project is designed to use three-dimensional movement analysis and magnetic resonance&#xD;
      (fMRI) neuroimaging techniques to examine the brain activity and motor behavior changes&#xD;
      associated with constraint-induced (CI) therapy for patients with sub-acute stroke (3-9&#xD;
      months post-stroke).Participants are evaluated at 5 time points-1-mo (pre &amp; post), 6-mo (pre&#xD;
      &amp; post), and 12-mo. Each person is randomized to receive CI therapy either between pre- and&#xD;
      post-evaluations or after the 6-mo pre-evaluation. We will determine the effects of CI&#xD;
      therapy on 1) reaching and grasping actions using behavioral kinematics and 2) the&#xD;
      sensorimotor network through fMRI scans with goal-directed aiming and grasping tasks. We will&#xD;
      also determine the relationship between lesion size and location using 3-D volumetric MRI&#xD;
      scans and behavioral outcomes as a consequence of CI therapy.&#xD;

      PURPOSE OF THE STUDY AND BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Specific Aims and Purpose of The Study: Overall, this proposal is to use three-dimensional&#xD;
      movement analysis and magnetic resonance (fMRI) neuroimaging techniques to examine the brain&#xD;
      activity and motor behavior changes associated with constraint-induced (CI) therapy for&#xD;
      patients with sub-acute stroke. This project is a companion study to the recently funded&#xD;
      multi-center randomized clinical trial (HD37606-01), Extremity Constraint-Induced Therapy&#xD;
      Evaluation (EXCITE). This project complements EXCITE by probing the mechanisms underlying the&#xD;
      clinical intervention in stroke rehabilitation. However, since enrollment for EXCITE has been&#xD;
      completed, we will be enrolling a new set of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. SPECIFIC AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the relationship between lesion size and location as assessed using 3-D&#xD;
           volumetric MRI and functional outcome (i.e, motor control and functional use) as a&#xD;
           consequence of CI therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the effects of CI therapy on the control of reaching and grasping actions as&#xD;
           assessed using behavioral kinematics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the effects of CI therapy on the neural substrate (sensorimotor network) as&#xD;
           assessed using fMRI during goal-directed aiming and grasping tasks (performed as&#xD;
           activation tasks in the scanner).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine the persistence and or stability of these changes in, motor control, neural&#xD;
           substrate, and functional use of the upper extremity in stroke with CI therapy 6 months&#xD;
           later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.1: Specific working hypotheses for each aim are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Specific Aim # 1, Hypothesis 1: There will be a predictable relationship between lesion&#xD;
      location, size and functional outcome from CI therapy. Those with specific sensorimotor&#xD;
      cortex (MI, SI) lesions will show a poorer response than those with lesions confined to the&#xD;
      subcortical regions (e.g., posterior limb of internal capsule, subcortical white matter, or&#xD;
      basis pontis, paramedian pontine areas) controlled for lesion size. One working assumption&#xD;
      underlying this hypothesis is that there will be a differential effect of CI therapy with&#xD;
      subcortical vs cortical sensorimotor area lesions. Hypothesis 2: The differences between&#xD;
      groups (treated vs untreated) will be greater in those with subcortical lesions than in those&#xD;
      with cortical sensorimotor area lesions, controlled for lesion size, at the&#xD;
      post-test/intervention time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Specific Aim # 2, Hypothesis 1: CI therapy will benefit the control of reaching and&#xD;
      grasping actions through changes in (arm) transport duration, timing of peak aperture, peak&#xD;
      transport velocity, and smoothness of both the reach and the grasp component for grasping&#xD;
      different sized objects and reaching different distances. Hypothesis # 2 is that the change&#xD;
      in the motor control of reaching and grasping actions from baseline to post-test/intervention&#xD;
      time point will be greater in the treated compared to the untreated group. Hypothesis # 3 is&#xD;
      that these motor control changes will be correlated with changes in real-world use of the&#xD;
      upper extremity as indexed by the Motor Activity Log (MAL) and Wolf Motor Function Test&#xD;
      (WMFT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Specific Aim # 3, Hypothesis 1: CI therapy will result in a decrease in ipsilateral&#xD;
      hemisphere activation and an expanded extent and or increased intensity of specific regions&#xD;
      of interest (ROIs) in the contralateral (affected) sensorimotor network with CI therapy.&#xD;
      Specifically, and as it relates to the planning of more complex hand actions (i.e., precision&#xD;
      grasp), specific ROIs that will show change in intensity and/or extent include primary motor&#xD;
      cortex (MI), primary sensory cortex (S1), supplementary motor area (SMA), and premotor area&#xD;
      (PM). Hypothesis # 2 is that the change in ROI activation from baseline to&#xD;
      post-test/intervention time point will be greater in the treated compared to the untreated&#xD;
      group. Hypothesis 3: The presence of an expanded extent and/or more intense activation in&#xD;
      these contralateral hemisphere ROIs will be correlated with changes in real-world use of the&#xD;
      upper extremity as indexed by the MAL and WMFT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Specific Aim # 4, Hypothesis 1: Persistence of these changes in reach-to-grasp motor&#xD;
      control (behavioral kinematics), expanded extent/intensity of sensorimotor network ROIs&#xD;
      (fMRI) and functional use (MAL and WMFT) will be demonstrated through comparison of the&#xD;
      treated and untreated (delayed-intervention) groups at the 6-month follow-up point. It is&#xD;
      possible that the differences between groups at the 6-month point may be greater than at the&#xD;
      post-test/intervention point particularly if functional use continues to improve in the&#xD;
      treated group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Background and Significance: Stroke is the leading cause of disability among American&#xD;
      adults. Each year in the U.S., approximately 750,000 people suffer strokes and of those,&#xD;
      nearly 400,000 survive with some level of neurological impairment and disability. The&#xD;
      cumulative total of living, stroke-affected Americans is nearly 3 million. Thirty billion&#xD;
      dollars annually is the estimated burden from stroke-related disability. Despite the enormity&#xD;
      of these statistics, there have been almost no scientific studies of the effectiveness of&#xD;
      post-stroke rehabilitation interventions. As a result, the recently published Clinical&#xD;
      practice guidelines for post-stroke rehabilitation (Gresham et al., 1995) have been forced to&#xD;
      rely primarily on expert opinion and not on well-controlled scientific studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new therapeutic approach to the rehabilitation of movement after stroke, termed&#xD;
      constraint-induced (CI) movement therapy, has been derived from basic research with monkeys&#xD;
      given somatosensory deafferentation (Taub, 1980). CI movement therapy consists of a family of&#xD;
      therapies; their common element is that they induce stroke patients to greatly increase the&#xD;
      use of an affected arm and hand for many hours a day over a period of 10 to 14 consecutive&#xD;
      days. The signature intervention involves motor restriction of the less affected arm in a&#xD;
      sling or mitt and training of the affected arm. The therapies result in large changes in&#xD;
      amount of use of the affected arm in the activities of daily living outside of the clinic&#xD;
      that have persisted for the 2 years measured to date (Morris et al., 1997; Taub &amp; Wolf, 1997;&#xD;
      Taub et al., 1994; Taub et al., 1993; Wolf et al., 1989). Previous research has never&#xD;
      resulted in any adverse effects from the restraint on the &quot;good arm/hand&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is mounting evidence for cortical reorganization that accompanies recovery of motor&#xD;
      control after stroke, and recently, similar changes were demonstrated in connection with CI&#xD;
      therapy in chronic stroke (Liepert et al., 2000). There appears to be a relationship between&#xD;
      lesion size and location and the nature of this reorganization as well as the time course of&#xD;
      this reorganization (Azari &amp; Seitz, 2000). The fact that therapy (forced use) can influence&#xD;
      this reorganization as revealed by the sub-human primate work (Nudo et al., 1996a,b) suggests&#xD;
      that there would be differences in the change in cortical activation patterns for reaching&#xD;
      and grasping tasks from baseline to post-test/intervention time points between the treated&#xD;
      and untreated subjects in our proposed project. Further, and related to the neural network&#xD;
      for the control of uni-manual reaching and grasping actions, ipsilateral (or bilateral)&#xD;
      hemisphere activation has been shown to be a corollary of task complexity, motor set, and&#xD;
      excessive effort (Winstein et al., 1997; Chen et al., 1997a, 1997b; Beltramello et al., 1998;&#xD;
      Doyon et al.,1998; Winstein et al., 2000). Motor set effects have been demonstrated most&#xD;
      consistently in the motor control literature by comparing predictable and unpredictable order&#xD;
      conditions. In an unpredictable condition, motor set is based on a 'best guess' plan and&#xD;
      default parameters are selected based on the range of possible responses (see Winstein et&#xD;
      al., 2000, for motor set effects in triggered grasp responses). By contrast, under&#xD;
      predictable task conditions, a more precise and tuned plan is enabled as the exact response&#xD;
      can be planned in advance (Velicki et al., 2000). As such, we hypothesize that as reaching&#xD;
      and grasping actions improve with practice, 'task complexity' will be reduced, motor set&#xD;
      effects will be enhanced (i.e., the task is planned and performed more easily, with less&#xD;
      cognitive demand, Lee et al., 1994), and there should be a concomitant reduction in the&#xD;
      extent of ipsilateral (bilateral) neural activity for affected limb movements. At the same&#xD;
      time, and consistent with use-dependent cortical reorganization, as skill (learning)&#xD;
      improves, there should be an expansion or increased intensity of activation in the&#xD;
      appropriate contralateral neural networks of reaching and grasping actions, particularly in&#xD;
      regions of interest including M1, S1, SMA and PM areas. These arguments provide the logic for&#xD;
      Specific Aim # 3 to determine the changes, as a consequence of CI therapy, in the&#xD;
      sensorimotor cortical network through event-related fMRI during specific reaching and&#xD;
      grasping tasks, and our associated hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By logical extension, we suggest that the effects of CI therapy on the control of upper&#xD;
      extremity reaching and grasping actions can be indexed at both the level of cortical neural&#xD;
      activation patterns (fMRI) and behavioral kinematics and in relation to well known&#xD;
      psychophysical laws of motor learning and control. Further, we suggest that the changes in&#xD;
      performance as reflected by physiological brain activation and motor control kinematics can&#xD;
      be related to changes in the use of the affected upper extremity as indexed by MAL and WMFT.&#xD;
      This companion project is innovative in that it represents the first attempt to correlate the&#xD;
      results of psychophysical studies of the 'control' of reaching and grasping actions with&#xD;
      neuroimaging (fMRI) studies designed to highlight the 'central motor set' effect (Winstein et&#xD;
      al., 2000) using a repeated measures design (3 repeated tests) with a between group factor&#xD;
      (treated and untreated-control group). This study complements current research in the&#xD;
      exploration of brain activity changes using different motor activation tasks and&#xD;
      circumstances that are geared to lend science to the examination of this clinically based&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this proposal, we plan to assess the changes in neural activation (cortical&#xD;
      reorganization) and motor control of reaching and grasping actions that pertain directly to&#xD;
      CI therapy compared to that associated with standard and customary care. These experiments&#xD;
      will be done on a separate day from the baseline, post-test, and 6-month follow-up tests, but&#xD;
      they will be scheduled within 1 week of those tests. This design allows us to explore the&#xD;
      physiological neural circuits, and motor control variables mediating the expected behavioral&#xD;
      change associated with CI therapy (treated group) and standard and customary care (delayed&#xD;
      intervention group) and characterize the persistence of that change in a group of sub-acute&#xD;
      stroke survivors who have relatively small lesions and some ability to move the wrist and&#xD;
      fingers on the hemiparetic side.&#xD;
