    <textblock>
      The aim of the present trial is to assess the gingival crevicular fluid level of caspase-3&#xD;
      and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) in Generalized versus Molar-incisor grade C&#xD;
      periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will be carried out on patients selected from those attending on the&#xD;
      outpatient clinics of Department of Oral Medicine, Periodontology, Oral Diagnosis and Dental&#xD;
      Radiology, Faculty of Dental Medicine, Al-Azhar University, Assiut.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal diseases are inflammatory disorders that give rise to tissue damage and loss, as&#xD;
      a result of complex interactions between pathogenic bacteria and host immune response.&#xD;
      Gingivitis is generally regarded as a site-specific inflammatory condition initiated by&#xD;
      dental biofilm accumulation and characterized by gingival redness and edema and the absence&#xD;
      of periodontal attachment loss.(1,2) periodontitis, a disease characterized by gingival&#xD;
      inflammation combined with connective tissue attachment and bone loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aggressive periodontitis is a form of periodontal disease characterized by rapid attachment&#xD;
      loss, bone destruction, non-contributory medical history and family history of the cases&#xD;
      Apoptosis is a fundamental and complex biological process that enables an organism to kill&#xD;
      and remove unwanted cells during development, normal homeostasis and disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caspases are proteins implicated in the activation and execution of apoptosis was identified&#xD;
      in humans as being crucial for this process. Caspases 3 appear to be activated in a protease&#xD;
      cascade that leads to inappropriate activation or rapid disablement of key structural&#xD;
      proteins and important signaling, homeostatic and repair enzymes and is essential for some of&#xD;
      the characteristic changes in cell morphology and certain biochemical events associated with&#xD;
      the execution and completion of apoptosis. However, the specific requirements of this caspase&#xD;
      in apoptosis were until now largely unknown. Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) is a&#xD;
      mitochondrion-localized flavoprotein with nicotinamide dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase activity&#xD;
      is encoded by a nuclear gene. It has been shown to translocate from mitochondria to the&#xD;
      cytosol as well as the nucleus when apoptosis is induced and mediate caspase-independent&#xD;
      death because inhibition of caspase activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many authors view apoptosis as a process that is near-to-synonymous to massive caspase&#xD;
      activation. The existence of a caspase-independent death effector thus does not fit the&#xD;
      dominant scheme. During the last 2 years, several papers advocated the hypothesis that AIF is&#xD;
      indeed a caspase-dependent death effector, meaning that the translocation of AIF from the&#xD;
      mitochondrion (where it would be inert) to the nucleus (where it would induce apoptosis)&#xD;
      would be caspase-dependent.&#xD;
