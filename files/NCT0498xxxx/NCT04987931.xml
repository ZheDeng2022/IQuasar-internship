  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a retrospective, multi-site, patient-level medical chart review of US adult&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (ABC) who initiated talazoparib on&#xD;
      or after October 16, 2018 and were managed by participating providers from Cardinal Health's&#xD;
      Oncology Provider Extended Network (OPEN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will describe patient characteristics, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes&#xD;
      of talazoparib-treated patients in real-world practice setting in US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary population for this study includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -HER2-negative ABC patients with germline BRCA1/2 (gBRCA1/2) mutations treated with&#xD;
      talazoparib monotherapy initiated on or after October 16, 2018 and ≥18 years of age at&#xD;
      initiation of talazoparib.&#xD;
