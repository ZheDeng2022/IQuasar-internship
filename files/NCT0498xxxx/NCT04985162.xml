  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the effect or ordinary and differential learning&#xD;
      based physiotherapy for torso control, balance and gait on subjects with ischemic stroke in&#xD;
      the second phase of rehabilitation&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic stroke is still the second most common cause of death and one of the leading causes&#xD;
      of disability worldwide. Half of all individuals with ischemic stroke do not regain lost body&#xD;
      functions until the end of life. Individuals with ischemic stroke are most likely to have&#xD;
      impaired cognitive, sensory, and motor functions, but the greatest challenge for health care&#xD;
      professionals is impaired motor skills caused by motor nerve cell damage. In order to&#xD;
      minimize the degree of disability, it is important to respond quickly to a person's&#xD;
      condition. Because it has been shown that lost functions can be taken over by adjacent,&#xD;
      non-stroke-affected areas of the cerebral cortex, early rehabilitation is a key factor that&#xD;
      can help prevent function limitation by acting in conjunction with spontaneous recovery of&#xD;
      body function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the effect or ordinary and differential learning based&#xD;
      physiotherapy for torso control, balance and gait on subjects with ischemic stroke in the&#xD;
      second phase of rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics of Kaunas Region&#xD;
      (2020-06-30 No.BEC-KN(B)-263).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Torso control assessment scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The torso control rating scale evaluates torso functions in a variety of locations, whether standing, sitting or performing a mobility assessment task. Each task was scored from 0 to 3 points: 0 - cannot perform task, 3 - can perfom task independently. Total test score is 36 and a higher total score meant a better trunk function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg balance test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Berg scale is used to assess a subject's static and dynamic balance. It is a 14 item list with each item consisting of a five-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4. The maximum obtainable score is 56. 0 points -are awarded to answers portraying the lowest level of function while 4 points are awarded to the highest level of function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dynamic gait index is used to assess the likelihood of falling. A four-point ordinal scale, ranging from 0-3 points. Total maximum score is 24 points. 0 points indicates the lowest level of function and 3 points - the highest level of function.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamic gait index assessed the gait model, provided information about the person's balance while walking</description>
