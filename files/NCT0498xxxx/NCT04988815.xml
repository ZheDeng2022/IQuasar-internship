      This is a multi-centre phase 2 open-label prospective study designed to assess the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of ropeg patients with pre-fibrotic primary myelofibrosis or DIPSS&#xD;
      low/intermediate-1 risk myelofibrosis after 24 months of treatment. . In patients achieving&#xD;
      any molecular response at 24 months, treatment with ropeg will be continued until disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining a written informed consent, screening evaluations will be performed.&#xD;
      Eligibility will be determined based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria in section 6 of&#xD;
      this protocol. Subject visits will be scheduled regularly after recruitment for efficacy&#xD;
      evaluations and safety assessments. A safety follow-up will be scheduled 28 days after&#xD;
      end-of-treatment visit. Efficacy evaluations, safety assessments and sample collection will&#xD;
      be performed according to the schedule laid in section 2 in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be evaluated using laboratory assessment of haematological parameters, physical&#xD;
      examination for liver and spleen size assessment, quantitative assessment of JAK2V617F, CALR,&#xD;
      MPL and other driver mutations, bone marrow examination, and symptom burden assessment by&#xD;
      MPN-SAF-TSS. Quantitative assessment of JAK2V617F, CALR, MPL and other driver mutations will&#xD;
      be performed using real-time quantitative PCR or ddPCR at the laboratory at the Department of&#xD;
      Medicine, the University of Hong Kong, National Taiwan University Hospital and Chang Gung&#xD;
      Memorial Hospital Chiayi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluations will be performed using symptoms, physical examination, laboratory&#xD;
      studies, Chest X-rays, ophthalmic assessment, ECOG performance status and CTCAE version 5.0.&#xD;
