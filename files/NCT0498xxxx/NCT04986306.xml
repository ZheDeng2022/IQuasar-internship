  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant or primary systemic treatment is increasingly applied in the treatment of&#xD;
      operable breast cancer. Down staging of the primary tumor is one of the important goals of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment (NCT), thereby permitting breast-conserving treatment&#xD;
      without affecting the risk for a local relapse. Complete pathological response (pCR) rates&#xD;
      after NCT vary across histological subtypes and can be more than 60% in HER2-positive disease&#xD;
      with dual blockade therapy. Down staging of the axilla is also observed in patients initially&#xD;
      presenting with metastatic lymph nodes. pCR rates in the axilla vary between 22% and 42% in&#xD;
      reported series, again depending on tumor subtype. Omission of axillary lymph node dissection&#xD;
      (ALND) can avoid the post-operative morbidity such as lymphedema in the short or long term&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metastatic lymph node status is hard to be stated as a pCR in the axilla by using physical&#xD;
      examination or imaging such as ultrasonography or tomography after complete NCT. Good&#xD;
      response to the axilla lymph node causing the difficulty of tissue proof by using core needle&#xD;
      biopsy, though the investigator knew that biopsy stands for the definite tool for the&#xD;
      confirmation of the residual disease. One proposed method to decrease the false-negative rate&#xD;
      (FNR) is clip placement in the positive node at initial diagnosis with confirmation of&#xD;
      clipped node resection at surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The correlation between the axillary lymph node identified on initial axillary ultrasound and&#xD;
      the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) identified at surgery has not been fully evaluated. The&#xD;
      concordance between percutaneous biopsy and the lymph node resected at the time of SLNB is&#xD;
      not 100%. Sometimes, the initial node identified by ultrasound is not one of the SLNs. The&#xD;
      impairment of the performance of SLNB might correlated to the alteration of lymphatic flow&#xD;
      induced by tissue fibrosis or tumor deposits after NCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator hypothesized that the clip placement at diagnosis of node-positive disease&#xD;
      with removal of the clipped node during SLNB reduces the FNR of SLNB after NCT. Here, we&#xD;
      evaluate how often the lymph node containing the clip placed at percutaneous biopsy before&#xD;
      chemotherapy was found at surgery to be one of the SLNs, and how often it was found in the&#xD;
      nodes retrieved at ALND. In addition, the investigator report the impact of identification of&#xD;
      the clipped node within the SLNs on the FNR of SLNB.&#xD;

      Aim 1: Identify the pathological result of SLN and ALN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lymph node containing the clip placed at percutaneous biopsy before chemotherapy was&#xD;
      found at surgery to be one of the SLNs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective study. 30 patients who will undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy were&#xD;
      asked to participate in this study. Informed consent will be given. Clip will be placed over&#xD;
      the positive lymph node by surgeon which was proven by fine-needle aspiration cytology. After&#xD;
      completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery of the breast and the axilla was executed in&#xD;
      the same session. Different surgeons performed the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SLNB will be performed by dual tracer (blue dye plus indocyanine green or radioisotope).&#xD;
      After remove the SLNs and ALN, detection of the clipped node will be identified under&#xD;
      mammography-guided. The clipped lymph node will be marked separately. All of the lymph node&#xD;
      will be sent to pathologist for final examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Check the feasibility of SLNB after neoadjuvant CT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SLNB is feasible after neoadjuvant CT under certain circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints used for statistical analysis were the success rate for identifying and&#xD;
      selectively removing the clipped node and the correlation of the response observed in the&#xD;
      clipped node on pathology with the ALND specimen. The identification rate of the clipped node&#xD;
      was analyzed in all patients who underwent surgical removal of the clipped node. Correlation&#xD;
      between the pathologic response observed in the clipped node and in the ALND specimen was&#xD;
      estimated using false-negative rates, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value,&#xD;
      negative predictive value, and accuracy.&#xD;
