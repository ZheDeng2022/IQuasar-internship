  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of chidamide&#xD;
      plus camrelizumab as second-line therapy for advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      treated with PD-1 blockade&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been tested in esophageal squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma(ESCC) with demonstrated clinical efficacy，a significant number of patients who have&#xD;
      an initial response will develop a secondary resistance and relapse. recent studies on the&#xD;
      role of epigenetics in immune evasion have exposed a key role for epigenetic modulators in&#xD;
      augmenting the tumour microenvironment and restoring immune recognition and immunogenicity.&#xD;
      These discoveries have established a highly promising basis for studies using combined&#xD;
      epigenetic and immunotherapeutic agents as anti-cancer therapies. Chidamide is a novel orally&#xD;
      active benzamide-type histone deacetylase inhibitor that has shown in vitro activities&#xD;
      against a wide array of neoplasms. Hence, the study of chidamide plus camrelizumab as&#xD;
      second-line therapy for advanced ESCC treated with PD-1 blockade was performed.&#xD;
