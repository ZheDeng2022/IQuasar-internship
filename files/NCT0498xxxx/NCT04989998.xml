  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical study in total hip&#xD;
      arthroplasties (THA) surgery. The subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria specified&#xD;
      in the protocol will receive THA using either Hip7 software or conventional instrumentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical follow-up evaluation will be performed preoperatively (Baseline), operatively, 6&#xD;
      weeks, 6 and 12 months after surgery using patient reported outcome measures regarding their&#xD;
      general health, hip and physical abilities, quality of life and pain level.&#xD;

    <measure>Forgotten Joint Score (FJS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Compare Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) utilizing Hip7 software on Kick &amp; CORI platforms with POLAR3 system to conventional procedures with standard instrumentation and digital templating techniques at 12 months post-operation. The FJS-12 Questionnaire comprises measures for assessment of joint-specific patient reported outcomes that focuses on subject's awareness of replaced joint in everyday life. Joint awareness defined as any unintended perception of a joint. Subjects rate awareness of their hip arthroplasty in 12 questions with a 5-point Likert response format: &quot;Never&quot;, &quot;almost never&quot;, &quot;seldom&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot; and &quot;mostly&quot;. Scores are summed &amp; linearly transformed in a 0-100 scale with a high value reflecting subject's ability to forget the replaced hip joint during daily living activities.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Frequency of Reduction of Outliers</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of reduction of outliers* with Hip7 software as compared to conventional procedures (as defined by literature) using digital templating techniques for posterior and direct anterior approaches&#xD;
*Outliers are defined as acetabular component placement outside the desired &quot;safe zone&quot;. Two most commonly used safe zones are described by Lewinnek and Callanan with the inclination and anteversion values outlined below: Callanan Safe Zone -- Anteversion between 5-25 degrees, Inclination between 30-45 degrees. Lewinnek - Anteversion between 5-25 degrees, Inclination between 30-50 degrees [i.e. 40° ± 10° and 15° ± 10°].</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Outcomes: Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The HOOS is developed as an instrument to assess the subject's opinion about their hip and associated problems. HOOS consists of 5 subscales: Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and hip related QOL. The last week is taken into consideration when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question gets a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Outcomes: Oxford Hip Score (OHS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The OHS is a 12-item questionnaire for patients who undergo total hip replacement (THR) to complete. Patients are asked to reflect on their pain and functional ability over the previous four weeks. There are two domains (pain and function) with six items or questions in each. Each item has four possible responses. Responses were from 1 = least difficult to 4= most difficult. Item scores are summed to give a total score from anywhere between 0 and 48. The lower the score, the better the outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Outcomes: EuroQol (European Quality of Life) five-dimensional Five-level (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire consists of two parts. Part one is the descriptive system to describe the subject's health state and consists of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The subject indicates their health state by marking the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 areas. Responses are converted to scores ranging from less than 0 to 1.0 with high scores representing higher health utility. Part two is the EQ Visual Analog Scale (VAS) that records the subject's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale. Scale ranges from 0-100 with 100 labelled &quot;The best health you can imagine&quot; and 0 &quot;The worst health you can imagine&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Cup placement accuracy</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks post-op</time_frame>
    <description>To demonstrate cup placement accuracy (defined as the difference between inclination, anteversion, leg length, and offset target) from the Computerized Tomography [CT]).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess Pelvic Tilt at 6 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks post-op</time_frame>
    <description>A CT scan will assess pelvic tilt (angle of pelvic bone in relation to spine and femur)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess Range of Motion of Femur at 6 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Medical staff will measure angles of femur movement in order to assess active range of motion. Active range of motion measures include angles of active flexion, abduction, adduction, external rotation and internal rotation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess Frequency of Femur Head Dislocation at 6 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Whether the subject experienced femoral head dislocation will be assessed at 6 weeks post op. Femoral head dislocation will be determined based on the count of participants with joint dislocation responses recorded by the investigator in the Adverse Events Case Report Form (CRF).</description>
