  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to illuminate the role of COVID-19 in the pathophysiology of erectile&#xD;
      dysfunction (ED). Nine patients that had COVID-19 and were treated as outpatients were&#xD;
      classified as group 1, 10 patients who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 were classified as&#xD;
      group 2, and 10 patients who did not have COVID-19 and applied to the urology outpatient&#xD;
      clinic with ED complaints and had similar clinical characteristics were classified as the&#xD;
      control group (group 3). Patients underwent diagnostic evaluation including International&#xD;
      Index of Erectile Function-5 form, penile color Doppler ultrasonography, corpus cavernosum&#xD;
      electromyography, and fasting serum levels of reproductive hormones (07-11 am). According to&#xD;
      the results of our study, cavernous smooth muscle damage occurs in patients with COVID-19 and&#xD;
      it has an important role in the pathophysiology of erectile dysfunction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus Sars-Cov-2, has been affecting people all&#xD;
      over the world for more than a year and has resulted in many deaths. It can affect almost&#xD;
      every part of the body and cause diseases including anosmia, hypogonadism, myopathy,&#xD;
      neuropathy, and vasculitis. Studies have reported that it may cause erectile dysfunction&#xD;
      (ED), however, its role in the pathophysiology of ED has not yet been fully elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged 20-50 years who applied to the urology outpatient clinic due to ED were&#xD;
      included in the study. Nine patients that had COVID-19 and were treated as outpatients were&#xD;
      classified as group 1, 10 patients who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 were classified as&#xD;
      group 2, and 10 patients who did not have COVID-19 and applied to the urology outpatient&#xD;
      clinic with ED complaints and had similar clinical characteristics were classified as the&#xD;
      control group (group 3). Patients underwent diagnostic evaluation including International&#xD;
      Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-5 form, penile color Doppler ultrasonography (CDUS), corpus&#xD;
      cavernosum electromyography (cc-EMG), and fasting serum levels of reproductive hormones&#xD;
      (07-11 am).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to penile CDUS results, distribution of vasculogenic pathologies in groups was as&#xD;
      follows: 33% in group 1, 40% in group 2, and 40% in group 3. According to cc-EMG results, the&#xD;
      pre-vasoactive drug (VAD) amplitudes of the patients in group 2 were significantly lower than&#xD;
      those in group 3 (p: 0.005). Moreover, the pre-VAD amplitudes of the patients in group 1 were&#xD;
      also significantly lower than those in group 3 (p: 0.042). In addition, while the RD values&#xD;
      of the patients in group 2 were significantly lower than those in group 3, no significant&#xD;
      difference was observed between other groups. There was no significant difference between the&#xD;
      groups in terms of hormonal profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cavernosal smooth muscle damage that occurs due to COVID-19-related endothelial dysfunction&#xD;
      may disrupt the nutrition of cavernosal tissues. The deterioration of the nutrition of the&#xD;
      cavernosal tissues may be one of the important reasons for the post-COVID-19 ED. The results&#xD;
      of our study need to be confirmed with larger studies in which electromyographic as well as&#xD;
      histopathological examinations are performed.&#xD;
