  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Women Helping Women Lung Cancer Screening (WHW-L) Study will be conducted to develop a&#xD;
      scalable, easy to apply community-based intervention to increase rates of lung cancer&#xD;
      screening and follow-up in high-need/low-resource populations, based on a Transtheoretical&#xD;
      Stages of Change theoretical model. The investigators will test the feasibility of using&#xD;
      Community Health Workers to recruit (Aim 1) and partner with 60 community members (Aim 2)&#xD;
      within 6 months, to take the steps to consult with a doctor, schedule screening, and/or&#xD;
      attend screening (Aim 3) [84 people may be screened for the study assuming some don't&#xD;
      continue}.CHWs will use the HealthStreet 12,000+ cohort to identify current or former female&#xD;
      smokers (adults 50 to 77 years old) with a smoking history of 25 pack-years who could benefit&#xD;
      from LDCT screening for lung cancer and will facilitate steps in their screening receipt. All&#xD;
      participants will benefit from the Standard Intervention; additionally, a random sample of 30&#xD;
      will receive the Enhanced CHW Intervention (E-CHW-I). The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      women who may be at higher risk of lung cancer due to lack of knowledge, access, and&#xD;
      resources will take steps to receipt of LDCT in both interventions, with those receiving the&#xD;
      Enhanced Intervention more likely to take these steps. Ultimately, such an intervention could&#xD;
      lead to a lower lung cancer burden in the target population&#xD;

    <description>to test the feasibility of implementation of a customize culturally relevant, gender-specific Community Health Worker partnered intervention using the Transtheoretical Stages of Change model, the investigators will measure screening adherence in hours for lung cancer among the 60 women assessed through records of intervention delivery, including Randomization and Contact Logs, where the investigators will document each contact with the 60 women enrolled.</description>

    <description>to evaluate the limited efficacy of the WHW-L intervention to increase screening for lung cancer among the 60 women at 45 days to improve outcome variables: see physician re lung cancer screening/smoking, schedule screening, receive screening, the investigators will conduct phone-based follow-up interviews among all 60 women at 45 days.</description>
