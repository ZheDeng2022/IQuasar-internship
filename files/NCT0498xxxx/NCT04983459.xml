  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In France, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men over 50 years of age (nearly&#xD;
      50,000 new cases per year) and is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in men&#xD;
      (approximately 9,000 deaths per year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among patients who have undergone a curative treatment strategy for localized prostate&#xD;
      cancer, between 27% and 53% of them will have a biochemical recurrence within 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical recurrence is defined as :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After total prostatectomy by the persistence of a detectable PSA or the reappearance of&#xD;
           a detectable PSA above 0.2 ng/ml after a more or less long period of undetectability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After conservative treatment (radiotherapy or brachytherapy) by an increase in PSA above&#xD;
           a threshold set at nadir +2 ng/ml Biological recurrence precedes the occurrence of&#xD;
           symptomatic metastases by an average of 7-8 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, after prostatectomy, when the PSA is &lt; 1 ng/mL, no imaging test is recommended for&#xD;
      the assessment of recurrence (grade A recommendation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensitivity of currently available tests does not provide sufficiently discriminating&#xD;
      information for this PSA value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiparametric MRI performs well in detecting local recurrence, particularly in the case of&#xD;
      PSA &gt; 1 ng/mL (sensitivity of 98%, specificity of 94% for the detection of 5 mm lesions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-choline positron emission tomography (PET-choline) is of interest in the detection of&#xD;
      distant lymph node and/or visceral recurrences; indeed, PET-choline has proven its&#xD;
      superiority in detection compared with conventional examinations, particularly for PSA values&#xD;
      above 2ng/ml with a detection rate of up to 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the performance of this examination remains dependent on the PSA level and is low&#xD;
      when the PSA level is below 1 ng/ml (sensitivity around 5-24% for a PSA below 1 ng/ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The performance of PET-choline is optimised for low PSA by taking into account the PSA&#xD;
      doubling time and velocity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, prostate specific membrane antigen ligand positron emission tomography (PET-PSMA)&#xD;
      has emerged as the most promising new molecular imaging modality for the management of&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a transmembrane glycoprotein selectively&#xD;
      overexpressed in 90-100% of prostate cancer lesions, as well as in metastatic lymph nodes and&#xD;
      bone metastases, making it an ideal target for molecular imaging of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This tracer appears to perform better than other imaging modalities, particularly for low PSA&#xD;
      values, with a detection rate of 50% for a PSA level below 0.5 ng/ml compared to 5-20% with&#xD;
      PET-choline. Indeed, a 2019 meta-analysis evaluating the value of PSMA-PET in patients with&#xD;
      biologic recurrence of prostate adenocarcinoma reported detection rates of 45%, 59%, 75% and&#xD;
      95% for PSA levels &lt; 0.5 ng/mL, between 0.5 and 0.9 ng/mL, between 1 and 1.9 ng/mL and 2&#xD;
      ng/mL respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate PSMA ligand PET for the detection of occult biological&#xD;
      recurrence in patients with prostatic neoplasia referred to the Brest University Hospital .&#xD;
