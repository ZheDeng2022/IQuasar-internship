  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to implement and assess the impact of a multi-faceted intervention to support&#xD;
      Primary Care Provider (PCP) outreach, and PCP and community organization dissemination of&#xD;
      information to promote COVID-19 vaccination among vulnerable patients in and near Worcester,&#xD;
      MA.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study protocol is to increase uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine among vulnerable&#xD;
      populations through systematic provider recommendations via text message outreach,&#xD;
      information provision, and provider education. The primary endpoint is the receipt of a&#xD;
      complete COVID-19 vaccination series (2 doses for vaccines that require 2 doses) among&#xD;
      patients who are unvaccinated at the time of clinic entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include receipt of incomplete (1 dose for vaccines that require 2 doses)&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccination series, racial/ethnic differences in vaccination rates, and the&#xD;
      percentage of intervention clinic patients who initiate vaccination after the first batch of&#xD;
      provider texts, after the second batch of provider texts, and after the third batch of&#xD;
      provider texts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a pragmatic cluster randomized clinical trial in which approximately 24&#xD;
      primary care clinics from three health systems (UMass Memorial Health Care, Family Health&#xD;
      Center of Worcester, and Edward M. Kennedy Community Health Center) in the Worcester,&#xD;
      Massachusetts area will be randomized to the intervention in a phased approach of 4 clinics&#xD;
      groups with approximately 6 clinics per group. Clinics will be matched by baseline COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccination rates prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients seen at a study clinic randomized to the intervention will receive a series of&#xD;
      text messages from their PCP recommending the COVID-19 vaccine, with information on how and&#xD;
      where to schedule a vaccination, and to a website with additional information and resources.&#xD;
      Patients will have the option to reply &quot;STOP&quot; to the text messages to decline further&#xD;
      participation. Our request for a waiver of consent for this aspect of the intervention was&#xD;
      approved by the University of Massachusetts Institutional Review Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providers at a study clinic randomized to the intervention will be asked to participate in a&#xD;
      &quot;lunch and learn&quot; interactive session prior to the start of the intervention. In the first&#xD;
      month of the intervention, they will be sent several emails containing brief educational&#xD;
      contents including (1) suggested language for making an &quot;indicated-style&quot; vaccination&#xD;
      recommendation, (2) common patient concerns about COVID-19 vaccines, and suggested responses,&#xD;
      (3) myth vs fact sheet. They will have the option to &quot;unsubscribe&quot; from our mailing list at&#xD;
      any point. Our request for a waiver of consent for this aspect of the intervention was&#xD;
      approved by the University of Massachusetts Institutional Review Board.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The intervention will be implemented using a pragmatic, cluster randomized clinical trial. Randomization will occur at the clinic level. Clinics will be matched by site (UMass Memorial Health Care, Edward M. Kennedy Community Health Center, Family Health Center of Worcester), and baseline COVID-19 vaccination rates. Within each pair, clinics will be randomly allocated to conditions using a randomization generated by the study statistician. Matched clinics will be grouped into four blocks of six clinics each (three pairs of matched clinics/block), balancing the four blocks regarding site and baseline vaccination rates.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>COVID-19 Complete Vaccination Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of clinic patients unvaccinated at the start of the intervention who complete the vaccine series within 16 weeks of the last text reminder is the primary outcome. It will be ascertained via the electronic health record (EHR).&#xD;
COVID_19 vaccination; dose 2 administered (Y/N). COVID-19 vaccination rates (N of patients vaccinated/number of patients vaccine eligible).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Potential Gap in COVID-19 Vaccination Rates Between Minority Racial Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcome measures will include receipt of at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and the gap in vaccination rates between the most common self-identified minority racial groups (Black, Latino, Asian), measured by the rate-ratio, or ratio between the percentage vaccinated of each minority racial group compared with the White population.</description>

    <description>The intervention will include the following components:&#xD;
An online library of brief videos depicting local PCPs responding to common questions &amp; concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine with link to be disseminated to patients by text message&#xD;
Automated PCP text messaging to unvaccinated patients with evidence-based recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination&#xD;
Educational materials for PCPs to support their conversations with patients about the COVID-19 vaccine</description>

    <description>Eligible patients seen at a study clinic randomized to the control group will receive usual care with no text messaging intervention.

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Health System Vaccination Text Messages</intervention_name>
    <description>The participating healthcare systems will implement the intervention in a fashion that is consistent with other healthcare system patient reminders. Patients not vaccinated for COVID-19 will be sent a series of text messages including a message from their PCP, information on how and where to schedule a vaccination, and a link to online educational materials that they can access if they choose. Subjects will be given the option to &quot;STOP&quot; the text messages.&#xD;
Providers will be asked to participate in an educational session, during which they will be introduced to the study and presented with underlying research supporting message content, as well as the importance of provider recommendations for vaccination. Providers will also be given the opportunity (separate from participation in the session) to request a modification to text message wording and content, to decline to have text messages sent to their patients, and/or to identify specific patients to not send text messages to.</description>
