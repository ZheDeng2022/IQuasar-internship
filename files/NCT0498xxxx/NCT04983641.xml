  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) forms will be administered&#xD;
      remotely to consecutive Orthopaedic patients presenting for new physician clinic visits.&#xD;
      These patients will be sent either reminder e-mails, reminder digital patient portal&#xD;
      (&quot;MyChart&quot;) messages, or no reminder messages at all concerning PROMIS form completion at&#xD;
      timepoints prior to their respective clinic visits and PROMIS form completion rates will&#xD;
      consequently be assessed. The primary objective of this study is to develop an understanding&#xD;
      of whether pre-visit reminder messages influence PROMIS form completion in Orthopaedic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will assess whether reminder messages prior to clinic visit have an impact on both remote pre-visit and overall PROMIS form completion rates in orthopaedic patients. Patients completing a single assigned PROMIS form will be regarded as having PROMIS completion.</description>

    <description>o Patients were assigned PROMIS forms in the domains of Depression (PROMIS-D) and Pain Interference (PROMIS-PI) in addition to Upper Extremity Function (PROMIS-UE) and/or Physical Function (PROMIS-PF). These forms were available for remote completion in each respective patient's MyChart portal at 1 week prior to their clinic appointment. Patients in this arm were not sent any reminder e-mails or MyChart messages concerning PROMIS form completion at any timepoint prior to their scheduled clinic visit.</description>

Patients in this arm were sent an initial reminder e-mail message at 1 week prior to their scheduled clinic visit regarding PROMIS form completion. If patient's did not fill out PROMIS forms by 3 days prior to their visit, they were sent a second reminder e-mail message.</description>
