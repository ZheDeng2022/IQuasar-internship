  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present clinical trial will try to demonstrate the efficacy of stable xenogeneic collagen&#xD;
      matrix in maintaining the vestibular coronal soft tissue volume and the stabilization of&#xD;
      mid-buccal margin position in immediate post-extraccion sockets compared with the use of&#xD;
      autogenous connective tissue grafts.&#xD;
