  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, recommended dose, and preliminary&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity of WU-CART-007 in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) T-cell acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, multicenter, Phase 1/2, single-agent study in patients with R/R&#xD;
      T-ALL/T-LBL who have exhausted other treatment options. The study will consist of two phases,&#xD;
      Phase 1 and Phase 2. During the Dose Escalation segment (Phase 1) up to 24 patients will be&#xD;
      treated with 1 dose of WU-CART-007, in up to 4 dose levels until maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      or maximum administered dose (MAD) is determined. The dose escalation segment will enroll&#xD;
      successive cohorts of 3 to 6 patients using a standard 3 + 3 design. Once the recommended&#xD;
      phase 2 dose (RP2D) is defined, the Phase 2 portion (Cohort Expansion) will enroll expansion&#xD;
      cohorts.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>There are two parts to this study. Phase 1 will comprise of Dose Escalation, and Phase 2 Cohort Expansion.&#xD;
Phase 1 will determine the safety and tolerability of a single dose of WU-CART-007 and define the RP2D.&#xD;
The Cohort Expansion Phase, will further define the safety and evaluate the initial efficacy of WU-CART-007 at the dose established from the Phase 1 Dose Escalation segment.</intervention_model_description>

          -  Evidence of relapsed or refractory T-ALL or T-LBL, as defined by World Health&#xD;
             Organization (WHO) classification with bone marrow with ≥ 5% lymphoblasts by&#xD;
             morphologic assessment or evidence of extramedullary disease at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
