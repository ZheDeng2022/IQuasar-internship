  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      urodynamic investigation when added in the diagnostic work-up of women with lower urinary&#xD;
      tract dysfunction with POP is debatable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was planned to determine the usefulness of preoperative urodynamic study in&#xD;
      improving urological outcome following surgery in women with pelvic organ prolapse and&#xD;
      urinary tract dysfunction.&#xD;

      60 patients, fulfilled the selection criteria were counseled and informed about the trial&#xD;
      protocol and a written consent according to declaration of Helsinki was signed. Participants&#xD;
      were randomly assigned following simple randomization procedures (computerized random&#xD;
      numbers) to group (1) or group (2). Each group consisted of 30 patients. All participants had&#xD;
      been thoroughly evaluated by history and examination. A standardized questionnaire was&#xD;
      obtained to evaluate the symptoms of stress urinary incontinence, urge urinary incontinence&#xD;
      and obstructive symptoms. Clinical staging of pelvic organ prolapse by POP Q Staging.&#xD;
      Ultrasound examination had been also carried out to rule out any pelvic pathology. Patients&#xD;
      had completed a 3-day bladder diary (frequency volume chart) to assist in arriving at an&#xD;
      urodynamic diagnosis. Urinalysis was performed. Only patients allocated for group 1 were&#xD;
      subjected to urodynamic studies before surgical intervention and then corrective procedures&#xD;
      for POP had been done .The Urodynamic studies carried out were : uroflowmetry and cystometry.&#xD;
      The Uroflowmetry was performed by the gravimeter method, where maximum flow rate, average&#xD;
      flow rate, voided volume and residual urine was measured. Maximum flow rate â‰¤15 ml/sec,&#xD;
      and/or residual urine of more than 50 ml or 10% of voided volume in a bladder filled with a&#xD;
      minimum of 150 ml was taken as cut off to detect abnormal voiding. Cystometric parameters&#xD;
      which indicated normal bladder function were first desire to void between 150 and 200 ml,&#xD;
      capacity (taken as strong desire to void) of greater than 400 ml, detrusor pressure rise on&#xD;
      filling of less than 15 mm H2O per 500 ml infused, absence of detrusor contractions, no&#xD;
      leakage on coughing, no significant pain on filling and finally a detrusor pressure rises on&#xD;
      voiding (maximum voiding pressure) of less than 50 cm H2O, with a peak flow rate of more than&#xD;
      15 ml/s for a voided volume over 150 ml. Urodynamic stress incontinence was diagnosed when&#xD;
      urethral leakage was seen with increased abdominal pressure, in the absence of detrusor&#xD;
      contractions. Detrusor over activity was diagnosed when the patient has involuntary detrusor&#xD;
      contractions during filling with or without leakage which may be spontaneous or provoked. All&#xD;
      participants were followed-up with same questionnaire and clinical examination after 12 weeks&#xD;
      post operatively.&#xD;
