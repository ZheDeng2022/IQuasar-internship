  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the minimum effective dose of a local anesthetic&#xD;
      for proper anesthesia for popliteal sciatic nerve block under ultrasound guidance in patients&#xD;
      undergoing surgery for diabetic foot disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unlike general patients, patients with diabetic foot disease often have diabetic neuropathy&#xD;
      and thus have increased sensitivity to local anesthetics. Therefore, when performing sciatic&#xD;
      nerve block, it is essential to properly adjust the dose to prevent neurotoxicity and delay&#xD;
      in recovery due to local anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the appropriate effective dose of local anesthetic for sciatic nerve block is found in&#xD;
      patients with diabetic foot through this study, it is expected that it will be a useful basis&#xD;
      for establishing a safe anesthetic method in the case of diabetic foot surgery.&#xD;

    <description>Check for sensory blockade every 5 minutes until 30 minutes after block performed. For sensory block, cold sense using alcohol swabs is evaluated on the foot, comparing with the opposite foot, on a 3-point scale (0 points if there is no cold sense at all, 1 point if there is a decrease, 2 points if it is the same with the opposite foot).&#xD;
The time it takes to block to 0 point is the sensory blockade onset time.</description>

The time it takes to block to 0 point is the motor blockade onset time.</description>
