  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The IN2COVID Study is a 2-staged phase I/II double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AP-003 (Interferon α2b) when administered via&#xD;
      inhalation twice daily for 10 days. Participants will have a final visit at Day 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A lead-in phase 1 substudy will be performed with at least 18 healthy adult male subjects to&#xD;
      assess safety and tolerability of inhaled AP-003 compared to placebo for 10 days. Two cohorts&#xD;
      of 9 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive two doses of inhaled AP-003 or placebo&#xD;
      with an allocation ratio of 2:1. The first cohort will assess a dose of 2.5 MIU of inhaled&#xD;
      AP-003. If no adverse events are observed, the second cohort will be conducted using a dose&#xD;
      of 5 MIU of inhaled AP-003. Maximum tolerated dose will be determined in this phase 1&#xD;
      substudy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of phase 1, the study will continue with a phase 2 treatment RCT in&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19. In this phase, 150 adults with mild or moderate COVID-19 demonstrated&#xD;
      by SARS-CoV-2 positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ≤ 5 days at enrollment will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 (75 in each arm) to receive nebulized AP-003 or identical placebo twice daily&#xD;
      during 10 days.&#xD;
