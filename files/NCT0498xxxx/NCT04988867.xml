&#xD;
          -  Has a stable pattern of seizures, or has had no seizures, within 8 weeks prior to&#xD;
             Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject and caregiver(s) must reside at a location to which study drug can be&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. QTcF interval of &gt;450 ms at Screening or Baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. History of a risk factor for torsades de pointes (e.g., heart failure or family&#xD;
                  history of long QT syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. History of clinically significant QT prolongation that is deemed to put the&#xD;
                  subject at increased risk of clinically significant QT prolongation&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Other clinically significant finding on ECG at Screening or Baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional inclusion/exclusion criteria apply. Patients will be evaluated at baseline to&#xD;
        ensure that all criteria for study participation are met. Patients may be excluded from the&#xD;
        study based on these assessments (and specifically, if it is determined that their baseline&#xD;
        health and condition do not meet all prespecified entry criteria).&#xD;
