      The current protocol will examine the use of a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding AR, alone or with&#xD;
      nivolumab, to induce and/or augment therapeutic T-cells following androgen deprivation in&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer scheduled to undergo prostatectomy. Patients&#xD;
      without evidence of metastatic disease, with tissue remaining from a pre-treatment biopsy,&#xD;
      and who are being considered for standard treatment by prostatectomy, will be invited to&#xD;
      participate and will be on study for up to 15 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current protocol will examine the use of a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding Androgen Receptor&#xD;
      (AR), alone or with nivolumab, to induce and/or augment therapeutic T-cells following&#xD;
      androgen deprivation in participants with newly diagnosed prostate cancer scheduled to&#xD;
      undergo prostatectomy. All participants will receive treatment with degarelix for 8 weeks&#xD;
      prior to prostatectomy. Participants will be also be randomized to receive either no&#xD;
      additional treatment, a DNA vaccine encoding AR, or a DNA vaccine encoding AR and nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receiving vaccination will begin that treatment prior to degarelix, based on&#xD;
      preclinical findings that this may be a preferred sequence of treatment. The overall goal is&#xD;
      to determine whether a DNA vaccine can augment the number of prostate tumor-specific&#xD;
      infiltrating CD8+ T cells elicited with androgen deprivation, and whether this might be&#xD;
      further augmented by combination with PD-1 blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because these cells should have cytolytic effector function, the primary clinical endpoint is&#xD;
      pathological response (pCR and secondarily MRD) at the time of prostatectomy. This endpoint&#xD;
      was chosen based on observations from previous clinical trials evaluating androgen&#xD;
      deprivation therapies alone in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will also be a primary objective of the current study, as this vaccine and nivolumab&#xD;
      have not been previously used in this early stage population. An additional secondary&#xD;
      clinical endpoint will be 1-year PSA progression-free survival, after completion of all&#xD;
      therapy, and with evidence of testosterone recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory and correlative endpoints will include whether vaccination, with or without&#xD;
      concurrent PD-1 blockade, elicits greater numbers of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and&#xD;
      whether AR-specific prostate tissue-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and persistent systemic&#xD;
      immunity are detectable after treatment with vaccination. Other correlative studies will&#xD;
      evaluate FLT PET/CT as an investigational means of specifically identifying tumor&#xD;
      infiltration by proliferating T cells as an early marker of treatment response, and whether&#xD;
      uptake in other normal tissues is associated with autoimmune toxicity. While this is a&#xD;
      relatively small trial, given a focus on correlative endpoints, a phase 2 expansion design&#xD;
      was chosen to further evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy if pathological responses are&#xD;
      observed in the initial part of the trial. If pathological responses exceeding 20% are&#xD;
      observed, this will be considered significantly different from what has been historically&#xD;
      observed, and would justify proceeding with future larger studies evaluating these&#xD;
      combination approaches in the neoadjuvant stage of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the safety of androgen deprivation and pTVG-AR DNA vaccine, alone or in&#xD;
           combination with nivolumab, in patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if pathological complete responses or minimal residual disease (MRD) can&#xD;
           occur in patients with prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation and pTVG-AR,&#xD;
           alone or in combination with nivolumab, prior to definitive surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Clinical Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine 1-year PSA progression-free survival (post-prostatectomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether treatment with androgen deprivation and pTVG-AR DNA vaccine, alone&#xD;
           or in combination with nivolumab, leads to residual cancer burden (RCB) &lt;0.25 cm3 at the&#xD;
           time of prostatectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory / Correlative Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether treatment with pTVG-AR elicits persistent systemic AR-specific&#xD;
           Th1-biased T-cell responses&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether treatment with androgen deprivation and pTVG-AR elicits greater&#xD;
           numbers of prostate tissue-infiltrating CD8+ T cells compared with androgen deprivation&#xD;
           alone, and whether this is augmented with nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine if vaccination with pTVG-AR elicits AR-specific tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T&#xD;
           cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine whether PD-1 blockade treatment with androgen deprivation and vaccine&#xD;
           increases the frequency of CD8+ T cells with memory and effector function, relative to&#xD;
           exhausted phenotype, compared with androgen deprivation and vaccine alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine whether treatment elicits changes detectable by FLT PET imaging&#xD;
