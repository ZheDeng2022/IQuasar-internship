      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of remote ischemic&#xD;
      conditioning combined with intravenous thrombolysis in treating acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 558 cases of ischemic stroke who undergo intravenous thrombolysis within 4.5&#xD;
      hours from the onset are included in 13 centers in China according to the principle of&#xD;
      random, and parallel control. The experimental group receive basic treatment and remote&#xD;
      ischemic conditioning for 200mmHg, 2 times per day for 7 consecutive days. The control group&#xD;
      receive basic treatment and remote ischemic conditioning control for 60mmHg, 2 times per day&#xD;
      for 7 consecutive days. Two groups will be followed up for 90 days to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of remote ischemic conditioning combined with intravenous thrombolysis in treating&#xD;
      acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;
