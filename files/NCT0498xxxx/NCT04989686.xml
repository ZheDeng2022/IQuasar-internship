  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunosuppressive therapy is used to treat and manage solid organ and bone marrow/stem cell&#xD;
      transplants in children. However, it can be harmful if too little or too much is given.&#xD;
      Monitoring immunosuppressive drug (cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, and sirolimus) concentrations&#xD;
      in the blood is important to ensure that the drug is given safely and effectively, but&#xD;
      current approaches for collecting blood from a vein are painful and often difficult in&#xD;
      children. Investigators seek to compare a new approach for monitoring immunosuppressive drug&#xD;
      concentrations using a novel small volume blood sampling technique to the traditional way of&#xD;
      collecting blood from a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this project is to identify the relationship between&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drug (cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, and sirolimus) concentrations in the&#xD;
      venous blood (gold-standard) and capillary whole blood obtained using microsampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to investigate the stability of blood samples&#xD;
      containing immunosuppressive drugs (cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, and sirolimus) under the&#xD;
      conditions of shipping and storage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunosuppressive therapy is used to treat and manage solid organ and bone marrow/stem cell&#xD;
      transplants; however, suboptimal dosing can lead to organ rejection and graft failure.&#xD;
      Immunosuppressant drugs require therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to ensure dosing is&#xD;
      adequate and therapeutic concentrations are achieved and maintained. The optimal blood&#xD;
      concentrations of these drugs are critical to minimize toxicity and simultaneously prevent&#xD;
      allograft rejection in an individual transplant patient. Often life-long TDM is required&#xD;
      necessitating hospital or laboratory visits for routine venous blood sampling by phlebotomy.&#xD;
      Immunosuppressive drugs, cyclosporine A (CYA), tacrolimus (TAC), and sirolimus (SIR) require&#xD;
      routine TDM. This entails immunocompromised people leaving their homes for laboratory visits,&#xD;
      potentially increasing their risk of acquiring infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TDM for CYA, TAC, and SIR are required due to their narrow therapeutic targets: CYA 150-400&#xD;
      ng/mL, TAC 5-12 ng/mL, and SIR 4-12 ng/mL. CYA, TAC, and SIR are primarily distributed in&#xD;
      erythrocytes and should be quantified in whole blood. Immunoassays and the liquid&#xD;
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays are the two commonly used methods&#xD;
      of TDM for CYA, TAC, and SIR. While immunoassays provide an accurate measurement of&#xD;
      concentrations, they often have some limitations on specificity. LC-MS/MS assays are very&#xD;
      specific and efficient since they can quantify multiple analytes with a single method. At the&#xD;
      Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), the clinical TDM immunoassays for CYA, TAC, and&#xD;
      SIR require 0.5-1.0 mL of blood. TDM immunoassays require blood collection by a trained&#xD;
      practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) with an FDA-approved Tasso-M20 device allows for&#xD;
      the accurate and precise collection of a fixed volume of blood from a capillary needle&#xD;
      without the need for phlebotomy. The Tasso-M20 (FDA Class 1 exempt device) consists of a&#xD;
      sample head with a lancet that is activated with the push of a button to accurately and&#xD;
      painlessly collect blood samples from the deltoid (or similar) muscle (capillary sampling) of&#xD;
      the subjects on all four tips (20 µL each). An LC-MS/MS assay with 20 µL blood, as obtained&#xD;
      by the Tasso device, was shown to provide the required test range for TDM of trough values.&#xD;
      This microsampling technique could be utilized clinically to promote the provision of TDM in&#xD;
      children but has not been studied for immunosuppressive drugs (CYA, TAC, and SIR) in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
