    <textblock>
      Purpose: To investigate the impact of milk protein ingestion on resistance exercise-induced&#xD;
      muscle damage in untrained males and females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Unaccustomed resistance exercise can cause muscle damage, presenting as muscle&#xD;
      soreness and reduced muscle function - such as loss of strength, power, and flexibility - for&#xD;
      several days after the exercise bout. Therefore, individuals may require longer recovery&#xD;
      periods before performing another exercise bout, and their performance may be impaired.&#xD;
      Further, muscle soreness may reduce exercise compliance, particularly in novice individuals.&#xD;
      Over time, this may compromise the gains in muscle mass and strength achieved through&#xD;
      exercise training. Therefore, strategies to reduce the severity of exercise-induced muscle&#xD;
      damage and/or to enhance post-exercise recovery processes are advantageous for exercising&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One such strategy is the consumption of dietary protein before or after muscle-damaging&#xD;
      exercise, which has shown to alleviate muscle soreness, improve blood markers of muscle&#xD;
      damage, and reduce the decline in maximal force and flexibility. In particular, consuming&#xD;
      20-gram doses of milk protein in the days after resistance exercise can improve the recovery&#xD;
      time of muscle soreness and maximum force, and also lower levels of damage markers in the&#xD;
      blood. However, most studies have been conducted with male participants who are well-trained&#xD;
      in resistance exercise. It has been suggested that males and females respond differently to&#xD;
      muscle damage, and therefore, this research aims to provide a sex comparison in the muscle&#xD;
      damage response to an acute bout of resistance exercise with or without milk protein feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, 40 healthy, young (18-35 years) adults (20 males, 20 females) will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate in this randomised controlled trial. Maximal leg strength and body composition&#xD;
      (by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; DXA) will be conducted at baseline. In females, all&#xD;
      primary outcome measures will be obtained during the late follicular phase of the menstrual&#xD;
      cycle. Participants will then be randomised to a protein (dairy yoghurt) or placebo&#xD;
      (oat-based yoghurt) dietary condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three weeks later, participants will complete a high-intensity resistance exercise session on&#xD;
      leg extension and leg curl machines to induce muscle damage. Various measures of muscle&#xD;
      damage (blood biomarkers, muscle soreness, flexibility, and swelling) will be obtained&#xD;
      before, immediately after, and 24, 48, 72, and 168 h after the exercise protocol. The maximal&#xD;
      strength test will be repeated 72 and 168 h after the exercise. Participants will consume the&#xD;
      protein or placebo yoghurt 4 times per day (every 3-4 hours) on the day of the exercise bout&#xD;
      and the following 3 days. Participants' habitual activity and dietary intake will be&#xD;
      monitored and controlled throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome: It is expected that the resistance exercise protocol will induce muscle&#xD;
      damage, which will be attenuated with the ingestion of milk protein. It cannot be ascertained&#xD;
      whether males and females will have the same responses to the exercise or to protein&#xD;
      ingestion.&#xD;
