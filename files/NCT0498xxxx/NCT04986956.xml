  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been increasing interest in natural dietary supplements that may support healthy&#xD;
      cognition. Recent studies have demonstrated promising effects of bioactive phytochemicals&#xD;
      (e.g., polyphenols) on cardiovascular and endocrine health outcomes. As such, an increasingly&#xD;
      intriguing line of inquiry is whether materials high in these compounds may also have effects&#xD;
      on psychological measures. Preliminary evidence suggests that polyphenols may improve&#xD;
      cognition, for example, particularly in aging populations. Whole coffee cherry extract (WCCE;&#xD;
      otherwise known as the generally-recognized-as-safe (GRAS) supplement Neurofactor(TM)), is a&#xD;
      proprietary, safe, powdered extract of whole coffee cherries from coffea arabica with high&#xD;
      levels of polyphenols and substantially low (&lt;2%; &lt;4mg) levels of caffeine. WCCE has been&#xD;
      previously associated with increased serum concentrations of both circulating and exosomal&#xD;
      brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), in addition to increased alertness and decreased&#xD;
      fatigue. However, few well-powered and well-designed studies have been conducted despite the&#xD;
      mounting preliminary evidence. Here, the investigators propose a study to examine the&#xD;
      long-term effects of a 200mg dose of WCCE on measures of cognition.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a virtual study whereby participants will be given either&#xD;
      200mg WCCE or placebo to take every day for 28 days. Every 7 days, participants will take a&#xD;
      cognitive assessment via the internet using a platform called Millisecond&#xD;
      (https://www.millisecond.com/). The cognitive assessment will be composed of tasks that&#xD;
      broadly test working memory, focus, and attention. Compliance checks will be administered&#xD;
      daily via the participant's smartphone. This study will be conducted in a double-blind&#xD;
      fashion, such that the experimental team and the participants are unaware of group assignment&#xD;
      (200mg vs. placebo). Blinding information will be held by the study sponsor, VDF&#xD;
      FutureCeuticals, Inc. Group assignment will be determined by random number generator, with&#xD;
      restrictions to ensure equal group sizes, and equal distribution of males/females in each&#xD;
      group. Participants, between 40-65 years of age, with no known psychiatric or neurological&#xD;
      conditions, will be recruited from the general community via online advertisements, social&#xD;
      media posts, community flyers, and newspaper ads (if needed). Participants will be excluded&#xD;
      if they are taking medications known to alter cognitive functioning (psychotropic medications&#xD;
      such as fluoxetine, benzodiazepines, etc. or other medications such as insulin). The primary&#xD;
      variables of interest will be the behavioral performance on the cognitive tasks over time,&#xD;
      inclusive of reaction time and accuracy. Compensation will be commensurate with study&#xD;
      participation, with a maximum payout of $125.&#xD;

The only content of the supplement is WCCE - there are no excipients, binders, or flow agents, nor are there any other materials. The coffee cherry is subjected to a food-grade water ethanol extraction; thus, after extraction, only 100% coffee-based components remain. 200mg of WCCE will be administered daily for 28 days.</description>
