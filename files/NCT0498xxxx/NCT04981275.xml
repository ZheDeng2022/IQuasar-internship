  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to explore the relationship between the gut microbiome&#xD;
      and hormone levels in women diagnosed with PCOS and determine whether there are differences&#xD;
      in the gut microbiome between women with PCOS and women without PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consented, enrolled participants will complete a health questionnaire, complete a fasted&#xD;
      blood draw at a local laboratory, and provide a stool, saliva, and vaginal swab sample for&#xD;
      comprehensive biomarkers, hormones, metagenomics, and metabolomics analysis.&#xD;
