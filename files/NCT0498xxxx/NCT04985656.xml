  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to see if signs and symptoms of myelodysplastic syndromes&#xD;
      disappear when treated with pevonedistat combined with decitabine and cedazuridine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive an infusion of pevonedistat 3 times during a 28-day cycle. They&#xD;
      will also take decitabine and cedazuridine tablets once a day for the first 5 days of the&#xD;
      same cycle. A minimum of 6 28-day cycles is recommended, but participants can stop treatment&#xD;
      at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A bone marrow biopsy, bone marrow aspirates, and blood samples will be collected during the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend a follow-up visit 30 days after their last dose of pevonedistat.&#xD;
      Once treatment has ended, participants will be followed up with either monthly clinic visits&#xD;
      or will be contacted every 3 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Pevonedistat (TAK-924/MLN4924). Pevonedistat is&#xD;
      being tested to treat people who have higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (HR MDS). This&#xD;
      study will look at the overall survival, event free survival and response in people who take&#xD;
      pevonedistat in combination with oral decitabine and cedazuridine in addition to standard&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 94 patients. Participants will be assigned to following&#xD;
      treatment group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Pevonedistat 20 mg/m^2 + Decitabine 35 mg + Cedazuridine 100 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive pevonedistat in combination with decitabine and cedazuridine as&#xD;
      specified in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to&#xD;
      participate in this study is approximately 30 months. Participants will make multiple visits&#xD;
      to the clinic and will be contacted by telephone OR plus a final visit after receiving their&#xD;
      last dose of drug/compound 30 days after last dose of study drug for event free survival&#xD;
      (EFS) follow-up followed by overall survival (OS) follow-up.&#xD;
