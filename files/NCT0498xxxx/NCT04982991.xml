      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the pharmacokinetic parameters of SAR443820 after ascending single oral doses in&#xD;
      healthy East Asian (Chinese and Japanese) adult participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the tolerability and safety of SAR443820 after ascending single oral doses in&#xD;
      healthy East Asian (Chinese and Japanese) adult participants&#xD;

      The duration of the study for a participant will be up to approximately 7 weeks and include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening period: up to 4 weeks (Day -28 to Day -2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Institutionalization period at each period of treatment: 4 days (Day -1 to Day 3, single&#xD;
           SAR443820 administration on Day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wash-out period: at least 5 days between each dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End-of-study visit: Period 3/ Day 6Â±1 day.&#xD;
