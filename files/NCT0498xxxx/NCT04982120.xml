  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) has been treated successfully by the injection of&#xD;
      Botox. The Repris injection needle has a deflection that may assist in injection difficult to&#xD;
      reach with standard straight needles. This study will assess the success, safety and patient&#xD;
      tolerance of this new injection needle.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, single arm study of the Repris injection needle to&#xD;
      administer Botox to the bladder wall in patients with an overactive bladder. Following&#xD;
      advancement of a cystoscope to the patient's bladder, the Repris needle will be advanced to&#xD;
      the area of interest and into the bladder wall in order to administer the recommended volume&#xD;
      of Botox. After injection, the needle will be removed and the procedure will be concluded.&#xD;
      The patient will be asked to rank her tolerance of the procedure and level of discomfort&#xD;
      using a standardized pain scale before being released. Five days after the procedure the&#xD;
      patient will be contacted by telephone to determine whether any adverse events had occurred&#xD;
      since release.&#xD;
