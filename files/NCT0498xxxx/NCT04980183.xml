  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      30 patients with the first rupture of the cruciate ligament were divided into two groups as&#xD;
      1:1. Experimental group will be treated with arthroscopic robot-assisted navigation and&#xD;
      positioning for cruciate ligament reconstruction. Control group will be treated with&#xD;
      conventional reconstruction. This project is used to verify the advantages of surgical robots&#xD;
      assisting surgeons in cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this study, 30 patients with the first rupture of the cruciate ligament were recruited as&#xD;
      the research objects, and the ratio of the experimental group and the control group was 1:1.&#xD;
      Patients in the experimental group will be treated with arthroscopic robot-assisted&#xD;
      navigation and positioning for cruciate ligament reconstruction, and patients in the control&#xD;
      group will be treated with conventional reconstruction. All subjects will undergo CT&#xD;
      evaluation and clinical function evaluation. This project is used to verify the advantages of&#xD;
      surgical robots assisting surgeons in cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery.&#xD;
