      This is a two-arm, randomized, open label, monocenter, controlled study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of Viusid plus Asbrip in patients with mild and moderate symptoms of&#xD;
      respiratory illness caused by Coronavirus 2019 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 80 subjects will be randomized 2:1 in this study. 50 patients will be assigned to&#xD;
      receive daily oral doses of 4,5 g of Viusid every 12 hours and 10 ml of Asbrip every 8 hours&#xD;
      and standard care with antivirals or not. Other 30 patients will be assigned to receive only&#xD;
      standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment duration: 21 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study: to increase the effectiveness of therapy for patients with Covid-19&#xD;
      using food supplements Viusid and Asbrip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the clinical symptoms of Covid-19 in patients on the background of combination&#xD;
           therapy with the inclusion of food supplements Viusid + Asbrip.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the dynamics of indicators of laboratory diagnostics against the&#xD;
           background of complex therapy with the inclusion of food additives Viusid + Asbrip in&#xD;
           the complex treatment of Covid -19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the dynamics of indicators of instrumental methods of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To develop an algorithm for the management of patients with coronavirus infection in&#xD;
           order to increase the effectiveness of therapy and rehabilitation of patients with this&#xD;
           pathology.&#xD;

    <description>Clinical symptoms related with COVID-19 disease are assessed by changes in total symptom score ranging from 0-12.&#xD;
The symptom score includes: [everyday assessment, up to 21 days]:&#xD;
Fever (temperature in oC) based on a scale 0-3: 0&lt;36,7; 1=36,7-37,8; 2=37,8-38,9; 3&gt; 38,9.&#xD;
Cough on a scale 0-3: 0 = no cough, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe.&#xD;
Shortness of breath based on a scale 0-3: 0 = no shortness of breath, 1 = with moderate intensity exercise, 2 = with walking on flat surface, 3 = short of breath with getting dressed or daily activities.&#xD;
Fatigue on a 0-3 scale: 0 = no fatigue, 1 = mild fatigue, 2 = moderate fatigue, 3 = severe fatigue.&#xD;
Composite score is a sum of mentioned four symptom scores, assessed every day up to 21 days. It ranges from 0 to 12.</description>
