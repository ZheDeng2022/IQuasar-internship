  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study of 10 Chagas Disease patients with Ventricular Tachycardia&#xD;
      that have failed prior catheter ablation or have this procedure contraindicated due to&#xD;
      clinical status. Those patients will underwent to Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)&#xD;
      targeting the area of the heart of the VT circuits. Radioablation target will be defined&#xD;
      based on prior ablation electroanatomical mapping, VT morphology, pre-acquired imaging (CT&#xD;
      angiogram, Cardiac Magnetic Resonance), current imaging reconstructed and integrated to&#xD;
      electroanatomical mapping and a EP study to define current VT morphologies. Gross targeted&#xD;
      volume (GTV), internal targeted volume (ITV) and planning targeted volume (PTV) will be&#xD;
      defined and calculated and a single 25Gy dose will be delivered to the PTV. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed initially for one year and efficacy endpoint will be rate of VT recurrence, time to&#xD;
      recurrence and VT burden. Safety endpoint will be the occurrence of any adverse effect&#xD;
      related to SBRT.&#xD;

      Enrollment A patient that fulfill all inclusion criteria (especially diagnosis of Chagas&#xD;
      heart disease including positive serology, recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia&#xD;
      requiring therapy and failed or is ineligible for catheter ablation and had no exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be identified as a candidate for participation in this study while receiving&#xD;
      care at Instituto do Coração, São Paulo, Brazil. The clinical team will contact the patient&#xD;
      in-person and propose study participation and Consent Form will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 10 patients will be enrolled in the current study. At the time of enrollment,&#xD;
      baseline information pertaining to symptoms and details regarding clinical presentation,&#xD;
      imaging, and heart catheterization procedures will be obtained from examination of their&#xD;
      medical record and recorded in a Redcap database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-radiation Imaging and Definition of Treatment Area:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will perform a cardiac MRI with 3D LGE sequence to be imported in the ADAS 3D&#xD;
      software. After MRI acquisition, images will be imported in the software, segmented and the&#xD;
      channels will be identified using an specific tool in the software. After channels and scar&#xD;
      identified the quality of reconstruction and channel identification will be manually&#xD;
      validated by one of the investigators. If the image is considered adequate, the scar, the&#xD;
      chambers and the channels will be exported in VTK format. If the reconstruction is defined as&#xD;
      a poor quality by the investigators, last VT ablation procedure and or ECGs of the VT and&#xD;
      cardiac, mapping data from prior ablation, prior MRI or cardiac CT analyzing wall thickness&#xD;
      will be used to design treatment area . Additionally, areas of scar or infarction identified&#xD;
      by previous electroanatomic mapping (voltage maps), imaging (CT, echocardiography, and/or&#xD;
      nuclear imaging) that are likely the source of VT based on mapping or ECG analysis will be&#xD;
      targeted. The area of interest will be determined by both the treating cardiologist and&#xD;
      radiation oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo a 4D CT scan for treatment planning. The patient will be&#xD;
      immobilized using a custom BodyFIX device. CT with contrast is preferred to facilitate&#xD;
      anatomical definition when the patient is a candidate for contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of the target volume:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As described above, the gross target volume (GTV) will be defined using the pre-radiation&#xD;
      imaging. Using the 4D CT data, an internal target volume (ITV) will then be created to&#xD;
      account for organ motion. Finally, to account for any patient setup variability, a planning&#xD;
      target volume (PTV) will be created by adding a 5 mm margin to the ITV. The prescribed dose&#xD;
      will be 25 Gy to the PTV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following are recommendations for radiation planning parameters with regards to target&#xD;
      coverage and normal tissue constraints. Final determination regarding radiation treatment&#xD;
      plan approval is left at the treating provider's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment planning guidelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  95% of the PTV should be covered with 100% of the prescribed dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  100% of the ITV should be covered with 100% of the prescribed dose Dmax of 120% the&#xD;
           prescribed dose SBRT will take place at the radiation oncology department. Treatment&#xD;
           will be completed within approximately 90 minutes during one visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post ablation management Any ICD or pacemaker will be interrogated before and immediately&#xD;
      after ablation and settings and function documented. Continued antiarrhythmic drug therapy&#xD;
      will be left to the discretion of the treating physicians. The following approaches are&#xD;
      recommended: If the patient is receiving amiodarone, it is recommended that the dose be&#xD;
      reduced to 200 mg daily and then consider stopping it after 3 months if no VT has occurred in&#xD;
      the previous month. It is recommended that antiarrhythmic drugs combined with amiodarone be&#xD;
      stopped at 6 weeks after radioablation if VT has not recurred in the preceding two weeks. For&#xD;
      other antiarrhythmic medications in the absence of amiodarone, continuing administration for&#xD;
      the first 3 months is recommended if tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticoagulation with warfarin or a direct acting anticoagulant will be maintained for one&#xD;
      month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Follow up will be at 4-6 weeks, 10-14weeks, 5-7 months, 11-13 months and thereafter&#xD;
      every 1 year. At the above intervals, all patients will return for follow-up in the&#xD;
      Department of Cardiology and Department of Radiation Oncology. At each visit screening for&#xD;
      effectiveness and adverse effects attributable to treatment will be performed. Arrhythmia&#xD;
      burden will be determined from ICD interrogation. Ventricular function will be assessed from&#xD;
      echocardiography at 3 months. Side effects will be graded according to CTCAE v4.0 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who die during the follow-up period will be considered for autopsy to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of treatment at the histologic and cellular level. This will be subject to approval by&#xD;
      the patient or his/her family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks The principal elements of risk in the study are possible complications of ablative&#xD;
      doses of radiation targeting the ventricle. Target regions and radiation doses will be&#xD;
      designed to limit dose to surrounding normal tissues using established constraints to&#xD;
      minimize potential toxicity. Treatment experience for an electrically ablative dose of&#xD;
      radiation to the myocardium is based on case reports and series noted above. Potential side&#xD;
      effects include, but are not limited to, skin changes/fibrosis, rib weakening or fracture,&#xD;
      lung injury (pneumonitis or fibrosis), heart injury (decreased EF, pericarditis, or&#xD;
      conduction abnormalities), vascular injury (to coronaries or other major vessels), nerve or&#xD;
      spinal injury, esophageal injury (stricture or esophagitis), fatigue, birth defects, and&#xD;
      secondary malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the severe detriment to quality of life and survival in patients with recurrent VT and&#xD;
      the evidence of VT burden reduction in patients treated with stereotactic ablation, we&#xD;
      believe the benefits of further characterizing this technique justify the risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems involving Risk to Participants or&#xD;
      Others Any unanticipated adverse events will be reported by the Principal Investigator&#xD;
      according to applicable IRB policy. The PI is fully engaged in the actual performance of the&#xD;
      study and this ensures that adverse events would be readily known and reported by the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation If an individual decides to withdraw their consent by&#xD;
      informing study staff in writing or verbally, we will withdraw the participant. Contact&#xD;
      information for the PI and study staff will be made available to the participant upon&#xD;
      enrollment in the consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management Data will be stored in REDCap using the participant's study ID. Their REDCap&#xD;
      data record may contain some identifying information. Subjects will be tracked using their&#xD;
      study ID. The identifiable data, excluding date of procedures, will reside as a separate form&#xD;
      under the data entry sections labeled &quot;Registration/PHI&quot; within our REDCap database which&#xD;
      will allow us to exclude access to the identifiable information, excluding date of&#xD;
      procedures, if necessary. Minimal paper records will be kept, and they will be kept locked in&#xD;
      a cabinet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol will adhere to privacy regulations at Instituto do Coração. No information&#xD;
      will be released, nor will participation in the research be acknowledged, to any party except&#xD;
      where compulsory according to law or Instituto do Coração policy. There may be unknown or&#xD;
      unanticipated adverse effects from participation in this registry for which the PI and study&#xD;
      team will remain observant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12. Follow-up and Record Retention Patient will be enrolled until the number is complete.&#xD;
      Data will be retained indefinitely. Electronic data may be destroyed earlier at the request&#xD;
      of the participant. Electronic records will be deleted from the REDCap database, paper copies&#xD;
      will be deposited into locked containers designated for shredding of confidential patient&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
