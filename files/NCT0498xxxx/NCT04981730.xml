  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The transition to parenthood is stressful for first-time mothers and fathers and&#xD;
      links to adverse health outcomes. Despite Internet use's popularity, an effective web-based,&#xD;
      individually-tailored intervention to enhance parental self-efficacy and infant health for&#xD;
      first-time parents remains lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This study aims to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based,&#xD;
      individually-tailored childbirth and parenting intervention program on parenting&#xD;
      self-efficacy and infant health outcomes. The feasibility and acceptability of a&#xD;
      theory-driven intervention will be examined in first-time mothers and fathers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A three-arm, single-blind randomized controlled trial will be conducted to&#xD;
      investigate the effects of web-based intervention in the first-time mother and father.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated to a guided web-based intervention, a self-guided&#xD;
      web-based intervention, or a control condition. A repeated measurement will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipatory results: The efficacy of a theory-driven web-based, individually tailored&#xD;
      intervention program will provide a valuable contribution to perinatal health care for&#xD;
      first-time mothers and fathers.&#xD;

      The primary outcome of parenting self-efficacy and the secondary outcomes of anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, sleep quality, social support, infant health outcomes will be assessed. Data will&#xD;
      be analyzed with the intention-to-treat analysis using linear mixed-effects modeling.&#xD;
