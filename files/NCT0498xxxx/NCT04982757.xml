  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a FDA-approved treatment for&#xD;
      depression and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The goal of the study is to learn how to&#xD;
      optimize the treatment to improve symptoms of depression and OCD. This research project will&#xD;
      test a new accelerated 5-day accelerated rTMS protocol for treating symptoms of depression&#xD;
      and OCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second goal of this study is to identify biomarkers of depression and OCD in the brain&#xD;
      using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This approach will predict who will&#xD;
      benefit from TMS, determine the optimal treatment target, and improve treatment outcomes.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a clinical assessment of symptoms and an fMRI brain scan before and&#xD;
      after each treatment course to measure the effect of treatment on symptom severity and on&#xD;
      fMRI measures of functional connectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to receive rTMS targeting either the lateral prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex (LPFC) or the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC). Participants will complete a&#xD;
      5-day course of rTMS delivered hourly for 10 hours per day. Participants who show a partial&#xD;
      response to treatment but not a full response will then receive a second 5-day course.&#xD;
      Treatment non-responders will be crossed over to receive rTMS targeting the opposite brain&#xD;
      area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that accelerated rTMS treatment will yield rapid improvement in&#xD;
      symptoms for patients with depression and OCD in just 5 days, and that response rates can be&#xD;
      further improved by adding a second 5-day treatment course.&#xD;
