  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The American Academy of Pain Medicine has labeled pain as a &quot;silent epidemic&quot; due to its&#xD;
      staggering costs to society (over $500 billion/year) and widespread prevalence (affects over&#xD;
      100 million Americans)(Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Advancing Pain Research, 2011;&#xD;
      Summers B, 2005). Thus, it is imperative to test and validate cost-effective pain therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this extent, cannabis is characterized as one of the most promising therapies to treat a&#xD;
      wide spectrum of pain conditions (Andreae et al., 2015; Baker, Pryce, Giovannoni, &amp; Thompson,&#xD;
      2003; Bostwick, 2014; Haroutounian et al., 2016; Shohet, Khlebtovsky, Roizen, Roditi, &amp;&#xD;
      Djaldetti, 2017). However, the clinical applicability of cannabis-based pain therapies has&#xD;
      been limited due to lacking mechanistic characterization in human-focused studies. Of&#xD;
      critical importance, the neural mechanisms supporting cannabis induced pain relief remain&#xD;
      unknown. The primary objective of the proposed pilot study is to identify the brain&#xD;
      mechanisms supporting the direct alleviation of acutely evoked pain through vaporized&#xD;
      cannabis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Behavioral (visual analog scale) and neural (cerebral blood flow) effects of a &quot;medium&quot; dose&#xD;
      (5.1% THC by weight; NIDA supply; University of Mississippi) of vaporized cannabis in&#xD;
      response to a well-validated noxious heat stimulation (49°C) and an emerging fMRI perfusion&#xD;
      technique (arterial spin labeling) will be conducted when compared to placebo (&lt;.1%&#xD;
      THC/weight). Cannabis will be self-administered using a portable Volcano vaporizer -a safe&#xD;
      and reliable method of intrapulmonary administration of cannabinoids and the Foltin Uniform&#xD;
      Puff Procedure (FUPP), an established inhalation protocol commonly used in cannabis research&#xD;
      to reduce variability of dosing across subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Human Involvement Successful completion of the proposed study will include a&#xD;
      total of 2 sessions. Prior to their enrollment potential subjects will first be screened over&#xD;
      the phone to determine if they qualify for the proposed project. There may be up to 2 weeks&#xD;
      between a subject's initial screening and their official enrollment of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A14-day gap between enrollment and the first experimental session will be provided time to&#xD;
      enroll cohorts, group randomization, and individualized scheduling. Once the schedules have&#xD;
      been determined, the subjects' baseline assessment and baseline testing session will be&#xD;
      scheduled, and a study coordinator(s) will schedule the pharmacologic testing sessions. The&#xD;
      sessions can include weekends; this approach will increase study feasibility, compliance and&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be collected from all subjects: name, date of birth, age,&#xD;
      gender, ethnicity, telephone number email address, handedness, current/previous drug and&#xD;
      cannabis regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the proposed procedures are characterized as &quot;experimental&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Session 1: Subjects will first report to the ACTRI. After obtaining informed consent,&#xD;
      If subjects are female and of child-bearing age (&lt;55 years), they will be administered a&#xD;
      urine based pregnancy test. Participants will also take a cannabis focused urine screening.&#xD;
      Research technicians will be employed to determine participant eligibility based on our&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, including reviewing MRI screening eligibility. These&#xD;
      criteria will simply be based on self-report and assessment of medical history from their&#xD;
      respective physicians, on an &quot;as needed&quot; basis. After meeting study inclusion criteria,&#xD;
      subjects will then be administered and complete one pre-session study questionnaires and will&#xD;
      be trained to reliably use the visual analog scale (VAS) to rate their pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychophysical Testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thermal stimulation: As in all of our prior IRB approved experiments, the MEDOC TSA-II will&#xD;
      be used to deliver all thermal stimuli. All stimulus temperatures will be less than or equal&#xD;
      to 50°C, and volunteers will be free to escape the stimulator at any time. No stimulus will&#xD;
      produce tissue damage. This study will use a 16x16 mm surface area for the delivery of&#xD;
      neutral and noxious stimuli. This modest stimulus area allows a relatively wide range of&#xD;
      noxious stimuli to be delivered (up to 50°C for 30 seconds) without either tissue damage or&#xD;
      significant subject withdrawals/drop-outs. Stimuli in this temperature range have been used&#xD;
      extensively by the PI and numerous laboratories around the world and do not produce tissue&#xD;
      damage or burns. In order to facilitate removal from the stimulator, the stimulator will be&#xD;
      attached to a custom-designed thermal stimulation probe holder. Participants will place their&#xD;
      calf on top of the probe holder and will not be strapped in or otherwise restrained.&#xD;
      Therefore, participants will be able to simply lift their legs at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cannabis administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cannabis will be stored in a locked and alarmed freezer in a UCSD research pharmacy until it&#xD;
      is dispensed to the subjects. Each subject will be provided a lock box in which to store the&#xD;
      capsules assigned to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These drugs are not FDA-approved for the proposed subject population and purpose. The IND for&#xD;
      the proposed study is in preparation and will be submitted pending IRB approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug: Bulk cannabis from the following NIDA batches will be purchased from the NIDA&#xD;
      supply at the University of Mississippi. The cannabis supply from NIDA/University of&#xD;
      Mississippi varies in the exact percentages available from year to year. Numerous past&#xD;
      UCSD/CMCR studies have used the NIH/NIDA supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. THC dominant (THC ~5.1%, CBD &lt;0.1%, &quot;THC&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Placebo cannabis (THC &lt;0.1%, &quot;Placebo&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatments will be administered under direct observation by a study nurse using a&#xD;
      cued-inhalation procedure. Subjects will be given verbal instructions prior to initiation of&#xD;
      the procedure. The respective dose of cannabis or placebo will be aerosolized using the&#xD;
      VOLCANO-System-Vaporizer (VSV). The VSV releases the active ingredients of the cannabis&#xD;
      through vaporization by hot air. The vapor with active ingredients of the cannabis are&#xD;
      trapped in a bag. A mouthpiece attached to the bag allows for inhalation. The subject will be&#xD;
      seated in a chair in the designated smoking room (in the ACTRI) and will be given the bag&#xD;
      containing aerosolized cannabis. The study nurse/research technician will provide verbal cues&#xD;
      from an adjacent room. The nurse will instruct the subject to inhale for 5 seconds. The&#xD;
      subject will then be instructed to remove the mouthpeice from the lips and hold the&#xD;
      inhalation for 5 seconds (if possible). Next, the subject will be instructed to exhale fully.&#xD;
      The subject will be given a 40-second resting period until the process is repeated up to 3&#xD;
      more times, at which time it is expected that the cannabis content of the bag will be fully&#xD;
      depleted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only study physicians, research pharmacist and the research coordinator will be able to&#xD;
      identify the cannabis dosage. This will be a double blinded study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Sessions: All of the proposed procedures are characterized as &quot;experimental&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1: This session will serve as the baseline control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will first report to the Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute&#xD;
           (pressurized clinical room).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After obtaining informed consent, research technicians will confirm participant&#xD;
           eligibility based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then, if female participants&#xD;
           are of child-bearing age, they will be administered a urine-based pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight will be measured to identify the appropriate drug dosage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once eligibility criteria review is complete, the research technician will begin the&#xD;
           psychophysical training and baseline pain testing portion of the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be trained to reliably use the visual analog scale (VAS) to rate their&#xD;
           pain and introduced to the thermal stimuli. Participants will be familiarized with 32,&#xD;
           5s duration stimuli (35 - 49°C) using the MEDOC TSA-II and use of the VAS (Zeidan,&#xD;
           Emerson, et al., 2015; Zeidan, Lobanov, et al., 2015a; Zeidan et al., 2011). Stimuli&#xD;
           will be delivered to the back of the right calf as subjects lie in supine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will then assess baseline psychophysical responses to noxious heat by administering a&#xD;
           total of four heat series. Heat series (4min and 24s) include ten, alternating 12s&#xD;
           plateaus of 49°C and 35°C stimulation to the back of the right calf. The thermal probe&#xD;
           will be moved to a different region on the back of the right calf after completion of&#xD;
           the first heat series. VAS pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings will be collected&#xD;
           after each series.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the first two heat series, subjects will be instructed to &quot;try to stay still&quot;. We&#xD;
           will then instruct them to sit quietly for 10 minutes to control for the time elapsed in&#xD;
           the subsequent heat testing-fMRI experimental sessions (Experimental Session 2 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 10 minutes pass, two heat series will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After successful completion of sensory testing, participants will then complete study&#xD;
           questionnaires (see Questionnaires for Study Assessments).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization will occur after successful completion of study session 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be tracked in the Screening/Enrollment Log that is maintained by the study&#xD;
      coordinator(s). Randomization will be stratified so that each sex will have their respective&#xD;
      list of randomization codes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Males and females will be randomized without replacement across a block of 120 codes&#xD;
      (assuming 20% attrition) using an Excel-based random number generator. Subjects will then be&#xD;
      randomized to one of two groups (5% THC/weight vs. &lt;.1% THC/weight). The study coordinator is&#xD;
      responsible for enrolling, scheduling, and randomizing subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      THC 5.1% group • Fifty subjects will receive a &quot;medium&quot; dose (5.1% THC by weight; NIDA&#xD;
      supply; University of Mississippi) of vaporized cannabis&#xD;
&#xD;
      THC .1% placebo group&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Fifty subjects will receive a &quot;very low&quot; dose (&lt;.1% THC by weight; NIDA supply; University&#xD;
      of Mississippi) of vaporized cannabis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures will be performed in each group, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 2: After at least 2 days have elapsed, subjects will report back to the ACTRI to&#xD;
      complete study session 2. Data collection in this session will take no more than 1.5 hour to&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A research technician will greet subjects as they arrive to the ACTRI and guide them to&#xD;
           the pressurized room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ACTRI nurses will then administer a cannabis based drug screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight will be measured to confirm the prescribed drug dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Next, the research technician will issue study assessments to the subject (via REDCap).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will then be positioned in the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A respiratory transducer will be fitted across the chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rest: Subjects will be instructed to keep their eyes closed and to reduce movement.Heat&#xD;
           series (4min and 24s) that contain ten, alternating 12s plateaus of 49°C and 35°C&#xD;
           stimulation to the back of the right calf. Two heat series will be administered during&#xD;
           fMRI acquisition. VAS pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings are collected after each&#xD;
           series. The thermal probe will be moved to a different location of the right calf after&#xD;
           each heat series to reduce potential habituation and sensitization. Subjects will be&#xD;
           instructed not to move and to keep their eyes closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaporized cannabis administration: Subjects will then be escorted to a pressurized room&#xD;
           in the ACTRI. Subjects will be administered vaporized cannabis by inhaling aerosolized&#xD;
           cannabis through the Volcano vaporizer. The study nurse/research technician will provide&#xD;
           verbal cues from an adjacent room. The nurse will instruct the subject to inhale for 5&#xD;
           seconds. The subject will then be instructed to remove the mouthpeice from the lips and&#xD;
           hold the inhalation for 5 seconds (if possible). Next, the subject will be instructed to&#xD;
           exhale fully. The subject will be given a 40-second resting period until the process is&#xD;
           repeated up to 3 more times and/or until the content of the bag is fully depleted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 10 minutes of cannabis administration, will reposition said subject in the MRI&#xD;
           Scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two more heat series will be administered during fMRI acquisition. VAS ratings will be&#xD;
           assessed after each heat series.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will then acquire a structural scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measure(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cerebral blood flow (average blood perfusion; mL blood/100 grams tissue/minute): changes&#xD;
           in cerebral blood flow (CBF) will be assessed during arterial spin labeling and BOLD&#xD;
           fMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Visual Analog Scale (VAS): Pain ratings will be assessed in response to the noxious heat&#xD;
           stimulation. Pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings will be assessed with a Visual&#xD;
           Analog Scale. The minimum rating (&quot;0&quot;) is designated as &quot;no pain&quot; whereas the maximum&#xD;
           (&quot;10&quot;) is labeled as &quot;most intense imaginable&quot; or &quot;most unpleasant imaginable.&quot; Higher&#xD;
           numbers correspond to higher pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Respiration Rate (Biopac respiratory transducer): Changes in respiration rate could be&#xD;
           predictive of analgesia and health promotion. We will be able to identify, in real-time,&#xD;
           if respiration rate data is being appropriately collected. Thus, there will be no need&#xD;
           to adjudicate these data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Questionnaires for Study Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All questionnaires will be delivered using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)&#xD;
           platform on iPAD tablets administered and supervised by study personnel. The&#xD;
           questionnaires to be presented on the REDCap platform include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Profile of Mood States Questionnaire (POMS-short form): This is a 40-item measure of 6&#xD;
           mood states: tension-anxiety, depression-dejection, anger-hostility, vigor-activity,&#xD;
           fatigue-inertia, and confusion-bewilderment. This assessment is recommended by the&#xD;
           IMMPACT group as a core measure of emotional functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Subjects' Global Impression of Change (PGIC): This is a self-report assessment&#xD;
           recommended to evaluate self-reported perception of improvement over trial/efficacy of&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. PROMIS 29-Item Profile: This is a 29-item generic health-related survey that assesses&#xD;
           the following 7 domains: depression, anxiety, physical function, pain interference,&#xD;
           fatigue, sleep disturbance, and ability to participant in social roles/activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. State Anxiety Inventory (SAI): The SAI is a prominent 20-item measure for anxiety, and&#xD;
           will be utilized as a manipulation check for our behavioral interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. SF-12 Health Survey (SF-12): This is a 12-item version of the SF-36 item Health Survey&#xD;
           designed to assess general mental and physical functioning, and overall health-related&#xD;
           quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI): This is a 21-item standard assessment widely used to&#xD;
           measure clinical depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI): This is a 10-item assessment designed to measure&#xD;
           quality of sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Cohen Perceived Stress Scale (PSS): This assessment is critical for controlling stress&#xD;
           in our analyses as well as a potential predictor in clinical pain improvements&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS): This is a 20-item self-report assessment&#xD;
           used to assess positive and negative affect in a subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. UNCOPE: This is a 6-item scale that provides a simple and quick means of identifying&#xD;
           risk for abuse and dependence for alcohol and other drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Cannabis Use Disorders Identification Test (CUDIT): screens for current cannabis use&#xD;
           disorders (abuse or dependence) according to DSM-IV&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. Problematic Use of Marijuana (PUM): measures ICD-10 harmful use along with problems in&#xD;
           interpersonal relationships and psycho-physical functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
       16. Cannabis Abuse Screening Test (CAST) identifies patterns of cannabis use leading to&#xD;
           negative consequences on a social or health level for the user himself or others.&#xD;
&#xD;
       17. Bowdle questionnaire: This questionnaire evaluates 3 psychedelic effects (drug high,&#xD;
           alterations in internal perception, and alterations in external perception) from 13&#xD;
           questions scored on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (from 0, no effect, to 100, maximum&#xD;
           effect). Internal perception reflects inner feelings that do not correspond with the&#xD;
           reality and is derived from questions regarding the hearing of unrealistic voices or&#xD;
           sounds and having unrealistic thoughts and paranoid or anxious feelings. The external&#xD;
           perception indicates a misperception of an external stimulus or change in the awareness&#xD;
           of the subject's surroundings and is derived from questions regarding the perceptual&#xD;
           change of body parts, the change of surroundings, the altered passing of time, the&#xD;
           difficulty of controlling thoughts, and the change in color and sound intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Determination &amp; Power:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this stage, the proposed study is exploratory in nature. Neverthelesss, random effects&#xD;
      models require a sample of 15 - 20 participants per group to attain sufficient statistical&#xD;
      power to detect a large effect size in fMRI-based regression models. We have repeatedly found&#xD;
      that sample sizes 15-16 (per group) can reliably detect the neural correlates of pain relief&#xD;
      across multiple fMRI testing points. However, since individual differences in pain&#xD;
      sensitivity and between group comparisons could decrease the power to assess relatively small&#xD;
      differences in neural activation across time, we will recruit 100 participants (50 per group)&#xD;
      to test our hypotheses. The data collected in this pilot study will also be used to estimate&#xD;
      the effect sizes to help design a larger fully-powered follow-up trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analyses and Interpretation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age and sex will be entered as covariates in all appropriate analyses. As previously, VAS&#xD;
      pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings will be examined in separate analyses. To test&#xD;
      study hypotheses, a 2 (group: medium dose vs. placebo) X 2 (rest vs. cannabis/placebo)&#xD;
      repeated measures (RM) ANOVA will be employed. Post-hoc paired samples t-tests (in each&#xD;
      group) will be conducted to test significant main effects and interactions on behavioral and&#xD;
      neural responses. Pain ratings derived from Session 1 may be entered as covariates. Between&#xD;
      groups differences on exploratory outcomes (psychological assessments) will be assessed with&#xD;
      a 2 (group) X 2(pre vs. post) RM ANOVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion of Women and Minorities: Subjects will include all sexes and races. We plan to&#xD;
      screen from over 2500 subjects from the ACTRI's recruitment service, 11 separate providers,&#xD;
      and the local community. Based on prior work, we will target to recruit 54% Non-Hispanic&#xD;
      White, 15% Non-Hispanic Black, 17% Hispanic, 7% Asian/Pacific Islander, 1% Native&#xD;
      American/American Indian, and 6% Other. If necessary to obtain minority representation,&#xD;
      under-represented racial groups will be targeted specifically for recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for all individual subjects randomized or exposed to study drug will be presented in&#xD;
      data listings. Continuous data will be summarized using the following descriptive summary&#xD;
      statistics: the number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), standard error (SE),&#xD;
      median, minimum value (min), and maximum value (max). Categorical data will be summarized&#xD;
      using counts and percentages.&#xD;
