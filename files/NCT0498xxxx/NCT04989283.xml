    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of atezolizumab given with usual chemotherapy during&#xD;
      radiation therapy in treating patients with superior sulcus non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin, carboplatin, etoposide, paclitaxel and&#xD;
      pemetrexed, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy&#xD;
      uses high energy beams to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving atezolizumab with usual&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy may lower the chance of the tumor from growing or&#xD;
      spreading.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare event-free survival (EFS) between participants randomized to conventional&#xD;
      trimodality therapy, with or without atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the pathologic complete response (pCR) by local review between the arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the pCR by centralized review between the arms. III. To compare overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) between the arms. IV. To compare surgical resection rate and complete resection&#xD;
      (R0) rate between the arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 among participants who do not undergo surgical resection, by treatment&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To compare the frequency and severity of toxicities between the arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADDITIONAL OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To bank blood and tissue for future research. II. To evaluate the association between&#xD;
      major pathologic response (MPR), as defined by the International Association for the Study of&#xD;
      Lung Cancer (IASLC), and survival outcomes (OS, PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the association between pCR by centralized review and survival outcomes (OS,&#xD;
      PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Evaluate the changes in fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      metrics (e.g., standardized uptake value [SUV] maximum [max], SUVpeak, SUVmax tumor-to-liver,&#xD;
      SUVpeak tumor-to-liver, metabolic tumor volume, total lesion glycolysis, etc.) in&#xD;
      participants randomized to receive trimodality therapy alone or in combination with&#xD;
      atezolizumab and to evaluate the association with pCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Evaluate the extent to which the changes in diffusion weighted imaging (DWI)-magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imagining (MRI) metrics (e.g., mean apparent diffusion coefficient or apparent&#xD;
      diffusion coefficient [ADC] for the primary tumor, etc.) are associated with pCR in&#xD;
      participants randomized to receive trimodality therapy alone or in combination with&#xD;
      atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Evaluate the extent to which changes in computed tomography (CT) tumor volume,&#xD;
      unidimensional lesion changes per RECIST 1.1 and bidimensional lesion changes per World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO) criteria are associated with pCR in participants randomized to&#xD;
      receive trimodality therapy alone or in combination with atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Patients&#xD;
      also receive one of the chemotherapy combinations below depending on their previous therapy&#xD;
      and disease. Beginning on the first day of chemotherapy and the first day of cycle 2 of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, patients undergo external beam radiation therapy 5 days per week. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 21 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 21 and 90 days after treatment, patients undergo surgery.&#xD;
      Within 42 days after completion of surgery, patients then receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive one of the chemotherapy combinations below depending on their&#xD;
      previous therapy and disease. Beginning on the first day of chemotherapy and the first day of&#xD;
      cycle 2 of chemotherapy, patients also undergo external beam radiation therapy 5 days per&#xD;
      week. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 21 and 90 days after treatment, patients&#xD;
      undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive one of the chemotherapy combinations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cisplatin IV over 2 hours and etoposide IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Carboplatin IV over 60 minutes and etoposide IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 60 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with non-squamous NSCLC may receive one of the following combinations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pemetrexed IV over 10 minutes and carboplatin IV over 60 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Pemetrexed IV over 10 minutes and cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 3 years,&#xD;
      then annually until 6 years from date of Step 1 Randomization.&#xD;

             that has required systemic treatment within the past two years (i.e., with use of&#xD;
             disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement&#xD;
             therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy&#xD;
             for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic&#xD;
             treatment. Autoimmune diseases include, but are not limited to, systemic lupus&#xD;

             active pneumonitis. This protocol includes an immunotherapy agent which can&#xD;
             precipitate known pneumonitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  STEP 1 RANDOMIZATION: Participants must not have a prior or concurrent malignancy&#xD;
             whose natural history or treatment (in the opinion of the treating physician) has the&#xD;
             potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational&#xD;
             regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  STEP 1 RANDOMIZATION: Participants must not have received a live attenuated&#xD;
             vaccination within 28 days prior to Step 1 Randomization. All COVID-19 vaccines that&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  STEP 1 RANDOMIZATION: Participants must not be pregnant or nursing due to carcinogenic&#xD;
             and teratogenic effects of treatment. Women/men of reproductive potential must have&#xD;
             agreed to use an effective contraceptive method while on study treatment and for 5&#xD;
             months after the last dose. A woman is considered to be of &quot;reproductive potential&quot; if&#xD;
             she has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months. In addition to&#xD;
             routine contraceptive methods, &quot;effective contraception&quot; also includes heterosexual&#xD;
             celibacy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy&#xD;
             prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal&#xD;
             ligation. However, if at any point a previously celibate participant chooses to become&#xD;
             heterosexually active during the time period for use of contraceptive measures&#xD;
             outlined, he/she is responsible for beginning contraceptive measures&#xD;
