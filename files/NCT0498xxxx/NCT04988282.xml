      Aim: To investigate the efficacy of systemic corticosteroids in treatment for Post-COVID-19&#xD;
      Interstitial Lung Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Method: In this multi-centre, prospective, randomised controlled open label clinical&#xD;
      trial, patients are divided into two arms: standard treatment arm and standard plus systemic&#xD;
      corticosteroid arm. After four weeks, clinical response will being assessed as primary&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;

    <description>A combination of symptomatic, functional, and radiological response will be assessed. Good symptomatic response is identified as grade 0 modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea score. Good functional response is identified as follows: no desaturation at rest and/or exercise, and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) is greater than 80 %. Good radiological response is identified as at least 90 % regression in extension of interstitial lesions in thorax CT. If at least two of these three (symptomatic, functional, and radiological) criterion are present, it will be accepted as a good clinical response.</description>
