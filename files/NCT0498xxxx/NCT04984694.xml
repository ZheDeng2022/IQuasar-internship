  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of dementia patients increased with aging population. People with subjective&#xD;
      memory complaints or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may have a high risk of developing&#xD;
      dementia. Cognitive /memory training programs have shown the potential positive effects for&#xD;
      improving or maintaining the cognitive progression. However, the impact of those cognitive&#xD;
      progressions on functional ability and quality of life is not well understood. In addition,&#xD;
      it appears to have large variability responsiveness among trained subjects. Most studies did&#xD;
      not examine the individual difference associated with training. The major aim will evaluate&#xD;
      the cognitive training programs on functional ability and quality of life in older adults.&#xD;
      The results will be expected to understand the effectiveness of the computerized virtual&#xD;
      reality training, improving or maintaining cognition, physical and psychosocial function,&#xD;
      enhancing quality of life, and reducing the risk of developing disability even conversion&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prevention strategies for dementia are needed because of the increasing prevalence of&#xD;
      dementia. People with mild cognitive impairment are at high risk of developing a disability,&#xD;
      even conversion into dementia in later life. Cognitive /memory training programs have shown&#xD;
      the potential positive effects for improving or maintaining the cognitive progression.&#xD;
      However, the impact of those cognitive progressions on functional ability and quality of life&#xD;
      is not well understood. The major aim of this total project is to evaluate the short and&#xD;
      long-term effects of computerized virtual reality training programs (Xavix Hot-Plus) on&#xD;
      functional ability (cognition, physical and psychosocial function) and quality of life in&#xD;
      older adults with mild cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental research design with three groups, one pretest and four posttests will be&#xD;
      conducted to examine the short-term and long-term effects on cognition (primary outcome),&#xD;
      physical (secondary outcome), psychosocial function (secondary outcome), and quality of life&#xD;
      (secondary outcome). Independent adults will be recruited from the community base on sample&#xD;
      criteria. The total subjects will be 160 to 190 older adults and the community care centers&#xD;
      include all eligible participants will be randomly assigned into computerized virtual reality&#xD;
      training programs group (Hot-Plus group) or social interaction group. The subjects for the&#xD;
      control group will be recruited in the community and be referred by neurological,&#xD;
      psychiatric, or gerontological physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are in the Hot-Plus group will divide several small groups which will be 4&#xD;
      persons with mild cognitive impairment. Participants will receive a computerized virtual&#xD;
      reality training program by Hot-Plus as a group activity one hour, once a week for 12 weeks.&#xD;
      The participants in the social interaction group will come as a group for social interaction&#xD;
      one hour weekly for 12 weeks. The control group will maintain their regular activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analysed by using SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL), with the significance&#xD;
      level is set at p&lt; .05. The normal distribution of the data will be evaluated using the&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Mean, Standard deviation, frequency, and percentage will be&#xD;
      performed to describe all variables. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate differences between groups according to the continuous variables, non-normal&#xD;
      distribution of data will be calculated by Kruskasl-Wallis test. The chi-square test will be&#xD;
      used for the comparison of categorical variables, and Fisher's exact test will be used due to&#xD;
      the expected value less than four. Generalised Estimating Equation (GEE) will be used to&#xD;
      examine the main effects, time effects, and interactions in outcomes over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be expected to understand the effectiveness of the computerized virtual&#xD;
      reality training, improving or maintaining cognition, physical, psychosocial function,&#xD;
      enhancing quality of life, and reducing the risk of developing disability even conversion&#xD;
      into dementia in later life.&#xD;

    <intervention_model>Parallel Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>Parallel assignment A type of intervention model describing a clinical trial in which two or more groups of participants receive different interventions. For example, a three-arm parallel assignment involves three groups of participants. One group receives intervention (Computerized Virtual Reality program), one group receives social interaction, and the other group is the control group. So during the trial, participants in one group receive intervention &quot;in parallel&quot; to participants in the other group, who receive social interaction.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>EQ-5D-3L Taiwanese version questionnaire was selected to measure health-related quality of life (HRQOL) which was recommended in older adults and people with mild dementia (Aguirre, Kang, Hoare, Edwards, &amp; Orrell, 2016; León-Salas et al., 2015). According to the self-report index scores, it can be converted to a single summary utility score by using the time trade-off (TTO) technique. The range of this EQ-5D-3L utility score (EQ5D-Utility) was -0.67 to 1.00 by using the Taiwanese value set (Lee et al., 2013), as the score closer to 1 indicated the better health, a negative score indicated worse than dead, and a 0.5 score could be acceptable.</description>
