  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mental health problems are increasing in Pakistan and there is a 90% treatment gap in mental&#xD;
      health services. Accessibility towards mental health services is limited due to range of&#xD;
      factors including low income and resources, lack of the trained staff and lack of specialized&#xD;
      and non-specialized mental health facilities. Therefore, there is a dire need to develop&#xD;
      indigenous solution of the mental health issues grounded in Islamic teaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard this study is designed to address the mental health issues at community level.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study divided into two phases. In first phase the aim of the study is to&#xD;
      adapt World Health Organization recommended psychological intervention for paraprofessionals&#xD;
      and to train the paraprofessional on this indigenously adapted intervention. Subsequently, in&#xD;
      second phase the study aims to assess the effectiveness of the indigenously adapted Problem&#xD;
      Management Plus (IA-PM+) as an evidence based remedy in the treatment of psychological&#xD;
      distress of person living with disabilities (PWDs).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence of disability is higher in Low and middle income countries (LMICs). Persons living&#xD;
      with disabilities are more vulnerable to develop psychopathology due to their low level of&#xD;
      functioning, their complex and speciÔ¨Åc needs. Consequently, Persons living with disabilities&#xD;
      (PWDs) are expected to experience more adverse psychological ailments as compared to the&#xD;
      persons living without disabilities particularly in the rural parts of the countries.&#xD;
      Accessibility towards mental health services in Pakistan has been limited due to range of&#xD;
      factors including low income and resources, lack of the trained staff and lack of specialized&#xD;
      and non-specialized mental health facilities. These challenges are required to be dealt at&#xD;
      locally at micro and macro levels systemically and effectively. This requires development and&#xD;
      innovation in the existing infrastructure by devising multidisciplinary community based&#xD;
      treatment policy in building mental health care services. Therefore, to integrate the mental&#xD;
      health care services at primary care level, there is a dire need to develop indigenous&#xD;
      psychological interventions in a simplified form so that people can quickly learn their&#xD;
      utilization not only from the health professionals but also from the para-professionals as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the lack of specialized mental health services and human resources in low resource&#xD;
      settings, task shifting is a well-known strategy, designed by World Health Organization to&#xD;
      bridge the treatment gap in mental health problems. This strategy empowers the health&#xD;
      workers, such as nurses and non-specialist to perform specific roles to bridge the available&#xD;
      treatment gap. In addition to this, deliverance of evidence based psychological treatment by&#xD;
      para-professionals/ non-specialists will not only help in reducing the financial and human&#xD;
      resources but also might be able to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Realizing the influence of religion on the general population, the American Psychological&#xD;
      Association (APA) has recommended to view the religion as a significant aspect of human life&#xD;
      and as such psychologists need to get special knowledge and training on religious&#xD;
      psychotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard this study is designed to address the mental health issues at community level.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study divided into two phases. In first phase the aim of the study is to&#xD;
      adapt World Health Organization recommended psychological intervention for paraprofessionals&#xD;
      and to train the paraprofessional on this indigenously adapted intervention. Subsequently, in&#xD;
      second phase the study aims to assess the effectiveness of the indigenously adapted Problem&#xD;
      Management Plus (IA-PM+) as an evidence based remedy in the treatment of psychological&#xD;
      distress of person living with disabilities (PWDs).&#xD;
