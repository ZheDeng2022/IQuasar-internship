  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of single syringe TIVA with propofol and remifentanil. The primary outcome for efficacy was a&#xD;
      processed EEG (pEEG) index within the recommended range for general anesthesia for the&#xD;
      duration of the maintenance anesthetic. The primary outcome measure for safety was&#xD;
      intraoperative administration of vasopressors. We hypothesized that the pEEG index would be&#xD;
      within the recommended range for over 90% of the duration of the maintenance anesthetic. We&#xD;
      hypothesized that vasopressor use would be consistent with other anesthetic types using&#xD;
      potent inhaled agents.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is a commonly used general anesthetic. Propofol and&#xD;
      remifentanil is a common drug combination used in TIVA and is a safe and efficacious method&#xD;
      of anesthesia in pediatric and adult patients.[1-7] A typical TIVA method is to administer&#xD;
      each drug using a separate syringe pump. Another approach to TIVA is to use a single syringe&#xD;
      pump containing propofol and remifentanil. This approach is considered off-label as neither&#xD;
      drug has been approved by a national or international regulatory agency to be used in a&#xD;
      single syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and safety of single syringe TIVA has not yet been evaluated. At a single&#xD;
      university hospital center, single syringe TIVA with propofol and remifentanil has been used&#xD;
      for over 15 years for a variety of procedures. A common combination of propofol and&#xD;
      remifentanil in a single syringe is propofol 10 mg/ml and remifentanil 20 mcg/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A preliminary retrospective analysis of electronic medical records (Epic Hyperspace&#xD;
      Electronic Medical Record, Epic Systems Corporation, Verona, Wisconsin) from May of 2014 to&#xD;
      June of 2019 identified 21,985 procedures using single syringe TIVA. (unpublished data) This&#xD;
      retrospective analysis, was used to identify adverse events, which included: awareness during&#xD;
      surgery, significant vasopressor use, replacement of the single syringe TIVA with an inhaled&#xD;
      anesthetic, and patient injury or death. This analysis was limited by possible clinician&#xD;
      underreporting of vasopressor use, changes in TIVA infusion rates, and awareness events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of single syringe TIVA with propofol and remifentanil. The primary outcome for efficacy was a&#xD;
      processed EEG (pEEG) index within the recommended range for general anesthesia for the&#xD;
      duration of the maintenance anesthetic. The primary outcome measure for safety was&#xD;
      intraoperative administration of vasopressors. We hypothesized that the pEEG index would be&#xD;
      within the recommended range for over 90% of the duration of the maintenance anesthetic. We&#xD;
      hypothesized that vasopressor use would be consistent with other anesthetic types using&#xD;
      potent inhaled agents.&#xD;
