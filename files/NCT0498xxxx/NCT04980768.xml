    <textblock>
      There is lack of evidence on resolution of signs of systemic inflammatory markers by&#xD;
      successful elimination of periapical inflammation by endodontic treatment. Complete blood&#xD;
      count (CBC) may have potential to detect various inflammatory conditions but its use for this&#xD;
      purpose is sparsely reported. To the best of our knowledge effect of chronic apical&#xD;
      periodontitis on various parameters of complete blood count has not been studied.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prevalence of Apical periodontitis (AP) is reported in the range of 17% to 65% with higher&#xD;
      prevalence reported in older patients. Infection of the pulp tissue of the affected tooth is&#xD;
      the principal cause of apical periodontitis and it is characterised by inflammation of the&#xD;
      periradicular tissues. Presentation of AP varies from classical signs of inflammation (pain,&#xD;
      swelling, loss of function) to being completely asymptomatic with only signs of apical bone&#xD;
      resorption on the radiograph. Histological changes seen in AP is localized infiltration of&#xD;
      inflammatory cells and bone resorptions. AP can be treated by root canal treatment (RCT)&#xD;
      which comprises elimination of microbes and their toxic products followed by filling of the&#xD;
      root canal by an inert material. It also acts to limit the spread of microbial infection seen&#xD;
      in AP to jaw and the other parts of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apical periodontics if left untreated can cause serious complications. Infection and loss of&#xD;
      function caused by loss of teeth may jeopardize overall health of the patients. Chronic&#xD;
      infection like untreated AP may also influence development and progression of other serious&#xD;
      conditions. Numerous inflammatory mediators are responsible for eliciting inflammatory&#xD;
      reactions seen in AP for example both IL-1beta and TNF-alpha are found in periapical lesions&#xD;
      and IL-1beta is suggested to cause greater bone resorption in patients of AP. Role of these&#xD;
      mediators in AP is to cause vasodilation, increased vascular permeability and recruit other&#xD;
      inflammatory cells. It is also been suggested that increased inflammatory mediators seen in&#xD;
      AP may also enhance the systemic inflammation. Inflammation induced tissue damage may vary in&#xD;
      different disease, however the markers that trigger this damage are very similar. They all&#xD;
      act to increase the rate of the inflammatory process, cause tissue destruction and may even&#xD;
      be involved in development of clinical symptoms. For example, markers like hsCRP is&#xD;
      associated with various steps of atherogenesis and is also found elevated in AP. Studies have&#xD;
      reported significantly higher levels of endothelial dysfunction in patients of apical&#xD;
      periodontitis which were found to reduce to normal level following root canal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent systematic review has found significant difference in levels of CRP and IL-6 in AP&#xD;
      subjects than control. IL-6 plays role in initiation of autoimmune disease and chronic&#xD;
      inflammation and also contributes in low grade systemic inflammation. The same systematic&#xD;
      review and meta-analysis has found only eight interventional study that studied effect on&#xD;
      inflammatory marker before and after treatment. The data from these studies were also&#xD;
      heterogenous with wide variety of treatment reported. Only two studies are available which&#xD;
      has evaluated effect of endodontic treatment on levels of isolated groups of inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators and stress markers like reactive oxygen species and circulatory immune complex.&#xD;
      TNF- α is indicated to be responsible for adverse pregnancy outcome and along with CRP may&#xD;
      enhance the insulin resistance. Similarly, complete hemogram indices like mean platelet&#xD;
      volume, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio is altered in chronic inflammatory conditions and their&#xD;
      estimation could be useful in evaluating overall systemic inflammatory burden of patients of&#xD;
      AP. To the best of our knowledge no study so far has evaluated effect of non-surgical root&#xD;
      canal treatment on the levels of hsCRP and complete hemogram parameters. Therefore, this&#xD;
      study proposes to compare these markers in patients of AP and healthy control and also before&#xD;
      and two years after root canal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and Dental Examination Prior to treatment a detailed medical and dental history will&#xD;
      be recorded. Oral clinical examinations will include hard and soft tissue evaluation. Pulp&#xD;
      sensibility test will be carried out along with percussion and palpation of the affected&#xD;
      tooth. The periapical radiographic examinations will be carried out at standard exposure&#xD;
      parameters to detect apical bone resorption. Periodontal clinical parameters will be&#xD;
      evaluated at 6 sites in all teeth, including probing depths (PDs), the clinical attachment&#xD;
      level, and bleeding on probing at the base of the crevice, excluding third molars. The&#xD;
      periodontal assessment will be made with a manual periodontal probe (UNC 15; Hu-Friedy,&#xD;
      Chicago, IL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Samples and Laboratory Analysis Fasting blood samples will be obtained by venipuncture&#xD;
      of the ante-cubital vein. Blood sample will be submitted to the clinical laboratory of the&#xD;
      Department of Biochemistry PGIMS and Department of Oral Pathology, PGIDS, Rohtak, Haryana for&#xD;
      the quantitative analysis of hs-CRP and complete hemogram analysis respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique for ELISA: Whole blood sample will be kept at 4°C overnight and centrifuged for 15&#xD;
      minutes at approximately 6000 rpm. Serum will be separated and stored in aliquots at -80 °C&#xD;
      in the until use. Serum hsCRP assay kit will be used. ELISA is a sandwich enzyme immunoassay.&#xD;
      A monoclonal antibody specific for these markers will be pre- coated on the microplate.&#xD;
      Standard and sample will be pipetted into wells and any marker present will be bound by&#xD;
      immobilized antibody. After washing away any unbound substances, enzyme- linked polyclonal&#xD;
      antibody specific for hs-CRP will be added to the wells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an incubation period amplifier solution will be added to the wells, and the color will&#xD;
      develop in proportion to the amount of hsCRP bound in the initial stage. The intensity of the&#xD;
      color will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Root Canal treatment Access opening will be done after rubber dam isolation and&#xD;
      administration of local anesthesia. debridement of the pulp chamber will be done and all&#xD;
      canal orifices will be identified. Negotiation of canals will be done. Working length will be&#xD;
      determined using root ZX apex locator and will be verified radiographically. Coronal&#xD;
      enlargement will be done using Gates- Glidden drills. The apical third of the root canal will&#xD;
      be instrumented up to size 35 for mesial and up to size 45 for distal canals. Finally, root&#xD;
      canals will be further instrumented with step-back technique enlargement in 1 mm increments&#xD;
      to 3 sizes larger than the master apical file. Irrigation will be carried out using 5 mL of a&#xD;
      5% NaOCl solution between files. After preparation, the root canals will be irrigated with 5&#xD;
      mL 17% EDTA for 3 minutes to remove smear layer, followed by 5 mL 5% NaOCl. The final&#xD;
      irrigation will be done with 5 mL distilled water. The root canals will be dried using paper&#xD;
      points and filled with laterally condensed gutta-percha (Dentsply Maillefer) and Zinc oxide&#xD;
      Eugenol based sealer mixed according to manufacturers' instructions. Gutta- percha will be&#xD;
      cut with a heated instrument and vertically condensed right at the orifice opening of the&#xD;
      canals. Final composite resin restoration will be done following manufacturer instruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Follow up and clinical and radiographic examination will be carried out at six&#xD;
      months. Re-assessment of hs-CRP and complete hemogram indices will also be done of all&#xD;
      patients at 6 months&#xD;
