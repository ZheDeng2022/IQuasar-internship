      676 / 5000 Résultats de traduction Partial or total edentulousness has a significant impact&#xD;
      on quality of life both functionally and aesthetically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TBR® Tissue Level Z1 Implants allow the patient to prevent bone resorption and maintain&#xD;
      facial tissue and musculature support. At the functional level, the patient who benefits from&#xD;
      implant treatment regains normal masticatory function with all the benefits on the quality of&#xD;
      life that this can bring him.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the osseointegration of the implant and the biocompatibility of the materials used,&#xD;
      the implant treatment remains effective in the long term and makes it possible to maintain&#xD;
      the aesthetics of the smile.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many adults have one or more missing teeth. The negative consequences of partial or total&#xD;
      edentulousness are numerous in the orofacial sphere:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Edentulousness causes a strong aesthetic deficit due to the lack of support of facial&#xD;
           tissues and musculature;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Edentulousness generates a functional deficit that can have significant repercussions on&#xD;
           the nutritional status of the affected subject;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Edentulousness is accompanied by bone resorption of the jawbones which is inevitable in&#xD;
           the absence of implant treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition, the resulting feelings of discomfort and fragility are experienced as a&#xD;
           real psychological handicap by the patient, partially or totally edentulous, which can&#xD;
           then have significant repercussions on his social life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TBR® Tissue Level Z1 implants are intended for placement in the maxillary or mandibular arch&#xD;
      in partially or completely edentulous patients for prosthetic restoration in the following&#xD;
      cases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single edentulousness,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intercalary edentulousness,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Terminal edentulousness,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total edentulousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following clinical conditions must be observed before placing a dental implant:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sufficient quality and volume of bone support;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy oral condition;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of contraindications for the placement of an implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure used to accomplish its intended use is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The receiving implant site is prepared using an established drilling sequence then the&#xD;
           implant is placed in this site: the body of the implant (in titanium) has an endosseous&#xD;
           position while the ring (in ceramic) remains transgingival;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After an osseointegration time, the final prosthetic abutment will load the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected benefits of this surgery are to improve the quality of life of patients, to&#xD;
      recover the chewing function and the aesthetics of the smile.&#xD;

    <description>The procedure used to accomplish its intended use is as follows :&#xD;
The recipient implant site is prepared using a drilling sequence, then the implant is placed at the crestal level After a period of osseointegration of the implant, a transgingival healing screw is placed to allow the healing of soft tissues. After this healing phase, the final prosthesis will be loaded on the implant.</description>
