  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to obtain suitable exercise intervention model for children and adolescents with&#xD;
      obese or metabolic syndrome in China, we conduct a RCT to examine the effects of different&#xD;
      intensity exercise intervention on weight, and other cardiometabolic risk factors among&#xD;
      children and adolescents, we also test the effects of exercise interventions on multi-omics&#xD;
      such as metabolomics, gut microbiome, genetics, and explore the potential mechanisms by which&#xD;
      exercise interventions modulate cardiometabolic risk. This is a randomized controlled study.&#xD;
      Children and adolescents with obesity or metabolic syndrome were randomly divided into three&#xD;
      groups, including low intensity exercise training group, moderate and intermittent high&#xD;
      intensity exercise training group. The investigators will obtain organ hydrodynamics indexes&#xD;
      by abdominal ultrasound and computational fluid dynamics technology, and obtain the metabolic&#xD;
      regulation mechanism of the body in response to exercise through the detection of metabolism&#xD;
      related small molecules in blood and urine and the analysis of intestinal flora, so as to&#xD;
      explore the potential value and mechanism of different exercise modes in the treatment of&#xD;
      obesity and metabolic syndrome. At the same time, the behavior and self-consciousness of&#xD;
      children and adolescents will be investigated to obtain the suitable exercise intervention&#xD;
      model for Chinese children and adolescents with obesity and metabolic syndrome. In&#xD;
      conclusion, this study aims to demonstrate which exercise mode can alleviate obesity or&#xD;
      reverse metabolic diseases, analyze which factors can sense exercise, and explore the&#xD;
      potential mechanisms through mutil-omic approach, so as to improve metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
