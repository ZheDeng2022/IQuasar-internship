      This study is the first to quantify the level of NF-kB translocation in lymphocyte&#xD;
      populations in children and adolescents with psoriasis of varying severity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a diagnostic study aimed at finding immunological predictors of the effectiveness of&#xD;
      therapy in children and adolescents with psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included 90 patients from 1 to 18 years old with psoriasis vulgaris, mild /&#xD;
      moderate and severe. The comparison group consisted of 30 healthy children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study took into account the PASI (Psoriasis Area Severity Index); the BSA (Body Surface&#xD;
      Area); including patient age; duration of the disease; type of therapy; duration of therapy.&#xD;
      Depending on the type of therapy, all psoriatic children were divided into 3 groups: Group 1&#xD;
      (n = 24) - patients receiving basic and external therapy; Group 2 (n = 20) - patients&#xD;
      receiving systemic therapy with methotrexate; and Group 3 (n = 46) - patients receiving&#xD;
      therapy with genetically engineered biological drugs (Adalimumab, Etanercept, Ustekinumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the NF-κB translocation level in lymphocytes was performed by flow cytometry&#xD;
      with imaging (Image Stream Mark II - AMNIS) using the Amnis NF-κB Translocation Kit.&#xD;
