    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the dose escalation (phase 1) part of the study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of the antibody drug conjugate&#xD;
      (ADC) REGN5093-M114 in order to determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or define the&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of REGN5093-M114 in patients with mesenchymal epithelial&#xD;
      transition factor (MET) overexpressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the dose expansion (phase 2) part of the study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess preliminary anti-tumor activity of REGN5093-M114 in MET-overexpressed NSCLC as&#xD;
      measured by the objective response rate (ORR)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the dose escalation (phase 1) part of the study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess preliminary anti-tumor activity of REGN5093-M114 as measured by the ORR&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the dose expansion (phase 2) part of the study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess the safety, tolerability profile, and PK of REGN5093-M114 ADC and total antibody&#xD;
      in each expansion cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of both phases of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate other measures of preliminary anti-tumor activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess immunogenicity to REGN5093-M114&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically confirmed NSCLC that is at advanced stage for which there are no&#xD;
             approved therapies available expected to confer clinical benefit as defined in the&#xD;
             protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Willing to provide tumor tissue from newly obtained biopsy from tumor site. Newly&#xD;
             obtained biopsies at tissue screening are required. An archival sample can be accepted&#xD;
             only after discussion with the medical monitor and if the sample is not more than 6&#xD;
             months old and obtained after completion of the last therapy. The enrollment of&#xD;
             patients will be based on an immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based assay using freshly&#xD;
             obtained tumor biopsies or an archival biopsy as described above. Only patients with&#xD;
             MET overexpressing tumors by central IHC analysis will be enrolled. For expansion&#xD;
             cohorts only: tumor site for biopsy must not have been irradiated previously and must&#xD;
             not be the only measurable lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Tumor must overexpress MET protein as defined in the protocol by central IHC analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. For expansion only: At least one lesion that is measurable by RECIST 1.1. Tumor&#xD;
             lesions in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has&#xD;
             been demonstrated in such lesions after radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Adequate organ and bone marrow function as defined in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has received treatment with an approved systemic therapy or has participated in any&#xD;
             study of an investigational agent or investigational device within 2 weeks or 5&#xD;
             half-lives of the prior treatment, whichever is shorter with a minimum of 7 days from&#xD;
             the first dose of study therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has not yet recovered (ie, grade ≤1 or baseline) from any acute toxicities resulting&#xD;
             from prior therapy except as described in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has received radiation therapy or major surgery within 14 days of first administration&#xD;
             of study drug or has not recovered from adverse events as defined in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Another malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment except as noted in&#xD;
             the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Untreated or active primary brain tumor, central nervous system (CNS) metastases,&#xD;
             leptomeningeal disease, or spinal cord compression as defined in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Encephalitis, meningitis, organic brain disease (eg Parkinson's disease) or&#xD;
             uncontrolled seizures in the year prior to first dose of study therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Uncontrolled infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or&#xD;
             hepatitis C infection; or diagnosis of immunodeficiency as defined in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
