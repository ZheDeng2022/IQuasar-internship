  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase Ib is a dose De-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK) and preliminary antitumor activity of GT90001 in combination with KN046 in subjects with&#xD;
      advanced or refractory hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), gastric carcinoma (GC) and&#xD;
      gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma, urothelial carcinoma (UC) and esophageal&#xD;
      square cell carcinoma (ESCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II is to investigate anti-tumor efficacy of GT90001 in combination with KN046 at RP2D&#xD;
      in subjects with specific types of tumors. A Simon two-stage design is planned for each&#xD;
      indication in order to minimize the number of treated participants if there is minimal&#xD;
      efficacy activity in that indication.&#xD;

             confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Phase Ib: subjects with advanced HCC, GC or GEJ adenocarcinoma, Urothelial&#xD;
                  transitional cell Carcinoma and Esophagus Carcinoma who have progressed despite&#xD;
                  standard therapies, are intolerant of standard therapy, or for whom no standard&#xD;
                  therapy exists;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Phase II: subjects with tumor of specific types:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cohort# Indication Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. HCC, 2L Unresectable histologic confirmed primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Subjects&#xD;
             with radiological diagnosis may also be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Documented radiographic or clinical disease progression during or after 1st line&#xD;
             therapy, including Sorafenib, Lenvatinib and Atezolizumab plus Bevacizumab and other&#xD;
             1st line standard care per local clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patient has a Child-Pugh score of 5 or 6 points and no encephalopathy and/or&#xD;
             clinically apparent ascites. (Note: Child-Pugh score should be evaluated within 7 days&#xD;
             of first dose of study drug)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. GC or GEJ adenocarcinoma, 3L Unresectable locally advanced or metastatic GC or GEJ&#xD;
             carcinoma and have histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
             At least 50% subjects with PD-L1 expression (CPS) on ≥ 1% will be enrolled in this&#xD;
             cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Has experienced documented objective radiographic or clinical disease progression&#xD;
             during or after standard first line Platinum- and fluoropyrimidine-based two or three&#xD;
             cytotoxic drug chemotherapy and second line NCCN recommended treatment regimen therapy&#xD;
             or other 1st and 2nd line standard care per local clinical practice. (Note: subjects&#xD;
             with discontinuation due to AEs prior to disease progression are not considered as&#xD;
             treatment failure unless disease progression is confirmed by documentation.) Disease&#xD;
             progression during or within 6 months following the last dose of adjuvant or&#xD;
             neo-adjuvant therapy will be considered as 1st line failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. UC, 2L Histologically or cytologically confirmed urothelial carcinoma of the renal&#xD;
             pelvis, ureter, bladder, or urethra that showed predominantly transitional-cell&#xD;
             features Has experienced documented progression or recurrence after at least the 1st&#xD;
             line platinum-based chemotherapy or recurrence within 12 months after the receipt of&#xD;
             platinum-based adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy for localized muscle-invasive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Primary chemoradiation for unresectable muscle-invasive bladder cancer with the aim&#xD;
        of bladder preservation will not be considered a prior line of systemic therapy for the&#xD;
        purposes of determining study eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4 ESCC 2L Histologically confirmed, unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The primary tumor must originate in the esophagus. Tumors that involve the GE junction must&#xD;
        meet Sievert Type 1 criteria, 1-5 cm above the EGJ. For the purposes of this protocol, this&#xD;
        will be interpreted as: greater than 50% of the tumor must be above the GE junction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have received at least one prior therapy for unresectable disease. Patients&#xD;
        with recurrence within 6 months of completion of neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy may be&#xD;
        considered as having received one prior therapy for unresectable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patient must have at least one measurable lesion by CT or MRI per RECIST 1.1. Tumor&#xD;
        lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression&#xD;
        has been demonstrated in such lesions. Loco-regional treated lesion cannot be selected as a&#xD;
        target lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1. 7. Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks. 8. At screening,&#xD;
        patients in Phase II part must agree to provide archival tumor tissue, if available, for&#xD;
        biomarker testing. When archival tissue is not available, it is optional for patients to&#xD;
        undergo fresh biopsy judged medically safe by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Archival tumor tissue can be formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue block&#xD;
             (preferably collected within 12 months before the first dose) or at least 5 freshly&#xD;
             sectioned unstained slides. Tissue block is preferred over unstained slides.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Acceptable tissue sample include core needle punctured, resected or incisional biopsy,&#xD;
             or surgical sample. (Note: Fine needle aspirational cytology (FNAC) sample is not&#xD;
             acceptable. Tumor tissue from bone metastases is not evaluable for determination of&#xD;
             PD-L1 expression and is therefore also not acceptable.) 9. Any toxic effects of prior&#xD;
             anti-cancer therapy or surgical procedures resolved to baseline severity or NCI-CTCAE&#xD;
             version 5 Grade ≤ 1 (except alopecia or other toxicities not considered a safety risk&#xD;
             for the patient at investigator's discretion).&#xD;

             (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within&#xD;
             14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal&#xD;
             replacement doses ≤ 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of&#xD;
             active autoimmune disease. A brief course of corticosteroids for the prophylaxis&#xD;
             (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g.,&#xD;
             delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
             10. Subjects with history of life-threatening toxicity related to prior immune therapy&#xD;
             (e.g., anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment) except those that are unlikely to re-occur with&#xD;
             standard countermeasures (e.g., Hormone replacement after adrenal crisis); 11. Only&#xD;
             patients in Phase II (except cohort 1, HCC): Prior treatment with an anti-PD-1,&#xD;
             anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4, anti-CD137, anti-TIM-3, anti-LAG-3 antibody, or&#xD;
             any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co stimulation or checkpoint&#xD;
             pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
             12. Administration of a live or attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to initiation&#xD;
             of study treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Allergies and Adverse Drug Reaction 13. History of allergy or hypersensitivity, or any&#xD;
             contraindications to study drug components.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Other Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             14. Patients with a known history of alcoholism or drug abuse. 15. Female patients who&#xD;
             are pregnant or breast-feeding. 16. Patients with a history of mental illness, or who&#xD;
             are incapacitated or have limited capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             17. Other conditions that, in the investigators' opinion, would make patients&#xD;
             inappropriate to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             18. Patients who are anticipating in other clinical studies or the planned first dose&#xD;
             of study treatment is less than 4 weeks after the last dose of treatment in previous&#xD;
             clinical study.&#xD;
