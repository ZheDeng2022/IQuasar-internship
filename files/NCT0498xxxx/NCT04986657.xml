  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institution, prospective study of the whole genome sequencing assay,&#xD;
      ChromoSeq. Using prospectively collected patient data, coupled with physician surveys, the&#xD;
      investigators seek to determine the feasibility of implementing ChromoSeq in addition to&#xD;
      standard genomic testing, for patients with the diagnoses of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).&#xD;

    <measure>Sensitivity of ChromoSeq as measured by total number of recurrent structural variants identified</measure>
    <time_frame>Through completion of all ChromoSeq tests (estimated to be 15 months)</time_frame>
    <description>As compared to conventional cytogenetics in a real-time clinical setting&#xD;
The total number of recurrent structural variants will be measured in each sample by ChromoSeq and metaphase cytogenetics yielding a pair of measurements. Each measurement will also be dichotomized into the presence or absence of at least one recurrent structural variant. The hypothesis of no difference in the number of variants detected by each method will be analyzed by a paired-sample t-test. However, if it is determined that the assumptions of a t-test are not tenable then a paired-sample sign test will be used instead. McNemar's test will be used to compare whether or not at least one recurrent structural variant identified is by each method.</description>

    <time_frame>Through completion of follow-up for all patients (estimated to be 63 months)</time_frame>
    <description>As compared to metaphase cytogenetics&#xD;
The relationship of risk-stratification defined by either ChromoSeq or conventional cytogenetics to clinical outcome will be illustrated with Kaplan-Meier survival analyses on overall survival for both ChromoSeq and metaphase cytogenetics. The predictive accuracy of the two methods will be tested by comparing the area under the ROC curves using the method of DeLong et al.</description>

    <description>As compared to conventional genomic profiling (cytogenetics, FISH, and next-generation sequencing) that is used for clinical management (such as risk-stratification or institution of targeted gene therapy)&#xD;
Items in the ChromoSeq Implementation Physician Survey will be used to describe physician evaluation of ChromoSeq with conventional genomic profiling with regard to clinical management. Responses to these items will be presented in frequency tables. For statistical analysis, the values of each item will be recoded from 1-5 to -2 to +2 and one-sample t-tests used to test the null hypothesis that the mean value is 0 (neither agree nor disagree.) In addition, case-reports will be reviewed for qualitative evaluations of physician experience with the two methods.</description>

    <time_frame>Through completion of all ChromoSeq tests (estimated to be 15 months)</time_frame>
    <description>As compared to failed standard of care genomic profiling assays&#xD;
Each assay will be categorized as successful or failed and a two-way table constructed displaying ChromoSeq assay status by standard assay status. A Pearson chi-square test will be calculated to test the null hypothesis that assay success is independent of type of assay.</description>

For each case, the corresponding treating physician will be asked to answer a case-based ChromoSeq Implementation Physician Survey. In order to prospectively investigate how the ChromoSeq data was used or could be used by the treating physician for each case, and to evaluate perceptions in real time, the physician will be asked to complete the survey within 1 month of the ChromoSeq and completed conventional genomic profiling results being returned to the chart, whichever is later.</description>
