  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Being the most important stakeholder of such a vulnerable population, the neuro&#xD;
      physiotherapist faced a lot of difficulties while consulting and assessing patients with&#xD;
      neurological impairments. Up to our knowledge and search history, this is the first-ever&#xD;
      study conducted by us which list out the challenges faced by neuro physiotherapist while&#xD;
      teleconsultation mode among Indian population.&#xD;

      During the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic many Neurophysiotherapist opted for telerehabilitation&#xD;
      to provide rehabilitation to the patients. This study aims to find out challenges faced by&#xD;
      Neurophysiotherapist (NeuroPT) for consultation through telerehabilitation within Maharashtra&#xD;
      provenance. A total of 103 NeuroPT within Maharashtra provenance were contacted through this&#xD;
      online survey. A brief, structured and validated questionnaire was constructed as there is no&#xD;
      gold standard questionnaire developed to obtain responses from the neuro physiotherapists&#xD;
      opting for telerehabilitation mode for their consultations with their clients. The&#xD;
      questionnaire was sent by What's app and email to gather basic information to describe the&#xD;
      various challenges in consultation through telerehabilitation.&#xD;
