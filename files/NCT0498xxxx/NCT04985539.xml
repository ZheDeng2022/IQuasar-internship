      Currently, the Movement Disorders Society (MDS)-UPDRS scale remains the gold standard to&#xD;
      document the outcomes in clinical trials for Parkinson's disease (PD). The MDS-UPDRS is far&#xD;
      from infallible, as it is based on subjective scoring (using a rather crude ordinal score),&#xD;
      while execution of the tests depends on clinical experience. Not surprisingly, the scale is&#xD;
      subject to both significant intra- and inter-rater variability that are sufficiently large to&#xD;
      mask an underlying true difference between an effective intervention and placebo. Digital&#xD;
      biomarkers may be able to overcome the limitations of the MDS-UPDRS, as they continuously&#xD;
      collects real-time data, during the patient's day to day activities. In this study the&#xD;
      investigators are interested in developing algorithms to track progression of bradykinesia,&#xD;
      gait impairment, postural sway, tremor, physical activity, sleep quality, and autonomic&#xD;
      dysfunction (the latter being derived from e.g. skin conductance and changes in heart rate&#xD;
      variability).&#xD;

      This PPP de NOVO cohort aims to validate novel digital biomarkers for disease progression,&#xD;
      fostering the unique research infrastructure and data collection protocol that are available.&#xD;
      The PPP de NOVO cohort consists of patients with de novo (i.e., newly diagnosed and&#xD;
      previously untreated) Parkinson's disease who will be followed longitudinally for two years.&#xD;
      De novo patients create the opportunity to study disease progression without interference of&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment. The observation of this natural process in the earliest course of&#xD;
      the disease is highly relevant for the development disease modifying interventions, which are&#xD;
      likely to have the biggest potential in the earliest phases of the disease, when the loss of&#xD;
      substantia nigra cells is minimal. In particular, the investigators will deploy the PPP de&#xD;
      NOVO cohort for the development of digital biomarkers that could serve as a surrogate or,&#xD;
      with time, possibly as key secondary or even a primary outcome in future clinical trials of&#xD;
      disease-modifying interventions. Digital biomarkers hold great promise in this regard, as&#xD;
      they provide a means to objectively track patients and measure their function in their own&#xD;
      living environment, unobtrusively, and over long periods of time. The outcomes are&#xD;
      potentially more sensitive than currently available clinical scales, which also be included&#xD;
      in the protocol and perhaps also more relevant as they provide an insight into daily life&#xD;
      functioning over extended periods of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to develop novel digital biomarkers that allow for measurement of&#xD;
      disease progression in de novo PD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that digital progression biomarkers will have greater sensitivity and&#xD;
      greater power for detecting disease progression than conventional scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to test the feasibility of the Proof-Of-Concept (POC) study&#xD;
      protocol that UCB Pharma will use for their potentially disease modifying treatment. The PPP&#xD;
      de NOVO study is considered instrumental in optimizing planning, data acquisition, analysis&#xD;
      and interpretation of the digital data collected in the POC study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third objective of this study is to create an extensive longitudinal dataset describing&#xD;
      the clinical and functional characteristics of a representative PD de novo cohort to allow&#xD;
      researchers to investigate important unanswered questions in PD.&#xD;
