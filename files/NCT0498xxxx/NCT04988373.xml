  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      36 participants who have mild crowding from the Orthodontic Department at University of&#xD;
      Damascus Dental School will be randomly assigned into two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In the experimental group, patients will be treated using single aligner appliance in&#xD;
           order to align their crowding teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control group will undergo typical orthodontic treatment using an MBT-prescription of&#xD;
           metallic brackets.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most adult patients do not prefer traditional fixed appliances for aesthetic reasons, long&#xD;
      treatment duration, and relatively difficult oral care. The current study came in order to&#xD;
      evaluate the Efficiency of a new single aligner appliance that is both aesthetic and&#xD;
      economical.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Little's Index of Irregularity</measure>
    <time_frame>T0: immediately before the start of orthodontic treatment; T1: after one month; T2: after two months; T3: after three months; T4: after four months; T5: at the end of the alignment stage (which is expected to occur within 4 to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The irregularity of the lower incisors is calculated by measuring the amount of deviations of the anatomic contact points between the six anterior teeth in the horizontal direction in mm, since the sum of these measurements represents the value of the index (Little, 1975). When the sum of these deviations is less than 3 mm, this indicates that the teeth are slightly crowded. When the sum is greater than 10 mm, this indicated very severe crowding.&#xD;
The ordinary orthodontic treatment aims to keep this Index less than 1 mm at the end of treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change in Lower Incisors Inclination</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately before the start of orthodontic treatment; T1: at the end of the alignment stage which is expected to happen within 4 to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The angle between the long axis of the lower Incisors and the mandible plane (Go-Me) will be measured using Cephalometric x ray.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the perception of self-reported pain</measure>
    <time_frame>: T0: immediately before the start of orthodontic treatment; T1: after one month; T2: after two months; T3: after three months; T4: after four months; T5: at the end of the alignment stage (which is expected to occur within 4 to 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>At each adjustment visit, patients in both groups will be given a prepared Self-reported pain questionnaire to complete over the following week and to be returned at each subsequent visit. This questionnaire records pain by means of a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS). The left end of the line refers to no pain (VAS=0) where the right end refers to maximum pain (VAS=100). The level of pain is represented in the number of millimeters measured from the left end of the line to the mark pointed out by the patient. This is called the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) where the higher the number is the more intense the pain.</description>
