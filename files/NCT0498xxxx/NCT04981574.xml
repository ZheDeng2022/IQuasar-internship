      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the effectiveness of thoracic thrust manipulation, together with massages&#xD;
      techniques and stretching, between people with neck pain versus people with low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be performed from August 2021 to October 2021 at the University of Alcala&#xD;
      de Henares. (Madrid)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of forty-six (46) volunteers will participate in this research, and they will be&#xD;
      divided in two groups of twenty-three (23). One group will be formed by candidates suffering&#xD;
      from neck pain (group A) and the other one by candidate with low back pain (group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will receive the same treatment and specific stretching exercises as applicable&#xD;
      in accordance to the pain area, e.g.: group A will get the massage and the stretching&#xD;
      exercises more suitable for the neck pain and group B the same but for the low back pain.&#xD;
      Nevertheless both groups will receive the same technical thrust manipulation in thoracic&#xD;
      area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these treatments will be applied of the volunteers at the University of Alcalá.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment includes the following activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Twenty (20) minutes massage in the pain area, as applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Technical thrust manipulation in thoracic area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ten (10) minutes stretching in accordance to the pain area treated. The stretching shall&#xD;
           be repeated twice a week by each volunteer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of six (6) sessions will be carried out during six (6) weeks, one session per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain, disability, kinesiophobia, HRQoL will be assessed as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Before first session. (In this evaluation will be also analyzed demographic variables&#xD;
           i.e.: height, weight, age, gender, academic level, smoker/no smoker)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Between third and fourth session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. After sixth session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Four weeks after sixth session.&#xD;

    <description>Twenty (20) minutes massage in the neck area. The volunteer will be in prone position during the massage.&#xD;
Technical thrust manipulation in thoracic area. For this technique the volunteer will be in supine position with their arms folded on the chest (making a &quot;V&quot;). The therapist will locate one hand on the spinous processes to be treated, and the other one on the arms of the patient to make easier the manipulation.&#xD;
Ten (10) minutes specific stretching for the neck area. These stretching exercises shall be repeated twice a week by each volunteer. Stretching will be made on the trapezius superior, musculus levator scapulae and sternocleidomastoideus holding the position thirty (30) seconds. Each muscle stretch shall be repeated three times.</description>
