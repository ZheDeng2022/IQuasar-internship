  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral pain is a common disease, and it often couples with patellar malalignment.&#xD;
      Previously, imbalance of the different quadriceps muscle heads was believed to be a causative&#xD;
      factor of patellar malignment. However, findings from electromyography studies on quadriceps&#xD;
      activities and patellar alignment in the last two decades were inconsistent. In order to&#xD;
      better understand the relationship between quadriceps muscle imbalance and patellar&#xD;
      malalignment, shear wave elastography (SWE), which can measure the passive and active muscle&#xD;
      stiffness, may shed some new lights to this area. This study aims to examine whether the&#xD;
      quadriceps muscle stiffness can predict the patellar position. The healthy young adult will&#xD;
      be recruited in this study. Active and passive quadriceps muscle stiffness will be measured&#xD;
      with the SWE in different conditions and the result will be correlated with the patellar&#xD;
      position measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Also, electromyography (EMG)&#xD;
      activity will be measured during the active stiffness measurement so as to establish the&#xD;
      level of agreement between the EMG and SWE data. Linear regression will be used to calculate&#xD;
      the relationship between different factors. The total number of subjects needed will be 55 by&#xD;
      setting an effect size of 0.15 with two predictors, 80% power, and Î± at 0.05 in the linear&#xD;
      regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will be conducted at PolyU campus and an MRI clinic in Hong Kong. Hopefully, it&#xD;
      could be started in July 2021 and will last for 1 year.&#xD;
