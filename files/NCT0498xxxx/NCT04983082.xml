      An integrated database of depersonalised routine hospital patient data consisting of&#xD;
      demographic and disease attributes, physiological or laboratory measurements, care contacts&#xD;
      and interventions along with associated clinical outcomes. The database is an essential&#xD;
      resource for the development and testing of risk models and classification systems, modified&#xD;
      as necessary for patient subgroups, which can then be introduced into clinical care to&#xD;
      improve patient outcomes. It can also be used for large scale simulations to evaluate&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;

      The aims and objectives of this database of depersonalised routinely collected hospital&#xD;
      patient data are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct epidemiological and observational studies of acute hospital care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop and use algorithms and risk models to identify the deteriorating / sick adult so&#xD;
           that interventions and enhanced care can be provided in a timelier manner with&#xD;
           consequent resource and outcome improvements. This covers both the deteriorating&#xD;
           inpatient at risk of adverse outcomes and people in the local community at risk of&#xD;
           hospitalisation or in need of other health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retrospectively evaluate interventions e.g. impact of system-wide clinical pathway&#xD;
           introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct simulations of clinical pathways&#xD;

        The research database will hold data on adults who are treated by Portsmouth Hospitals&#xD;
        University National Health Service Trust (PHU), either as an outpatient, Accident and&#xD;
        Emergency (A&amp;E) attender, day case or inpatient or have investigations carried out by PHU&#xD;
        services Adult patients are defined by the National Health Service (NHS) as individuals&#xD;
        over 16 years old. Data on service contacts and use will only be included where the patient&#xD;
        was more than 16 years old at that time. None of the data included in the Clinical Outcomes&#xD;
        analyses are collected specifically for the purposes of research. All datasets are&#xD;
        routinely collected clinical datasets, collected for clinical use and clinical audit.&#xD;
