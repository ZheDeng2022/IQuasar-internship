  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is the most severe of the systemic autoimmune diseases. It is&#xD;
      characterized by skin and organ fibrosis (mainly interstitial lung disease, which affects&#xD;
      40-50% of patients), as well as severe vascular complications such as pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
      (5-10%), renal crisis (2%), and digital gangrene (5%). There are currently no validated&#xD;
      prognostic biomarkers for the progression of SSc, yet it is crucial to better predict the&#xD;
      progression of SSc to optimize patient management, but also to identify the optimal&#xD;
      population for clinical trials (&quot;progressor&quot; patients). Furthermore, there are no validated&#xD;
      biomarkers of response to immunosuppressive therapies that would be useful both in patient&#xD;
      management and in the evaluation of new treatments in clinical trials. The internal medicine&#xD;
      department of the Lille University Hospital is a national and European reference center for&#xD;
      the management of patients with SSc. Nearly 500 patients are followed annually in the&#xD;
      internal medicine department. As part of their routine care, patients are hospitalized in&#xD;
      average once a year in the internal medicine department of the Lille University Hospital for&#xD;
      a complete assessment of their SSc. This assessment includes a detailed medical observation,&#xD;
      complementary examinations and blood and urine biology tests. The purpose of this study would&#xD;
      be to collect 2 additional blood samples during the standard evaluation of scleroderma&#xD;
      patients. The main objective of this collection of biological samples for scientific research&#xD;
      will be the identification of new biomarkers associated with prognosis and treatment response&#xD;
      to improve the management of SSc patients.&#xD;
