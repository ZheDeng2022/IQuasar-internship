      The aim of the project is to study of the influence of Lettuce crop enriched with Molibdenum&#xD;
      on hematological parameter. Secondary outcome to find out Molibdenum presence in urine in&#xD;
      order to evaluate vegetables, like little crop, as Molibdenum biocarrier.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      everal human pathologies are caused by deficiencies of some mineral elements. These&#xD;
      deficiencies can be overcome through careful dietary diversification and mineral&#xD;
      supplementation. An alternative or even complementary way is represented by the intake of&#xD;
      bio-fortified foods. In the field of mineral deficiency increasing the bioavailable mineral&#xD;
      concentration in vegetables intended for human consumption; can be a useful tool to prevent&#xD;
      many harmful pathologies. Therefore, in this scenario, it appears very important to identify&#xD;
      the right dosages and the most effective methods of administration to bio-fortify vegetables&#xD;
      with a strong nutritional-health connotation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project aim to investigate the benefits of fortified food intake in a cohort of&#xD;
      healthy individuals. Specifically, we have fed healthy individuals with lettuce enriched with&#xD;
      Molibdenum and collected plasma and urine samples after 7-10 days. Each subject was subjected&#xD;
      to two venous blood samples taken at the beginning of the observation and at the end. The&#xD;
      samples thus obtained will be transported in certified containers for the safe transport of&#xD;
      biological samples, and, subsequently, processed by the experimenters at the laboratories of&#xD;
      the Molecular Biology section of the University of Palermo. Serum and plasma will be obtained&#xD;
      from each blood sample. All information thus obtained will be recorded in a database in which&#xD;
      each person will be identified with a numerical code, in order to comply with current privacy&#xD;
      regulations. Body weight, Barefoot standing height, Body mass index, Body composition will be&#xD;
      measured in the different groups of study. Samples will be analyzed and compared for glucose,&#xD;
      albumin, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid,&#xD;
      creatinine, AST, ALT, γ-GT, ALP, bilirubin, Ferritin, free Iron, transferrin, total proteins,&#xD;
      Magnesium, Calcium, insulin, osteocalcin, hematocrit, hs-CRP, Bone metabolism (Osteocalcin,&#xD;
      parathyroid hormone, CTX, Calcitonin), Vitamin D Calcium, Phosphate, Potassium, gastric&#xD;
      hormones ( GIP, GLP1, GLP2, ghrelin, glucagon, PYY, CCK) oxidative stress markers (LDL-ox,&#xD;
      AGE, urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F (PGF)2alpha) and inflammatory markers(IL-1, TNF, IL-6,&#xD;
      IL-10)&#xD;
