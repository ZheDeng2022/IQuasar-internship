  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study is aimed to know if tele-rehabilitation could improve the motor function and&#xD;
      general condition in post-stroke patients who are in isolation or quarantine of serious&#xD;
      infection issues.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Most post stroke patients suffer from poor motor recovery and difficulty in&#xD;
      performing activities of daily living. Early intervention has better prognosis for those&#xD;
      patients. However, patients may miss the prime of rehabilitation due to an interruption of&#xD;
      regular rehabilitation programs, which is caused by the infection control policies for&#xD;
      Covid-19 or other serious infection issues. Tele-rehabilitation could be a substitution of&#xD;
      regular rehabilitation, by which post-stroke patients in out-ward clinics and nursing&#xD;
      facilities could have functional improvement in upper limbs motions, ADLs and complex&#xD;
      activities. Furthermore, there is no evidence yet of the effectiveness in tele-rehabilitation&#xD;
      during the isolation or quarantine of serious infection issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purposes: This study is aimed to know if tele-rehabilitation could improve the motor function&#xD;
      and general condition in post-stroke patients who are in isolation or quarantine of serious&#xD;
      infection issues. Moreover, the application of tele-rehabilitation in post-stroke patients&#xD;
      will be discussed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Post-stoke patients would be recruited from a hospital of a medical university in&#xD;
      Northern Taiwan. They will be divided into experimental group (tele-rehabilitation) (N=10)&#xD;
      and control group (bedside rehabilitation) (N=10). Each patient will go on a treatment with&#xD;
      10 sections, and each section is 15 or 30 minutes. A single-blinded evaluator will do the&#xD;
      pre- and post-evaluation during the treatment. The evaluations include Postural Assessment&#xD;
      Scale for Stroke Patients (PASS), Functional ambulation category (FAC), Modified Barthel&#xD;
      index (MBI), Patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ9), Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE).&#xD;
      In the end, a satisfaction questionnaire will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Nonparametric test will be used in the comparison of the pre- and&#xD;
      post-evaluation data inter group. The analysis will be carried out using SPSS Statistic&#xD;
      (v20.0) and α&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key words: tele-rehabilitation, stroke, infection, isolation, quarantine&#xD;

    <measure>Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients (PASS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PASS is a postural assessment scale specifically designed to assess and monitor postural control after stroke. It contains 12 four-level items of varying difficulty for assessing ability to maintain or change a given lying, sitting, or standing posture.The PASS consists of a 4-point scale where items are scored from 0 - 3. The total score ranges from 0 - 36</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional ambulation category (FAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC) is a functional walking test that evaluates ambulation ability. This 6-point scale assesses ambulation status by determining how much human support the patient requires when walking, regardless of whether or not they use a personal assistive device. The score ranges from 0 to 5.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified barthel index (MBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of physical disability used widely to assess behaviour relating to activities of daily living for stroke patients or patients with other disabling conditions. Total score ranges from 0-100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale will help you estimate how hard you're working (your activity intensity). Perceived exertion is how hard you think your body is exercising. Ratings on this scale are related to heart rate (how hard your heart is working to move blood through your body). The score range from 6-20.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Every training session during 10 sessions, total sessions continued to 3 weeks</time_frame>

    <description>The bedside therapist and the case work together to set an activity schedule. The case is asked to establish and record daily routine activities, provide basic exercise and activity schedules to avoid degradation and reduce the lack of active participation in activities. The protection is to wear personal protective equipment, including protective clothing, gloves, masks, and face shields, and wash hands and disinfect before and after treatment.</description>
