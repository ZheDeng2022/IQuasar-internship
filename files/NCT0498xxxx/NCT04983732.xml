      This single-center, randomized, open-label, single dose, parallel study will assess the&#xD;
      absolute bioavailability of 150 mg FL-101 when administered via the SC and IV routes. The&#xD;
      study will consist of a Screening Period (up to 28 days), followed by Baseline assessments&#xD;
      and an inpatient Study Treatment Period of 24 hours (Day 1 and Day 2). Subjects will return&#xD;
      to the clinic as outpatients for study procedures including, but not limited to, blood&#xD;
      samples to be obtained for both PK and antibody assessments at pre-specified time points.&#xD;
