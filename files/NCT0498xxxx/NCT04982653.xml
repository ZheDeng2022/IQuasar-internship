  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial compares two different kinds of surgical closing techniques, short stitch&#xD;
      suture or traditional suture, in patients who are having liver tumor surgery. This study may&#xD;
      help researchers learn if one technique can lower the chances of developing a hole in the&#xD;
      wall of the abdomen (an abdominal hernia) at the incision site better than the other.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess whether small bites abdominal wall closure reduces the risk of developing&#xD;
      incisional hernia following liver surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare short-term perioperative outcomes between small bites and typical fascial&#xD;
      closure technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the hernia incidence rate of short stich versus (vs.) standard closure in&#xD;
      subgroups of patients with inverted-L or midline incisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the hernia incidence rate of Kawaguchi-Gayet hepatectomy complexity&#xD;
      classifications I/II vs. III (hernia rate by extent of hepatectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the hernia incidence rate of preoperative chemotherapy or no preoperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy (hernia rate by exposure to preoperative chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess impact of small bites abdominal wall closure on health care quality of life&#xD;
      following liver surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess safety of small tissue bites fascial closure suture technique versus&#xD;
      conventional fascial closure following hepatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I (INTERVENTION): Patients undergo hepatectomy as planned using small bites fascial&#xD;
      method for abdominal wall closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II (CONTROL): Patients undergo hepatectomy as planned using conventional fascial method&#xD;
      for abdominal wall closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1-4 weeks, and then at 3, 6, and 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

    <description>Definition of incisional hernia will be based on the European Hernia Society: Any abdominal wall gap with or without a bulge in the area of a postoperative scar perceptible or palpable by clinical examination or imaging. Assessment of the primary outcome will occur at 3, 6, and 12 months with a computed tomography scan/magnetic resonance imaging. Scans will be read and assessed for incisional hernia by 3 independent assessors blinded to the allocation. A correlation coefficient will be determined for their assessments. The cumulative incidence rate of incisional hernia at 12 months will be estimated, along with the 95% confidence interval.</description>
