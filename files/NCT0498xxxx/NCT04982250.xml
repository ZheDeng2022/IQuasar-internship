      Few young women at risk of HIV infection are initiating pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for&#xD;
      HIV prevention in Kenya, thus we propose refining and testing a new model to increase PrEP&#xD;
      initiation among young women at high HIV risk that has never been explored: peer PrEP&#xD;
      referral + HIV self-test (HIVST) delivery. We conducted formative research to design of a&#xD;
      model that is acceptable to young women and feasible to implement in Kenya. In this study, we&#xD;
      will refine this model where young (â‰¥16 to 24 years) female PrEP users refer their peers to&#xD;
      PrEP and deliver HIVSTs in a pilot study and then test the refined model in a hybrid&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation trial. We hypothesize that relative to informal word-of-month&#xD;
      peer PrEP referral (currently ongoing in Kenya), formalized peer PrEP referral + HIVST&#xD;
      delivery will increase PrEP adoption (i.e., initiation, retention, and adherence) among&#xD;
      peers, and be low cost and have high fidelity in Kenya.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention is highly effective, but uptake remains&#xD;
      low among young women in sub-Saharan Africa, one of the populations at greatest HIV risk. In&#xD;
      Kenya, one of the target groups for HIV incidence reduction is young women (16-24 years), who&#xD;
      account for 33% of the total of new HIV infections, yet comprise only 10% of the population.&#xD;
      Barriers to PrEP initiation for this population are multi-faceted and include institutional&#xD;
      (e.g., stigma associated with use) and intra-personal (e.g., lack of PrEP knowledge or&#xD;
      self-efficacy) barriers. Thus, innovative PrEP delivery models that can help overcome these&#xD;
      barriers are needed. The opinion of peers often influences the behaviors and preferences of&#xD;
      young women, including those related to health and health care. The majority of young women&#xD;
      who have initiated PrEP in Kenya to date have done so because of peer referral, thus&#xD;
      formalized and enhanced peer referral has the potential to increase PrEP initiation among&#xD;
      members of this population. HIV self-testing (HIVST) is a new technology that has the&#xD;
      potential to enhance peer PrEP referral. Much of the emphasis on HIVST to date has been on&#xD;
      identifying new individuals living with HIV and facilitating linkage to treatment, but the&#xD;
      majority of individuals who self-test will test negative and may be interested in facilitated&#xD;
      linkage to prevention services, like PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that a formalized peer PrEP referral + HIVST delivery model can amplify PrEP&#xD;
      initiation among young Kenyan women at HIV risk. We conducted formative qualitative research&#xD;
      and stakeholder engagement to develop a model of formalized peer PrEP referral + HIVST&#xD;
      delivery to increase PrEP initiation among young Kenyan women. We propose refining this model&#xD;
      in a pilot study. In our pilot , we will recruit 16 young female PrEP users in Thika, Kenya&#xD;
      to deliver the formalized peer PrEP referral + HIVST model to ~4 peers (=64 peers in total).&#xD;
      At one month, we will quantitatively measure model adoption (e.g., peer referral, PrEP&#xD;
      initiation) and feasibility (e.g., peer follow up) using surveys, and qualitatively measure&#xD;
      acceptability using focus group discussions (FDGs) with those delivering and receiving the&#xD;
      model (4 FDGs, ~6 women/FDG). We then propose testing the refined model in hybrid&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation trial. In our trial, we will randomize 80 young female PrEP&#xD;
      users to: 1) &quot;formal peer PrEP referral + HIVST delivery&quot;, where they are encouraged to refer&#xD;
      4 peers using PrEP materials (developed in the K99 phase &amp; Aim 1) and HIVSTs (2/peer, =8&#xD;
      total), vs. 2) &quot;informal peer PrEP referral&quot;, where they are encouraged to refer 4 peers&#xD;
      using word-of-mouth, as is ongoing in Kenya. All trial outcomes will be measured among peers&#xD;
      and PrEP users three months later. Implementation outcomes will include adoption (e.g., PrEP&#xD;
      initiation [primary], PrEP retention, HIVST use), fidelity, and costs. The effectiveness&#xD;
      outcome will be PrEP adherence, confirmed using dried blood spots. The results from this&#xD;
      trial will address one of the greatest challenges to PrEP scale-up today, inform an R01&#xD;
      proposal for a community-randomized trial and budget impact analysis, and help launch my&#xD;
      independent research career.&#xD;
