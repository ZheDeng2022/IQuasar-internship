             protocol evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. More than one change of ART regimen because of the inability to achieve or maintain&#xD;
             suppression of viral replication to an HIV-1 RNA level &lt; 200 copies/mL within the past&#xD;

         13. Receipt of any other investigational study agent(s) within 90 days before SV2.&#xD;

             attack), deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Experienced urticaria in the 6 months before the screening visit (SV2) or had ongoing&#xD;
