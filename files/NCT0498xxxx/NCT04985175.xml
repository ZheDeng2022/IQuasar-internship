      To investigate the effects of a question prompt list (QPL) on a shared decision-making&#xD;
      consultation among facing decision for dialysis in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. A&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial was conducted at the university medical center of North Taiwan.&#xD;
      Subjects were randomized assigned to QPL group or usual care group. Decisional quality and&#xD;
      decision control preferences were assessed with questionnaires. Measurements were performed&#xD;
      at before the counseling (T0), immediately after counseling (T1), and evaluate decision&#xD;
      regret at one month after treatment.&#xD;

      The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of decisional quality and&#xD;
      decisional control preferences by using a specific question prompt list (QPL) during a shared&#xD;
      decision-making consultation among facing decision for dialysis in end-stage renal disease&#xD;
      (ESRD) patients. A randomized controlled trial was conducted at the university medical center&#xD;
      of North Taiwan. Recruit subjects are those who are about to receive the nurse-led coaching&#xD;
      of shared decision-making (SDM) for patients with ESRD and attend the program. By using&#xD;
      blocked Randomization design, the investigators assigned participants to QPL group or usual&#xD;
      care. Prior to a clinic visit to discuss treatment, two-pages ESRD QPL leaflets are provided&#xD;
      to QPL group, while usual care group without receiving provision of QPL. Measurements of&#xD;
      outcome included decision quality (decision conflict, decisional self-efficiency) and&#xD;
      decision control preference at before the counseling (T0), immediately after counseling (T1),&#xD;
      and evaluate decision regret at one month after treatment (T2), at this time the patient has&#xD;
      decided and started to accept the selected treatment (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or&#xD;
      conservative treatment). All statistical analyses were performed in SAS statistical software,&#xD;
      version 9.4 (SAS, Cary, NC). The effects of the intervention were assessed by generalized&#xD;
      estimating equation (GEE) analysis with the coefficient of interaction ( group Ã— time) term.&#xD;
      Statistical tests were two-sided with a significance level of 0.05. Hierarchical Linear Model&#xD;
      was used to detect the impact of nested within physician.&#xD;

    <description>Decision conflict was measured by Decision conflict scale(DCS). The scale consists of 16 items into 5 subscales: Uncertainty(3 items), Informed(3 items), values clarity(3 items), support(3 items), and effective decision(4 items) that are rated on a 5-point likert-scale from &quot;strongly agree&quot; (0) to &quot;strongly disagree&quot; (4). The sum of scores are calculated from 0 to 100. The higher the score, the higher the level of decision conflict.</description>

    <measure>Decisional self-efficiency</measure>
    <time_frame>before the counseling (T0), immediately after counseling(T1)</time_frame>
    <description>Decision self-efficiency was measured by Decisional Self-Efficiency Scale(DSES). The scale represents self-confidence or belief in decision making. The scale consists of 11 items that are rated on a 5-point likert-scale from &quot;not at all confident&quot; (0) to&quot; very confident &quot;(4) . The sum of scores are calculated from 0 to 100. The higher the score, the higher the level of self-confidence.</description>

The sum of scores are calculated from 0 to 100. The higher the score, the higher the level of regret.</description>
