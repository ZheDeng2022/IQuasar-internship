    <textblock>
      This study evaluates patient perceptions around quality of care through telemedicine in&#xD;
      neuro-oncology. Studying questionnaires related to perceptions quality of care through&#xD;
      telemedicine in patients with brain cancer may help doctors to improve the delivery of care&#xD;
      through this modality.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the patient-perceived quality of care by group (telemedicine versus in-person&#xD;
      visits) in patients with central nervous system (CNS) cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the visits provided by telemedicine compared to those in-person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To contrast the average time spent on telemedicine visits compared to in-person visits,&#xD;
      and the delay between visit order placement and visit occurring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the domains of patient care addressed on a telemedicine visit versus&#xD;
      in-person visit per documentation, including (1) treatment planning, (2) symptom burden, (3)&#xD;
      goals of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate frequency of acute care sought (through emergency room or urgent care clinic)&#xD;
      within 30 days of encounter in telemedicine visit versus (vs) in-person visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. The impact of patient and clinical characteristics on perceived quality of care in the&#xD;
      context of covariate-adjusted modeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete a survey related to their perceived quality of care via telephone and have&#xD;
      their medical chart reviewed prospectively.&#xD;
