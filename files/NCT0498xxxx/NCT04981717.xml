  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of REGN1908-1909, as compared&#xD;
      to placebo, to reduce allergic rhinitis/conjunctivitis symptoms and allergy rescue medication&#xD;
      use during natural cat exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary Objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the reduction of allergic symptoms and use of allergy rescue medications after&#xD;
           treatment with REGN1908-1909 versus placebo, as measured by the individual components of&#xD;
           the CSMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as measured by the Rhinoconjunctivitis&#xD;
           Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ[S])&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the efficacy of REGN1908-1909, as compared to placebo, to inhibit a&#xD;
           wheal-and-flare response to a skin prick test with cat allergen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the durability of effect in allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis symptom and&#xD;
           medication scores after multiple doses of REGN1908-1909 compared to placebo given every&#xD;
           12 weeks (Q12W)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the efficacy following multiple doses of REGN1908-1909 compared to placebo&#xD;
           at inhibiting a wheal-and-flare response to a skin prick test with cat allergen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the effect of REGN1908-1909 on lung function, as compared to placebo, in&#xD;
           patients with asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the efficacy of REGN1908-1909 as compared to placebo to reduce asthma&#xD;
           symptoms in patients with asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether there is a difference in asthma rescue medication use in patients with&#xD;
           asthma who are treated with REGN1908-1909 compared to placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether there is a difference in nighttime awakenings in patients with asthma&#xD;
           treated with REGN1908-1909 compared to placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the short-term and long-term safety and tolerability of REGN1908-1909,&#xD;
           including the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions, local injection site reactions,&#xD;
           and asthma exacerbations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine systemic exposure of total (free and antigen-bound) antibodies as measured&#xD;
           by concentration of REGN1908 and REGN1909&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immunogenicity of REGN1908 and REGN1909&#xD;

    <description>The total daily asthma symptom score is a patient-reported outcome concerning the occurrence of asthma symptoms and their effect on a patient's daily activities and sleep.

    <time_frame>Baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ACQ-5 had 5 questions, reflecting the top-scoring five asthma symptoms: woken at night by symptoms, wake in the mornings with symptoms, limitation of daily activities, shortness of breath and wheeze. Participants were asked to recall how their asthma had been during the previous week and to respond to each of the five symptom questions on a 7-point scale ranged from 0 (no impairment) to 6 (maximum impairment). ACQ-5 total mean score was mean of the scores of all 5 questions and, therefore, ranged from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled), higher scores indicated lower asthma control.</description>
