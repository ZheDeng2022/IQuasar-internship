  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study of children with GSD1b to evaluate their outcome after&#xD;
      using empagliflozin for neutrophil defects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glycogen Storage Disease Type 1b (GSD1b) is an ultra-rare inborn error of carbohydrate&#xD;
      metabolism, characterized by low neutrophil count, neutrophil dysfunction, and the associated&#xD;
      recurrent infections and inflammatory bowel conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) only&#xD;
      increases neutrophil count but does not improve neutrophil function. It achieves only partial&#xD;
      clinical response. Fever, recurrent infections, and gastrointestinal upset remain significant&#xD;
      problems. Long-term regular GCSF injection is needed to sustain the clinical effect, but is&#xD;
      also associated with development of serious complications including massive spleen&#xD;
      enlargement, acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accumulation of a toxic metabolite called 1,5-anhydroglucitol-6-phosphate (1,5AG6P) is&#xD;
      recently discovered as the cause of neutrophil problems in GSD1b. Empagliflozin, a&#xD;
      sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor widely used as anti-diabetic drug, is known&#xD;
      to promote excretion of 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5AG) in kidney. Since 1,5AG is the precursor&#xD;
      of 1,5AG6P, empagliflozin also reduces the accumulation of 1,5AG6P. This is confirmed by&#xD;
      animal studies that empagliflozin is shown to improve neutrophil count and function in GSD1b&#xD;
      mouse model. Similar benefits are also recently reported in human cases (3 adults and 2&#xD;
      children with GSD1b), that GCSF dose could be significantly reduced or even stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective cohort study of children with GSD1b to examine their outcome after&#xD;
      receiving empagliflozin treatment. The objective is to evaluate the short to medium term&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of empagliflozin. The ultimate goal is to assess if SGLT2 inhibitor could&#xD;
      be an effective alternative of GCSF with less side effects and risks, and to improve the&#xD;
      clinical outcomes and quality of life for patients and families with GSD1b.&#xD;
