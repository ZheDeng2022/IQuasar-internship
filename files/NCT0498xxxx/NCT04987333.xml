    <description>Adverse events (AEs) are defined as any untoward medical occurrence in clinical study participant irrespective of a causal relationship with the study treatment. TEAEs are any event that occurs after the participant has received study treatment. Any clinically significant changes in physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests and vital signs will be recorded as TEAEs.&#xD;
Serious AEs (SAEs) are defined as any event that meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria:&#xD;
Results in death (fatal)&#xD;
Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization&#xD;
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity&#xD;
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect&#xD;

There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
