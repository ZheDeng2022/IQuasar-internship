      Patients with early breast cancer were randomized at the final visit of adjuvant radiotherapy&#xD;
      to surveillance by phone calls or by mobile Noona software. After six months the groups were&#xD;
      crossed over to the other arm. At 12 months the patients were asked their preference which&#xD;
      was the primary end-point. At baseline, 6 months and 12 months the patients answered the&#xD;
      other questionnaires.&#xD;

      Patients with early breast cancer were randomized at the final visit of adjuvant radiotherapy&#xD;
      to surveillance by phone calls or by mobile Noona software. After six months the groups were&#xD;
      crossed over to the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point was to find out patient preference for the modality of surveillance.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints were patient satisfaction, symptoms, quality of life and cost of&#xD;
      follow-up during surveillance modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 12 months the patients were asked their preference for the follow-up modality of early&#xD;
      breast cancer. At baseline, 6 months and 12 months the patients answered the other&#xD;
      questionnaires on quality of life, symptoms, patient satisfaction and use of other&#xD;
      health-care services. Information on the cost of follow-up was gathered from the hospital and&#xD;
      other registries.&#xD;
