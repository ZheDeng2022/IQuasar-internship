  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral inflammation and microvascular dysfunction are central to the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      schizophrenia (SZ). Retinal imaging allows for the accurate quantitative assessment of the&#xD;
      condition of retinal microvessels, and early studies implicate microvascular dysfunction in&#xD;
      SZ, but the specific pathophysiological mechanisms underlying greater length, density,&#xD;
      capillary network and diameter are not yet entirely understood. Anti-inflammatory drug trials&#xD;
      in SZ suggest that Early Course Schizophrenia (ECS) individuals with elevated peripheral&#xD;
      inflammation show the greatest benefit to adjunctive anti inflammatory treatments. Also,&#xD;
      there is a growing interest in the use of Sodium Nitroprusside (SNP) in SZ but further&#xD;
      studies are needed as results are inconsistent. This study will determine the effectiveness&#xD;
      of SNP on psychosis symptoms, cognition, and retinal measures in symptomatic ECS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The microvascular environment is the major interface of systemic factors affecting the brain,&#xD;
      it is a logical focus for understanding the neurobiology of schizophrenia (SZ). However, our&#xD;
      understanding of the immunological underpinnings of SZ and improved methodologies to detect&#xD;
      microvascular disorder have led to increased research in this area. We have shown that&#xD;
      inflammatory subtypes are found in psychosis and an increased pattern of peripheral&#xD;
      inflammation (including C-Reactive Protein, CRP) is related with worse overall cognition.&#xD;
      Retinal and cerebral microvessels are embryological related and can be utilized to measure&#xD;
      the state of cerebral microvessels. Advances in retinal imaging, such as swept source optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA), provide greater microvascular clarity to&#xD;
      visualize the retina non-invasively, in a more detailed, quicker and cost-effective manner.&#xD;
      In a pilot study using SS-OCTA, we identified microvascular dysfunction associated with&#xD;
      early-stages SZ. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these retinal microvascular&#xD;
      changes are not entirely understood, but they have been associated with inflammation&#xD;
      (including CRP), endothelial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species and hypoxia/ ischemia,&#xD;
      which have also been consistently observed in SZ. Nitric oxide (NO) signaling is a potential&#xD;
      mechanism for protecting the microvasculature against oxidative stress, inflammation and&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction and treatment with NOD have been shown to reduce oxidative&#xD;
      stress/inflammation and to increase cerebral blood flow in cerebrovascular disorders.&#xD;
      Anti-inflammatory drug trials in SZ suggest that Early Course Schizophrenia (ECS) individuals&#xD;
      with elevated peripheral inflammation show the greatest benefit to adjunctive anti&#xD;
      inflammatory treatments. In line with that there is a growing interest in the use of SNP in&#xD;
      SZ. Preclinical and clinical evidence have shown that SNP may have an antipsychotic profile.&#xD;
      Hallak et al (2013) demonstrated that a single infusion of SNP in patients with ECS was both&#xD;
      safe and associated with immediate and longer-term clinical outcome. While three other&#xD;
      studies demonstrated that SNP was well-tolerated in patient with multi-episode SZ, they were&#xD;
      not able to replicate Hallak's finding, which was likely due to the disease heterogeneity,&#xD;
      the inclusion of an older population with a longer duration or multi-episodes of illness, and&#xD;
      the lack of treatment biomarkers. Further work is needed to determine whether the effect of&#xD;
      SNP treatment is dependent on a patient's illness duration and whether a retinal biomarker&#xD;
      for microvascular dysfunction/inflammation can predict treatment response to SNP. Thus, the&#xD;
      principal goal in the field of SZ is to identify biomarker-based targets for early&#xD;
      intervention, evidence of engaging this target by selective interventions and assessing&#xD;
      therapeutic efficacy.&#xD;
