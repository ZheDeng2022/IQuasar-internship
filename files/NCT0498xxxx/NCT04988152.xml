  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I single-dose study to investigate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and&#xD;
      tolerability of sotrovimab vs placebo by intravenous or intramuscular administration in&#xD;
      healthy Japanese and Caucasian participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK)&#xD;
      of a single fixed dose of sotrovimab administered intravenously (IV) or via intramuscular&#xD;
      (IM) injection in Japanese and Caucasian healthy volunteers. This study will occur in two&#xD;
      parts (Part 1 and Part 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Healthy Japanese and Caucasian participants will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive a single IV infusion of sotrovimab or volume-matched saline placebo on Day 1.&#xD;
      Participants will be blinded to study intervention. Safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and&#xD;
      PK of IV sotrovimab will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Healthy Japanese and Caucasian participants will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive a single IM dose of sotrovimab or volume-matched saline placebo on Day 1.&#xD;
      Participants will be blinded to study intervention. Safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and&#xD;
      PK of IM sotrovimab will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from this study will be used to supplement data available from other clinical trials&#xD;
      that were conducted in non-Japanese participants.&#xD;
