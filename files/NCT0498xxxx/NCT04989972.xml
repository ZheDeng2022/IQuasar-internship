      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessing the efficacy of micro-dosed&#xD;
      psilocybin on reducing anxiety and/or depression levels in adults&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation reported that Anxiety disorders currently&#xD;
      affect an estimated 275 million people worldwide, about one in 13 people (7.3 percent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 has accelerated the rate of new anxiety diagnoses and exacerbated pre-existing&#xD;
      diagnoses of anxiety in individuals worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of full dose psilocybin for treatment of anxiety and depression has been&#xD;
      shown in a number of clinical trials. While there is a significant evidence of clinical&#xD;
      efficacy of full dose psilocybin, acute effects of the dose result in a significant&#xD;
      impairment - perceptual and sensory distortions incapacitating the patient for the duration&#xD;
      of drug activity. Recent work suggests while not producing perceptual changes, micro-dosing&#xD;
      may indeed be associated with improved mood and enhanced well-being. The practice of&#xD;
      micro-dosing is gaining popularity in the general population, while clinical data on its&#xD;
      safety and efficacy is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a novel randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study aimed at&#xD;
      establishment of safety and anxiolytic efficacy of psilocybin PSIL428 administered in a&#xD;
      micro-dosing regimen (2-5% of a full therapeutic dose) to adults suffering from depression or&#xD;
      anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study is the change in anxiety and/or depression levels from&#xD;
      screening to week 16. Participant anxiety levels will be monitored through Beck Anxiety&#xD;
      inventory, depression levels - through Beck Depression Inventory forms on a bi-weekly basis&#xD;
      across the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug PSIL428 is an experimental intervention and the active ingredient psilocybin is&#xD;
      botanically derived. Similar interventions are currently undergoing Phase IIb/III clinical&#xD;
      trials in international jurisdictions. It is being assessed for treatment of depressive&#xD;
      disorders. Typically psilocybin used in full therapeutic doses associated with significant&#xD;
      acute adverse effects. The proposed trial would utilize psilocybin in different dosing&#xD;
      regimen - as micro-dosing - ingesting of sub-perceptual doses of the drug equal to 2-10% of&#xD;
      the full dose. The micro-dosing practice is gaining significant popularity world-wide,&#xD;
      however evidence-based data around it is minimal. Risks and benefits associated with the&#xD;
      trial are not definitively established, however existing pre-clinical and clinical data&#xD;
      around full-dose use of the drug carries a favorable risk-benefit potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted in accordance with the most recently acceptable version of the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) according to International Conference&#xD;
      on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines, and applicable Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). The&#xD;
      trial will be conducted under a protocol reviewed and approved by an IRB; the trial will be&#xD;
      conducted by scientifically and medically qualified persons; the benefits of the study are in&#xD;
      proportion to the risks; the rights and welfare of the subjects will be respected; each&#xD;
      subject will give his or her written informed consent before any protocol-driven tests or&#xD;
      evaluations are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are responsible for obtaining informed consent in adherence to GCP and&#xD;
      according to applicable regulations prior to entering the subject into the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A positive change in Beck Anxiety and/or Beck Depression numeric levels between PSIL428 and&#xD;
      placebo groups will mark our primary outcome achievement of confirming beneficial effects of&#xD;
      micro-dose-administered psilocybin on study participants' overall anxiety and/or depression&#xD;
      levels&#xD;
