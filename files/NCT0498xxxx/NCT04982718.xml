  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Self-testing with easy-to-use rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) has been successfully used for&#xD;
      diseases such as HIV. The availability of self-testing has been shown to increase testing&#xD;
      rates and testing acceptability in diverse populations around the world, in large part due to&#xD;
      its convenience and privacy advantages. Self-testing has also been effectively used to reach&#xD;
      key populations who may not be covered by traditional healthcare programs, such as persons&#xD;
      who inject drugs and men who have sex with men. In Malaysia, HIV self-testing has been shown&#xD;
      to have moderate to high levels of acceptability, depending on the population, test used, and&#xD;
      test delivery framework. In the present study we aim to evaluate the acceptability and impact&#xD;
      of an online program enabling home-based hepatitis C virus (HCV) self-testing in Malaysia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malaysia is an upper middle-income country with a population of more than 32 million,&#xD;
      comprising thirteen states and three federal territories. It is estimated that the hepatitis&#xD;
      C virus (HCV) seroprevalence in the general population of Malaysia is between 0.3% and 2.5%.&#xD;
      In Malaysia, people who inject drugs represent just 0.24% (75 000) of the adult population;&#xD;
      however, they are disproportionately affected by HCV, with an overall HCV prevalence of 67.5%&#xD;
      to 89.9%. Other key populations in Malaysia at higher risk of HCV include 77 903 people&#xD;
      living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, 0.24%), 221 698 men who have sex with men&#xD;
      (0.69%), 22 000 female sex workers (0.069%), and 15 000 transgender sex workers (0.047%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major challenges faced by Malaysia in eliminating viral hepatitis have been&#xD;
      under-screening, under-diagnosis and under-treatment. A high proportion of those infected&#xD;
      with HCV remain undiagnosed and, until 2018, only a small proportion of those infected&#xD;
      received treatment each year. Up until 2017, it is estimated that just 6.1% (23 258) of&#xD;
      people infected with HCV were diagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-testing with easy-to-use rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) has been successfully used for&#xD;
      diseases such as HIV. The availability of self-testing has been shown to increase testing&#xD;
      rates and testing acceptability in diverse populations around the world, in large part due to&#xD;
      its convenience and privacy advantages. In the present study we aim to evaluate the&#xD;
      acceptability and impact of an online program enabling home-based HCV self-testing in&#xD;
      Malaysia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FIND, in conjunction with the Malaysian AIDS Council (MAC) and the Ministry of Health (MOH)&#xD;
      Malaysia, is evaluating HCV self-testing as a way to expand outreach, improve HCV testing&#xD;
      rates, and increase linkage to care among HCV-infected individuals. The ability to utilize an&#xD;
      existing online platform promoting HIV self-testing (JomTest) will enable us to examine how&#xD;
      offering home-based HCV self-testing may help identify HCV-infected individuals and link them&#xD;
      to care. *The online platform JomTest is currently hosting a research study with Medical&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee, University Malaya Medical Center MRECID No. 202013-8135, study&#xD;
      title &quot;Integrated HIV self-testing (HIVST) service delivery in Malaysia for policy and&#xD;
      service development: JomTest online&quot; and aims to assess the integrated HIVST service delivery&#xD;
      in Malaysia for policy and service development through the platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the impact of a home-based HCV self-testing program in Malaysia. We&#xD;
      aim to describe the acceptability and impact of an online platform offering home-based HCV&#xD;
      self-tests to key populations. Since HCV self-tests detect the presence of antibodies to HCV,&#xD;
      indicating exposure to HCV, any individual reporting a positive HCV self-test will be&#xD;
      referred to HCV RNA confirmatory testing in order to identify active HCV infection. Those&#xD;
      confirmed to have active HCV infection with a positive HCV RNA test will be linked to HCV&#xD;
      treatment and care. Rates of testing and linkage to care will be measured, along with&#xD;
      knowledge, attitudes, and practices around HCV testing and care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled trial comparing an online platform providing home-delivery of&#xD;
      HCV self-tests to referral to standard of care community-based HCV testing sites in Malaysia.&#xD;
      Study participants will be recruited through an existing HIV self-testing program using an&#xD;
      online platform JomTest. Interested participants will sign up and proceed for study&#xD;
      eligibility screening and if eligible, proceed to complete an online consent form. All&#xD;
      consented and enrolled study participants will complete an online baseline survey collecting&#xD;
      demographics and knowledge and attitudes towards HCV testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to the intervention or control group in a 2:1 ratio. In the&#xD;
      intervention group, participants will receive a HCV self-test (ST) kit delivered in&#xD;
      non-identifiable packaging to their home or a preferred mailing address. The kit will include&#xD;
      the test, instructions for use, and information about additional supporting materials, such&#xD;
      as access to live chat and a call center for questions about testing. In order to evaluate&#xD;
      two sampling methods for HCV self-testing, the first 250 participants in the intervention&#xD;
      group will receive an oral fluid-based HCV ST, and the next 250 participants will receive a&#xD;
      blood-based fingerstick HCV ST. In the control group, participants will receive information&#xD;
      about standard of care HCV antibody testing available at local testing sites in their&#xD;
      community and information about additional supporting materials, such as access to live chat&#xD;
      and a call center for questions about testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there is no quality-assured HCV self-test today, the professional use OraQuick® HCV Rapid&#xD;
      Antibody Test and First Response® HCV Card Test that have been repackaged and labelled with&#xD;
      Instructions for Use (IFU) adapted by the manufacturers for self-testing would be used in&#xD;
      this study. The OraQuick® HCV Rapid Antibody Test is prequalified by WHO and CE marked for&#xD;
      professional use (sensitivity 98.1%, specificity 99.6%); the First Response® HCV Card Test is&#xD;
      CE-marked and currently under WHO review for professional use (sensitivity 100%, specificity&#xD;
      100%). Both these professional tests are not yet registered with the Medical Device Authority&#xD;
      in Malaysia. The OraQuick® HCV Self-Test and First Response® HCV Self-Test kits provided to&#xD;
      participants in the intervention group will be labelled for Research Use Only (RUO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be sent a reminder for online Follow-up survey #1 and the opportunity&#xD;
      to upload any testing result in approximately 2-4 weeks from day of enrolment. A second&#xD;
      online Follow-up survey #2 will be sent after the closure of the first survey. Up to 3&#xD;
      reminders may be sent if a survey has not been completed. Participants will receive 20&#xD;
      Ringgit (~5 USD) for completing Follow-up survey #1 and an additional 20 Ringgit for&#xD;
      completion of the Follow-up survey #2. Any participants found to be HCV antibody positive&#xD;
      through the study will be supported to access HCV management and care services for&#xD;
      confirmatory HCV testing and HCV treatment if required and be provided additional assistance&#xD;
      through MAC's existing peer navigation system as outlined in the organization's standard&#xD;
      operating procedures.&#xD;
