  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the year of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic several&#xD;
      studies have focused on the effect of the COVID-19 on the adrenal cortex, demonstrating&#xD;
      conflicting results. Herein, researchers sought to investigate the adrenal response in&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19by assessing the diurnal rhythm of salivary cortisol and the adrenal&#xD;
      androgen dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), as well as the plasma levels of aldosterone and&#xD;
      adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in consecutive patients before the possible therapeutic&#xD;
      administration of dexamethasone. To elucidate the potential association between the magnitude&#xD;
      of individual immune response and the adrenal cortex response we included serum measurements&#xD;
      of interleukin - 6 (IL-6).&#xD;

      All adult consecutive patients that visited the emergency department of the LAIKO General&#xD;
      Hospital of Athens from May to July 2021 due to confirmed COVID-19 and related symptomatology&#xD;
      were eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age and gender matched healthy individuals without COVID-19 who had never been treated with&#xD;
      GCs and fulfilled the exclusion criteria were also recruited from the Hospital's personnel&#xD;
      and included in the analysis as Controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were obtained immediately upon admission for the measurements of ACTH, IL-6 and&#xD;
      aldosterone, which were performed by electrochemiluminescence assays on the cobas e 801&#xD;
      immunoassay analysers (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). Salivary samples for free cortisol and DHEAS&#xD;
      were obtained during the next day using the Salivette (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) at&#xD;
      different time points 0800, 12.00, 18.00, and 22.00. Within 24h after saliva collection the&#xD;
      salivettes were centrifuged at 2400 g for 20 min in 4 °C and aliquots were stored at -80 °C&#xD;
      and analyzed by an Immunochemiluminescence assay in a Roche COBAS E411 analyzer.&#xD;
