    <textblock>
      Chronic and progressive dyspnea is the most characteristic symptom of chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease. There are studies in the literature showing that electromyography&#xD;
      activations of respiratory muscles increase in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease and that the severity of the perceived shortness of breath is associated with muscle&#xD;
      activation. However, no study has been found comparing respiratory muscle activations during&#xD;
      pursed lip breathing and normal breathing in the dyspnea reduction positions and supine&#xD;
      position used in the treatment and management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of different dyspnea reduction positions on&#xD;
      respiratory muscle activations separately, to compare respiratory muscle activation during&#xD;
      normal breathing, respiratory control and pursed lip breathing during these different&#xD;
      positions, and to classify muscle activations according to the severity of chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a common, preventable and treatable disease&#xD;
      characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airway limitation due to airway and/or&#xD;
      alveolar abnormality, which is affected by many factors that cause abnormal lung development&#xD;
      resulting from exposure to harmful gases or particles. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      is known as the fourth most common cause of death in the world and is expected to rise to&#xD;
      third place by the end of 2020. Physiopathological changes such as airflow limitation,&#xD;
      bronchial fibrosis, increased airway resistance, ciliary dysfunction, gas exchange&#xD;
      abnormalities and air trapping occur in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. While smoking&#xD;
      is the most common risk factor in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Occupational dust&#xD;
      and chemicals, air pollution, lung growth and development, genetic predisposition such as age&#xD;
      and gender, and exposure to environmental effects. Symptoms such as shortness of breath&#xD;
      (dyspnea), cough, and sputum are common in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic and progressive dyspnea is the most characteristic symptom of chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease. About 30% of individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have a&#xD;
      productive cough. These symptoms can vary from day to day and may precede airflow limitation&#xD;
      for years. Significant airflow limitation may also be present without chronic dyspnea, cough,&#xD;
      and sputum production. Although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is defined based on air&#xD;
      restriction, individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease usually make the decision&#xD;
      to seek treatment based on the effect of symptoms on functional status. Dyspnea, which is the&#xD;
      main symptom of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is the main cause of disability and&#xD;
      anxiety associated with the disease. Typical chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients&#xD;
      define dyspnea as a feeling of increased breathing effort, heaviness in the chest, and air&#xD;
      hunger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, it has been shown that there are many underlying causes of dyspnea. In chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease patients, minute ventilation and dead space ventilation due to&#xD;
      increased workload increase respiratory motor output in association with an increase in&#xD;
      carbon dioxide production. As a result, individuals feel short of breath. Simple mechanical&#xD;
      distention of the airways during exhalation, which is defined as dynamic airway compression,&#xD;
      is another cause of dyspnea in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Different&#xD;
      positions and breathing patterns affect the perception of dyspnea in individuals with chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease. In current studies, individuals with chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease have an increased perception of shortness of breath in the supine position&#xD;
      (orthopnea); It was observed that the perception of shortness of breath decreased in pursed&#xD;
      lib (pursed lip) breathing and dyspnea reduction positions. Therefore, pursed lip breathing&#xD;
      and breathlessness reduction positions are frequently used in the treatment of individuals&#xD;
      with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Leaning forward, comfortable sitting, leaning&#xD;
      forward, standing with the back leaning, high side lying are the most commonly used positions&#xD;
      to reduce dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that the forward bending position, one of the dyspnea-reducing positions,&#xD;
      improves the length-tension relationship and function of the diaphragm muscle, decreases the&#xD;
      activity of the sternocleidomastoideus, scalene muscles, improves thoracoabdominal movement,&#xD;
      and helps to reduce shortness of breath. Pursed-lip breathing, on the other hand, increases&#xD;
      tidal volume, leading to increased rib cage movement and accessory muscle recruitment during&#xD;
      inspiration and expiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to healthy individuals, individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have&#xD;
      an increased electromyographic activation of respiratory muscles. In chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease patients, there is an increase in respiratory muscle activation and&#xD;
      shortness of breath due to the imbalance between the workload and capacity of the respiratory&#xD;
      muscles. In current studies, it has been observed that the severity of dyspnea perception and&#xD;
      respiratory muscle activations are related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are studies in the literature showing that electromyographic activations of respiratory&#xD;
      muscles increase in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and that the&#xD;
      severity of the perceived shortness of breath is associated with muscle activation. However,&#xD;
      no study has been found comparing respiratory muscle activations during pursed lip breathing&#xD;
      and normal breathing in dyspnea reduction positions and supine position used in the treatment&#xD;
      and management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The aim of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of different dyspnea reduction positions on respiratory muscle activations&#xD;
      separately, to compare respiratory muscle activation during normal breathing, respiratory&#xD;
      control and pursed lip breathing during these different positions, and to classify muscle&#xD;
      activations according to the severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&#xD;
