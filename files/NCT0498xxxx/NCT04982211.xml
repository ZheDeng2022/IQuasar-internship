  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to examine a mismatch-based method of reconsolidation blockade for&#xD;
      the treatment of psychological trauma in military personnel and Federal police officers. The&#xD;
      standard reconsolidation blockade treatment (aka Reconsolidation Therapy) involves&#xD;
      reactivating the trauma memory while under the influence of propranolol. The mismatch method&#xD;
      of Reconsolidation Therapy will involve varying the contexts in which the weekly trauma&#xD;
      memory retrieval will occur. This study will involve 10 visits (eligibility assessment,&#xD;
      treatments, and follow-up visits) over a 6-month period for each participant. Treatments will&#xD;
      be conducted once a week for a six-week period where the participant will take a dose of&#xD;
      propranolol (or a placebo pill) 60 minutes prior to memory reactivation. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that reconsolidation blockade treatment will be as effective in treating PTSD&#xD;
      among military personnel and Federal police officers, with the mismatch condition showing&#xD;
      greater symptom improvement.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic stress remains a treatment-refractory mental health problem characterized by&#xD;
      symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance, negative cognitions and affect, and hyperarousal. Due&#xD;
      to the nature of their profession, military personnel and the Federal police officers (RCMP;&#xD;
      Royal Canadian Mounted Police) are at a greater risk of suffering from traumatic stress.&#xD;
      Thus, there is an important unmet need for developing novel treatments for trauma-related&#xD;
      disorders, particularly for the military and RCMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the pivotal role of negative emotional experiences in the development and&#xD;
      persistence of PTSD, blocking the reconsolidation of such experiences opens the door to a&#xD;
      novel and powerful treatment approach against this disorder. We (Brunet et al, 2018) have&#xD;
      previously shown the efficacy of trauma memory reactivation performed under the influence of&#xD;
      propranolol, a noradrenergic beta-receptor blocker, as a putative reconsolidation blocker, in&#xD;
      reducing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although this therapeutic method&#xD;
      was shown to be efficacious, it is hypothesized that symptomatic improvements may be&#xD;
      increased by including a mismatch experience between what is expected during memory recall&#xD;
      and the actual recall experience, in line with mismatch theory (Pedreira et al, 2004; see&#xD;
      Ecker, 2015). In this study, we test the effects of a mismatch procedure by altering the&#xD;
      context in which the trauma memory retrieval occurs. Standard and mismatch reconsolidation&#xD;
      therapy procedures will be used to treat PTSD in military personnel and Federal police&#xD;
      officers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Compare the effects of Standard Reconsolidation Therapy using propranolol vs. placebo on&#xD;
      PTSD symptoms one-week post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is predicted that propranolol administration will yield greater PTSD symptom improvement&#xD;
      than placebo at one week following the last treatment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the effect of Standard vs. Mismatch Reconsolidation Treatment conditions on PTSD&#xD;
           symptoms using propranolol during treatment, one-week post-treatment and at six months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether Reconsolidation Therapy with propranolol is associated with greater&#xD;
           PTSD symptom reductions than placebo during treatment and at six months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the proportion of participants rated as 'improved' based on a global clinical&#xD;
           impression rating scale across treatment conditions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the proportion of participants who no longer meet PTSD diagnostic criteria at&#xD;
           one-week post-treatment and follow-up according to treatment condition;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the effect of the treatment on depressive symptoms, dissociative symptoms,&#xD;
           complex PTSD symptomatology, and quality of life;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the effect of treatment condition on drop-outs and relapse rates;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish the study objectives, the investigators will employ a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial and use standardized, repeated dependent measures of change at each&#xD;
      treatment visit, as well as at one-week, 3-month and 6-month post-treatment visits). At each&#xD;
      treatment session, participants will be asked recall their traumatic memory with the help of&#xD;
      a trauma narrative under the influence of propranolol or a placebo. Recall will occur using a&#xD;
      standard reconsolidation or mismatch protocol. Four treatment conditions will be defined, as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Standard trauma memory reactivation + propranolol;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Standard trauma reactivation + placebo;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3: Modified trauma reactivation + propranolol;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 4: Modified trauma reactivation + placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a means to favor recruitment, the current study will use an unbalanced sampling design. We&#xD;
      will randomize 50 participants per cell in each of two active treatment groups and 25&#xD;
      participants per cell in the two placebo groups. Approximately 4 sites will be involved in&#xD;
      recruiting participants for the study: one in the US, with the remaining sites in Canada. We&#xD;
      are targeting 150 study participants with the aim of obtaining 121 treatment completers,&#xD;
      taking into account an approximate 20% attrition rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will involve 10 study visits over a 6-month period. The first two visits will&#xD;
      serve to obtain consent, establish the PTSD diagnosis, and determine eligibility. Treatments&#xD;
      will occur once a week for 6 weeks. The standard reconsolidation therapy procedure will&#xD;
      involve having participants write or read a summary of their traumatic experience under the&#xD;
      influence of propranolol. The mismatch reconsolidation therapy condition will involve&#xD;
      changing the way the trauma narrative is used to reactivate the trauma memory at each visit .&#xD;
      Participants will not be informed in advance of the mismatch procedures. Follow-up&#xD;
      assessments for all participants will be conducted one week post-treatment, as well as at&#xD;
      three- and six-months after study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses. It is hypothesized that both standard and mismatch therapy conditions&#xD;
      under propranolol will show greater improvements than with placebo. However, it is the&#xD;
      mismatch therapy condition using propranolol is expected to yield significantly greater&#xD;
      improvements in PTSD symptoms relative to the other three conditions. All data will be tested&#xD;
      using mixed effects statistical models.&#xD;
