  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to examine a mismatch-based method of reconsolidation blockade for&#xD;
      the treatment of psychological trauma in military personnel and Federal police officers. The&#xD;
      standard reconsolidation blockade treatment (aka Reconsolidation Therapy) involves&#xD;
      reactivating the trauma memory while under the influence of propranolol. The mismatch method&#xD;
      of Reconsolidation Therapy will involve varying the contexts in which the weekly trauma&#xD;
      memory retrieval will occur. This study will involve 10 visits (eligibility assessment,&#xD;
      treatments, and follow-up visits) over a 6-month period for each participant. Treatments will&#xD;
      be conducted once a week for a six-week period where the participant will take a dose of&#xD;
      propranolol (or a placebo pill) 60 minutes prior to memory reactivation. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that reconsolidation blockade treatment will be as effective in treating PTSD&#xD;
      among military personnel and Federal police officers, with the mismatch condition showing&#xD;
      greater symptom improvement.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic stress remains a treatment-refractory mental health problem characterized by&#xD;
      symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance, negative cognitions and affect, and hyperarousal. Due&#xD;
      to the nature of their profession, military personnel and the Federal police officers (RCMP;&#xD;
      Royal Canadian Mounted Police) are at a greater risk of suffering from traumatic stress.&#xD;
      Thus, there is an important unmet need for developing novel treatments for trauma-related&#xD;
      disorders, particularly for the military and RCMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the pivotal role of negative emotional experiences in the development and&#xD;
      persistence of PTSD, blocking the reconsolidation of such experiences opens the door to a&#xD;
      novel and powerful treatment approach against this disorder. We (Brunet et al, 2018) have&#xD;
      previously shown the efficacy of trauma memory reactivation performed under the influence of&#xD;
      propranolol, a noradrenergic beta-receptor blocker, as a putative reconsolidation blocker, in&#xD;
      reducing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although this therapeutic method&#xD;
      was shown to be efficacious, it is hypothesized that symptomatic improvements may be&#xD;
      increased by including a mismatch experience between what is expected during memory recall&#xD;
      and the actual recall experience, in line with mismatch theory (Pedreira et al, 2004; see&#xD;
      Ecker, 2015). In this study, we test the effects of a mismatch procedure by altering the&#xD;
      context in which the trauma memory retrieval occurs. Standard and mismatch reconsolidation&#xD;
      therapy procedures will be used to treat PTSD in military personnel and Federal police&#xD;
      officers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Compare the effects of Standard Reconsolidation Therapy using propranolol vs. placebo on&#xD;
      PTSD symptoms one-week post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is predicted that propranolol administration will yield greater PTSD symptom improvement&#xD;
      than placebo at one week following the last treatment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the effect of Standard vs. Mismatch Reconsolidation Treatment conditions on PTSD&#xD;
           symptoms using propranolol during treatment, one-week post-treatment and at six months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether Reconsolidation Therapy with propranolol is associated with greater&#xD;
           PTSD symptom reductions than placebo during treatment and at six months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the proportion of participants rated as 'improved' based on a global clinical&#xD;
           impression rating scale across treatment conditions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the proportion of participants who no longer meet PTSD diagnostic criteria at&#xD;
           one-week post-treatment and follow-up according to treatment condition;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the effect of the treatment on depressive symptoms, dissociative symptoms,&#xD;
           complex PTSD symptomatology, and quality of life;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the effect of treatment condition on drop-outs and relapse rates;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish the study objectives, the investigators will employ a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial and use standardized, repeated dependent measures of change at each&#xD;
      treatment visit, as well as at one-week, 3-month and 6-month post-treatment visits). At each&#xD;
      treatment session, participants will be asked recall their traumatic memory with the help of&#xD;
      a trauma narrative under the influence of propranolol or a placebo. Recall will occur using a&#xD;
      standard reconsolidation or mismatch protocol. Four treatment conditions will be defined, as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Standard trauma memory reactivation + propranolol;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Standard trauma reactivation + placebo;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3: Modified trauma reactivation + propranolol;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 4: Modified trauma reactivation + placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a means to favor recruitment, the current study will use an unbalanced sampling design. We&#xD;
      will randomize 50 participants per cell in each of two active treatment groups and 25&#xD;
      participants per cell in the two placebo groups. Approximately 4 sites will be involved in&#xD;
      recruiting participants for the study: one in the US, with the remaining sites in Canada. We&#xD;
      are targeting 150 study participants with the aim of obtaining 121 treatment completers,&#xD;
      taking into account an approximate 20% attrition rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will involve 10 study visits over a 6-month period. The first two visits will&#xD;
      serve to obtain consent, establish the PTSD diagnosis, and determine eligibility. Treatments&#xD;
      will occur once a week for 6 weeks. The standard reconsolidation therapy procedure will&#xD;
      involve having participants write or read a summary of their traumatic experience under the&#xD;
      influence of propranolol. The mismatch reconsolidation therapy condition will involve&#xD;
      changing the way the trauma narrative is used to reactivate the trauma memory at each visit .&#xD;
      Participants will not be informed in advance of the mismatch procedures. Follow-up&#xD;
      assessments for all participants will be conducted one week post-treatment, as well as at&#xD;
      three- and six-months after study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses. It is hypothesized that both standard and mismatch therapy conditions&#xD;
      under propranolol will show greater improvements than with placebo. However, it is the&#xD;
      mismatch therapy condition using propranolol is expected to yield significantly greater&#xD;
      improvements in PTSD symptoms relative to the other three conditions. All data will be tested&#xD;
      using mixed effects statistical models.&#xD;

The design will be stratified by profession (military vs. police) and sex. After an eligibility assessment at baseline, participants meeting inclusion criteria will be randomly allocated to one of four groups with a 66.6% probability of getting enrolled in one of the two propranolol treatment groups.</intervention_model_description>
