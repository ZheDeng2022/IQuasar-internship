    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter, dose escalation, and dose expansion&#xD;
      first-in human (FIH) Phase 1 study to determine the safety, tolerability, PK,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of INCA00186 when given alone or in combination&#xD;
      with INCB106385 and/or retifanlimab in participants with specific advanced solid tumors;&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and specified gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
      malignancies have been selected as indications of interest for this study. Participants with&#xD;
      CD8 T-cell-positive tumors will be selected as these tumors are more likely to respond to&#xD;
      immunotherapy.&#xD;
