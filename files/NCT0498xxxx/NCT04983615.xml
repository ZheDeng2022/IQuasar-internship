  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid-based sedation as a first line in mechanically ventilated patients has been considered&#xD;
      the &quot;gold standard&quot; in intensive care unit patients around the world for several decades.&#xD;
      Advantages of opiate-based sedation, compared to benzodiazepine-based sedation, which has&#xD;
      been used in the past, include a reduction in delirium scores, better pain control,&#xD;
      decreasing the time between cessation of sedation and patient awakening, and decreasing the&#xD;
      time between cessation of sedation and extubation, with decreased ICU admission times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most Western European countries, as well as in the United States, there are almost no&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated patients hospitalized outside the intensive care unit. In a few&#xD;
      countries, including Japan and Israel, mechanically ventilated patients are also hospitalized&#xD;
      outside of intensive care units, as part of internal or surgical wards. Contrary to the vast&#xD;
      knowledge accumulated regarding different sedation methods in ventilated patients in&#xD;
      intensive care units, there are almost no studies that have evaluated different sedation&#xD;
      methods in ventilated patients hospitalized in non-intensive care wards. Thus, while there is&#xD;
      consensus on the benefits of opioid-based sedation in intensive care units, there is&#xD;
      insufficient information to recommend the preferred sedation method in non-ICU wards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For various reasons, in a large number of the internal medicine wards of hospitals in Israel,&#xD;
      the common sedation practice for ventilated patients is still benzodiazepine-based sedation.&#xD;
      In the past year, a pilot program was initiated in Internal Medicine Department A at Meir&#xD;
      Hospital in Kfar Saba, in which a new protocol for opioid-based sedation in ventilated&#xD;
      patients was implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol is based on the continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl as the first line of&#xD;
      treatment for sedation in ventilated patients only. If the sedation-agitation level (as&#xD;
      measured by the RASS score) did not match the target RASS score set by the attending&#xD;
      physician, a dose up to a maximum limit could be increased according to the protocol.&#xD;
      Second-line sedation drugs were addition of continuous intravenous infusion of midazolam (in&#xD;
      addition to fentanyl) in hemodynamically stable patients, or addition of continuous&#xD;
      intravenous infusion of ketamine in unstable patients. In stable patients who did not reach&#xD;
      the desired RASS level under continuous infusion of fentanyl and midazolam, ketamine could be&#xD;
      added as a third line drug, in addition to fentanyl and midazolam.&#xD;
