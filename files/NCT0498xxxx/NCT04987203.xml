  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be comparing tivozanib in combination with nivolumab to tivozanib alone in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) who have had 1 or 2 prior lines of therapy,&#xD;
      one of which was an Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, randomized, controlled, multicenter, multi-national, parallel-arm&#xD;
      study. The study is designed to compare the progression free survival (PFS), overall survival&#xD;
      (OS), Objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), and safety of tivozanib and&#xD;
      the combination of tivozanib with nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 326 subjects with refractory advanced RCC at approximately 190 sites will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with tivozanib plus nivolumab (163 subjects) or&#xD;
      tivozanib (163 subjects). Subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive 1.34 mg of tivozanib once daily (QD) for 3 weeks followed by 1 week off&#xD;
      study drug. One cycle will be defined as 4 weeks: 3 weeks on treatment and 1 week off&#xD;
      treatment. Subjects who receive nivolumab will be infused with 1 treatment of nivolumab at&#xD;
      specified dose on specified days of each Cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with documented stable disease or an objective response may continue to receive both&#xD;
      tivozanib and nivolumab therapy at the same dose and schedule until progression as long as&#xD;
      the tolerability is acceptable. Nivolumab will be discontinued in all subjects after 2 years.&#xD;
      A Safety Follow-up Visit will be performed 30 days (± 7 days) after the last dose of study&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;
