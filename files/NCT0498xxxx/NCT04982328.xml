  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is currently the leading public health problem, associated with a high risk of&#xD;
      complications and death in risk groups of patients. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)&#xD;
      is the most common liver disease with a prevalence of 30% in the Western population and is&#xD;
      also recognized as an independent risk factor for the development of severe COVID-19. In the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of COVID-19, the key role is played by the hyperreactivity of the immune&#xD;
      response, the so-called cytokine storm leading to the development of severe forms of&#xD;
      pneumonia, acute respiratory and multiorgan failure. The aim of this study is to investigate&#xD;
      the clinical course, outcomes, and profile of inflammatory response in patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      and NAFLD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2 virus infection is currently the leading public health problem, associated with a&#xD;
      high risk of complications and death in at-risk groups. Risk factors for the development of&#xD;
      severe forms of COVID-19 include components of the metabolic syndrome (obesity, diabetes,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, and arterial hypertension), which are also associated with the development of&#xD;
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). According to previously published, but mostly&#xD;
      retrospective studies, NAFLD is a possible risk factor for the development of severe&#xD;
      COVID-19. . In the pathogenesis of COVID-19, the key role is played by the hyperreactivity of&#xD;
      the immune response, the so-called cytokine storm. According to recent research, activation&#xD;
      of the Th17 system could play a key role in the regulation of this excessive inflammatory&#xD;
      response. Furthermore, Th17 lymphocytes and cytokines are important in the development and&#xD;
      progression of NAFLD. The question is whether, due to Th17 hyperreactivity, patients with&#xD;
      NAFLD are at higher risk of developing severe forms of the disease and what is the profile of&#xD;
      the Th17 immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in this group of patients.&#xD;
