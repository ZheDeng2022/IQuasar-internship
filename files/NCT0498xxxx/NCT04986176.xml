  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of HC-1119 as an adjuvant&#xD;
      treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 male and female patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a prospective, superiority, interventionist, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      double-blinded, randomized parallel assignment study. The study evaluates the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of HC- 1119.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened for eligibility; the assessment should be completed prior to&#xD;
      any randomization to avoid screening failures to a maximum extent. Eligible participants (men&#xD;
      and women) will be randomized 1:1 between arms (HC-1119 and placebo). HC-1119 and placebo&#xD;
      will be administered orally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosing regimen is 160 mg daily for 14 consecutive days. All patients will receive in&#xD;
      parallel the standard treatment for COVID -19, according to the institution's protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An electronic program will be used to manage randomization and drug shipment. The whole&#xD;
      process will be handled in a manner that is blinded for the treatment received to all&#xD;
      involved study personnel. The study follow up period will be 28 days after the first&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
