  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity nearly tripled from 1975 to 2021, resulting in liposuction, as an&#xD;
      effective shaping method, to be performed more frequently. Liposuction is a surgical&#xD;
      procedure that uses a specialized instrument to suck fat fragments in the subcutaneous fat&#xD;
      layer through a small incision. Analyzing a large sample sizes of patients who had&#xD;
      liposuction, we found that some female patients underwent menstrual irregularity after&#xD;
      liposuction. In 2004, Carolyn et al. reported several cases in which there was a connection&#xD;
      between liposuction and an early onset of menses. Further studies showed that an early onset&#xD;
      of menses may be related to the volume of adipose tissue extracted, the amount of anesthesia&#xD;
      given, the area of liposuction, and body weight. However, the sample of that study was small,&#xD;
      as there were only 17 cases included in the statistical model, and there are few articles in&#xD;
      which the impact of liposuction on menses has been studied. To better understand whether&#xD;
      menstrual irregularity will occur after liposuction, patients with postmenopausal or&#xD;
      preoperative menstrual irregularity were excluded, leaving a sample of 518 female patients to&#xD;
      be reviewed. A better understanding of the impact of liposuction on menses may help clinical&#xD;
      doctors predict the underlying risk of menstrual irregularity after liposuction and identify&#xD;
      individuals at higher risk. The findings may contribute to further understanding of menstrual&#xD;
      irregularity.&#xD;
