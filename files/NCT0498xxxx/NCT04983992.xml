      follow-up, compared with preoperative and postoperative imaging data, clinical&#xD;
      manifestations, signs, etc., to evaluate the surgical effect, at the same time of resection&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Excessive Lateral Pressure Syndrome (ELPS) is a series of clinical symptoms caused by various&#xD;
      factors, such as patella tilt, adaptive contraction of the Lateral retinaculum and unbalanced&#xD;
      Pressure on the medial and Lateral joint surfaces of the patellofemoral. The concept was&#xD;
      first proposed by Ficat in 1977. Patellofemoral pain syndrome has long been lumped together&#xD;
      as widespread pregenitual pain and Patella malalignment syndrome as Patellofemoral pain due&#xD;
      to poor Patella alignment.Kramer et al. found that the main cause of patellofemoral pain and&#xD;
      increased pressure on the lateral patellofemoral surface was excessive pressure on the&#xD;
      lateral retinol. Later, this view was accepted by more scholars, and lateral patellofemoral&#xD;
      compression syndrome was gradually regarded as an independent syndrome and more studies were&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with lateral patella compression syndrome, early manifestations are usually pain&#xD;
      in the soft tissues around the patella. Fulkerson et al. in 1985 found pathological changes&#xD;
      in the nerve fibers in the lateral retinaculum through a pathological study, which is the&#xD;
      basis for early lesions showing only pain in the soft tissues around the patella.As the&#xD;
      disease progresses, uneven pressure on the medial and lateral facets of the patellofemoral&#xD;
      joint will gradually lead to damage of the medial and lateral facets of the articular&#xD;
      cartilage, eventually leading to irreversible damage of the articular cartilage and&#xD;
      osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical treatment of lateral compression syndrome is varied, and in recent years, the&#xD;
      most commonly used surgical methods include: incision lysis, percutaneous lysis,&#xD;
      arthroscope-assisted percutaneous lysis, arthroscopic release, etc.These traditional surgical&#xD;
      methods all have obvious complications, such as intraarticular dislocation of patella,&#xD;
      recurrence of lateral compression due to postoperative adhesion of the support band,&#xD;
      patellofemoral joint instability, intraarticular hematoma, etc.Although there are many&#xD;
      surgical treatment methods for lateral compression syndrome, there is still no recognized&#xD;
      standard treatment. Due to the fact that its effect and evaluation criteria cannot be&#xD;
      unified, accurate horizontal comparison cannot be made among different regions and different&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Made by the researchers of the lateral retinaculum extracapsular release, at the same time in&#xD;
      the release of the lateral retinaculum complete retaining articular capsule and lateral&#xD;
      patellofemoral ligament, this procedure can obviously improve patellofemoral joint trajectory&#xD;
      anomalies and significantly reduce joint surface pressure, at the same time reduce the&#xD;
      surgical trauma, try to keep the original structure, can greatly reduce the postoperative&#xD;
      complications of patellofemoral joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studied in this paper in March 2021 to March 2022 to undergraduate course to see a doctor and&#xD;
      accept the lateral retinaculum capsule of external release the prospective study of 100&#xD;
      patients with follow-up, compared with preoperative and postoperative imaging data, clinical&#xD;
      manifestations, signs, etc., to evaluate the surgical effect, at the same time of resection&#xD;
      specimens for pathology and genetics research,To investigate the pathogenesis of lateral&#xD;
      patella compression syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through this study, to explore the etiology, development and outcome of the disease, is&#xD;
      helpful for the early diagnosis and treatment of the disease, avoid the irreversible injury&#xD;
      of the patient's knee joint, greatly improve the quality of life of patients, reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of knee replacement, and save medical resources.At the same time, the external&#xD;
      capsule release of the lateral retinacular joint created by the present study will have a&#xD;
      profound impact on the surgical treatment of the lateral retinacular joint.&#xD;
