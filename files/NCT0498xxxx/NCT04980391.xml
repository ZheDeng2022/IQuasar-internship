    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immune response of a&#xD;
      single intramuscular dose of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) maternal vaccine compared&#xD;
      to placebo, when administered in the second or third trimester of pregnancy in women, 15 to&#xD;
      49 years of age (YOA), with high risk pregnancies and in the infants born to the vaccinated&#xD;
      mothers.&#xD;
