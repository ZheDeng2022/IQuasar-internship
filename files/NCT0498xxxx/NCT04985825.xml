    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the anti-tumor activity, safety, tolerability, immunogenicity,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of imgatuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with enhanced antibody-dependent cellular&#xD;
      cytotoxicity (ADCC) in patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC).&#xD;
      Quality of life of patients treated with imgatuzumab will also be assessed.&#xD;
