  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to learn more about side effects of Advate when given as&#xD;
      standard treatment to people with hemophilia A who have already been treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sponsor will not be involved in how participants are treated but will provide&#xD;
      instructions on how the clinics will record what happens during the study. Participants will&#xD;
      need to visit the study doctor 5 times in total during the study. During these visits, study&#xD;
      data will be collected by the study doctor.&#xD;
