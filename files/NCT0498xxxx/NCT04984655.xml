    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research is to evaluate the feasibility and scalability of delivering a&#xD;
      30-minute novel virtual reality (VR) experience through the Oculus Quest 2 Virtual Reality&#xD;
      headset with the aim of measuring changes in: 1) patient-reported stress levels on a survey,&#xD;
      2) blood pressure, 3)heart rate, 4) respiration rate 5) heart rate variability 6) and&#xD;
      galvanic skin response in cardiology clinic and cardiac rehabilitation patients.&#xD;

      After consenting to participate, participants will be asked to complete a pre-experience&#xD;
      questionnaire. The investigators will ask participants questions to evaluate their general&#xD;
      and current state of stress as well as gather some baseline health information. Although the&#xD;
      questionnaires ask questions about anxiety, they are being conducted for research purposes,&#xD;
      so if participants are feeling anxious they should discuss this with their primary care&#xD;
      provider or other doctor. The investigators think it should take about 5 minutes to complete&#xD;
      the pre-experience questionnaire. If participants feel uncomfortable or embarrassed answering&#xD;
      any question, they may skip it. The questionnaire will not contain any information that could&#xD;
      be used to identify yparticipants. If participants do not feel comfortable answering surveys&#xD;
      then this would result in withdrawal from the study. Participants would be politely notified&#xD;
      of your withdrawal and not complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then place the VR headset over their head along with over the ear&#xD;
      headphones. The research member will ensure safety and comfort then instruct participant how&#xD;
      to begin the experience through the headset. The experience includes relaxing images, shapes,&#xD;
      and colors that change and evolve slowly. These visuals are also paired with music, which can&#xD;
      be adjusted at the start of the experience with the assistance of the researcher (participant&#xD;
      will not have to control sound or light). Participants will not have a choice as to the&#xD;
      content viewed during this experience. If at any time during the experience participant would&#xD;
      like to stop, you may feel free to signal to the researcher, ask to stop, or just remove the&#xD;
      headset and headphones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the experience, participants will be asked to complete a post-experience&#xD;
      survey. Investigators think this should take about 5 minutes to complete. Investigators will&#xD;
      again ask about stress levels. Investigators will also gather feedback from participant about&#xD;
      thoughts and attitudes towards the VR experience for stress reduction and potential&#xD;
      usefulness in cardiac rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological measures will be collected and monitored as follows: The heart rate and heart&#xD;
      rate variability will be monitored via the PolarH10 heart rate monitor and chest strap and&#xD;
      transmitted to the safely encrypted computer/tablet. There will be no info transmitted with&#xD;
      the data aside from the time/date of the collecting. This will be a continuous recording from&#xD;
      5 minutes after you sit down to complete the survey until 5 minutes after the experience. The&#xD;
      blood pressure cuff will be used 3 times: 5 minutes after you sit down but prior to the&#xD;
      experience, at 15 minutes during the experience, and at the end of the experience.&#xD;
      Respiratory rate will be observed by the researcher while you enter the survey data, and&#xD;
      every 10 minutes during the experience, then as you complete the post-survey for a total of 5&#xD;
      measurements. The galvanic skin response (sweat gland activity) sensor will be placed at the&#xD;
      same time as the heart rate monitor and will provide continuous monitoring for 5 minutes&#xD;
      prior to the start of the experience and 5 minutes post-experience.&#xD;
