      This phase III trial studies how well Mepitel Film works in reducing radiation dermatitis&#xD;
      (redness and peeling) in patients with breast cancer during radiation therapy after a&#xD;
      mastectomy. Mepitel Film may reduce the severity of skin redness and peeling in the area of&#xD;
      radiation.&#xD;

      The primary and secondary objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the ability of Mepitel Film to reduce the severity of radiation dermatitis in&#xD;
      patients undergoing post-mastectomy radiotherapy for breast cancer when compared to the&#xD;
      institutional standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KEY SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the ability of Mepitel Film to prevent radiation-induced dermatitis based on&#xD;
      a centralized, blinded provider assessment review of photographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the ability of Mepitel Film to prevent radiation-induced dermatitis based on&#xD;
      a non-blinded institutional provider assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the ability of Mepitel Film to prevent radiation-induced dermatitis based&#xD;
      on a combined patient and non-blinded institutional provider assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive standard of care skin management during radiation therapy for up to 6&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive Mepitel Film applied to breast or chest wall every week before&#xD;
      radiation therapy for up to 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 7-14 days, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year,&#xD;
      and 2 years.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Serially measured patient-completed modified Radiation Induced Skin Reaction Assessment Scale (mRISRAS) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Scores obtained at baseline (i.e. prior to the start of radiation), during weekly radiation therapy, at 10 (±4) days post-radiation therapy, and at 3-months post radiation therapy. At a given measurement time point, a patient-completed mRISRAS score ranges from 0 to 12, where higher scores correspond to increased radiation-induced skin reactions. The effect of the Mepitel Film in reducing the severity of radiation dermatitis will be defined as the between-arm difference in the summary statistic area under the curve obtained from a repeated-measures (means) mixed model.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Centralized, blinded provider-completed modified Radiation Induced Skin Reaction Assessment Scale (mRISRAS) scores obtained from a blinded grading of the photographs taken at the end of radiation therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>At the completion of radiation therapy, photographs will be obtained one hour after the removal of the Mepitel Film or immediately following completion of radiation therapy for patients on the standard of care arm. A panel of radiation oncology providers will perform the blinded, central review to score the photographs. Each provider will independently assign a provider-completed mRISRAS score to each photograph, and the average score will be calculated for each patient. The provider-completed mRISRAS score ranges from 0 to 24, where higher scores correspond to increased radiation-induced skin reactions. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be used to test for an effect of the Mepitel Film.</description>
