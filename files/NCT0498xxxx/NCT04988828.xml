      Introduction: Approximately 35% patients can not return to sports after anterior cruciate&#xD;
      ligament reconstruction(ACLR). Persistent quadriceps weakness is a factor that prevents&#xD;
      patients return to sports. Pre-operative quadriceps strength is a predictor for the outcomes&#xD;
      after ACLR. Therefore, enhancing pre-operative quadriceps is important. However, current&#xD;
      prehabilitation can not well restore quadriceps strength may be due to quadricep inhibition.&#xD;
      Whole body vibration was proposed as a promising intervention to increase muscle strength and&#xD;
      modulate quadriceps inhibition simultaneously. Therefore, this study aim to investigate if&#xD;
      whole body vibration has the efficacy of enhancing pre-operative quadriceps and modulating&#xD;
      quadricep inhibition in patients with ACL injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A randomized controlled trial was designed. Patients with primary ACL injuries, age&#xD;
      from 18-45 yrs, BMI&lt;29, physically active who awaiting ACLR will be included. Patients with&#xD;
      any previous lower-limb injuries within 1 year, any cardiovascular or metabolic disorders&#xD;
      will be excluded. All the subjects in this study have to finish their routine 5 week&#xD;
      prehabilitation as well as the interventions. The primary outcomes of this study include&#xD;
      quadriceps strength and quadriceps central activation ratio. Secondary outcomes include the&#xD;
      score of IKDC and ACL-RSI, as well as the concentrations of myokines in serum.&#xD;

      The effect of whole body vibration therapy on increasing quadriceps strength prior to&#xD;
      anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is a common knee injury in orthopaedic and&#xD;
           sports medicine. It is estimated that there are 200000 ACL injuries annually in US.&#xD;
           According to the ACL injury registry system of Scandinavia, the incidence of ACL injury&#xD;
           was about 32-38/10000 people per year. ACL reconstruction (ACLR) has been recommended as&#xD;
           the optimal treatment to restore knee passive laxity in patients with ACL injury who&#xD;
           have desire to return to sports. However, a recent meta-analysis showed that only 42% of&#xD;
           elite athletes are able to return to non-elite competitive sports following a successful&#xD;
           reconstruction and rehabilitation. About 50% of them cannot return to sports at 1 year&#xD;
           and one-third cannot return at 2 years post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Until now, the reason why some patients can have good functional recovery following&#xD;
           surgery while the others cannot is still unknown. Since the ultimate goal of ACL&#xD;
           reconstruction is to help patients return to pre-injury activity without high re-injury&#xD;
           risk, identifying those who are at high risk of poor recovery following surgery is&#xD;
           extremely essential. Some previous studies concluded that pre-operative quadriceps&#xD;
           strength is a key predictor for functional recovery post-operatively. Therefore,&#xD;
           increasing pre-operative quadriceps strength is very important. Several studies&#xD;
           implemented pre-operative rehabilitation found that part of patients still could not&#xD;
           achieve symmetrical quadriceps strength, which mainly because of injury-induced&#xD;
           arthrogenic inhibition and increased atrophy-related biomarkers makes those patients&#xD;
           have low response to traditional strength training.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It has been demonstrated that whole body vibration is an effective way in decreasing AMI&#xD;
           due to increase corticomotor excitability. Whole body vibration becomes more and more&#xD;
           popular as an additional program of physiotherapy for diverse disorders. For patients&#xD;
           with ACL injury, previous studies indicate that whole body vibration is effective in&#xD;
           improving quadriceps function, neuromuscular control and balance. There are several&#xD;
           mechanisms can explain the benefits whole body vibration therapy brought to ACLD&#xD;
           patients. Firstly, vibratory stimuli can increase the excitability of type Ia afferent&#xD;
           neuron via muscle spindles, resulting in tonic vibration reflex and enlargement of type&#xD;
           I and type II muscle fibers. Secondly, whole body vibration can decrease fast-twitch&#xD;
           motor unit recruitment thresholds immediately, leading to higher activation of muscles.&#xD;
           Thirdly, vibratory stimuli may activate proprioceptive receptors of lower limbs. On&#xD;
           molecular level, Low-amplitude high frequency vibration can down regulate Atrogin-1 mRNA&#xD;
           and myostatin expression. In addition, it also was found effective in increasing&#xD;
           circulating irisin which is a recently identified myokine levels acutely after vibration&#xD;
           exercises. Several studies also reported that whole body vibration training can reduce&#xD;
           blood concentration of TNF-αreceptors, TNF-α, IL-6 in elderly population and healthy&#xD;
           people after exercise. Based on the above, whole body vibration maybe a more efficient&#xD;
           and effective way to improve quadriceps strength prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thus, this study is primarily to answer the research question: Do patients with greater&#xD;
           quadriceps strength improvement prior to surgery also have better functional recovery&#xD;
           following ACLR? The second aim is to answer the research question: Are quadriceps&#xD;
           inhibition and altered exercise-induced myokines secretion the reasons for the patient's&#xD;
           different responses to the same intensity exercise? The third aim is to answer is whole&#xD;
           body vibration is a more effective and efficient way to improve quadriceps strength&#xD;
           prior to surgery?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A randomized control trial 2.1 Participants: Inclusion criteria: Adult; primary&#xD;
           unilateral ACL rupture; no other injuries on lower extremities; BMI &lt;30; no acute&#xD;
           symptoms of injury; waiting for ACLR Exclusion criteria: BMI≥ 30; pregnancy; any cardiac&#xD;
           or respiratory disease; refuse to accept ACLR 2.2 Interventions: Patients will be&#xD;
           randomized allocated into 2 groups: conventional group and; vibration group;&#xD;
           conventional+ strength training group; conventional +vibration group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Conventional group： strength training Vibration group: Whole body vibration therapy&#xD;
           Conventional+ vibration group: strength training+ whole body vibration therapy Strength&#xD;
           training protocol: Leg press 75% RM 10 repetitions*3 Leg extension 75% RM&#xD;
           10repetitions*3 Leg curl 75%RM 10 repetitions*3 Hip abduction 75% RM 10 repetitions*3&#xD;
           Hip adduction 75% RM 10 repetitions*3 Straight leg raise 75 RM 10 repetitions*3 Squat 1&#xD;
           min*6 repetitions ,1 min rest between each Whole body vibration (Fitvibe Excel Pro)&#xD;
           protocol: Vertical direction vibration Position: standard squat with knee 60 flexion,&#xD;
           barefoot and hands on the wrist Frequency: 20-60 Hz (adjusted with a step of 5Hz)&#xD;
           Amplitude: 2-4mm Intensity: 15-30 mins (adjusted according to patients' self-reported&#xD;
           feeling and progress)&#xD;
&#xD;
           All of the interventions will take fivefour weeks and patients need to complete 10&#xD;
           sessions of exercise at least.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to make all of the patients follow a same post-operative rehabilitation. A&#xD;
           smart phone APP illustrating our post-operative rehabilitation protocol will be&#xD;
           installed to patients' smart phones.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3Outcomes: 2.3.1 Time points for outcome measurements: baseline, after a single&#xD;
           session of WBV, pre-operation, 3 months post-operation, 9months post-operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.2 Quadriceps strength and quadriceps voluntary activation : Subjects' quadriceps&#xD;
           peak torque (both legs) measurement will be completed on an isokinetic strength&#xD;
           dynamometer (Biodex System 3, Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY, USA). During the&#xD;
           test, subjects are positioned with their hip flexed 90°and knee flexed 30°and subjects&#xD;
           are asked to try their very best to ensure the MVIC. Meanwhile, the tester will give&#xD;
           encouraging word 'harder and harder' during the process of contraction. The MVIC test&#xD;
           will repeat 3 times per subject. And sufficient rest is allowed during the interval of&#xD;
           each repeat. In order to standardize the data, individual MVIC peak torque will be&#xD;
           divided by the body mass of every subject for the further statistic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To quantify quadriceps activation ratio the superimposed burst technique will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The peak torque recorded from the MVIC test will be inputted into a software to deliver&#xD;
           a supramaximal electrical stimulus (from DS7R:10-pulses, 100 Hz train) to the quadriceps&#xD;
           muscle once the maximal knee extension torque is reached. The electrical stimulus will&#xD;
           be delivered through two self-adhesive stimulating electrodes (8 × 13cm) applied over&#xD;
           the vastus lateralis muscle proximally and the vastus medialis distally. Quadriceps&#xD;
           activation ratio will be calculated using the central activation ratio formula (CAR),&#xD;
           which is (MVIC) / (peak torque generated by the stimulus) *100. A CAR of 100 was used to&#xD;
           represent complete quadriceps activation. CAR values that were ≥ 95 were considered to&#xD;
           be 'normal' and/or representative of a healthy CAR value. The maximal CAR value that is&#xD;
           collected will be used for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           CAR= MVIC/(MVIC+ST) *100%&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.3 Quadriceps thickness: Previous studies have confirmed that quadriceps size could&#xD;
           be accurately predicted from a single MRI scan at the middle level of the thigh. In this&#xD;
           study, considering the cost-inefficiency of MRI examination, shear-wave elastography&#xD;
           ultrasound (version 6.0; Supersonic Imagine, Aix-en-Provence, France) will be used to&#xD;
           estimate quadriceps CSA since several studies demonstrate that ultrasound is a reliable&#xD;
           tool for quantification of muscle CSA. Furthermore, Abe T et al. found there is a high&#xD;
           correlation(r=0.91) between muscle thickness and CSA of quadriceps. And Franchi et al.&#xD;
           support the use of ultrasound-measured middle level quadriceps thickness for monitoring&#xD;
           long-term hypertrophic response induced by resistant strength training as an alternative&#xD;
           to the much more expensive MRI examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.4 Functional performance (sSingle leg hop; postural control): The single leg hop&#xD;
           (SLH) test will be performed as previous studies reported. Before testing, patients will&#xD;
           be required to complete a 5 min warm-up on a stationary exercise bike. A general&#xD;
           instruction about the jumping task &quot;Stand on one leg, jump as far possible and land on&#xD;
           the same leg&quot; will be given. Three trials will be performed with each leg followed by&#xD;
           familiarization. The SLH will be deemed correctly if the patient is able to achieve&#xD;
           maximal hop distance while maintaining balance for at least 2 s after landing. Patients&#xD;
           will be asked to start with their non-injured leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Biodex Stability System (with software version 3.1, Biodex Medical Systems) will be&#xD;
           used to evaluate postural control. Participants will be positioned with both feet on the&#xD;
           platform and in a comfortable position with knee flexion around 15°. The foot positions&#xD;
           recorded in the first session will be used at all subsequent assessments. Each patient&#xD;
           have to maintain the static position with the platform progressively decreased in&#xD;
           stability from level 8 to level 4 within 25 seconds. There will be a total of 3 trials,&#xD;
           with a 10-second resting time between. The mean ±standard deviation of the OSI, API, and&#xD;
           MLI will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.5 Patients reported outcomes: The subjective functional outcome will be evaluated by&#xD;
           Lysholm knee scoring system, the IKDC subjective scoring system and Tegner activity&#xD;
           score. Psychological readiness for return-to-play will be evaluated by ACL-RSI. The IKDC&#xD;
           is consisted of 10 questions about symptoms and activity ranging from 0 to 100 where 100&#xD;
           implies perfect knee function. The Tegner score is an activity level scaled from 1 (low&#xD;
           activity) to 10 (very high activity). The ACL-RSI scale with 12 items measures three&#xD;
           specific psychological constructs-emotions, confidence in performance and risk&#xD;
           appraisal-on a scale from 0 to 100. This scale is a predictive parameter for a&#xD;
           successful RTS after ACLR.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.6 Biomarkers in blood serum: Blood will be taken at baseline, at 30 mins after 1 day&#xD;
           exercises and when after completion 4 weeks exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The technique for serum sampling was reported by Perez-Lopez et al . Blood samples will&#xD;
           be centrifuged for 15 minutes at 1000 g and stored at -80°C. Two high-sensitivity&#xD;
           enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits will be used to determine the serum&#xD;
           concentration of IL-15, IL-15Rα, myostatin, IL-6, IL-10, IGF-1, irisin in duplicates.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.7 Swelling and pain assessment: (will be measured 1 week and 3 months&#xD;
           post-operatively) Knee joint swelling will be evaluated by measurement of mid-patellar&#xD;
           girth with a standard tape measure (tape width = 8 mm). Difference between injured side&#xD;
           and contralateral side will be recorded for further analysis. The same experienced&#xD;
           researcher will perform the measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pain will be estimated by the well-established numerical pain rating scaleThe&#xD;
           well-established numerical pain rating scale will estimate pain. Patients will finish&#xD;
           this scale based on their subjective feeling according to the introduction on the scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.8 Knee passive laxity The knee passive laxity will be measured by KT-1000 knee&#xD;
           arthrometer. The KT-1000 is an objective instrument for ACL injury and reconstruction,&#xD;
           which measures anterior tibial motion relative to the femur. The test involves strapping&#xD;
           the KT-1000 to the leg, pulling the tibia anteriorly, and quantifying the amount of&#xD;
           movement in millimeters (mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.9 Motivation and Social Cognitive Variable and Rehabilitation Adherence For&#xD;
           measuring treatment motivation, the injury rehabilitation version of Treatment&#xD;
           Self-Regulation Questionnaire will be used. The questionnaire has been used among ACL&#xD;
           patients in Hong Kong and has received supporting evidence for its validity and&#xD;
           reliability. For measuring the variables from the theory of planned behaviour, the&#xD;
           Chinese injury rehabilitation version of the Theory of Planned Behaviour Scale that has&#xD;
           been developed and validated from previous studies about injury rehabilitation will be&#xD;
           used .&#xD;
&#xD;
           The rehabilitation adherence will be estimated by the Self-Reported Injury&#xD;
           Rehabilitation Adherence Scale. The scale is one of the most widely used self-reported&#xD;
           instrument that has been validated in Chinese language, and it has also been used among&#xD;
           ACL patients for measuring their rehabilitation adherence with strong evidence to&#xD;
           support its psychometric properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quadriceps strength was used as the primary outcome. With an estimated effect size of 0.3 for&#xD;
      the increase in quadriceps strength after WBV based on a similar study and assuming a 20%&#xD;
      attrition rate, it was demonstrated that each group should recruit 50 subjects, and 125160 in&#xD;
      total. Baseline characteristics will be tested using independent t tests for parametric&#xD;
      parameters and the x2 test for nonparametric parameters. Repeated-measures analysis of&#xD;
      variance (ANOVA) with time as the repeated-measures factor for the outcomes measure will be&#xD;
      used to analyze the difference between the 24 groups. Tests of within-patient effect were&#xD;
      utilized to find any difference between different time intervals in each group. Contrast with&#xD;
      F statistics will be used to detect the difference at different time points in the post hoc&#xD;
      analysis. The Mann-Whitney U test will be employed to compare for any difference between the&#xD;
      24 groups in the outcome variables. For all statistical tests, the alpha level will be set at&#xD;
      0.05 and performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM SPSS Ver. 24).&#xD;
