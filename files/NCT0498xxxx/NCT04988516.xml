  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: For Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to work as intended, the patient must remain&#xD;
      still while laying down within a confined space with very loud sounds for a period varying&#xD;
      from 30 to 60 minutes. Oftentimes, anxious children may become restless during the exam&#xD;
      leading to uncontrolled movements resulting in undiagnostic images. As a consequence, this&#xD;
      may result in a premature termination of the procedure itself, requiring the exam to be&#xD;
      repeated ulteriorly, thus, causing subsequent episodes of anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators believe that an Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) intervention in&#xD;
      the format of an interactive video game to prepare participants prior to an MRI exam is easy&#xD;
      to use and could help decrease MRI-related procedural anxiety in children from 7 to 17 years&#xD;
      old. The investigators also believe that a patient who can follow the instructions well,&#xD;
      without any signs of anxiety detected by physiological parameters, will have better results&#xD;
      in the MRI than a patient who has difficulty following the instructions and/or who shows&#xD;
      signs of anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study will first consists of a field test phase with 10 participants (10% of&#xD;
      the total sample size calculated) to address the feasibility and acceptability of the VR&#xD;
      intervention. Following the field test, a randomized clinical trial design using a parallel&#xD;
      design with two groups will be used: 1) experimental group (pre-procedural IVR game&#xD;
      preparation), 2) usual care group (standard care as per radiology department's protocol) in&#xD;
      an equal ratio of 49 participants (between 7-17 years old) per group for a total of 98&#xD;
      participants. Participants will be identified through the radiology information system as&#xD;
      having an appointment for an upcoming MRI. Measures of procedure related-anxiety with the&#xD;
      French-Canadian version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC-F) and also&#xD;
      the Child Fear Scale (CFS, 0-4) will be taken before the intervention (T0), immediately after&#xD;
      the intervention (T1) and after the MRI procedure (T2). Socio-demographic and clinical&#xD;
      characteristics will be assessed at T0, and physiological data will be collected throughout&#xD;
      the simulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: The investigators believe that results of this study could help transforming the&#xD;
      known negative and maybe traumatic experience children go through into a more positive one.&#xD;
      It is believe that this may help reduce the rate of MRI retakes needed due to movements&#xD;
      during imaging.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a medical procedure that is considered non-invasive and&#xD;
      safe. For MRI to work as intended, the patient must remain still while laying down within a&#xD;
      confined space for a certain amount of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scan environment may be a source of anxiety for some patients. This can be due to the&#xD;
      claustrophobic nature of a narrow space. MRIs have been known for almost forty years to&#xD;
      generate fear and anxiety caused by claustrophobia. In addition, MRI scanners generate loud&#xD;
      clicking sounds while running. These loud acoustic noises may be as loud as 100dB (decibels).&#xD;
      Not surprisingly, up to 30% of patients undergoing MRIs had anxiety-related reactions of&#xD;
      various degree of intensity. Interviews performed with small children and their parents&#xD;
      revealed that MRIs caused anxiety in children because of their size, design and sounds.&#xD;
      Oftentimes, anxious children may become restless during the exam leading to uncontrolled&#xD;
      movements resulting in undiagnostic images. As a consequence, this may result in a premature&#xD;
      termination of the procedure itself, requiring the exam to be repeated ulteriorly, thus,&#xD;
      causing subsequent episodes of anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, it is becoming common practice in many hospitals' radiology department to&#xD;
      require conscious sedation as the frequency of repeated MRI scans are higher within the&#xD;
      pediatric population. However, sedation is not without any risk or consequences. Emerging&#xD;
      evidence suggests that sedation in children might have long-term neurocognitive side effects,&#xD;
      in addition to the short-term procedure-related risks. As some authors also pointed out, its&#xD;
      use is also related to an increase amount of fear in children and their parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Like any medication, there is always a risk for adverse reactions. For this reason, many&#xD;
      efforts have been put into the development of non-pharmacological methods to reduce fear and&#xD;
      anxiety in children requiring MRI scans. Many interventions ranging from music and artwork to&#xD;
      videogames have been used and deemed useful to relieve anxiety in children during an MRI&#xD;
      exam. Interventions done prior to the scan have also been investigated. Among these,&#xD;
      pre-procedural patient education has been shown to decrease anxiety and enhance comprehension&#xD;
      of MRI exams, which in turn, can serve to increase patient collaboration. Mock MRI scanners,&#xD;
      which involve using a full-size replica scanner for a 5-minute training session to lie still,&#xD;
      have been used to help explain to children what the procedure involves and what to expect in&#xD;
      an age-appropriate manner. This preparation has been reported to reduce MRI-related&#xD;
      procedural anxiety, rate of motion artifacts, need for sedation, overall duration of the&#xD;
      study, as well as a decrease in heart rate during the procedure. However, a shortcoming of&#xD;
      mock replica is that there is limited availability in hospitals, since the mock MRI machine&#xD;
      would require a room to store, as well as additional resources, including staff and time, to&#xD;
      organize these sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since physical mock sessions prior to MRI scans have shown promising results, virtual reality&#xD;
      (VR) used to replicate an MRI environment can also be used as patient preparation.&#xD;
      Pre-procedural virtual reality education has been studied in different medical procedures,&#xD;
      including chest radiography, dental procedures, anesthesia and surgeries. These studies show&#xD;
      that VR preparation helps improve procedural experience among pediatric patients by reducing&#xD;
      anxiety, distress and procedure time while increasing parents' satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, very few studies seemed to have looked at the effect of virtual&#xD;
      reality (VR) on anxiety of children scheduled for an MRI scan specifically and how this&#xD;
      intervention could help identified which children are more responsive to VR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are three-fold: 1- to develop an algorithm of predictability based on&#xD;
      biofeedback ; 2- to address feasibility and acceptability of a pre-procedural immersive VR&#xD;
      (IVR) game preparation before an MRI for children's anxiety (field test phase) and 3- to&#xD;
      examine the efficacy of a pre-procedural IVR game preparation compared to usual care for the&#xD;
      management of procedural anxiety in children undergoing an MRI (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that an IVR intervention in the format of an interactive video game&#xD;
      to prepare participants prior to an MRI exam is easy to use and could help decrease&#xD;
      MRI-related procedural anxiety in children from 7 to 17 years old. The investigators also&#xD;
      believe that a patient who can follow the instructions well, without any signs of anxiety&#xD;
      detected by physiological parameters, will have better results in the MRI than a patient who&#xD;
      has difficulty following the instructions and/or who shows signs of anxiety through his&#xD;
      physiological parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary research question is: for children undergoing magnetic resonance imaging, will a&#xD;
      pre-procedural interactive IVR game preparation decrease their MRI-related procedural&#xD;
      anxiety?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the secondary objectives of the scientific clinical validation phases are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if pre-procedural IVR game preparation is a feasible and acceptable&#xD;
      non-pharmacological method to decrease MRI-related procedural anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if children experiencing pre-procedural IVR game preparation will have a slower&#xD;
      heart rate prior to and during the MRI than children not exposed to the IVR game preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if children experiencing pre-procedural IVR game preparation will require less&#xD;
      need for sedation than children not exposed to the IVR game preparation prior to an MRI exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if children experiencing pre-procedural IVR game preparation will require less&#xD;
      rescheduling of exam than children not exposed to the IVR game preparation prior to an MRI&#xD;
      exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the occurrence of side effects with pre-procedural IVR game preparation in&#xD;
      comparison to children not exposed to the IVR game preparation prior to an MRI exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare healthcare professionals' satisfaction levels between pre-procedural IVR game&#xD;
      preparation and usual care groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare children's and parents' satisfaction levels between pre-procedural IVR game&#xD;
      preparation and usual care groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare overall procedure time required for MRI exam between pre-procedural IVR game&#xD;
      preparation and usual care groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop a predictability algorithm that will help identify which children will have better&#xD;
      results in the MRI following the IVR game preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This study will first consists of a field test phase with 10 participants (10% of the&#xD;
      total sample size calculated) to initiate the development of a predictive algorithm for&#xD;
      biofeedback solution requiring actual participants and to address the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of the VR intervention and research process. Following the field test, a&#xD;
      scientific clinical validation based on a randomized clinical trial design using a parallel&#xD;
      design with two groups will be used: 1) experimental group (pre-procedural IVR game&#xD;
      preparation), 2) usual care group (standard care as per radiology department's protocol) in&#xD;
      an equal ratio of 49 participants per group for a total of 98 participants including a&#xD;
      correction for an attrition rate of 24%, established according to the 2020 radiology records&#xD;
      at the study setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample and Settings: Recruitment will be done at Maisonneuve-Rosemont hospital in Montreal, a&#xD;
      general care hospital with a pediatric unit and services. Participants will be identified&#xD;
      through the radiology information system as having an appointment for an upcoming MRI. A&#xD;
      research nurse will be notified by the radiology technologist and will proceed to contact the&#xD;
      parents for recruitment ahead of time before their arrival to the radiology department. On&#xD;
      the day of the appointment, parents will be approached to sign the consent if the parents&#xD;
      still agree to the study. Child assent will also be obtained on the same day. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      due to the COVID-19 sanitary crisis, recruiting personnel availability and the difficulty of&#xD;
      movement between units and departments, recruitment will be limited to the radiology&#xD;
      department. According to the statistics in year 2020, 145 MRI procedures were prescribed for&#xD;
      children between the age of 7 to 17 years at this setting, but actually 193 procedures were&#xD;
      done because of delays and repeating procedures. Thus, an attrition rate of 24% which was&#xD;
      considered in the calculation of the sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures and outcomes: Timepoints. Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics will be&#xD;
      assessed in the waiting room to establish baseline at T0. Measures of procedure&#xD;
      related-anxiety with the French-Canadian version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for&#xD;
      Children (STAIC-F) and also the Child Fear Scale (CFS, 0-4) will be taken before the&#xD;
      intervention (T0), immediately after the intervention (T1) and after the MRI procedure (T2).&#xD;
      A measure of healthcare professionals, parents, and participants' level of satisfaction via a&#xD;
      questionnaire developed and pretested by the team will also be collected at T2. Physiological&#xD;
      signs such as heart rate, skin conductance, hand temperature and muscle tension via an EMG&#xD;
      will be collected throughout the simulation. Data will be collected on the occurrence of side&#xD;
      effects and throughout the study. Clinical monitoring will be performed by an independent&#xD;
      nurse from the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Primary analysis will involve the comparison of two group means. In addition, no&#xD;
      interim analysis will be conducted. Therefore, group sample sizes of 37 (i.e. 74 in total)&#xD;
      are necessary to achieve 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of equal means when the&#xD;
      population mean difference for State anxiety score is 5 with a standard deviation for both&#xD;
      groups of 7.47 and a significance level (alpha) of 5% using a two-sided t-test. Standard&#xD;
      deviation for both groups was varying from 4.61 to 7.47. In order to be conservative, the&#xD;
      biostatistician chose 7.47. Based on data from the medical imaging registry, the attrition&#xD;
      rate was approximately 24%. Assuming a similar attrition rate, a total of 98 participants (49&#xD;
      per group) will be required. The sample size calculation was performed using PASS Software&#xD;
      (version 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis plan: Analyses will be conducted using the statistical analysis software SAS&#xD;
      (Statistical Analysis System)(version 9.4). Descriptive statistics will be conducted for&#xD;
      socio-demographic and clinical variables and presented by treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for age, sex, baseline (T0) Trait anxiety score&#xD;
      measurement and baseline State anxiety score measurement will be used to assess the mean&#xD;
      difference in State anxiety scores on the STAIC-S, between the experimental and the control&#xD;
      groups at T2. Analyses will be carried out according to the intention-to-treat principle,&#xD;
      with a significance level (α) of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ANCOVA adjusted for age, sex and baseline anxiety score measurement will be used to assess&#xD;
      the mean difference in anxiety scores on the CFS, between the experimental and the control&#xD;
      groups at T2. To assess the mean difference in the sense of presence in VR and engagement&#xD;
      into the game (GRS), between the experimental and the control groups at T1, an ANCOVA&#xD;
      adjusted for age and sex will also be conducted. The biostatistician will use a linear mixed&#xD;
      model to estimate the effect of the treatment on the changes in heart rate over all&#xD;
      assessment timepoints. This analysis will be adjusted for age, sex and baseline heart rate.&#xD;
      Differences between arms for Parents, children and healthcare professionals' levels of&#xD;
      satisfaction (T2) as well as the overall procedure time will be assessed using Student's&#xD;
      t-tests or nonparametric Mann Whitney U Test if data are non-normal. Chi-squared Test or&#xD;
      Fisher's Exact Test will be conducted to compare dichotomous variables including the&#xD;
      occurrence of side effects, the number of rescheduled MRI and use of sedation in each group.&#xD;
