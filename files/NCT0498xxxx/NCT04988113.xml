      Delayed presentation is not uncommon in children and may have been treated as asthma due to&#xD;
      associated with low-grade cough and noisy breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Late diagnoses of foreign body aspiration were defined as occurring beyond 3 days after the&#xD;
      aspiration of the foreign body, or onset of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Undiagnosed foreign body aspiration can cause mechanical effects, chemical reactions, and the&#xD;
      most common complications were pneumonia, asthma, lung collapse, bronchiectasis, emphysema,&#xD;
      mediastinal shift, atelectasis and lung abscess. Long-term presence of FBs in the bronchus&#xD;
      may lead to bronchial stenosis&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A foreign body is an endogenous or exogenous substance, different from the anatomy of the&#xD;
      site where it is found. Chevalier Jackson defined a foreign body as &quot;an object or a substance&#xD;
      that is foreign to its location&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspiration of a foreign body (FB) is a potentially life-threatening emergency and 75% of&#xD;
      cases occur in children younger than 3 years of age, due to the absence of molar teeth,&#xD;
      underdeveloped swallowing coordination and the tendency to talk and play while eating .&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, foreign body aspiration does happen in adults and elderly people as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtaining a good history plays a vital role in effectively diagnosing a foreign body&#xD;
      aspiration. Three clinical phases of aspiration of foreign bodies are recognized: The first&#xD;
      stage is the impaction of the foreign body and entitled &quot;penetration syndrome,&quot; defined as a&#xD;
      sudden onset of choking and intractable cough with or without vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage, these symptoms diminish as the foreign body settles into a stationary&#xD;
      location and the tracheoesophageal reflexes tire out; this asymptomatic stage can last hours&#xD;
      to weeks, which may delay diagnosis. In the third phase, Complications occur (also defined as&#xD;
      Complications phase), when obstruction, erosion or infection cause pneumonia, atelectasis,&#xD;
      abscess or fever. The first presentation of the condition may actually represent a&#xD;
      complication of inhaled foreign body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed presentation is not uncommon in children and may have been treated as asthma due to&#xD;
      associated with low-grade cough and noisy breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Late diagnoses of foreign body aspiration were defined as occurring beyond 3 days after the&#xD;
      aspiration of the foreign body, or onset of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Undiagnosed foreign body aspiration can cause mechanical effects, chemical reactions, and the&#xD;
      most common complications were pneumonia, asthma, lung collapse, bronchiectasis, emphysema,&#xD;
      mediastinal shift, atelectasis and lung abscess. Long-term presence of FBs in the bronchus&#xD;
      may lead to bronchial stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neglected foreign bodies in the respiratory tract may occur due to misdiagnosis by the fellow&#xD;
      professionals and pediatricians when FBs in the upper tracheal airway produce symptoms&#xD;
      similar to those of viral subglottic croup or due to lack of typical symptoms and signs. The&#xD;
      most common symptoms and signs of FBA, namely coughing, wheezing, and decreased air entry,&#xD;
      can easily be overlooked by bronchial asthma or pneumonia. Parental negligence, not&#xD;
      conclusive chest radiographs, and false negative bronchoscopic findings are other blamed&#xD;
      factors&#xD;
