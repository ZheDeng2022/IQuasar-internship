    <textblock>
      This prospective trial will be a single-center, participant-blinded, randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. It is reported in previous studies that both acupuncture and transcutaneous electrical&#xD;
      nerve stimulation are effective in reducing neck pain comparing to placebo or exercise.&#xD;
      Taking into account the convenience of electro-thumbtack needle therapy shown in clinical&#xD;
      practice, this study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of electro-thumbtack needle&#xD;
      therapy for alleviating chronic neck pain compared with sham electro-thumbtack needle&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic neck pain is a commonly experienced symptom that often influences work efficiency and&#xD;
      life satisfaction for years. A total of 180 participants suffering mechanical chronic neck&#xD;
      pain will be recruited and randomized into either electro-thumbtack needle therapy group or&#xD;
      sham electro-thumbtack needle therapy group. All participants will receive the standardized&#xD;
      neck exercise instruction at their first treatment session and will be asked to perform the&#xD;
      exercise once every day during 4-week treatment. All assessments will be performed by the&#xD;
      assessor and the assessment results will be all kept from the acupuncturist. The statistician&#xD;
      will be involved in neither assessment nor treatment and will be blinded regarding&#xD;
      intervention group code.&#xD;

    <description>Each treatment session starts with sterilizing acupoints. Dazhui (GV14), bilateral Wangu (GB12), bilateral cervical Jiaji (at C4 and C6 level), two Ashi points and bilateral Houxi (SI3) have been selected in accordance with the principle of acupuncture prescription making and the consensus of experts on treating neck pain. Electro-thumbtack needles (0.25Ã—2 mm) will be held by the acupuncturist between thumb and forefinger, vertically inserted into skin instantly and taped well on skin. Then assemble the gel electrodes to the surface of the conductive adhesive tape, also assemble the portable stimulation devices, adjust the current intensity from level 1 to a proper level that the participant can tolerate. Participants will receive three 30-min treatment sessions per week every other day for 4 consecutive weeks.</description>

    <description>Each treatment session starts with sterilizing acupoints. Sham electro-thumbtack needles (0.25Ã—0.2 mm) will be held by the acupuncturist between thumb and forefinger, taped well on skin without penetration. The adhesive tape of needles are also produced with conductive material, after assembling the gel electrodes and the portable stimulation devices, adjust the current intensity to level 1 for a minimal stimulus which will last for only 30 seconds. By this time the acupuncturist will turn the device off to cut the current. Participants will receive three 30-min treatment sessions per week every other day for 4 consecutive weeks.</description>
