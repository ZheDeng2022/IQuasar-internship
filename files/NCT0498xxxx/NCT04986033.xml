  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative anemia is present in more than 50% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, which&#xD;
      is associated with increased risk of transfusion, increased length of stay in the intensive&#xD;
      care unit, and increased incidence of renal failure and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, clinical research on perioperative anemia has been focused on finding and treating&#xD;
      other underlying causes of anemia, lowering the threshold for transfusion, and performing&#xD;
      careful transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, recently, it was known that hepcidin and erythroferrone are related to iron&#xD;
      metabolism and absorption, vitamin D has an inverse correlation with the development of&#xD;
      anemia, and is related to hepcidin concentration control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study, the relationship between vitamin D, hepcidin concentration and&#xD;
      perioperative hemoglobin level in patients with off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery&#xD;
      was investigated together.&#xD;

    <description>Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, a regulator acting on bone and calcium metabolism, and is known to affect the pathophysiology of several chronic diseases, and is particularly closely related to heart disease.&#xD;
Vitamin D deficiency was observed in 56% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and low vitamin D concentrations increased the risk of postoperative infection and organ failure, atrial fibrillation, and delirium.&#xD;
It is also known that vitamin D is closely related to anemia by regulating the secretion of erythroferrone and changing the concentration of hepcidin.</description>
