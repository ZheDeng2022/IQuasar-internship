      Virtual and simulatorbased learning is not widely available in LMIC. It is imperative to&#xD;

    <textblock>
      COVID-19 pandemic has introduced us to a greater need of virtual learning platforms and has&#xD;
      resulted in less clinical exposure for fellows-in-training. Virtual and simulatorbased&#xD;
      learning is not widely available in LMIC. It is imperative to analyze feedback of CV&#xD;
      fellow-in-training regarding this mode of learning before large scale implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was an observational study conducted between July-August 2020. A multicentered survey&#xD;
      was conducted. Survey questionnaire was disseminated to FIT via Google Forms. The&#xD;
      questionnaire contained total of 24 questions about virtual and simulator-based learning&#xD;
      during the pandemic.&#xD;
