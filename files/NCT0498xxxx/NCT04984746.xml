      The aim of the project is to study the influence of Lettuce crop enriched with Molybdenum and&#xD;
      lettuce enriched with Iodine administrated at the same time on healthy population in order to&#xD;
      assess influence on hematological parameter and Thyroid hormones. Secondary outcome will be&#xD;
      to find out Molybdenum and Iodine presence in urine in order to evaluate vegetables as&#xD;
      biocarrier and any additive effect when administrated all together.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Several human pathologies are caused by deficiencies of some mineral elements. These&#xD;
      deficiencies can be overcome through careful dietary diversification and mineral&#xD;
      supplementation. Increasing the bioavailable mineral concentration in vegetables for human&#xD;
      consumption could be a useful tool for prevention of many harmful pathologies. Therefore, in&#xD;
      this scenario, it appears very important to identify the right dosages and the most effective&#xD;
      methods of administration to bio-fortify vegetables with a strong nutritional-health&#xD;
      connotation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project aims to investigate the benefits of fortified food intake in a cohort of&#xD;
      healthy individuals. Specifically, participants will be fed with lettuce enriched with&#xD;
      Molybdenum and lettuce enriched with Iodine in order to study any additional influence on&#xD;
      hematological parameters of both minerals The healthy group will eat 100 gr of Lettuce with&#xD;
      iodine and 100gr of lettuce with Molybdenum and collect plasma and urine samples after 10&#xD;
      days. Each subject will be subjected to two venous blood samples taken at the beginning of&#xD;
      the observation and at the end. The samples obtained will be transported in certified&#xD;
      containers for the safe transport of biological samples, and, subsequently, processed by the&#xD;
      experimenters at the laboratories of the Molecular Biology section of the University of&#xD;
      Palermo. Serum and plasma will be obtained from each blood sample. All information thus&#xD;
      obtained will be recorded in a database in which each person will be identified with a&#xD;
      numerical code, in order to comply with current privacy regulations. Body weight, Barefoot&#xD;
      standing height, Body mass index, Body composition will be measured in the different groups&#xD;
      of study. Samples will be analyzed and compared for glucose, albumin, total cholesterol,&#xD;
      HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, creatinine, AST, ALT, γ-GT, ALP,&#xD;
      bilirubin, Ferritin, free Iron, transferrin, total proteins, Magnesium, Calcium, insulin,&#xD;
      osteocalcin, hematocrit, hs-CRP, TSH, FT3, FT4. Bone metabolism (Osteocalcin, parathyroid&#xD;
      hormone, CTX, Calcitonin), Vitamin D Calcium, Phosphate, Potassium, gastric hormones ( GIP,&#xD;
      GLP1, GLP2, ghrelin, glucagon, PYY, CCK) oxidative stress markers (LDL-ox, AGE, urinary&#xD;
      8-iso-prostaglandin F (PGF)2alpha) and inflammatory markers(IL-1, TNF, IL-6, IL-10)&#xD;
