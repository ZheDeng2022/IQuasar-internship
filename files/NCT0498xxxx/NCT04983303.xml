  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venipuncture, a frequently performed needle-related procedure, is one of the foremost&#xD;
      frightening experiences, and a typical source of moderate to severe pain for pediatric&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No randomized studies have compared the effectiveness of balloon inﬂation, cough trick, and&#xD;
      TICK-B on reducing pain in children between 6 and 12 years old during the drawing of venous&#xD;
      blood samples. The research hypothesis was that children who draw and color a picture, inﬂate&#xD;
      a balloon, or perform the cough trick while having their blood taken would experience less&#xD;
      pain and anxiety than children who did not undergo a pain-reducing intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the roles of the TICK-B, balloon inflation, and cough trick in relieving pain and&#xD;
      fear of school-age children during venipuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the effect of TICK-B with the effects of the cough trick, balloon inflation, on&#xD;
      reducing pain and anxiety during venipuncture in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the effects of three distraction groups with the control group in relieving pain&#xD;
      and anxiety during venipuncture.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Venipuncture, a frequently performed needle-related procedure, is one of the foremost&#xD;
      frightening experiences, and a typical source of moderate to severe pain for pediatric&#xD;
      patients. Approximately 83% of young children aged 2.5-6 years, 51% of youngsters aged 7-12&#xD;
      years, and 28% of adolescents (aged more than 12 years) who underwent venipuncture stated&#xD;
      high levels of distress during the painful procedure. However, &lt; 10% of venipuncture&#xD;
      performing are given pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To relieve pain, fear, and anxiety in children undergoing venipuncture or venous cannulation,&#xD;
      both pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches are used to help control pediatric&#xD;
      patients' discomfort. Pain management includes pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic&#xD;
      approaches. The most commonly used pharmacological approach to decrease medical&#xD;
      procedure-related pain is the application of topical anesthetic creams. Non-pharmacological&#xD;
      methods include distraction actions like blowing bubbles, reading, or playing a game.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balloon inﬂation causes a reduction in venous return with increased intrathoracic pressure.&#xD;
      It has been speculated that this increase in pressure induces baroreceptor activation with&#xD;
      contraction of the pulmonary vessels and that the activation of cardiopulmonary and&#xD;
      sinoaortic baroreceptor reﬂex arcs has an antinociceptive effect, resulting in pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coughing increases intrathoracic pressure and stimulation to the autonomic nervous system,&#xD;
      causing an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, a higher level of pressure in the&#xD;
      subarachnoid space, and baroreceptor activation. The increase in pressure in the subarachnoid&#xD;
      space activates the segmental pain inhibiting pathways; thus, the increase in blood pressure&#xD;
      and baroreceptor activation appears to be efﬁcacious in reducing the perception of pain.&#xD;
