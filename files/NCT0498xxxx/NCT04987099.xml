  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to examine cognitive and affective outcomes in the offspring of&#xD;
      women supplemented with choline vs. control during pregnancy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Choline, an essential nutrient, plays numerous important roles in fetal development. However&#xD;
      &gt;90% of pregnant women in the U.S. consume less than the recommended amount, and choline is&#xD;
      typically absent from most prenatal vitamins. Moreover, current choline recommendations for&#xD;
      pregnant women may be inadequate for optimal fetal development and lifelong health. Animal&#xD;
      studies clearly show that maternal choline supplementation (MCS) improves offspring memory,&#xD;
      attention, and emotion regulation. The purpose of this study is to examine cognitive and&#xD;
      affective outcomes in the offspring of women supplemented with choline vs. control during the&#xD;
      second and third trimesters of pregnancy.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Effects of Maternal Choline Supplementation on Infant Visual Recognition Memory: Developmental Trajectory Analysis of the Novelty Preference Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Infant ages of 5, 7, 10, and 13 months</time_frame>
    <description>The composite novelty score (proportion of looking to the novel image) is obtained from a series of 9 visual paired comparison tests. The novelty score is a measure of visual recognition memory for infants and has been shown to predict cognitive outcomes in childhood. This analysis will assess developmental trajectories for performance on this task across the first year of life (ages 5, 7, 10, and 13 months).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Effects of Maternal Choline Supplementation on Infant Visual Attention: Mean Orienting Speed Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Infant ages of 5, 7, 10, and 13 months</time_frame>
    <description>Visual attention orienting speed is measured by the latency to initiate a stimulus-guided fixation shift to a peripheral visual target (mean of up to 20 target presentations). The orienting score is found to be sensitive to maternal choline supplementation in infants of this age and has shown acceptable test-retest reliability and prediction of attention, memory, and intelligence quotient outcomes in childhood. This analysis will assess the within-subject age-adjusted mean saccade latency obtained from tests repeated at ages 5, 7, 10, and 13 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Effects of Maternal Choline Supplementation on Infant Sustained Focused Attention: Mean Sustained Focused Attention Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Infant ages of 5, 7, 10, and 13 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sustained focused attention is measured during a 5-minute period in which infants are engaged in solitary play with a complex toy. The score is the average duration of infant engagement in a state of focused attention on the toy. Infants who sustain focused attention for longer durations have been found to have fewer attentional problems as children. This analysis will assess the within-subject age-adjusted mean duration of focused attention obtained from tests repeated at ages 5, 7, 10, and 13 months.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Effects of Maternal Choline Supplementation on Emotion Regulation: Lab-TAB/Frustation Task Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Infant ages of 7, 10, and 13 months</time_frame>
    <description>Negative affect in response to goal blockage is measured by coding of infant facial expression, vocalization, and body language over the course of four sequential task trials to produce composite scores of negative affect. Infants' ability to regulate negative affect during the task has been found to predict aggressiveness at age three and has been associated with non-compliance in toddlerhood.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Effects of Maternal Choline Supplementation on Emotion Regulation: Face-to-Face Still-Face Paradigm Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Infant ages of 7, 10, and 13 months</time_frame>
    <description>Infant negative affect in response to a violation of social expectations for interactions with a parent (the parent not engaging with infant's social cues and maintaining a neutral expression) is measured by coding of infant negative vocalizations (crying, screaming, etc.) over the course of three sequential task trials to produce composite scores of negative affect. Infants' behavior in this task has been shown to predict later attachment, internalizing, and externalizing behaviors in toddlerhood and early childhood.</description>
