  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof-of-concept randomized clinical trial of psilocybin-enhanced psychotherapy&#xD;
      versus treatment-as-usual among individuals being treated for methamphetamine use disorder.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will take place with individuals admitted to a residential rehabilitation treatment&#xD;
      program. The treatment protocol will consist of 4 preparatory therapy visits, 2 psilocybin&#xD;
      sessions (25-30mg), and 8 total integration therapy visits. Primary aims assess&#xD;
      acceptability, feasibility, and safety with a primary endpoint at the conclusion of the study&#xD;
      intervention. An additional aim assesses preliminary efficacy for methamphetamine use&#xD;
      disorder and overall functioning at follow-up assessments 60 and 180 days after discharge&#xD;
      from the residential treatment program.&#xD;
