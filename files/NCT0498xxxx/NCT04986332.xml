      The MACH Study trial will examine the impact on high complexity COPD patients of a&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MACH Study investigators designed a trial to evaluate in high complexity subjects (at least 2&#xD;
      chronic diseases):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in the COPD cohort, the impact of a multidimensional approach involving global&#xD;
           therapeutic remodeling (re-assessing and therapeutic optimization of the whole burden of&#xD;
           chronic pathologic conditions) plus a 24-weeks moderate intensity physical activity&#xD;
           program on: number of total and severe exacerbations; number of total and COPD/related&#xD;
           hospitalizations; quality of life; survival over a 36 months follow-up period;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to establish whether a higher index of comorbidity and polypharmacy is independently&#xD;
           associated with a worst clinical severity of COPD, an increased risk of exacerbations&#xD;
           and a reduced survival;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the role played by specific clinical-laboratory markers of comorbidity (blood iron&#xD;
           profile, hemochromocytometric parameters, renal function, blood pressure profile,&#xD;
           glycemic compensation, Body Mass Index, lipid profile) and specific multidimensional&#xD;
           tests in identifying COPD patients with higher clinical risk of rapid disease decline&#xD;
           and/or higher risk of exacerbations and COPD-related hospitalizations;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to establish the role of Heart Failure as the most impactful comorbidity of COPD: assess&#xD;
           the incidence rate and the relative risk of total/severe exacerbation and the incidence&#xD;
           rate and the relative risk of total/COPD-related hospitalizations in Heart Failure/COPD&#xD;
           patients over a 36-months follow-up period;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at the enrollment time (zero time) and after 12, 24 and 36 months, circulating levels of&#xD;
           several systemic inflammation biomarkers. Correlate their variation over time with the&#xD;
           comorbidity indexes, global pharmacological therapeutic redefinition and lifestyle&#xD;
           intervention centered on 24-weeks physical activity program;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at the enrollment time (zero time) and after 12, 24 and 36 months, plasma levels of the&#xD;
           main miRNAs involved in the COPD pathogenesis. Correlate their variation over time with&#xD;
           the comorbidity indexes, global pharmacological therapeutic redefinition and lifestyle&#xD;
           intervention centered on 24-weeks physical activity program;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at the enrollment time (zero time) and after 12, 24 and 36 months, plasma levels of the&#xD;
           main myokines currently associated with the systemic effects of physical activity,&#xD;
           correlating their baseline concentration to clinical-anthropometric parameters and type&#xD;
           and number of chronic diseases and their variation over time in relation to the global&#xD;
           pharmacological therapeutic redefinition and the 24-weeks physical activity program;&#xD;

    <description>The Maryland Disability Index (formally Barthel Index) was codified in the late 1950s by the english nurse Barthel. It allows to have knowledge of the degree of subject's independence. It consists of 10 items that explore common &quot;Activities of Daily Living (ADL)&quot;, from nutrition to the ability to climb or descend stairs. Each item is assigned an arbitrary score of 5, 10 or 15 points (maximum 100). The sum indicates the degree of autonomy of the patient in carrying out daily activities.</description>
