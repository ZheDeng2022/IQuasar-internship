  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial (RCT) analyzed monolithic single-unit implant restorations&#xD;
      out of lithium disilicate (LS2) or polymer-infiltrated ceramic networks (PICN) in a chairside&#xD;
      digital workflow (Test) and a conventional protocol (Control). The primary outcome was&#xD;
      subjective patient perception in terms of PROMs comparing digital and conventional impression&#xD;
      techniques as well as patients' satisfaction related to the final implant restoration among&#xD;
      difference workflows and materials. The secondary outcome was to investigate the objective&#xD;
      evaluation by a dental professional applying the functional implant prosthodontic score&#xD;
      (FIPS). The null-hypothesis of this RCT was that both workflows and the two materials for the&#xD;
      monolithic implant restorations had comparable results with respect to the defined outcomes.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient reported outcome measure (PROM): satisfaction with impression technique via VAS questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>After impression, At first visit within 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>After impression-taking, questionnaires were handed out to the participants to evaluate PROMs via visual analog scales (VAS). Six categories were assessed: (1) overall treatment time of impression-taking procedure (0=unsatisfactory to 10=excellent); (2) convenience level of the impression technique (0=unsatisfactory to 10=excellent); (3) anxiety level of impression technique (0=low to 10=high); (4) bad taste and (5) nausea caused by the impression (each 0=no sensation to 10=a lot of sensation); and (6) pain during impression-taking procedure (0=no pain to 10=a lot of pain).</description>

    <measure>Patient reported outcome measure (PROM): satisfaction with final implant restoration via VAS questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after prosthesis delivery</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were requested to score their feeling on screw-retained monolithic implant crowns in a 10cm VAS one week after delivery of the final implant crowns. The level of patients' satisfaction was measured in four categories: (1) perception of the overall treatment outcome (0=unsatisfactory to 10=excellent); (2) opinion on the function of the restoration (0=unsatisfactory to 10=excellent); (3) esthetic perspective (0=unsatisfactory to 10=excellent), and (4) ease of oral hygiene care (0=unsatisfactory to 10=excellent).</description>
