  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the potential benefits of adding&#xD;
      information on patients' breast arterial calcification (BAC) results to the standard results&#xD;
      letter women receive after mammography. In addition to looking for potential breast cancer,&#xD;
      research shows that mammograms can also detect the presence of calcifications within the&#xD;
      breast arteries. Those calcifications can be associated with coronary artery disease. Right&#xD;
      now, women are not routinely told whether or not they have BAC; that is, it's not part of&#xD;
      standard practice to communicate that information to patients. However, previous research has&#xD;
      suggested that patients would like to be informed about their BAC status more often. In this&#xD;
      study, the team has two goals. First, the team wants to measure the rates of BAC in a large,&#xD;
      diverse group of 14,875 women. Because most of the past research on BAC has largely been&#xD;
      focused on White mammography patients, the researchers feel it is important to see if the&#xD;
      results are similar or different in a more racially and ethnically diverse sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, the study team wants to understand the effects of giving women information on their&#xD;
      BAC results as part of their standard post-mammography letter. Specifically, the study team&#xD;
      wants to see how sharing that information might affect women's healthcare choices and&#xD;
      lifestyle. The research will include 1,888 women in this second part of the study, which will&#xD;
      be the first in the literature to explore women's reactions to BAC information. If research&#xD;
      shows that women find the information useful, BAC information may be given to women regularly&#xD;
      in the future.&#xD;

    <measure>Detection of coronary artery disease (CAD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will respond to a single, self-report item (adapted from the 2019 NHIS survey item) which will ask if they have been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had coronary artery disease in the last 6 months. The item will be rated as, &quot;yes, no, or don't know.&quot; Self-reported diagnosis will be confirmed via medical record review.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>Illness representations will be assessed using the IPQ-R which have been adapted to include an addendum of Cardiovascular-Disease Related Worry Scale questions. Participants will be asked to rate items related to personal beliefs about CAD with regard to causal beliefs and on 8 subscales: identity (scale 0-13); timeline (scale 6-30); consequences (scale 6-30); personal control (scale 6-30); treatment control (scale 5-25); illness coherence (scale5-25); timeline cyclical (scale 4-20); and emotional representations (scale 6-30); and CVD related worry scale (scale3-13). Full scale from 41-216, higher scores represent a higher number of symptoms related to CAD, more positive beliefs about the controllability of disease, and a greater personal understanding of the condition.</description>
