  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect of the cannabidiol (CBD) + cannabigerol (CBG) + tetrahydrocannabinol&#xD;
      (THC) up to 133/66/4mg daily versus placebo as adjuvant treatment in chronic migraine (CM)&#xD;
      patients under preventive treatment at a stable dose for at least 3 months who present at&#xD;
      least 5 headaches day a month. CM patients of both sexes, between 25 and 65 years old, who&#xD;
      have not had CBD and/or THC as a migraine treatment. Patients may be having migraine&#xD;
      preventive treatment such as propranolol, topiramate, valproic acid/sodium valproate,&#xD;
      flunarizine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, candesartan, galcanezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab,&#xD;
      botulinum toxin type A. Acute treatment will follow patients doctor's prescription. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria: active liver disease or elevated liver transaminases&gt; 3 times than the normal&#xD;
      values, pregnancy, fertile age women without contraceptive treatment or who intend to get&#xD;
      pregnant, patients without migraine preventive treatment, substance abuse or addiction, use&#xD;
      of medical cannabis or products with CBD or THC in the last 30 days or during study period,&#xD;
      history of allergy or adverse reactions with the use of CBD or related products, substance&#xD;
      users of liver enzymes inducers such as rifampicin, ketoconazole, theophylline,&#xD;
      carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital and St. John's wort. Patients on vitamin K&#xD;
      anticoagulant medicines, as warfarin. After randomization patients will be divided into two&#xD;
      groups of 55 participants, who will receive CBD + CBG + THC up to a maximum dose of 133/66/4&#xD;
      mg or placebo for 12 weeks (V0 screening, V1 allocation, V4 final visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome is the reduction in frequency of headache days per 4 weeks between V1 and V4&#xD;
      compared to placebo. Secondary outcomes will be a reduction in duration and intensity of&#xD;
      migraine attacks, amount of painkillers used and percentage of patients with a reduction&#xD;
      greater than 50% on migraine days, 50% reduction in the other variables as MIDAS scores,&#xD;
      HIT-6 scores, Beck's Anxiety and Depression Scales, Epworth Sleepiness Scales, and the scores&#xD;
      at The Severity of Dependence Scale used as an indicator of overuse medication in this&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical and laboratory data obtained in this study will comply with the objectives&#xD;
      elaborated in the evaluation of the primary and secondary, the proposal of which is to&#xD;
      publish the data regardless of the results obtained.&#xD;
