  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop a Social Cognitive Theory-based dietary behavioral intervention&#xD;
      for gastric cancer survivors, and explore the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness of delivering this intervention. Two phases are covered in this study,&#xD;
      including development of the intervention in phase 1 and a pilot randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT) in phase 2. For the phase 1, a qualitative descriptive study will be conducted to&#xD;
      enrich the initial intervention protocol, which has been formed based on the Social Cognitive&#xD;
      Theory and literature review. Furthermore, an expert consultation will be conducted to&#xD;
      validate and refine the initial intervention protocol. For the phase 2, a pilot RCT will be&#xD;
      conducted to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of the&#xD;
      proposed intervention. All participants will be recruited from a tertiary hospital in Wuhan&#xD;
      city, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the qualitative descriptive study in phase 1, gastric cancer survivors will be recruited&#xD;
      through purposive sampling to attend focus group interviews. Number of focus groups will be&#xD;
      at least four, but the final sample size being determined by data saturation. Data will be&#xD;
      analyzed through qualitative content analysis. Based on qualitative data, the intervention&#xD;
      content will be validated and /or refined by a panel of multidisciplinary experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the pilot RCT in phase 2, 72 gastric cancer survivors will be recruited through&#xD;
      convenience sampling. After randomization, the participants will be assigned to one of two&#xD;
      groups, either the intervention group, which will receive a 6-week dietary behavioral&#xD;
      intervention; or the control group, which will receive usual care only. The 6-week dietary&#xD;
      behavioral intervention will target six dietary behaviors that are relevant to gastric cancer&#xD;
      and will be delivered by a registered nurse and a registered dietician. The intervention&#xD;
      consists of three face-to-face group-education with 10-12 participants in each group and&#xD;
      three individual telephone counselling sessions. The usual care will be general dietary&#xD;
      advice provided by the nurses before discharge from the hospital. The general dietary advice&#xD;
      will be provided orally and printed in the discharge plan. The primary outcomes will be&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability. The secondary outcomes will be dietary consumption, quality of&#xD;
      life, and self-efficacy. Outcome measurements will be conducted at baseline (before&#xD;
      randomization), and week 7 (after intervention). Generalized estimating equation model&#xD;
      analyses will be conducted to examine group-by-time interaction effects.&#xD;
