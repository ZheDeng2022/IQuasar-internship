  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cranberries are traditionally used for urinary comfort and prevention of urinary disorders of&#xD;
      bacterial origin and despite an EFSA opinion invalidating the clinical efficacy of&#xD;
      cranberries, its mechanism of action has been several times proposed by the scientific&#xD;
      community: it would act by inhibiting the synthesis of P-fimbriae leading to a complete&#xD;
      disappearance of these adhesins, and to bacterial-type deformation by lengthening of the cell&#xD;
      body. Cinnamon and microbiotic strains could enhance this synergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a food supplement based on cranberry,&#xD;
      cinnamon and microbiotic strains (Feminabiane CBU) on the symptoms of cystitis, urinary&#xD;
      discomfort and the number of cystitis reported by women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women who use or not the cranberry, cinnamon, and microbiotic blend are encouraged to&#xD;
      complete a 6-month diary in which they report any urinary tract disorders they encounter.&#xD;
