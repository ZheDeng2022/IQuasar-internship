  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Now, enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) is considered an essential goal to improve&#xD;
      patient satisfaction, increase surgical workflow rate and facilitate performing different&#xD;
      surgical procedures, including lumber laminectomy, on an ambulatory base. Different ERAS&#xD;
      protocols have been applied and succeeded to improve recovery profile after colonic, rectal,&#xD;
      gastric, urologic, biliary, pancreatic, and gynecologic procedures. Up to our knowledge, it&#xD;
      is the 1st trial that will investigate the effect of combining single shot epidural blockade&#xD;
      and general anesthesia (GA) using tolerable endotracheal tube (TET), as components for ERAS&#xD;
      protocol for patients undergoing lumber laminectomy, on postoperative recovery profile. so&#xD;
      the current study will be done to assess if Single shot epidural blockade and GA using TET,&#xD;
      for patients undergoing lumber laminectomy, can enhance their postoperative recovery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be carried out at anesthesia and surgical intensive care department -Zagazig&#xD;
      University Hospitals. Patients of both sexes, assigned to a single or double level lumbar&#xD;
      laminectomy or discectomy, will be included in the study. all patients will be preoperatively&#xD;
      evaluated according to standard local protocol. patients, who will not be excluded, will be&#xD;
      assigned to one of two groups: Group I (control group) patients who will undergo standard&#xD;
      general anesthetic technique and Group II (combined general/ epidural anesthesia group&#xD;
      (CGEA)) patients will undergo single shot epidural analgesia [by bupivacaine (15 ml with&#xD;
      0.25% concentration)] followed by induction of standard general anesthesia (GA) using&#xD;
      tolerable endotracheal tube (TET)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be compared as regard:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient recovery in the form of time to extubation, , time to achieving modified aldrete&#xD;
           score ≥ 9 , duration of post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) stay and incidence of PACU&#xD;
           bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients' satisfaction, time to Post anesthesia discharge scoring system (PADSS) for&#xD;
           determining home readiness ≥ 9 and incidence of hospital re-admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intra operative hemodynamic stability, blood loss, operative time and surgeon's&#xD;
           satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Postoperative pain scores and analgesic requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated using Epi Info 6, based on expected time to modified Aldrete score&#xD;
      ≥ 9 in group I 13.1± 3.7 in group GA and in group II 7.9 ± 3.2 , confidence interval 95% and&#xD;
      power of test 80%, to be 32. Eight patients will be added to compensate for dropout, so the&#xD;
      total number of patients will be 40 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be collected, tabulated and statistically analyzed using SPSS 20.0 for windows&#xD;
      (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and MedCalc 13 for windows (MedCalc Software bvba, Ostend,&#xD;
      Belgium). According to the type of data qualitative data will be represented as number and&#xD;
      percentage, parametric quantitative data will be represented by mean ± standard deviation&#xD;
      (SD), non-parametric data will be presented as median and range and the following tests were&#xD;
      used to test differences for significance and association of qualitative variable by Chi&#xD;
      square test (X2). Differences between quantitative multiple by student t-test or Mann Whitney&#xD;
      test as appropriate. P value was set at &lt;0.05 for significant results.&#xD;
