      In the study, selections to the experimental and control groups will be made randomly and&#xD;
      simple randomization method will be used. In this context, the individuals included in the&#xD;
      research will be assigned to the control and initiative groups respectively and randomized by&#xD;
      an expert statistician.The sample of the study was found to be at the 95% confidence interval&#xD;
      and at the level of α= 0.05. The effect size was found to be 0.5703 based on previous&#xD;
      studies. With a theoretical power of 0.95, the minimum sample size was totally calculated as&#xD;
      51, 17 for the intervention 1 (back massage), 17 for the intervention 2 (breast massage)&#xD;
      group and 17 for the control group. However, it was aimed to reach 60 people by predicting&#xD;
      that there might be case losses, and it was planned to recruit 20 people for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dependent variables of the study are the amount of breast milk and the level of anxiety.&#xD;
      The independent variable is the back and breast massage practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will be carried out in Zonguldak Gynecology and Pediatrics Hospital between 1st&#xD;
      July 2021-2022.&#xD;

      The data of the research will be collected in two phases. In the first phase, the data will&#xD;
      be collected by the researcher by face-to-face interview technique with mothers having just&#xD;
      given birth in the hospital and meeting the inclusion criteria of the study. At this phase,&#xD;
      &quot;Informed Consent Form&quot; prepared by the researcher in line with the literature, &quot;Personal&#xD;
      Information Form&quot;, &quot;Breastmilk Evaluation Form&quot; and &quot;State-Trait Anxiety Scale&quot; will be used&#xD;
      to collect data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a digital thermometer to adjust the room temperature and milk storage bags to&#xD;
      store the milk will be used. In the second phase, data will be collected by calling the&#xD;
      mothers by phone (audio, video) after they are discharged from the hospital. At this phase,&#xD;
      &quot;Post-Discharge Breast Milk Evaluation Form&quot;, &quot;State-Trait Anxiety Scale&quot; and &quot;New-born&#xD;
      Nutritional Status Evaluation Form&quot; will be used. &quot;Personal Information Form&quot;, which will be&#xD;
      used in the collection of data consists of 20 questions about the socio-demographic&#xD;
      characteristics (age, education level, region of residence until the age of 15, spouse's&#xD;
      education level, employment status, occupation, family type, income status), fertility&#xD;
      characteristics (number of pregnancies, week of birth, type of birth, the state of oxytocin&#xD;
      given at birth, planning status of pregnancy, encountering problems during pregnancy, baby's&#xD;
      gender and birth weight, baby's height and head circumference), APGAR score of the baby, the&#xD;
      person that make her give birth and mother's body mass index, the status of smoking and&#xD;
      medicine or herbal product usage to increase breast milk. Informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
      if women meeting the inclusion criteria agree to participate in the research. After obtaining&#xD;
      their consent, a pre-test will be applied to the women with the &quot;Personal Information Form&quot;&#xD;
      and the &quot;State-Trait Anxiety Scale&quot; by face-to-face interview technique. Both state and trait&#xD;
      anxiety scales are of 4-point Likert type. There are 10 reversed statements in the state&#xD;
      anxiety scale and 7 reversed statements in the trait anxiety scale. In the state anxiety&#xD;
      scale, the responses are classified as (1) Not at all, (2) A little, (3) A lot, and (4)&#xD;
      Completely; Responses in the trait anxiety scale are classified as (1) almost never, (2)&#xD;
      sometimes, (3) often, and (4) almost always. There are two kinds of statements (direct and&#xD;
      reversed) in scales. Direct statements express negative emotions, reversed statements express&#xD;
      positive emotions. While scoring these statements, those with a score of 1 turn into 4, and&#xD;
      those with a score of 4 turn into 1. In direct statements, responses with a value of 4&#xD;
      indicate high anxiety. In reversed statements, responses with a value of 1 indicate high&#xD;
      anxiety while those with a value of 4 indicate low anxiety. The scores obtained from both&#xD;
      scales range from 20 to 80. The score obtained from the scales constitutes the individual's&#xD;
      score to be interpreted at the level of anxiety. A high score indicates a high level of&#xD;
      anxiety, and a low score indicates a low level of anxiety. According to Öner, in Spielberg's&#xD;
      state and trait anxiety inventory, 0-19 points is evaluated as no anxiety, 20-39 points as&#xD;
      mild anxiety, 40-59 points as moderate anxiety, 60-79 points as severe anxiety and 80 points&#xD;
      as severe anxiety-panic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized assignment to the experimental and control groups will be made by a statistician&#xD;
      in order to control the randomization and selection bias in the study. Participants will be&#xD;
      included in initiative 1 (back massage), initiative 2 (breast massage) or control group&#xD;
      according to randomized assignments after pre-test application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation of the Research in the Control Group No intervention will be made to the&#xD;
      control group, standard hospital procedures will be applied and the relevant forms will be&#xD;
      filled out. Until the mother is discharged from the hospital, the amount of milk obtained&#xD;
      from the mother will be measured by the researcher with the &quot;Breast Milk Evaluation Form&quot;,&#xD;
      and the breast milk will be measured in the storage bag and delivered to the baby nurses.&#xD;
      Covid-19 precautions will be taken in all controls of the mother (hand washing, surgical&#xD;
      mask, gloves, apron, face visor). When the mother is discharged from the hospital, the&#xD;
      &quot;Post-Discharge Breast Milk Evaluation Form&quot; will be given to the mother and she will be told&#xD;
      how to fill it out. The contact numbers of the mothers will be received and information about&#xD;
      the measurements filled in the form will be obtained twice a day. Anxiety levels of mothers&#xD;
      will be determined with a post-test using the &quot;State-Trait Anxiety Scale&quot;, just before their&#xD;
      discharge from hospital and on the 5th-7th days. The mothers will be called again at the 6th&#xD;
      week of postpartum, and the &quot;New-born Nutritional Status Evaluation Form&quot; will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation of Research in the Initiative Group The first back massage will be initiated&#xD;
      in the first 2 hours after birth and it will be performed every 6 hours for 15 minutes (first&#xD;
      2 hours, 6th, 12th, 18th, 24th, 30th, 36th, 42nd, 48th hour, etc.) until the mother is&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital. After the mother's outfits are removed and the mother is&#xD;
      situated in a suitable position, the back of the mother will be massaged by euphlorage&#xD;
      (stroking), petrissage (pressing the back), friction methods. Then, the mother's breast will&#xD;
      be milked by hand and the milk obtained from the breast will be measured in the breast milk&#xD;
      storage bag and delivered to the baby nurses. The amount of milk will be measured with the&#xD;
      &quot;Breast Milk Evaluation Form&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the mother's being discharged from the hospital, a family member will be taught about&#xD;
      the fact that how the back massage is practised and asked to practise it at home until the&#xD;
      5th-7th day. The video for the practice of the back massage to be applied at home will be&#xD;
      taken by the researcher. Both the video and the brochures will be given to the mother and the&#xD;
      person who will apply the massage. Before the mother's being discharged, whether the family&#xD;
      member practises the massage correctly or not will be observed. After being discharged, video&#xD;
      or audio calls will be made with the family member and asked about whether he/she practices&#xD;
      the back massage on the mother and the effectiveness of the massage will be evaluated. The&#xD;
      length of the back massage to be practised at home will be for 15 minutes, four times a day&#xD;
      (every 6 hours) that is in the morning, at noon, in the evening and at night. Besides this,&#xD;
      when the mother is discharged from the hospital, the &quot;Post-Discharge Breast Milk Evaluation&#xD;
      Form&quot; will be given to the mother and she will be told how to fill it out. Information about&#xD;
      the form will be obtained twice a day by contacting the mother. Anxiety levels will be&#xD;
      determined with a post-test using the &quot;State-Trait Anxiety Scale&quot; (Appendix 5) before being&#xD;
      discharged and on the 5th-7th days, with. At the 6th week of postpartum, the breastfeeding&#xD;
      status of mothers will be evaluated with the &quot;Nutrition Status of the New-born Evaluation&#xD;
      Form&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initiative 2 (breast massage group): The first breast massage will be initiated in the first&#xD;
      2 hours after delivery and it will be practised every 6 hours (first 2 hours, 6th, 12th,&#xD;
      18th, 24th, 30th, 36th, 42nd. , 48th hour) until being discharged. After the researcher&#xD;
      washes her hands, the mother's outfits are removed and she is situated in a sitting position,&#xD;
      the massage will be practised on both breasts for 10 minutes by the researcher herself. After&#xD;
      the breast massage, the mother will be milked by hand and the milk obtained from the mother&#xD;
      will be measured in the breast milk storage bag and delivered to the baby nurses. The amount&#xD;
      of milk obtained from the mother will be measured with the &quot;Breast Milk Evaluation Form&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mother will be taught about the breast massage and asked to practise it at home until the&#xD;
      5th-7th day. A video about the self-practice of breast massage will be taken and given to the&#xD;
      mother with the brochures. Self-practice of breast massage takes an average of 2-3 minutes&#xD;
      and consists of five steps which are pumping the breast, pressing against the rib cage,&#xD;
      clockwise or counter-clockwise circular movements, sliding the breast up and down, and back&#xD;
      and forth movements. Each step will be performed five times and before each milking time .&#xD;
      Whether the mother practices breast massage correctly or not will be evaluated before her&#xD;
      being discharged. After being discharged, video or audio calls will be made with the mother&#xD;
      and asked about whether she practices the massage herself and the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      massage will be evaluated. In addition, while the mother is being discharged from the&#xD;
      hospital, the &quot;Post-Discharge Breast Milk Evaluation Form&quot; will be given to the mother and&#xD;
      she will be told how to fill it out. Information about the form will be obtained twice a day&#xD;
      by contacting the mother. Anxiety levels will be determined with a post-test using the&#xD;
      &quot;State-Trait Anxiety Scale&quot;, before being discharged and on the 5th-7th days. At the 6th week&#xD;
      of postpartum, the breastfeeding status of mothers will be evaluated with the &quot;Nutrition&#xD;
      Status of the New-born Evaluation Form&quot;.&#xD;
