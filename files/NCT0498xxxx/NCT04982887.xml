  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that occurs with the effect of&#xD;
      dopaminergic pathways in the substantia nigra and causes a progressive decrease in motor&#xD;
      functions. When the literature is examined; Physiotherapy and rehabilitation programs applied&#xD;
      in PD include conventional physiotherapy methods and neurophysiological based activity&#xD;
      training. Classical physiotherapy programs; It includes stretching, strengthening, aerobics,&#xD;
      posture exercises, balance and coordination training. PH treatment in recent years; Virtual&#xD;
      reality is gradually enriched with motor imagery and robot-assisted physiotherapy&#xD;
      applications and different exercise methods including dance, music therapy, yoga, pilates and&#xD;
      spinal stabilization exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stabilization exercises, which form the basis of spinal stabilization training, use the basic&#xD;
      principles of motor learning. The aim of the spinal stabilization exercise program is to&#xD;
      support the vertebral column by increasing the strength and endurance of the stabilizer&#xD;
      muscles, to improve the spinal posture by increasing kinesthetic awareness and to improve&#xD;
      balance control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of telerehabilitation practices even&#xD;
      more. Telerehabilitation can be defined as providing rehabilitation services remotely using&#xD;
      information and communication technologies. In order to minimize the risk of transmission in&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic, physical activity levels of individuals have been reduced by&#xD;
      restricting social life and the access of sick individuals to rehabilitation services is&#xD;
      severely restricted. In addition, rehabilitation professionals are at risk in the treatment&#xD;
      of these patients due to the serious transmission risk of COVID-19. Considering these&#xD;
      situations, it is emphasized by many authorities that telerehabilitation practices should be&#xD;
      expanded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inactivity, which occurs as a result of restrictions in access to social isolation and&#xD;
      rehabilitation services, brought about by the COVID-19 Pandemic in Parkinson's patients,&#xD;
      adversely affects the progression of the disease. Telerehabilitation allows patients who&#xD;
      cannot access rehabilitation due to their geographical, economic or physical disabilities to&#xD;
      benefit from rehabilitation services. It is known that telerehabilitation applied in various&#xD;
      neurological diseases reduces the fatigue levels of the patients, improves their functional&#xD;
      activities and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with all these reasons, this study was planned to investigate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      two different exercise programs adapted to the telerehabilitation program in Parkinson's&#xD;
      patients during the Covid 19 pandemic.&#xD;

    <measure>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 6 week after</time_frame>
    <description>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. There are 4 sub-parameters. 1. mental status, behavior and mental state 2. daily life activities 3. motor inspection 4. treatment complications. mental status, behavior and mental state total 16 points, daily activity total 52 points, Motor parameter total 92 points, treatment complications total 23 points. Total maximum 183 points. the total score is calculated by adding all sub-parameter scores. low value is good, high value is a symptom of bad result.</description>

    <description>The cervical region is one of the most affected regions of the musculoskeletal system due to the intensive proprioceptors. Studies have shown that many position sense proprioceptors are over the deep group cervical muscles such as longus colitis and longus capitis. The deep group cervical muscles, which perform a dynamic ligament function, have an important role in maintaining the stability of the spine as well as the proprioceptive sense. In particular, proprioceptive receptors, which are commonly found in the deep suboccipital muscles; There are cervical and reflex connections with vestibular, visual and postural control systems.</description>
