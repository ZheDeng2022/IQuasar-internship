  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Case series with retrospective data collection of patients treated for Fournier's gangrene&#xD;
      between January 2010 and March 2017. The main etiologies, risk factors, postoperative&#xD;
      complications outcomes and long term follow up results were analyzed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eight four (84) patients were recruited. The average age of our patients was 49 years (with&#xD;
      limits of 20 to 76), the male gender dominates our series (83.33%) with a sex ratio of 5M /&#xD;
      1W, the most frequently found risk factor was diabetes mellitus (37%). The most common&#xD;
      etiology was anal abscesses (32%). The average time to consultation was 8 days (limits ranges&#xD;
      from 3 to 30 days). All patients were admitted at a necrosis stage (100%). Anemia was&#xD;
      identified in 85% of cases. The low platelets were noticed in 44.03% of cases.&#xD;
      Hypoalbuminemia was found in 93% of cases. All patients (100%) benefited resuscitation&#xD;
      initially and antibiotic therapy on their admission. They received emergency surgical&#xD;
      debridement with a cleansing stoma. The average length of hospital stay was 13 days and&#xD;
      complications occurred in 33% of cases. The mortality rate was 7.14%. then we conclude that&#xD;
      Fournier's gangrene is a medico-surgical emergency with a high morbidity and mortality rate.&#xD;
      Early diagnosis as well as antibiotic therapy and the quality of debridement save the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
