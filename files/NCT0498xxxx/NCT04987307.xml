  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of efavaleukin alfa on induction of&#xD;
      clinical remission in participants with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis&#xD;
      (UC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to receive 1 of 3 efavaleukin alfa doses or placebo during a&#xD;
      12-week induction period. Participants who complete the 12-week induction period will have&#xD;
      the option to enter an exploratory long-term treatment period for up to 40 weeks (total of up&#xD;
      to 52 weeks of treatment) if, in the opinion of the investigator, they may benefit from&#xD;
      continued treatment. During the long-term period, participants randomized to efavaleukin alfa&#xD;
      will remain on the same efavaleukin alfa blinded dose; participants randomized to placebo who&#xD;
      achieved clinical response at week 12 will remain on placebo; and placebo non-responders (ie,&#xD;
      participants randomized to placebo who did not achieve clinical response at week 12) will&#xD;
      receive efavaleukin alfa in a blinded manner during continued treatment. All participants&#xD;
      will complete a safety follow-up visit 6 weeks after their last dose of investigational&#xD;
      product.&#xD;

        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has provided informed consent prior to initiation of any study specific&#xD;
             activities or procedures. In Japan, if a participant is younger than 20 years at the&#xD;
             time of signing the informed consent, the informed consent must be obtained from both&#xD;
             the participant and their legal representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women aged ≥ 18 to &lt; 80 years at screening visit (≥ 19 to &lt; 80 in South&#xD;
             Korea).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of UC established ≥ 3 months prior to enrollment by clinical and endoscopic&#xD;
             evidence and corroborated by a histopathology report. If a histopathology report is&#xD;
             not available at screening, then additional biopsies may be taken during the screening&#xD;
             period for local histopathology analysis to corroborate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderately to severely active UC as defined by a modified Mayo score of 5 to 9, with a&#xD;
             centrally read rectosigmoidoscopy endoscopic subscore ≥ 2 and no subscore &lt; 1 prior to&#xD;
             day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has documentation of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A surveillance colonoscopy (performed according to local standard) within 12&#xD;
                  months of day 1 visit for participants with pancolitis of &gt; 8 years duration, or&#xD;
                  participants with left-sided colitis of &gt; 12 years duration, or participants with&#xD;
                  primary sclerosing cholangitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For all other participants, up-to-date colorectal cancer surveillance (performed&#xD;
                  according to local standard). Participants who do not have a colonoscopy report&#xD;
                  available in source documentation will have a colonoscopy instead of&#xD;
                  rectosigmoidoscopy performed as the screening endoscopy for the study, at the&#xD;
                  discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have demonstrated inadequate response, loss of response, or&#xD;

                       least 30 mg/day for a minimum of 2 weeks; or corticosteroid-dependent&#xD;
                       colitis, defined as: an inability to reduce corticosteroids below the&#xD;
                       equivalent of prednisone 10 mg/day within 3 months of starting&#xD;
                       corticosteroids without a return of signs and/or symptoms of active UC; or a&#xD;
                       relapse within 3 months of completing a course of corticosteroids).&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  History of intolerance of corticosteroids (including, but not limited to,&#xD;
                       Cushing's syndrome, osteopenia/ osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, or&#xD;

                       (eg, ≥ 0.75 mg/kg/day), or oral azathioprine or 6-mercatopurine within a&#xD;
                       therapeutic range as judged by thioguanine metabolite testing, or a&#xD;
                       combination of a thiopurine and allopurinol within a therapeutic range as&#xD;
                       judged by thioguanine metabolite testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  History of intolerance to at least 1 immunomodulator (including but not&#xD;
                       limited to nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, pancreatitis, liver function&#xD;
                       test abnormalities, and lymphopenia) and have neither failed nor&#xD;
                       demonstrated an intolerance to a biological medication (anti-tumor necrosis&#xD;
                       factor [TNF] antibody, anti-integrin antibody, or interleukin [IL]-12/23&#xD;
                       antagonists) that is indicated for the treatment of UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Biologic or targeted small molecule therapy failed participants: those who&#xD;
                  demonstrated inadequate response or loss of response or intolerance to biologic&#xD;
                  therapy for UC (eg, anti-TNF antibodies or IL-12/23 antagonists, anti-integrin&#xD;
                  antibodies) or targeted small molecules (eg, JAK inhibitors). The therapy used to&#xD;
                  qualify the participant for entry into this category must be approved for the&#xD;
                  treatment of UC in the country of use, at the time of use. Participants must&#xD;
                  fulfil one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Inadequate response: signs and symptoms of persistently active disease&#xD;
                       despite induction treatment at the approved induction dosing that was&#xD;
                       indicated in the product label at the time of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Loss of response: recurrence of signs and symptoms of active disease during&#xD;
                       approved maintenance dosing following prior clinical benefit&#xD;
                       (discontinuation despite clinical benefit does not quality as having failed&#xD;
                       or being intolerant to UC biological therapy or JAK inhibitor).&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Intolerance: history of intolerance to infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab,&#xD;

                       inhibitors (including but not limited to infusion-related event,&#xD;
                       demyelination, congestive heart failure, or any other drug-related adverse&#xD;
                       event that led to a reduction in dose or discontinuation of the medication).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If receiving any of the following therapies, participants must have stable dosage for&#xD;
             the specified duration:&#xD;
