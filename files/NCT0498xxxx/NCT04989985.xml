      For locally advanced adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction(AEG) (cT3-4aN+M0),&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy was improved to downstage T and N stage, increase the resectability&#xD;
      of tumor, and finally improve the long-term survival. Combination of perioperative PD-1&#xD;
      antibody and chemotherapy for locally advanced AEG could be a novel therapy to increase&#xD;
      response rate and resectability and reduce recurrence rate. Sintilimab in this study is an&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody for injection which has been approved for several malignant&#xD;
      tumors. This study is a multi-center, open-label, randomized phase II clinical trial to&#xD;
      evaluate tolerability, safety and efficacy of sintilimab in combination with perioperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy in locally advanced AEG.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignancies in China with incidence and mortality&#xD;
      both ranking the 2nd among malignancies in China. Unfortunately, over 70% of gastric cancer&#xD;
      patients in China were diagnosed in advanced stage, and more than 80% of adenocarcinoma of&#xD;
      esophagogastric junction(AEG) were advanced stage. Locally advanced AEG (cT3-4aN+M0) could be&#xD;
      cured by multi-disciplinary therapies including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. As&#xD;
      proved, Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can downstage T and N stage, increase the resectability of&#xD;
      tumor, and finally improve the long-term survival in AEG patients. However, the therapeutic&#xD;
      effects remain unsatisfactory. PD-1 antibody has demonstrated its efficacy in metastatic AEG&#xD;
      and has been proved to be effective in neoadjuvant setting in lung cancer and melanoma.&#xD;
      Combination of perioperative PD-1 antibody and chemotherapy for locally advanced could be a&#xD;
      novel therapy to increase response rate and resectability and reduce recurrence rate.&#xD;
      Sinitilimab in this study is an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody for injection which has been&#xD;
      approved for lymphoma. This study is a multi-center, open-label, randomized phase II clinical&#xD;
      trial to evaluate tolerability, safety and efficacy of sinitilimab in combination with&#xD;
      perioperative chemotherapy（SOX: oxaliplatin plus S-1） in locally advanced AEG.&#xD;
