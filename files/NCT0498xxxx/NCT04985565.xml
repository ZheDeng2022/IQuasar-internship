      This clinical trial studies the effects of a dietary intervention prior to surgery&#xD;
      (neoadjuvant) in patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer. Changing your diet before&#xD;
      surgery may help to improve overall health. Information from this study may help researchers&#xD;
      better understand the influence of diet on the outcomes of patients with intermediate&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the feasibility of a neoadjuvant feeding study prior to radical prostatectomy&#xD;
      in a racially diverse group of men diagnosed with intermediate risk prostate cancer, defined&#xD;
      as the percentage of patients who enter the pre-intervention equilibration period and begin&#xD;
      the dietary intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the tolerance of Mediterranean diet as defined by compliance with diet of 70% or&#xD;
      greater total calories consumed during study period from the Mediterranean diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the effects of controlled dietary interventions on metabolic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the total number of potentially eligible patients who are approached by study&#xD;
      coordinators and enter the equilibration period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the effects of controlled dietary interventions on the fecal microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Create a well annotated bank of clinical data and samples, including but not limited to&#xD;
      periprostatic fat, for use in future research and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Examine the safety of controlled dietary interventions in patients with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Determine changes in Cav-1-sphingolipid signature following Mediterranean diet&#xD;
      consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Compare Cav-1-sphingolipid levels following dietary interventions in with a separate&#xD;
      cohort of men who do not undergo pre-operative dietary intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participate in the Mediterranean diet for 6 days per week for 4 weeks before&#xD;
      undergoing standard of care radical prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-8 weeks.&#xD;
