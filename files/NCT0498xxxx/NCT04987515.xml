      Objectives: To investigate the outcomes of fenestration decompression combined with secondary&#xD;
      curettage (FDSC) in the surgical treatment of jaw ameloblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Medical records of patients diagnosed as multicystic ameloblastoma (MA) or unicystic&#xD;
      ameloblastoma (UA) by routine pathology were collected from January 2010 to December 2017 in&#xD;
      Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University Medical College. Patients were divided&#xD;
      into two groups based on the management regimen: FDSC group, and local curettage (LC) group.&#xD;
      Patients were followed up for 3-8 years, using panoramic radiography to measure the change of&#xD;
      the area of the cystic cavity involved in ameloblastoma and the recurrence or malignant&#xD;
      transformation of the tumor in both groups. A total of 244 eligible patients were selected&#xD;
      for provisional screening, including 145 patients with MA, and 99 patients with UA.&#xD;
