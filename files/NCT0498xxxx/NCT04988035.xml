    <textblock>
      This is a platform trial to conduct a series of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trials using common assessments and endpoints in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19.&#xD;
      BET is a proof-of-concept study with the intent of identifying promising treatments to enter&#xD;
      a more definitive study. The study will be conducted in up to 70 domestic sites and 5&#xD;
      international sites. The study will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a&#xD;
      common control arm and determine which have relatively large effects. In order to maintain&#xD;
      the double blind, each intervention will have a matched placebo. However, the control arm&#xD;
      will be shared between interventions and may include participants receiving the matched&#xD;
      placebo for a different intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is not to determine clear statistical significance for an intervention, but rather&#xD;
      to determine which products have clinical data suggestive of efficacy and should be moved&#xD;
      quickly into larger studies. Estimates produced from BET will provide an improved basis for&#xD;
      designing the larger trial, in terms of sample size and endpoint selection. Products with&#xD;
      little indication of efficacy will be dropped on the basis of interim evaluations. In&#xD;
      addition, some interventions may be discontinued on the basis of interim futility or efficacy&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One or more interventions may be started at any time. The number of interventions enrolling&#xD;
      are programmatic decisions and will be based on the number of sites and the pace of&#xD;
      enrollment. At the time of enrollment, subjects will be randomized to receive any one of the&#xD;
      active arms they are eligible for or placebo. Approximately 200 (100 treatment and 100 shared&#xD;
      placebo) subjects will be assigned to each arm entering the platform and a given site will&#xD;
      generally have no more than 3 interventions at once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BET-C stage will evaluate the combination of remdesivir with danicopan vs remdesivir with&#xD;
      a placebo. Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. Once subjects are discharged&#xD;
      from the hospital, they will have a study visit at Days 8, 15, 22, 29, and 60 as an&#xD;
      outpatient. The Day 8, Day 22 and Day 60 visits do not have laboratory tests or collection of&#xD;
      samples and may be conducted by phone. All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy and&#xD;
      safety laboratory assessments. Safety laboratory tests and blood (serum, plasma and RNA)&#xD;
      research samples on Day 1 (prior to study product administration) and Days 3, 5, 8, and 11&#xD;
      while hospitalized. Blood research samples plus safety laboratory tests will be collected on&#xD;
      Day 15 and 29 if the subject attends an in-person visit or is still hospitalized. However, if&#xD;
      infection control considerations or other restrictions prevent the subject from returning to&#xD;
      the clinic, Day 15 and 29 visits may be conducted by phone and only clinical data will be&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of danicopan relative to the&#xD;
      control arm in adults hospitalized with COVID-19 according to clinical status (8-point&#xD;
      ordinal scale) at Day 8.&#xD;
