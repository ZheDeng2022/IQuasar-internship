      Impaired working memory (WM) plays a crucial role in normal aging, in mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment (MCI) and cognitive decline associated with dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      (AD). The aging-related differences in WM are hypothesized to be based on various&#xD;
      neurobiological origins, for example alterations in the dynamic interplay between the&#xD;
      large-scale brain networks have proven an important role. Recent studies have shown that&#xD;
      non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) methods can modulate neuronal activity, plasticity and&#xD;
      large-scale brain network interactions. The investigators hypothesize that multifocal NIBS&#xD;
      can improve WM. By successive and concurrent stimulation of multiple brain regions of the WM&#xD;
      network by transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and/or repetitive transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) the investigators will study dynamic interactions between&#xD;
      distinct cortico-cortical and subcortico-cortical brain areas. By leveraging multimodal&#xD;
      systems neuroscience information during multifocal stimulation, the investigators expect to&#xD;
      acquire better mechanistic understand through which NIBS acts on the brain and improves&#xD;
      cognitive functions, such as WM.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) describes an intermediate stage from normal cognitive&#xD;
      functioning to dementia, and identifies a spectrum of diseases that includes impairment in&#xD;
      both memory and non-memory cognitive domains. A deficient working memory (WM) plays a crucial&#xD;
      role in normal aging, MCI, and cognitive decline associated with dementia, such as&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). WM refers to the on-line temporary storage and manipulation of&#xD;
      information to be employed in ongoing processing, and is central to the execution of a&#xD;
      variety of daily functions. The loss of WM efficiency related to either aging or&#xD;
      neurodegenerative process is hypothesized to have various neurobiological roots, among which&#xD;
      altered functioning of the fronto-parietal networks play an important role. The processing,&#xD;
      exchange, and storing of information rely on intra- and interregional connectivity that allow&#xD;
      neuronal populations to synchronize their firing. Based on this, intra- and cross frequency&#xD;
      oscillatory interactions have been demonstrated as core basis for working memory processes,&#xD;
      besides other cognitive functions. Any impairment preventing the adaptation and&#xD;
      synchronization of the oscillatory activities within this network will inevitably lead to&#xD;
      temporary or permanent loss of function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, based on the mentioned pathophysiological concepts, the investigators will&#xD;
      develop and test novel, individualized, multifocal, physiology-inspired non-invasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation (NIBS) approaches aimed at enhancing interregional processing in memory-related&#xD;
      fronto-parieto-cerebello networks with consecutive behavioral modulation of WM processes&#xD;
      impacting on daily life activities in aged healthy volunteers (HV) and MCI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators approach these aims in a step-wise manner: (1) The investigators will&#xD;
      explore entrainment of oscillatory activity in the fronto-parietal network with transcranial&#xD;
      alternative current stimulation (tACS) at frequencies relevant to memory encoding (theta) to&#xD;
      boost WM in healthy seniors. (2) Then, the investigators will explore cross-frequency&#xD;
      entrainment of interregional oscillatory interactions in the frontal and parietal target&#xD;
      network with bifocal tACS to boost WM in healthy seniors. (3) Based on the current knowledge&#xD;
      about the extensive involvement of the cerebellum in cognitive processes by its modulatory&#xD;
      effects onto the fronto-parietal networks crucial for cognition, the investigators will&#xD;
      leverage our experience in non-invasive modulation of the cerebellar outputs by means of&#xD;
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). rTMS over the cerebellum will be applied&#xD;
      just before cortical entrainment to further enhance its physiological and behavioral effects.&#xD;
      (4) Finally, the investigators will select the most effective approach from the previous&#xD;
      work-packages to be applied in MCI patients and quantify the behavioral benefits. Besides the&#xD;
      behavioral effects, the investigators will apply multimodal systems neuroscience approaches&#xD;
      by means of neuroimaging (structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging; s/fMRI) and&#xD;
      electrophysiological (Electroencephalography - EEG, transcranial magnetic stimulation - TMS)&#xD;
      methods to determine the underlying network mechanisms and patterns of intrinsic connectivity&#xD;
      changes. As there is significant spatial heterogeneity in fronto-parietal peak activity in&#xD;
      healthy seniors and patients, stimulation targets will be individually defined based on fMRI.&#xD;
      By leveraging the mechanistic aspects derived from individualized multifocal stimulation, the&#xD;
      investigators expect to better understand the mechanisms through which NIBS techniques act on&#xD;
      the brain and improve cognitive functions. The investigators will also test and quantify&#xD;
      within a virtual reality (VR) task how well the intervention-driven cognitive improvement&#xD;
      translates into daily life.&#xD;
