    <textblock>
      This project will test the accuracy of a novel diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (DWMRI) approach using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to predict an optimal&#xD;
      resection margin for pediatric epilepsy surgery objectively. Its primary goal is to minimize&#xD;
      surgical risk probability (i.e., functional deficit) and maximize surgical benefit&#xD;
      probability (i.e., seizure freedom) by precisely localizing eloquent white matter pathways in&#xD;
      children and adolescents with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. This new imaging approach, which&#xD;
      will acquire a DWMRI scan before pediatric epilepsy surgery in about 10 minutes without&#xD;
      contrast administration (and also without sedation even in young children), can be readily&#xD;
      applied to improve preoperative benefit-risk evaluation for pediatric epilepsy surgery in the&#xD;
      future. The investigators will also study how the advanced DWMRI-DCNN connectome approach can&#xD;
      detect complex signs of brain neuronal reorganization that help improve neurological and&#xD;
      cognitive outcomes following pediatric epilepsy surgery. This new imaging approach could&#xD;
      benefit targeted interventions in the future to minimize neurocognitive deficits in affected&#xD;
      children. All enrolled subjects will undergo advanced brain MRI and neurocognitive evaluation&#xD;
      to achieve these goals. The findings of this project will not guide any clinical&#xD;
      decision-making or clinical intervention until the studied approach is thoroughly validated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will combine advanced brain MRI with detailed neuro-psychology evaluation,&#xD;
      performed in children and adolescents affected by drug-resistant focal epilepsy, to address&#xD;
      two main aims, each of them with the following research hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1. To determine the accuracy of deep learning tractography-based benefit-risk analysis&#xD;
      compared to a standard electrical stimulation mapping (ESM) which is the current clinical&#xD;
      standard for detecting eloquent cortical regions before epilepsy surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.1 In healthy controls, DCNN-based tract classification will localize eloquent&#xD;
      cortices, which are significantly overlapped at both single shell DWI acquisition and&#xD;
      generalized Q-sampling imaging, suggesting that the accuracy of this approach may not be&#xD;
      significantly affected by the acquisition protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.2 DCNN-based tract classification will achieve at least 93% accuracy for&#xD;
      prospective detection of ESM-defined eloquent cortices, including patients with a high&#xD;
      likelihood of functional reorganization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.3 Preservation of DCNN-classified eloquent white matter pathways during surgery&#xD;
      will predict the avoidance of postoperative deficits as accurately as the preservation of&#xD;
      ESM-defined eloquent cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.4 Preservation of surgical margins optimized by Kalman filter on retrospective&#xD;
      data will achieve seizure control and avoidance of postoperative deficits in a prospective&#xD;
      surgical patient cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this aim, the investigators will test the accuracy of a recently developed deep&#xD;
      learning-based benefit-risk model, called deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) tract&#xD;
      classification combined with Kalman filter analysis, for non-invasive detection of eloquent&#xD;
      white matter pathways and optimization of surgical margin (i.e., the distance between&#xD;
      epileptogenic area and eloquent area), resulting in seizure freedom and avoidance of&#xD;
      functional deficits. Failure to identify eloquent areas in the proposed resection region can&#xD;
      have potentially lifelong consequences, and overestimation or incorrect localization of the&#xD;
      extent of the eloquent regions may lead to incomplete resection of the epileptogenic zone.&#xD;
      Without optimizing the benefit-risk ratio, the minimum acceptable margin is highly variable&#xD;
      across different settings, ranging from 0 to 2 cm across epilepsy surgery centers. The&#xD;
      investigators will study whether the proposed benefit-risk model can standardize (or&#xD;
      customize) epilepsy surgery of individual patients by accurately optimizing the margins of&#xD;
      the eloquent white matter pathways to be preserved, which is ultimately essential to balance&#xD;
      the benefit of seizure freedom with the risk of functional deficit. This proposed new imaging&#xD;
      approach could change clinical practice for pediatric epilepsy surgery and is widely&#xD;
      applicable for other types of neurosurgical procedures such as tumor resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2. To determine the accuracy of deep learning-based connectome analysis for prediction of&#xD;
      long-term neurocognitive improvement following epilepsy surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.1 Connectivity efficiencies preserved in specific modular networks of&#xD;
      preoperative DCNN-based connectome, found to be associated with postoperative functional&#xD;
      improvement on retrospective data, will accurately predict long-term functional improvement&#xD;
      in a prospective patient cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.2 Longer epilepsy duration will be significantly associated with more decreased&#xD;
      efficiency in full-scale IQ modular network of preoperative DCNN-based connectome, thus&#xD;
      suggesting that earlier surgery will yield better long-term full-scale IQ improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.3 Patients with ipsilateral resections, who show signs of postoperative&#xD;
      &quot;crowding&quot; (i.e., verbal IQ improvement at the expense of non-verbal function), will show&#xD;
      decreased efficiency in non-verbal and increased efficiency in verbal IQ network of&#xD;
      DCNN-based connectome in the contralateral hemisphere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this aim, the investigators will test if an advanced DWMRI approach integrating DCNN and&#xD;
      connectome helps decide timely surgery by providing 1) preoperative imaging markers&#xD;
      underlying high likelihood of postoperative neurocognitive improvements and 2) mechanistic&#xD;
      insight in structural brain reorganization associated with postoperative verbal IQ&#xD;
      improvement. A series of preoperative imaging markers called &quot;local efficiency&quot; that&#xD;
      quantifies how efficiently neural connection is shared by neighboring regions will be&#xD;
      evaluated at the levels of specific modular networks. We expect that these markers can&#xD;
      identify long-term and specific neurocognitive consequences (and potential predictors of&#xD;
      these) associated with surgical intervention and their neural correlates for specific&#xD;
      neurocognitive functions. In addition, neuronal remodeling associated with a functional&#xD;
      crowding effect, studied with DWMRI connectome improved by the DCNN tract classification,&#xD;
      will provide a new mechanistic insight in compensatory processes for verbal IQ function in&#xD;
      children and adolescents who undergo resective surgery to treat drug-resistant focal&#xD;
      epilepsy.&#xD;
