      Clinical trial will study the effect of a formulation containing Vitex negundo leaf extract&#xD;
      and Zingiber officinale extract on alleviating chronic low back pain and related disability&#xD;
      in individuals leading a sedentary lifestyle. It will also evaluate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      product on other factors associated with LBP, including mobility, work productivity and sleep&#xD;
      quality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitex negundo is a large aromatic shrub or tree part of the family Lamiaceae. Many parts of&#xD;
      the plant have been studied for their medicinal properties, as they contain phytochemicals&#xD;
      and secondary metabolites in the plant leaves, roots, flowers, and seeds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These bioactive compounds are the reason behind the plant's anti-inflammatory, antihistamine,&#xD;
      anti-diabetic, anti-oxidant, anti-cancer and antimicrobial activity. In a study wherein the&#xD;
      plant leaf extract was fed to rats, it revealed the pain relieving properties of the fresh&#xD;
      Vitex negundo leaves, which could be mediated by prostaglandin synthesis inhibition. However,&#xD;
      there are no clinical trials that use the plant for chronic low back pain relief. On the&#xD;
      other hand, Zingiber officinale (ginger) is a part of the family Zingiberacae and is one of&#xD;
      the most important medicinal plants in use today. It has been used for pain relief in both&#xD;
      oral and topical forms. It has been used in clinical trials to alleviate pain during&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea, muscle soreness, osteoarthritis and chronic low back pain. However, in the&#xD;
      clinical trial studying its effect on chronic low back pain, ginger was used in the form of&#xD;
      an aromatic oil.The use of both these extracts in all the studies mentioned saw minimal&#xD;
      problems related to toxicity and are seen as safe for consumption without any harmful&#xD;
      effects, especially due to their use in traditional medicine. It has been stated however that&#xD;
      extremely high dosage of ginger could lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, central nervous&#xD;
      system depression, allergic reactions, prolonged pre-existing bleeding, and&#xD;
      arrhythmia.Therefore, this clinical trial will study the effect of a formulation containing&#xD;
      Vitex negundo leaf extract and Zingiber officinale extract on alleviating chronic low back&#xD;
      pain and related disability in individuals leading a sedentary lifestyle. It will also&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of the product on other factors associated with LBP, including&#xD;
      mobility, work productivity and sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study to&#xD;
      explore the effect of Vitex negundo and Zingiber officinale on non-specific chronic low back&#xD;
      pain due to sedentary lifestyle. Approximately 90 participants aged between ≥ 18 and ≤ 60&#xD;
      years will be screened. Both the IP and placebo trial arms will have atleast 30 completed&#xD;
      participants after accounting for the screening failure and dropout/withdrawal rate of 20%&#xD;
      each. The treatment duration for all the study participants will be 30 days.&#xD;

    <measure>Roland Morris Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0, Day 7 and Day 30.</time_frame>
    <description>To determine effect of 30 days administration of IP on functional activities due to low back pain as assessed by the change in Roland-Morris disability score from baseline as compared to the change in placebo. The scale is used to differentiate between patients who have chronic low back pain without any form of disability and those who experience some form of disability due to the pain experienced. Only participants with a Roland Morris disability score between ≥ 8 and ≤ 15 will be included in the study, to exclude individuals with minimal and extremely debilitating chronic low back pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fingertip-to-Floor Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0,and 30.</time_frame>
    <description>Using this test, the forward bending flexibility and mobility of individuals with chronic low back pain will be assessed, as well as the impact of IP consumption on the same in comparison to placebo. Participants will be asked to bend forward and attempt to touch the floor with their fingertips. The investigator will then measure the distance between the floor and the participant's right long finger using a standard measuring tape. The difference in height between the floor and the participant's right long finger will be compared from baseline to Day 30, and in comparison to the placebo</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0, 7 and 30.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to recall the pain they experienced in the specified lower back region, after which they will be asked to mark a point on the 100-point visual analogue scale that corresponds to the level of pain experienced. Participants will have to self-administer the scale.&#xD;
minimum score 0 is referred to no pain at all and Maximum Score 100 is referred to as the worst possible pain</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0,and 30.</time_frame>
    <description>Chronic low back pain has been associated with lower work productivity in several studies. Using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire, the impact of chronic low back pain on work and the performance of regular activities will be studied. The questionnaire consists of six questions, all the replies being categorized into 4 groups: 1) Percentage worktime missed, 2) Percentage impairment while working, 3) Percentage overall work impairment and 4) Percentage activity impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia severity index</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0,and 30.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to recall their sleep patterns for the past month and then fill the aforementioned questionnaire on baseline and Day 30. In this study, the Change of insomnia severity due to chronic low back pain will be studied throughout the study duration from baseline and in comparison to placebo.&#xD;
The score ranges for the same are as follows:&#xD;
0-7: No clinically significant insomnia 8-14: Subthreshold insomnia 15-21: Clinical insomnia (moderate severity) 22-28: Clinical insomnia (severe)</description>
