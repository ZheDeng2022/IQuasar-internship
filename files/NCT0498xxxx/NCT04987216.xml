    <textblock>
      This is a multicentric, prospective, open-label PMCF study whereby patients undergoing&#xD;
      routine cataract surgery will have mono- or bilateral implantation of hydrophobic acrylic&#xD;
      monofocal toric intraocular lens PODEYE TORIC. The device under investigation is a&#xD;
      hydrophobic acrylic monofocal toric intraocular lens (IOL) manufactured by the sponsor of&#xD;
      this study. The refractive power of the lens has a spherical and a cylindrical component. The&#xD;
      IOLs will be implanted in the course of routine cataract surgery and will benefit to patients&#xD;
      suffering from cataract development and showing pre-existing corneal astigmatism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If only one eye qualifies for toric lens implantation due to small amount of pre-existing&#xD;
      corneal astigmatism, one eye will be implanted with PODEYE TORIC and the contralateral eye&#xD;
      will be received an implantation with the monofocal parent lens PODEYE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study purpose is to determine safety, rotational stability, refractive and visual&#xD;
      performance, contrast sensitivity, patient satisfaction and PCO rate after mono- or bilateral&#xD;
      implantation of PODEYE TORIC intraocular lens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total approx. 50 patients will be recruited for this clinical study and undergo mono- or&#xD;
      bilateral implantation of PODEYE TORIC intraocular lens. The maximum time between 1st and 2nd&#xD;
      eye implantation is 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects participating in the trial will attend a total of maximum 12 study visits over a&#xD;
      period of 630-780 days (preoperative, operative, 1-2 days, 7-14 days, 30-60 days, 120-180&#xD;
      days, 330-420 days and 630-780 days postoperative visits). Subjects would have the option for&#xD;
      unscheduled visits if required medically.&#xD;

    <measure>Rotational stability - Photograph of IOL with dilated pupil to asses IOL rotation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The primary performance endpoint is to show statistically non-inferior rotational stability outcomes on PODEYE TORIC lens compared to CER data obtained for a multifocal toric IOL (POD FT) by the same manufacturer sharing the same haptic design but based on a hydrophilic lens material. The null hypothesis is that the absolute mean IOL rotation measured on PODEYE TORIC is not larger than the absolute mean IOL rotation reported in the current CER on POD FT lens.&#xD;
The alternative hypothesis is that the absolute mean IOL rotation measured on PODEYE TORIC is larger than the outcomes reported in the current CER on POD FT lens. The measure is taken at 6 months postoperative visit compared to the measurement performed within 10 minutes after surgery.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-Op, 1 week postoperative, 1 month postoperative, 6 months postoperative, 12 months postoperative, 24 months postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The objective is to compare CDVA above defined thresholds of the investigational product to the results of historical data of EN ISO 11979-7:2018, Annex E (Table E.3 and E.4). The null hypothesis for the CDVA is that / when the true rate of cases with visual acuity 0.3 logMAR or better is less than or equal to the SPE rate. The alternative hypothesis is that the &quot;success&quot; rate is higher than the SPE rate. If the distance corrected visual acuity is 0.3 logMAR or better in 30 eyes or more (with 36 eyes included), the null hypothesis could be rejected, and the alternative hypothesis could be accepted.</description>

    <description>A Halo and Glare simulator software (Eyeland Design Network GmbH, Germany) will be used to assess the subjective perception of photic phenomena. The patients will be asked to adjust the halo and glare level in a simulated image to the amount they perceive of such photic phenomena. This test is performed pre- and postoperatively. The preoperative outcomes serve as a baseline measurement.&#xD;
This simulator utilizes a scale for intensity, size of the halo, and glare that ranges from zero (none) to 100 (extremely disturbing). It also allows for classifying the halos into three types, as follows: T1 (diffuse halo ring), T2 (starburst type), and T3 (distinct halo ring) [Kretz, 2015].</description>

    <description>The SPE rates of the investigational product will be compared to the results of historical data of EN ISO 11979-7:2018, Annex E (Table E.2).&#xD;
Rates of adverse events as determined by EN ISO 11979-7:2018 will be reported through the complete study follow-up. The proportion of all subjects with these events will be reported over time. Statistical comparisons to EN ISO 11979-7:2018 SPE (Safety and Performance Endpoints) rates (Annex E) will be based on all eyes implanted with the investigational device using a one-sided, exact test based on the binomial distribution.</description>

If only one eye qualifies for toric lens implantation due to small amount of pre-existing corneal astigmatism, one eye will be implanted with PODEYE TORIC and the contralateral eye will be receive an implantation with the monofocal parent lens PODEYE (PhysIOL sa/nv, Liège, Belgium).</description>
