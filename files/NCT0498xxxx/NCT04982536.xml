  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate biopsy is the definitive test to establish the diagnosis of prostate cancer. The&#xD;
      standard of care biopsy needles do not predictably obtain full cores of tissue and what&#xD;
      tissue obtained is often fragmented, making pathologic review a challenge. The VMCore Biopsy&#xD;
      System has a geometry in the tip of its biopsy needles that capture more tissue in a single&#xD;
      sample. This study is to compare the characteristics of tissue captured by either standard of&#xD;
      care needles and the VMCore needle.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This post-market study is being conducted in order to assess the capability of the VMCore&#xD;
      biopsy needle to capture prostate tissue in subjects consenting to the use of both the VMCore&#xD;
      needle and the urological practice's standard of care needle for twinned samples during a&#xD;
      routine prostate biopsy procedure. The primary endpoints are to success in tissue core&#xD;
      sampling, safety of the sampling, and subject's tolerance to the procedure.&#xD;
