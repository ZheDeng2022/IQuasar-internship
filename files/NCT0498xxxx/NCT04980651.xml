      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of remote ischemic&#xD;
      conditioning for acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 2210 cases of ischemic stroke in 72 hours were included in 10 centers in China&#xD;
      according to the principle of random, and parallel control. The experimental group receive&#xD;
      basic treatment and remote ischemic conditioning for 200mmHg, 2 times per day for 7&#xD;
      consecutive days. The control group receive basic treatment and remote ischemic conditioning&#xD;
      control for 60mmHg, 2 times per day for 7 consecutive days. Two groups will be followed up&#xD;
      for 90 days to evaluate the efficacy and safety of remote ischemic conditioning in treating&#xD;
      acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;
