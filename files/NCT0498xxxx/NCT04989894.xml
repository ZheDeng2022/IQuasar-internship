  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proposed study, the investigators hope to assess the quality of recovery after&#xD;
      delivery in a local population that would take into account physiological and psychological&#xD;
      parameters to better understand the recovery process after delivery. The investigators will&#xD;
      identify risk factors, especially those that are modifiable and associated with a poorer&#xD;
      ObsQoR score and hence a poor quality of recovery after delivery. This data may then be used&#xD;
      to educate women and manage expectations in the postpartum period, and help develop potential&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditional postpartum outcome measures do not describe the patient experience or quality of&#xD;
      recovery (QoR) after childbirth. A recent obstetric-specific recovery tool (ObsQoR-10) has&#xD;
      been developed to assess the quality of recovery in patients in various mode of delivery on&#xD;
      aspects of pain, drug side effects, comfort, control, ability to hold and feed the baby,&#xD;
      independent mobilization and achievement of personal hygiene. However, this questionnaire is&#xD;
      not yet validated in Asian population, especially in Chinese-speaking patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to investigate the validity, reliability, feasibility, and&#xD;
      responsiveness of the Chinese translated version of ObsQoR-10. The investigators will first&#xD;
      perform a pre-test in 10 patients, of which an interview will be conducted to seek for their&#xD;
      feedback and suggestions. Modification of questionnaire will be done if necessary, followed&#xD;
      by recruitment of 112 patients at postpartum day 1 to fill in the Chinese translated&#xD;
      ObsQoR-10 and other questionnaires related to their mood, anxiety and pain. In this proposed&#xD;
      study, the investigators hope to assess the quality of recovery after delivery in a local&#xD;
      population that would take into account physiological and psychological parameters to better&#xD;
      understand the recovery process after delivery. The investigators will identify risk factors,&#xD;
      especially those that are modifiable and associated with a poorer ObsQoR score and hence a&#xD;
      poor quality of recovery after delivery. This data may then be used to educate women and&#xD;
      manage expectations in the postpartum period, and help develop potential therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
