  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the OPTIMISER Registry is to prospectively and retrospectively collect&#xD;
      baseline, clinical and procedural data in patients who present with AMI and are treated with&#xD;
      PCI as well as prospectively collect the clinical outcome data. Outcomes will be compared in&#xD;
      different clinical subgroups. The impact of PCI in AMI in general as well as cardiovascular&#xD;
      outcomes after AMI will be assessed.&#xD;

      -  To assess procedural success and clinical outcomes among persons with AMI, who undergo&#xD;
           PCI and/ or CABG for AMI (STEMI or NSTEMI)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Periprocedural outcomes/ complications, which will be analyzed, represent: final&#xD;
                result (e.g. TIMI flow), stent expansion, dissections, perforations, prevalence of&#xD;
                thrombus (assessed by angiography and intravascular imaging)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Short and long-term clinical outcomes of interest including: new AMI, unstable&#xD;
                angina (UA), stent-/scaffold thrombosis, target lesion failure, target vessel&#xD;
                revascularization, ischemia driven revascularization, repeat hospitalization,&#xD;
                new/worsening heart failure, cardiogenic shock, stroke, bleedings, cardiovascular&#xD;
                death and all-cause death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe procedural and clinical performance of various balloon, stent and scaffold&#xD;
           devices implanted in patients presenting with AMI during the afore mentioned period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the impact of different devices and strategies used for lesion preparation and&#xD;
           PCI optimization strategies among patients undergoing PCI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe early and late angiographic and OCT-findings among coronary artery disease&#xD;
           in patients with AMI treated with various metallic stent and scaffold devices&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess possible predictors for coronary stent implantation or device failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the impact of different antithrombotic regimens on patient clinical outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study procedural and clinical outcomes among CAD patients requiring hemodynamic&#xD;
           support using mechanical devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe economic implications (cost-effectiveness) of various interventional&#xD;
           treatments for CAD.&#xD;

        In an all-comers design, virtually any AMI patient treated with PCI or CABG at the&#xD;
        Cardiology Division of Lucerne Cantonal Hospital and giving consent may be included. We&#xD;
        expect a total inclusion rate of around 400 patients per year at the LUKS. The prospective&#xD;
        recruitment is planned to continue for 10 years, which results in 4000 patients in the&#xD;
        prospective arm. In addition, a retrospective arm will include a random sample of 500&#xD;
        patients who presented with AMI and were treated with PCI or CABG in the 5 years prior to&#xD;
        study start (2016-2020).&#xD;
