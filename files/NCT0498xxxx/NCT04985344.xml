  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By age 18, roughly 8% of traumatized youth have met criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, with&#xD;
      numbers rising up to 40% in cases of sexual abuse and assault. To date there is no empirical&#xD;
      support for the use of psychopharmacological interventions as treatment of pediatric PTSD.&#xD;
      Trauma-focused psychotherapeutic/TFP approaches should be favored in childhood PTSD. However,&#xD;
      when compared to active control conditions, TFP produced a mean effect size on child and&#xD;
      adolescents population (g=0.83). Moreover, in therapies with a substantial exposure&#xD;
      component, the intense and lengthy reexperiencing of the traumatic event results in a&#xD;
      substantial proportion of participants dropping out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reactivation of a previously consolidated memory can make it labile, subsequently&#xD;
      requiring a re-stabilization of it called reconsolidation of the memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acting on these reconsolidation processes makes possible to interfere with the subsequent&#xD;
      storage of this memory.&#xD;

      By age 18, roughly 8% of traumatized youth have met criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, with&#xD;
      numbers rising up to 40% in cases of sexual abuse and assault. To date there is no empirical&#xD;
      support for the use of psychopharmacological interventions as treatment of pediatric PTSD.&#xD;
      Trauma-focused psychotherapeutic/TFP approaches should be favored in childhood PTSD. However,&#xD;
      when compared to active control conditions, TFP produced a mean effect size on child and&#xD;
      adolescents population (g=0.83). Moreover, in therapies with a substantial exposure&#xD;
      component, the intense and lengthy reexperiencing of the traumatic event results in a&#xD;
      substantial proportion of participants dropping out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reactivation of a previously consolidated memory can make it labile, subsequently&#xD;
      requiring a re-stabilization of it called reconsolidation of the memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acting on these reconsolidation processes makes possible to interfere with the subsequent&#xD;
      storage of this memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of the targeted reactivation of the traumatic memory and the intake of an&#xD;
      agent that decreases the reconsolidation can thus disrupt the recall of unwanted memories and&#xD;
      thus serve as a treatment for people suffering from traumatic memories, such as in PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since stimulation of β-noradrenergic receptors facilitates the consolidation of memories as&#xD;
      well as their re-consolidation, an antagonist of these receptors, propranolol, has generated&#xD;
      considerable interest as a treatment to alleviate emotional and traumatic memories in&#xD;
      individuals with PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In adults diagnosed with long-standing PTSD two 6-week, double-blind, placebocontrolled,&#xD;
      randomised clinical trials, one in 60 subjects and the other in 67 have shown promising&#xD;
      results. PTSD participants who actively recalled their traumatic event under the influence of&#xD;
      propranolol once a week for up to 6 weeks showed a substantial decrease in symptom ratings&#xD;
      compared with placebo. Thus, all of this data led the team to propose a comparable design&#xD;
      study in children with PTSD&#xD;

    <measure>Child Post-Traumatic Stress Reaction Index/CPTS-RI</measure>
    <time_frame>week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The main evaluation criterion will be the difference between the Child Post-Traumatic Stress Reaction Index/CPTS-RI total score administered at week 8 and week 0. The CPTS-RI is a scale comprised of 20 Likert-type items, intended for children from 6 to 16 years, which evaluates the symptoms of PTSD after exposure to various traumatic events. Each item frequency is rated on a 5-point scale, from never (=0) to almost always (=4). The global score consists of the sum of the 20 items and ranges from 0 to 80, with higher scores indicating higher PTSD symptom severity. The time required for completion of the scale is 15-20 min. A total score of 12-24 is associated with a mild level of PTSD, from 25-39 with a moderate level, from 40-59 with a severe level, and ≥60 with a very severe level.</description>
