  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of 50 mg opicapone when administered&#xD;
      with the existing treatment of levodopa (L-dopa) plus a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (DDCI),&#xD;
      in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with end-of-dose motor fluctuations and associated pain&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, parallel group,&#xD;
      interventional clinical study in PD patients with end-of-dose motor fluctuations and&#xD;
      associated pain. The study consists of a 1-week screening period, a 24-week double-blind&#xD;
      treatment period and 2 weeks of follow-up period. The duration of treatment for the&#xD;
      individual patient is expected to be up to 24 weeks.&#xD;
