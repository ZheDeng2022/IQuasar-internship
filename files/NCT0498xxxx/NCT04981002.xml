  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients with acute complaints related to the musculoskeletal system are prevalent and&#xD;
      correspond to a large percentage of visits to Emergency Care Units (UPA), often performed by&#xD;
      general practitioners. These patients, in most cases, present complaints associated with&#xD;
      low-complexity trauma, which can be diagnosed through targeted physical examination and&#xD;
      treated with basic guidelines (behavioral/medicinal). The diagnosis of a more complex&#xD;
      fracture or injury requires an assessment by an orthopedist. Currently, patients with&#xD;
      orthopedic complaints are often seen by telemedicine, but there are no studies that have&#xD;
      compared the diagnostic accuracy of remote assessment with standard face-to-face assessment.&#xD;
      Telemedicine is a recognized medical care strategy used for various situations, including as&#xD;
      a virtual emergency service. Despite the current widespread use, there are few studies that&#xD;
      have evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of telemedicine compared to face-to-face evaluation,&#xD;
      and there are no specific studies in patients with orthopedic symptoms. Scientific evidence&#xD;
      of high diagnostic accuracy in telemedicine care can support the investment and expansion of&#xD;
      this modality, expanding and facilitating the access of patients to the health service, with&#xD;
      a reduction in costs and the rational use of resources. The objective of the study is to&#xD;
      analyze the diagnostic accuracy of telemedicine-guided self-examination compared to a&#xD;
      face-to-face medical evaluation at the UPA in adult patients with orthopedic complaints.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are: evaluation of medical care time, indication of additional tests,&#xD;
      guidance, medical prescription, proposed destination after completion of care, cost and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction. It is a a randomized, prospective, single-center study carried out in&#xD;
      the telemedicine and UPA sectors of Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein. Randomization will be&#xD;
      1:1 and patients will be allocated in the Tele group (evaluation by telemedicine followed by&#xD;
      face-to-face evaluation) or in the Standard group (in-person evaluation). The sample&#xD;
      calculated for non-inferiority was 50 patients in each group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, prospective, single-center study carried out in the telemedicine sectors and&#xD;
      emergency care unit of Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Ibirapuera Unit. The randomization&#xD;
      will be 1:1, from the commercial application Randomizer Â®, by the member of the project&#xD;
      Renata Vidigal Correia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, patients will be included in one of two possible groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. TELE Group: first care will be provided via telemedicine with a clinical physician,&#xD;
           guiding self-examination guided by telemedicine. After the remote consultation, a&#xD;
           face-to-face evaluation will be carried out with an orthopedist, according to&#xD;
           institutional protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. GrupoSTANDARD: Face-to-face care with an orthopedist, according to institutional&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The face-to-face evaluation will be carried out by the local UPA medical and orthopedic care&#xD;
      team and the telemedicine evaluation by the fixed medical team of the HIAE service&#xD;
      responsible for urgency/emergency care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be of non-inferiority with evaluation of accuracy in both groups, since the&#xD;
      telemedicine group, after completion of care, will pass the face-to-face consultation (gold&#xD;
      standard).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both in face-to-face and telemedicine assessments, clinical data, final diagnosis,&#xD;
      destination, total time of care, guidance, complementary exams and prescription will be&#xD;
      computed. In the face-to-face evaluation, additional exams and medications received in situ&#xD;
      will also be computed. The final diagnoses will receive nomenclature according to the&#xD;
      International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems - ICD 10&#xD;
      (requirement of institutional records - Cerner) and will be grouped according to the&#xD;
      equivalence of the syndromic diagnosis. The diagnosis of the face-to-face evaluation is made&#xD;
      following institutional protocols based on extensive medical literature and approved by the&#xD;
      institutional clinical staff, being representative of current medical practice and will be&#xD;
      considered the gold standard diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total service time in minutes will be evaluated, verifying if telemedicine can change the&#xD;
      total medical service time. The fee for complementary exams will be counted in the number of&#xD;
      exams requested and their categorization (laboratory exam or imaging exam); the&#xD;
      quantification in number and its categorization (behavioral measures, cryotherapy guidelines&#xD;
      and new medical evaluation if necessary) of the guidelines; categorization of prescription&#xD;
      (only symptomatic or medication in the UPA); destination categorization (high - item valid&#xD;
      for both services, hospitalization - valid item for face-to-face care, search for the ER -&#xD;
      valid item for telemedicine care), hospital cost (measured by the need for&#xD;
      immobilization/complementary tests), and indication of additional tests .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final diagnosis will be considered by the official report of the radiologist based on the&#xD;
      imaging exams performed.&#xD;
