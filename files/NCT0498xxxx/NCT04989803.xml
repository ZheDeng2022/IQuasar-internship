    <textblock>
      The primary objective of Phase 1a of the study is to evaluate the safety of KITE-363 in&#xD;
      participants with relapsed and/or refractory (r/r) B-cell lymphoma and to determine the dose&#xD;
      level(s) for Phase 1b dose expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of Phase 1b of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of KITE-363 in&#xD;
      participants with r/r B-cell lymphoma as measured by the objective response rate (ORR)&#xD;
      defined as complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR) rates.&#xD;

    <description>Phase 1a (Dose Escalation): Participants with r/r large B-cell lymphoma will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by a single target starting dose of KITE-363 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) transduced autologous T cells. Based on dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed in the first cohort, additional participants will be enrolled and administered escalating dose of KITE-363.&#xD;
Phase 1b (Dose Expansion): After completion of dose escalation, additional participants with r/r B-cell lymphoma across different disease indications will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by a single dose of KITE-363 at 1 or more dose-level deemed to be tolerable.</description>
