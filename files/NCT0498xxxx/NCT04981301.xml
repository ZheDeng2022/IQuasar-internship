  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spine surgery in thoracolumbar region is one of the most common surgeries performed for the&#xD;
      treatment of leg and back pain. Pain management is especially important for these patients&#xD;
      since chronic pain often occurs after surgery. Severe pain may occur at postoperative period&#xD;
      in patients following lumbar disc herniation (LDH) operation. Postoperative effective pain&#xD;
      treatment provides early mobilization and shorter hospital stay, thus complications due to&#xD;
      hospitalization such as infection and thromboembolism may be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound-guided quadratus lumborum block (QLB) is a fascial plane block where local&#xD;
      anesthetic is injected adjacent to the quadratus lumborum muscle with the goal of&#xD;
      anesthetizing the thoracolumbar nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of US-guided QLB for postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia management after lumbar disc herniation-laminectomy surgery. The primary aim is to&#xD;
      evaluate postoperative pain scores (VAS), the secondary aim is to evaluate use of rescue&#xD;
      analgesia and adverse effects (allergic reaction, nausea, vomiting).&#xD;

      Spine surgery in thoracolumbar region is one of the most common surgeries performed for the&#xD;
      treatment of leg and back pain. Pain management is especially important for these patients&#xD;
      since chronic pain often occurs after surgery. Severe pain may occur at postoperative period&#xD;
      in patients following lumbar disc herniation (LDH) operation. Postoperative effective pain&#xD;
      treatment provides early mobilization and shorter hospital stay, thus complications due to&#xD;
      hospitalization such as infection and thromboembolism may be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioids are one of the most preferred drugs among the analgesic agents. Parenteral opioids&#xD;
      are generally performed for patients after surgery. However opioids have undesirable adverse&#xD;
      events such as nausea, vomiting, itching, sedation and respiratory depression (opioid-related&#xD;
      adverse events).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various methods may be performed to reduce the use of systemic opioids and for effective pain&#xD;
      treatment. US-guided interfascial plane blocks have been used increasily due to the&#xD;
      advantages of ultrasound in anesthesia practice. Ultrasound-guided quadratus lumborum block&#xD;
      (QLB) is a fascial plane block where local anesthetic is injected adjacent to the quadratus&#xD;
      lumborum muscle with the goal of anesthetizing the thoracolumbar nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of US-guided QLB for postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia management after lumbar disc herniation-laminectomy surgery. The primary aim is to&#xD;
      evaluate postoperative pain scores (VAS), the secondary aim is to evaluate use of rescue&#xD;
      analgesia and adverse effects (allergic reaction, nausea, vomiting).&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Quadratus Lumborum Block</intervention_name>
    <description>The block procedure will be applied after the surgery and before extubation with patients in the prone position by using US (Vivid Q, GE Healthcare, US). Under aseptic conditions using 10% povidone iodine, the convex probe will be covered with a sterile sheath and a 22G, 100 mm block needle (Braun Stimuplex Ultra 360, Germany) will be used. After visualizing the abdominal muscles with the anterior approach, the needle will be punctured in the Petit triangle and 5 ml of saline will be injected into the anterolateral border of the quadratus lumborum muscle. After the block location is confirmed, 15 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected. The same process will be applied to the opposite side (30 ml totally).</description>
