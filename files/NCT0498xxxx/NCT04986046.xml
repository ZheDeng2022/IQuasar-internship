  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to test if fruit and vegetable prescription vouchers (FVRx) and a&#xD;
      cooking skills program (Home Plate) can improve dietary quality, food security (access to a&#xD;
      sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food), feelings about the home and community&#xD;
      food environments, and caregiver mental health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the effect of a fruit and vegetable&#xD;
      voucher, a certificate redeemable in participating locations, program (FVRx) and a cooking&#xD;
      skills program (Home Plate) on dietary quality, food security, perceptions of the food&#xD;
      environment, and mental health. Investigators also aim to determine the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of the programs.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Diet quality</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Diet quality of the child will be measured by use of an automated self-administered 24-hour dietary recall system (ASA24), completed by the child's caregiver. The ASA24 is a web-based tool that enables automatically coded, self-administered 24-hour diet recalls, providing high-quality dietary data. The ASA24 system is adapted from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Automated Multiple-Pass Method, which has been validated. Validation and evaluation studies of ASA24 have found close agreement with standardized interview-administered 24 hour recall.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Food security - Food Security Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Food security status will be assessed using the USDA Food Security Survey. The 18-item USDA Food Security Survey the time period (e.g. last 30 days) and specify lack of resources as the reason for the behavior or experience (e.g. &quot;couldn't afford more food,&quot; or &quot;there was not enough money for food&quot;) to determine the level food security (very low, low, marginal, and full). Participants are asked to check boxes next to statements that best describe their behavior. These surveys will be administered via REDCap with telephonic support by study staff at baseline and 8 weeks following the initiation of the intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Food security - Hunger Coping Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Food security status will be assessed using the Hunger Coping Scale. The five items from the Hunger Coping Scale question the time period (e.g. last 30 days) and specify lack of resources as the reason for the behavior or experience (e.g. &quot;couldn't afford more food,&quot; or &quot;there was not enough money for food&quot;) to determine the level food security (very low, low, marginal, and full). Participants are asked to check boxes next to statements that best describe their behavior. These surveys will be administered via REDCap with telephonic support by study staff at baseline and 8 weeks following the initiation of the intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver diet quality</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver diet quality will be measured by the caregivers completion of the automated self-administered 24-hour dietary recall system (ASA24) for themselves at baseline and 8 weeks following the initiation of the nutrition education intervention. The ASA24, is a web-based tool that enables automatically coded, self-administered 24-hour diet recalls, providing high-quality dietary data. The ASA24 system is adapted from the USDA Automated Multiple-Pass Method, which has been validated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver perceived food environment</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Perceptions of food environment will be assessed using the Perceived Nutrition Environment Measures survey (NEMS-P). The survey is completed by the person who does the majority of the food shopping in a household to learn about his/her perceptions of the nutrition environments (where food is consumed or purchased, and in the home). Participants are asked to check boxes next to statements that best describe their behavior (e.g. &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot; or &quot;never or rarely&quot; to &quot;almost always&quot;. Components within the survey ar examined individually. The survey can discriminate perceptions of nutrition environments between residents of higher- and lower-socioeconomic status (SES) neighborhoods. The NEMS-P will be administered via REDCap with telephonic support by study staff at baseline and 8 weeks following the initiation of the nutrition education intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver mental health - Loneliness</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver mental health will be measured using the Revised UCLA (R-UCLA) Loneliness Scale designed to measure one's subjective feelings of loneliness as well as feelings of social isolation. Participants rate each item on a scale from &quot;hardly ever&quot; to &quot;often&quot;. Minimum score is 3 maximum score is 9; higher scores indicate worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Program feasibility - Voucher Redemption</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Program feasibility will be assessed through voucher redemption</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Program feasibility - Home Plate Class Attendance</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Program feasibility will be assessed through virtual Home Plate class attendance</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Program feasibility - Participant Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Program feasibility will be assessed through participant feedback measured by completion of the participant satisfaction surveys and phone interviews post intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Urine Metabolites</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Urine samples will be collected from subjects at baseline and 8 weeks and measured by metabolomic analysis to quantify association with dietary biomarkers.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver mental health - Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depressive Scale (CES-D) is a 20-item questionnaire that includes a brief self-report for which the scale is designed to measure self-reported symptoms associated with depression experienced in the past week. Participants rate each item on a scale from 0= &quot;Rarely or none of the time (less than 1-day)&quot;, 1= &quot;Some or a little of the time (1-2 days),&quot; 2= &quot;Occasionally or a moderate amount of the time (3-4 days,&quot; or 3=&quot;Most or all of the time (5-7 days).&quot;The scale will be administered via REDCap with telephonic support by study staff at baseline and 8 weeks following the initiation of the interventions. High scores indicating greater depressive symptoms.</description>
