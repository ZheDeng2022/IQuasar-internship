    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a total of 44 subjects with clinically measurable keloid lesions. At&#xD;
      least 50% of subjects (at least 22 out of the 44 subjects) will also have documented&#xD;
      diagnosis of concomitant type 2 atopic/allergic) inflammatory diseases. In Phase I, subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized (3:1) to either receive weekly dupilumab or placebo for 24 weeks. At Week&#xD;
      24, both groups will enter Phase II of the study in which all subjects will receive weekly&#xD;
      doses of dupilumab up to Week 52. The treatment period will conclude at Week 52.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a total of 44 subjects with clinically measurable keloid lesions. At&#xD;
      least 50% of subjects (at least 22 out of the 44 subjects) will also have documented&#xD;
      diagnosis of concomitant type 2 atopic/allergic) inflammatory diseases. In Phase I, subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized (3:1) to either receive weekly dupilumab or placebo for 24 weeks. At Week&#xD;
      24, both groups will enter Phase II of the study in which all subjects will receive weekly&#xD;
      doses of dupilumab up to Week 52. The treatment period will conclude at Week 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After providing consent, subjects will be assessed for study eligibility during the screening&#xD;
      period (within 28 days of Baseline), which includes a review of the subject's past and&#xD;
      current medical conditions as well as a family history of keloids, atopic dermatitis (AD),&#xD;
      asthma and other atopic diseases, detailed review of past and current medications, review of&#xD;
      past topical and systemic treatments/therapies and invasive treatments (including surgery,&#xD;
      radiation, and cryotherapy) for keloids, limited physical examination, clinical assessments&#xD;
      (number, location and measurements via tonometer and calipers). Measurements of keloid&#xD;
      lesions will be standardized and performed using Verneir Calipers. These are accurate to the&#xD;
      nearest 0.01mm in their measurement of all dimensions. Keloid distensibility (hardness) will&#xD;
      be measured using a tonometer, a tool that has been adapted for use in systemic sclerosis and&#xD;
      can give insight into softening of lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet inclusion criteria for eligibility will undergo Baseline assessments at&#xD;
      Week 0, including clinical assessments (number, location and measurements via tonometer and&#xD;
      calipers), review of concomitant medications, standardized clinical photography,&#xD;
      questionnaires (a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and a Keloid-Quality of Life Index&#xD;
      (K-QLI) questionnaire), and additional skin assessments if he/she concurrently has atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis (EASI, IGA, BSA and SCORAD will be used to evaluate existing atopic dermatitis).&#xD;
      Blood samples and skin biopsies will be collected for mechanistic studies (described below)&#xD;
      at various timepoints for RNA, DNA and protein analyses, as well as for analyses of IgE and&#xD;
      serum CRP. Two 4.5 mm biopsies will be performed at Baseline: one from a keloid lesion and&#xD;
      one from an adjacent non-lesional area. Non-lesional biopsies will mimic nascent trauma (e.g.&#xD;
      surgery, or other inflammatory processes) and evaluate the effectiveness of dupilumab in&#xD;
      preventing new keloid lesion formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return for visits at weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 28, 36, 48, and 52 following study&#xD;
      treatment initiation for repeat clinical assessments (number, location, and measurements via&#xD;
      tonometer and calipers), medication reviews, blood and biopsy collection, surveys, and&#xD;
      monitoring for adverse events. At week 24 a second lesional biopsy will be performed (from&#xD;
      the same keloid area biopsy at baseline, but away from the previous biopsy scar), and at week&#xD;
      48 both a lesional (again from the same keloid, but away from prior biopsies) and a&#xD;
      non-lesional biopsy will be performed. Bloods will be done at baseline, week 4, week 16, week&#xD;
      24, week 48. The biopsy sites as well as other lesional areas will be monitored at each&#xD;
      subsequent visit by clinical assessment (number, location and measurements via tonometer and&#xD;
      calipers) and standardized clinical photography.&#xD;

    <measure>Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>For those with concomitant atopic dermatitis, disease severity assessments will be performed. The EASI index assigns proportionate values to 4 body regions. Each region is assigned a score of 0 to 3, indicating none, mild, moderate, and severe clinical expression. The percentage of area involved is also assigned an eruption proportional score from 0 to 6. The total body score for each body region is obtained by multiplying the sum of the severity scores by the area score, then multiplying the result by the constant weighted value assigned to that body region. The sum of these scores gives the EASI total from 0-72, with higher score indicating more severity.</description>

The subjective items include daily pruritus and sleeplessness, graded on a 10-cm visual analogue scale, with maximum subjective score 20. SCORAD full score is 0-103, with higher score indicating more symptoms.</description>

             have been treated with surgery, cryotherapy, radiation, or any other procedure that&#xD;
             leads to a deformity that interferes with proper clinical assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 50% of the subjects: subject has documented diagnosis of concomitant type 2&#xD;
             (atopic/allergic) (e.g., active AD, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal&#xD;
             polyposis, food allergy confirmed by skin prick test or food allergen specific IgE,&#xD;
             seasonal allergies, other confirmed allergies).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is judged to be in otherwise good overall health as judged by the&#xD;
             investigator, based on medical history, physical examination, and laboratory testing.&#xD;
             (NOTE: The definition of good health means a subject does not have uncontrolled&#xD;
             significant co-morbid conditions).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test at&#xD;
             Screening and Baseline. While on investigational product and for at least 28 days&#xD;
