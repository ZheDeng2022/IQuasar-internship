  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate whether a 7-day dietary high protein supplementation of 90&#xD;
      grams per day increases plasma sodium levels in hyponatremic patients with chronic SIAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will receive first dietary high protein supplementation for one week. After&#xD;
      a wash-out phase of at least one week, the patients will receive oral urea for another week.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyponatremia (blood sodium &lt;135 mmol/l) is the most frequent electrolyte and fluid&#xD;
      disturbance with a prevalence up to 30% in hospitalized patients. The most common etiology of&#xD;
      euvolemic hyponatremia is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) which is also the&#xD;
      main etiology of hyponatremia overall. Urea osmotic diuresis has been reported to cause&#xD;
      hypernatremia in critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU), showing that urea can&#xD;
      influence sodium levels. Increasing solute intake with oral urea represents a valid treatment&#xD;
      approach to increase urine volume and solute free water clearance through osmotic diuresis&#xD;
      and reduction of urinary sodium excretion in SIAD. In Switzerland, urea is a medical food&#xD;
      prepared as a compounding agent by pharmacies. Endogenous proteins and dietary protein are&#xD;
      metabolized into nitrogen which is metabolized to soluble excretable urea by the liver.&#xD;
      Protein intake could represent an osmotic relevant source of urea. The Jone's factor of 6,25&#xD;
      is commonly used to convert nitrogen to protein equivalent, assuming an average nitrogen&#xD;
      content of 16% in protein (100g protein / 6,5 = 16g nitrogen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urea (CH₄N₂O) contains 46,6% nitrogen (atomic weight of nitrogen = 14 g/mol, atomic weight of&#xD;
      urea = 60,1 g/mol). Using these ratios, 30g urea would correspond to 14g nitrogen and 87,5g&#xD;
      protein. In this study, a 90g protein supplementation will be used, which corresponds roughly&#xD;
      to 30g urea, in form of a daily intake of protein powder (Whey Protein®, foodspring GmbH,&#xD;
      Germany), which is freely marketed as food in Switzerland. Both interventional products are&#xD;
      not considered as drugs. This study is to analyze whether protein supplementation can&#xD;
      increase plasma sodium levels in patients with SIAD by increasing urinary urea excretion.&#xD;
