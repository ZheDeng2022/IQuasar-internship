  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although, cervical cancer frequency has dramatically declined in regions where screening&#xD;
      programs have been implemented the incidence rates of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia&#xD;
      (CIN) 2/3 lesion is increasing significantly [1,2]. The loop electrosurgical excision&#xD;
      procedure serves up a number of advantages over traditional therapies such as cold knife&#xD;
      conization or laser conization for CIN management [1,2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the fact that a LEEP is a brief procedure, it can cause significant pain and&#xD;
      discomfort to the patient in the absence of adequate anesthesia. The type of anesthesia&#xD;
      (local or loco-regional) is not clearly specified at some special national guidelines [3,4].&#xD;
      In some countries, it is usually performed as an outpatient procedure using local anesthesia&#xD;
      (LA) whereas in others local-regional anesthesia is preferred [5,7]. Advantages of outpatient&#xD;
      LEEP to both the healthcare providers and patients include shorter recovery time, avoidance&#xD;
      of general anesthesia, more convenience, and cost-effectiveness. However, under LA if the&#xD;
      patient moves during the procedure it is very difficult for the surgeon to perform the&#xD;
      procedure accurately and may result in various complications. Only one randomized trial&#xD;
      compared the two types of anesthesia during LEEP. The authors of that study reported that&#xD;
      LEEP performing with LA was associated with less blood loss and higher patient satisfaction&#xD;
      [8]. However, that study has some limitations. Therefore, we conducted this randomized study&#xD;
      to compare patients' satisfaction, histopathologic results, and short-term morbidity in&#xD;
      patients undergoing LEEP under LA or GA.&#xD;

    <description>GA group intravenous 2-3 μ/kg fentanyl followed by 2 mg/kg propofol. were administered for anesthesia induction. After a laryngeal mask insertion anesthesia was maintained by inhalation of sevoflurane in an oxygen (60%) and nitrous oxide (40%) mixture to maintain a minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) of 0.8%-1.3%.</description>

    <description>According to the size of the cervix, a loop electrode size was selected. The electrical power for the loop electrode was set to 50 W cut and 45 W coagulation in blended mode. LEEP was performed by carefully passing the loop around the transformation zone from 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock. An additional top-hat excision was performed in patients with a lesion deep in the cervical canal. After completion of the excision, hemostasis was exclusively obtained using the ball electrode in spray coagulation mode. No suturing or other methods were used for hemostasis.</description>
