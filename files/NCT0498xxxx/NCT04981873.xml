      To translate and culturally adapt PELVIC FLOOR DISTRESS INVENTORY SHORT FORM (PFDI-20) into&#xD;
      Urdu and To evaluate the reliability and validity of Urdu version of Pelvic floor distress&#xD;
      inventory (short form).Urdu is the national language of Pakistan. The PFDI-20 has not been&#xD;
      translated into Urdu so far. In order to use in Urdu speaking people, it is necessary to&#xD;
      translate and culturally adapt PFDI-20 into Urdu language, so that it can be better&#xD;
      understood by this population.&#xD;

      Pelvic floor disorders, which include urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, and pelvic&#xD;
      organ prolapse, are highly prevalent conditions in women, affecting overall, almost 25% of&#xD;
      women in the United States Because there are different types of pelvic floor disorders&#xD;
      (PFDs), symptoms of different PFDs can vary or overlap. For example, women with PFDs may&#xD;
      feel: heaviness, fullness, pulling, or aching in the vagina that gets worse by the end of the&#xD;
      day or is related to a bowel movement; See or feel a &quot;bulge&quot; or &quot;something coming out&quot; of the&#xD;
      vagina, have difficulty starting to urinate or emptying the bladder completely, leak urine&#xD;
      when coughing, laughing, or exercising, feel an urgent or frequent need to urinate, feel pain&#xD;
      while urinating, leak stool or have difficulty controlling gas, have constipation and have&#xD;
      difficulty making it to the bathroom in time PFDI-20 has been translated into many languages&#xD;
      across the globe to check the validity, reliability and responsiveness of the scale, in their&#xD;
      native languages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study was conducted to assess validity of PFDI-20 in Finnish by using Multistep translation&#xD;
      method with sample size of 63, they found it a valid tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Turkish language validity and reliability of this tool was addressed on larger number of&#xD;
      women and was recommended as valid and reliable tool&#xD;
