  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aimed to conduct a prospective longitudinal interventionnal monocentric study to assess&#xD;
      the ability of seven tesla MRI to detect diffuses axonal lesions in patients presenting a&#xD;
      post concussional syndrom (PCS) at seven days about a mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). Our&#xD;
      first objective was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of seven tesla MRI runned at seven&#xD;
      days after MTBI among patients presenting a PCS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among patients admitted in emergency care units in France for mild traumatic brain injury, 10&#xD;
      % will develop post concussionnal symptoms. The variability of the clinical presentation lead&#xD;
      to a syndrome at the border of neurology, psychiatry and neuro-traumatology. Ninety per cent&#xD;
      of these patients will have a favorable evolution in three to six months while ten per cent&#xD;
      will have persistant symptoms : dizziness, headache, nausea, drowsiness, anxio-depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, irritability, memory impairments, attentionnal disorders. This conduct to an&#xD;
      additionnal medical and social cost (medical re-consultation in emergency services,&#xD;
      pharmaceutical expenditure due to over medication, social recognition, deterioration of&#xD;
      social and professionnal relationships …). The litterature data show the presence of diffuse&#xD;
      axonal lesions (DAL) frequently observed in patients victims of MTBI. These lesions seemed to&#xD;
      be correlate with the occurrence of post concussional symptoms. New brain imagery have lead&#xD;
      to these discoveries but are not relevant in clinical routine (functionnal MRI, Diffusion&#xD;
      Tensor Imaging, tractography). Computed Tomography is often normal and not able to detect&#xD;
      these lesions. Standard MRI is not enough sensible for the detection of the DAL. Some autor&#xD;
      shows alose that his sensibility decrease in time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These observations and encouraging results lead us to initiate a prospective interventionnal,&#xD;
      longitudinal, pilot study monocentric using seven tesla MRI to evaluate its input in the&#xD;
      detection of diffuse axonal lesions among patients presenting post concussionnal symptoms&#xD;
      after a mild traumatic brain injury at day seven after they are admitted to our emergency&#xD;
      service.&#xD;
