      The APEC study is a multi-center, retrospective ,real-world study of anlotinib combined with&#xD;
      PD-1 inhibitors for patients with histologically confirmed advanced and metastatic esophageal&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) that progressed after 1or more lines of therapy, conducted at&#xD;
      8 sites in China. Patients received anlotinib combined with PD-1 inhibitors , every 3 weeks&#xD;
      for up to 2 years, until progression of disease, unacceptable toxic effects occurred, or&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent. The primary end point was the progression-free survival (PFS)among all&#xD;
      patients. Secondary end points included Adverse events (AEs),objective response rate (ORR)&#xD;
      ,duration of response (DOR), , and overall survival (OS). Tumor response was assessed per the&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1.&#xD;
