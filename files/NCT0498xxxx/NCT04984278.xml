  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of nabiximols compared&#xD;
      with placebo on a clinical measure of velocity-dependent muscle tone in the lower limbs&#xD;
      (Lower Limb Muscle Tone-6 [LLMT-6]) in participants with multiple sclerosis (MS). LLMT-6 is&#xD;
      defined as the average of the 6 individual Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)-transformed scores&#xD;
      of knee flexors, knee extensors, and plantar flexors on both sides of the body.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each period of this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-treatment,&#xD;
      2-period, crossover trial includes a 7-day Baseline period, a 3-week treatment period&#xD;
      (comprising a 2-week titration phase and a 1-week maintenance phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will enter the 7-day baseline period of each treatment period. During&#xD;
      baseline, participants will maintain their optimized oral MS antispasticity medication&#xD;
      regimen and record their 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) spasticity score and spasm&#xD;
      count using an electronic daily diary. On Day 1, eligible participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      1 of 2 treatment sequences, each composed of 2 treatment periods, with administration of&#xD;
      multiple doses of nabiximols or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be advised to titrate the investigational medicinal product (IMP),&#xD;
      beginning with 1 spray/day, to an optimized dose or to a maximum of 12 sprays/day over the&#xD;
      first 14 days of treatment. Participants should continue at the same dose level achieved at&#xD;
      the end of the titration phase ±1 spray divided into a morning dose and an evening dose for&#xD;
      the remainder of the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower limb muscle tone, health-related quality of life, safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics will be evaluated during the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who complete the trial will participate for a total of approximately 11 weeks&#xD;
      (77 days), including the 7-day baseline period.&#xD;

    <description>Nabiximols is a complex botanical medicine formulated from extracts of the cannabis plant that contains the principal cannabinoids delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) and also contains minor constituents, including other cannabinoid and non-cannabinoid plant components, such as terpenes, sterols, and triglycerides. Study dependent: Each spray delivers 100 microliters (μL) of nabiximols. A pre-determined number of sprays, but no less than 4 sprays, of nabiximols will be self-administered by participants as an oromucosal spray, under supervision of trial staff during 2 study visits to the trial site after they temporarily discontinued treatment with prescribed nabiximols (Sativex) as part of their regular medication.</description>

    <description>Placebo to match nabiximols is presented as an oromucosal spray containing the excipients ethanol and propylene glycol (50% v/v) with colorings and flavored with peppermint oil (0.05% v/v). Each spray delivers 100 μL containing no active ingredients.</description>
