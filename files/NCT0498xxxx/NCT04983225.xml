  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of human&#xD;
      dental pulp stem cells injection in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to provide the basis for dosage regimen for further clinical trials and to&#xD;
      evaluate the preliminary efficacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Initial periodontal therapy involves cleaning, scaling and root planing. The present&#xD;
      dose-escalating, randomized, double-blind, blank controlled clinical trial will be conducted&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety and tolerability of dental pulp mesenchymal stem cells injection as an&#xD;
      adjunct with Initial periodontal therapy in chronic periodontitis. Patients meeting the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be assigned into five dose groups, in a 3:1 ratio within each group&#xD;
      to treat with drug or placebo after initial periodontal therapy. The evaluation will be&#xD;
      conducted based on safety and efficacy end points.&#xD;

    <description>Clinical Attachment Level (AL) may be assessed to the nearest millimeter by means of a graduated probe and expressed as the distance in millimeters from the CEJ to the bottom of the probeable gingival/periodontal pocket.&#xD;
The clinical assessment requires the measurement of the distance from the free gingival margin (FGM) to the CEJ for each tooth surface. After this recording, AL may be calculated from the periodontal chart (i.e. PPD - distance CEJ to FGM). In cases with gingival recession, the distance FGM-CEJ turns negative and, hence, will be added to the PPD to determine AL.</description>
