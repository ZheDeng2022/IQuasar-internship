    <textblock>
      Decentralized clinical study designed to collect further cough sounds, self-reported&#xD;
      symptoms, and medical treatment questionnaires from participants enrolled on the COVID-Cough&#xD;
      Study (&quot;Study 1&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this further data collection study (&quot;Study 2&quot;) is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. develop an understanding of changes in cough sounds associated with COVID-19 and how&#xD;
           they alter during the disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. develop an understanding of other causes of COVID-19-like symptoms and their associated&#xD;
           cough sound patterns; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. gain a broader understanding of the clinical outcomes of individuals who present for&#xD;
           COVID-19 testing.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to be administered in a decentralized manner to collect self-reported&#xD;
      COVID-19 symptoms, cough sample recordings and descriptions of recent medical treatment to&#xD;
      investigate the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Whether patterns unique to COVID-19 disease can be detected in cough sounds collected&#xD;
           over time;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The incidence of COVID-19 and other lung diseases within individuals who test negative&#xD;
           for COVID-19;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Whether existing machine learning algorithms can detect the presence of disease in the&#xD;
           lower respiratory tract in participants; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Whether distinct cough sound patterns in COVID-19 disease are associated with the&#xD;
           requirement of medical treatment for COVID-19 disease. Through the administration of&#xD;
           Study 1, a list of potential participants will be created for whom the result of a&#xD;
           recent rt-qPCR COVID-19 test is known. Participants have been consented to allow for&#xD;
           outreach regarding further studies. Cough samples and answers to medical questions have&#xD;
           been collected from these individuals at the time of testing, and the aim of Study 2 is&#xD;
           to gather further cough samples and questionnaire answers over a period of 25 days.&#xD;
