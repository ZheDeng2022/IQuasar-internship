  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sedentary behaviour is particularly high among the older and in the presence of a chronic&#xD;
      pathology. Physical activity is limited mainly by the lack of accessibility to activities&#xD;
      offered in the city and the lack of motivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to study the physical solicitations and the well-being during the visit of a&#xD;
      museum (free or guided visit). Our hypothesis is that this cultural activity induces a&#xD;
      sufficient physical solicitation for sedentary people and for individuals with a post-stroke&#xD;
      motor disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the tests will be carried out during the same day by experienced physiotherapists.&#xD;
      Physical and well-being tests will be performed before and after the visits. The number of&#xD;
      steps taken during the visit will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a different approach to promote physical activity and this proposal is an original&#xD;
      way to stimulate the physical, psychic and social health of sedentary people. If the results&#xD;
      are beneficial, museums could become real health partners to stimulate the activity of&#xD;
      sedentary people.&#xD;
