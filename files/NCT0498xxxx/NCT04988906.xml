  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a before-and-after study examining the impact of real-time ventilation monitoring&#xD;
      during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Study investigators will compare ventilation quality&#xD;
      (rate, volume) performed during the resuscitation without the real-time feedback (before&#xD;
      phase), to ventilation quality with the use of real-time feedback using the Zoll Accuvent&#xD;
      device (after phase).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The before intervention phase of this study will involve no change in practice to cardiac&#xD;
      resuscitation by paramedics. Paramedics will be instructed to attach the Zoll AccuVent® to&#xD;
      the BVM at each use and to leave it attached throughout the duration of the resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the resuscitation the Zoll AccuVent® will monitor and record ventilation rates and&#xD;
      volumes that are being delivered during each ventilation performed utilizing the &quot;Real BVM&#xD;
      Help®&quot; dashboard, however rescuers will be blinded to this information and will not be able&#xD;
      to access it during the resuscitation. Post-call paramedics will upload the Zoll file&#xD;
      containing the ventilation data in addition to CPR quality data and cardiac rhythms. This is&#xD;
      consistent with current standard practice. These files will then be used by study&#xD;
      investigators for data analysis. During this initial phase, to avoid biasing the study&#xD;
      results the paramedics will only be trained on application of the Zoll AccuVent®, but will&#xD;
      not have access to the real-time dashboard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study intervention will involve a brief training session for paramedics during the annual&#xD;
      continuing medical education (CME) day. Training will consist of specifics of the study as&#xD;
      well as how to apply the Zoll AccuVent® device and use the device during a cardiac arrest.&#xD;
      Paramedics will be reminded of good ventilation practices during cardiac arrest and&#xD;
      post-cardiac arrest care as well as current standards of practice as defined by the American&#xD;
      Heart Association and Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intervention, paramedics will be &quot;un-blinded&quot; and able to utilize the real-time feedback&#xD;
      from the Zoll AccuVent® to help guide the delivery of ventilations during cardiac arrest&#xD;
      resuscitation. All other aspects of care will be provided in accordance with standard&#xD;
      practice at that time. Once the Zoll AccuVent® is applied, paramedics will use the real-time&#xD;
      monitoring capabilities of the device to monitor the delivery of ventilations (rate and&#xD;
      volume) during the resuscitation. Post-call paramedics will again upload files containing&#xD;
      ventilation data that study investigators will analyze to compare our results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bivariate descriptive statistics will be used to examine differences in ventilation&#xD;
      parameters between paramedics while using the Zoll AccuVent® and using standard monitoring&#xD;
      devices (standard of care). The mean volume (mL) will be calculated for each of the two&#xD;
      groups and Student's t-test will be used to compare the mean difference in volume (mL)&#xD;
      between groups. Investigators will compare the proportion of ventilations per minute that are&#xD;
      compliant with AHA guideline recommendations using Chi-square test for proportions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between ventilations (volume and rate) and ROSC will be assessed using&#xD;
      Poisson regression with robust standard errors. The results will be reported as relative&#xD;
      risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals for each of the included variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volume of ventilations (mL) will be evaluated as a continuous variable, with secondary&#xD;
      analyses analyzing per increase of 10mL as well as by quintiles of ventilation volume&#xD;
      provided. The rate of ventilations will be analyzed categorically as &quot;Compliant (8-10 per&#xD;
      minute)&quot;, &quot;Too Slow (&lt; 8 per minute)&quot;, or &quot;Too Fast (&gt; 10 per minute)&quot;. Regression models&#xD;
      will control for standard Utstein variables and additional modelling will examine for&#xD;
      interactions between ventilation parameters and patient sex, patient age, initial rhythm and&#xD;
      witness status. If a significant interaction is found subgroup analyses will be performed&#xD;
      examining these specific groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A priori subgroup analyses will be performed examining differences between airway strategies&#xD;
      (BVM vs. endotracheal intubation vs. supraglottic airway) as well as intra-arrest and&#xD;
      post-arrest management.&#xD;
