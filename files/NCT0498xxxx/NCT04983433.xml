      To set up a Brazilian strategy for early diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis using new modality&#xD;
      of echocardiography, the 3D echocardiography, and the level of myocardial deformity by&#xD;
      measuring the Strain Longitudinal through the technology Speckle Tracking.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) is an infiltrative cardiomyopathy caused by&#xD;
      extracellular deposition of insoluble transthyretin amyloid fibrils in the myocardium.&#xD;
      Unstable changes in the wild type and variant (familial) stimulate misfold aggregation and&#xD;
      ultimately form amyloid fibrils and deposit in various tissues including the heart.&#xD;
      Generally, cardiac amyloidosis is a cause of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.&#xD;
      The heart involvement with amyloidosis may represent part of a systemic disease with&#xD;
      multiorgan involvement as is seen with light chain amyloidosis (AL). A distinct form of&#xD;
      cardiac amyloidosis is the deposition of misfold transthyretin that results from aggregation&#xD;
      of the native protein or from inherited mutations in the transthyreyin (TTR) gene, in&#xD;
      particular in old patients and, with the increase of the aged population, the incidence of&#xD;
      ATTR-CA is increasing although its real presence and correct diagnosis lacks standardized&#xD;
      strategies, in particular due to diseases in the differential diagnosis with similar&#xD;
      phenotypes. The Wild type ATTR-CA also known as senile systemic amyloidosis caused by age&#xD;
      related misfolding of the TTR is the most frequent form of age-related cardiac amyloidosis.&#xD;
      Hereditary ATTR-CA due to gene mutations can also lead to cardiac amyloidosis but in Brazil&#xD;
      the most frequent mutation Val30Met usually has a clinical phenotype predominantly&#xD;
      neurological contrary to the USA, where the mutation Val122Ile is more frequent with a&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy phenotype. Lack of recognition of cardiac amyloidosis due to the presence of&#xD;
      nonspecific symptoms and associated comorbidities commonly leads to delayed diagnosis and&#xD;
      disease progression. Echocardiography is the first line technique for patients presenting&#xD;
      with heart failure but there is still a gap on the clinical utility of the multiparametric&#xD;
      parameters or their combination in patients where conventional echocardiogram raises the&#xD;
      suspicion of cardiac amyloidosis. The study will be one of the first in its kind to&#xD;
      prospectively delineate the presence of cardiac amyloidosis in a patient population where&#xD;
      this hypothesis has not been properly evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:In this cohort study, patients undergoing evaluation for amyloidosis will be&#xD;
      provided with diagnostic tools to confirm the diagnosis; in cases where verified, subtype&#xD;
      methodologies for amyloidosis subtype characterization will be employed. If there is a&#xD;
      suspicion of amyloidosis complementary imaging, etiologic evaluation with TTR sequencing,&#xD;
      paraprotein evaluation (serum and urine serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation,&#xD;
      serum-free light), and pyrophosphate scintigraphy will be performed. If the origin of amyloid&#xD;
      protein cannot be determined, further evaluation with biopsy of the amyloid deposition and&#xD;
      mass spectrometry will be undertaken. Initially, fatpad biopsy and minor salivary glands will&#xD;
      be performed. If unrevealing, the affected organ will be biopsied for amyloid tissue&#xD;
      characterization.&#xD;
