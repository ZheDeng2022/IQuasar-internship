      One hundred patients were enrolled, based on sensitization and doctor-diagnosed allergy to&#xD;
      HDM. Questionnaires were administered to document demographic and clinical characteristics.&#xD;
      Serum IgE reactivity toDermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp) extract, Der p 1, Der p 2 and Der&#xD;
      p 10 was measured by ImmunoCAP.&#xD;

      Background: The role of specific IgE (sIgE) against Der p 1and Der p 2 in Chinese patients&#xD;
      with house dust mite (HDM)allergy has not yet been well investigated.Methods: One hundred&#xD;
      patients were enrolled, based on sensitization and doctor-diagnosed allergy to HDM.&#xD;
      Questionnaires were administered to document demographic and clinical characteristics. Serum&#xD;
      IgE reactivity toDermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp) extract, Der p 1, Der p 2 and Der p 10&#xD;
      was measured by ImmunoCAP.&#xD;

        All patients were evaluated by a physician face-to-face, using a detailed questionnaire to&#xD;
        establish the nature and severity of their clinical manifestations. The questionnaire also&#xD;
        included demographic characteristics, a family history of allergic diseases and any other&#xD;
        history of allergic disease.&#xD;
