  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to investigate whether an online lifestyle modification&#xD;
      program for people with Metabolic Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD) through a mobile&#xD;
      application produces a significant reduction in liver steatosis and is associated with a&#xD;
      higher rate of weight loss compared to standard recommendations currently indicated in&#xD;
      Primary Care.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic liver disease are very common and potentially severe. For the most part, they are&#xD;
      diagnosed in an advanced stage, which prevents the introduction of curative treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAFLD is currently the most common cause of chronic liver disease affecting approximately 25%&#xD;
      of the world's population. MAFLD is characterized by an excessive accumulation of liver fat&#xD;
      associated with insulin resistance (IR) which is defined by the presence of steatosis in&gt; 5%&#xD;
      of hepatocytes according to histological analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the only effective strategy for treating MAFLD is weight loss. Several studies&#xD;
      show that a 3-5% weight loss manages to reduce hepatic steatosis and associated metabolic&#xD;
      parameters. Despite this, a reduction of at least 7-10% is required to improve fibrosis.&#xD;
      Guidelines from the European Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (EASL) and the&#xD;
      American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommend following an&#xD;
      energy-restricted diet adjusted to the Mediterranean diet, excluding MAFLD-promoting&#xD;
      components (processed products and high in added fructose), and perform physical activity in&#xD;
      order to achieve this goal. However, it is a difficult goal to achieve and maintain over&#xD;
      time. Epidemiological evidence recommends implementing structured lifestyle modification&#xD;
      programs with the goal of losing weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In people with MFGNA, participation in structured lifestyle programs may be compromised by&#xD;
      work and time constraints. An application-based online intervention may be more appropriate&#xD;
      for young people, people of working age, and those living far from primary care. EHealth&#xD;
      technology is a possible resource for promoting behavior change but is a little-studied field&#xD;
      in lifestyles modification of people with MAFLD. Given the lack of information regarding&#xD;
      lifestyle modification programs in people with MAFLD as the main therapeutic intervention in&#xD;
      Primary Care (PC), we consider to analyze the effectiveness of an online program based on the&#xD;
      Mediterranean diet with calorie restriction, associated with specific goals of weight loss&#xD;
      and physical activity, which allows to reduce hepatic steatosis of individuals with MAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, along with studies of early detection of chronic liver disease through liver&#xD;
      elastography &quot;LiverScreen&quot;, aims to be the beginning of the approach to chronic liver disease&#xD;
      in Primary Care. The aim of this study is to evaluate a strategy for treating MAFLD.&#xD;
