  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CELTiC panel is a potential blood-based test for detecting colorectal cancer (CRC) and&#xD;
      precursors of CRC. This can be useful for CRC screening, since this requires tests that&#xD;
      detect cancer in an early stage to maximize the chances of successful treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CELTiC combines four markers that can be detected in blood. These markers are composed of&#xD;
      so-called messenger RNA (mRNA) and can be viewed as the instructions of our genes to the cell&#xD;
      to make certain proteins. Cancer is the result of mutation in these genes. Thus, the mRNA in&#xD;
      cancer patients is, depending on the type of mRNA, often abnormal. In earlier studies, the&#xD;
      developers of CELTiC found four mRNA's that are different in patients with CRC compared to&#xD;
      healthy individuals. However, CELTiC has not yet been extensively studied in individuals for&#xD;
      whom the test is intended: a population undergoing CRC screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study aims to fill this gap. We will assess the ability of CELTiC to detect CRC&#xD;
      and precursors of CRC in a population of individuals between 50 and 75 years old in the&#xD;
      Netherlands and Italy. This population has already been preselected by having a positive&#xD;
      fecal immunochemical test (FIT), a test that is frequently used in CRC screening. This&#xD;
      population will undergo a colonoscopy, a procedure where a doctor enters the large bowel&#xD;
      through the anus using a flexible camara to assess whether the patient has cancer. Prior to&#xD;
      this colonoscopy, we will collect blood samples from the individuals to assess their CELTiC&#xD;
      score. After the colonoscopy and the blood analysis, we can assess whether the test&#xD;
      adequately detects CRC and precursors of CRC in this population.&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
           Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer in developed regions&#xD;
           around the world and its incidence is rising(1,2). Many nations or regions have&#xD;
           introduced CRC population screening programmes to detect cancerous lesions before&#xD;
           symptoms arise or to detect precursor lesions whose eradication may prevent CRC (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) is used to screen for CRC in many nations and&#xD;
           regions around the world. Its advantages include ease of use, the ability to be&#xD;
           performed at home and to be sent by mail to a laboratory, and its cost-efficiency (4).&#xD;
           Moreover, these characteristics enable population-wide screening without the need for&#xD;
           all participants to undergo a colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           However, a downside of the FIT is its performance. In the Netherlands, where a FIT&#xD;
           cut-off concentration of 47 mcg Hb/g faeces is used, the FIT produces a negative result&#xD;
           in 15% of people who have CRC (5). For the detection of CRC and Advanced Adenomas (AA),&#xD;
           referred to as Advanced Neoplasia (AN), the FIT falsely provides a negative result in up&#xD;
           to 70% of people with AN. In addition, more than half of the people with a positive FIT&#xD;
           result in the Netherlands do not have any (pre)cancerous lesions at colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           One way to improve the efficiency of CRC screening is to introduce a second test to&#xD;
           FIT-positive screening participants, to further select individuals for a colonoscopy.&#xD;
           Ideally, this test should have a high sensitivity since a false negative result would&#xD;
           lead to denying a colonoscopy to a FIT-positive individual with a (pre)cancerous lesion.&#xD;
           In addition, the specificity of this test should be high enough to substantially reduce&#xD;
           the number of FIT-positive individuals without AN undergoing colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The CELTiC panel is a blood-based test comprising of four mRNA markers (LGALS4, CEACAM6,&#xD;
           TSPAN8, and COL1A2) (6). In a sample of 128 individuals the panel reached an are under&#xD;
           the curve (AUC) of 0.82 in discriminating individuals with AN (n = 92; AA n = 25, CRC n&#xD;
           = 67) from individuals with a positive FIT result but a normal colonoscopy (n = 36). The&#xD;
           CELTiC panel could potentially function as a second test for individuals with a positive&#xD;
           FIT result and reduce the number of unnecessary colonoscopies (7). Furthermore, by&#xD;
           simultaneously lowering the cut-off concentration of the FIT and introducing the CELTiC&#xD;
           panel, screening programs may potentially detect more individuals with AN without&#xD;
           increasing the number of colonoscopies performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. QUALITY ASSURANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
           This cross-sectional diagnostic test study will examine the CELTiC panel in a population&#xD;
           of 800 FIT-positive individuals in Italy and the Netherlands. Sites in both nations will&#xD;
           adhere to the same protocol, including blood sample collection, processing, and data&#xD;
           collection. Monitoring will be put in place at both sites to ascertain adequate data&#xD;
           collection and storage. Laboratory personnel and endoscopy staff will be blinded to the&#xD;
           results of the colonoscopy and lab analysis respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Objective: to estimate the sensitivity of the CELTiC panel for detecting AN at a&#xD;
           cut-off with an expected sensitivity of 90%. Secondary Objective(s) include: (i) to&#xD;
           estimate the specificity of the CELTiC panel for detecting AN at a cut-off with an&#xD;
           expected sensitivity of 90%; (ii) to estimate the positive predictive value of the&#xD;
           CELTiC panel for detecting advanced neoplasia at a pre-specified threshold with an&#xD;
           expected sensitivity of 90%; (iii) to estimate the specificity of the CELTiC panel for&#xD;
           detecting advanced neoplasia and CRC at an observed sensitivity of 90%; (iv) to estimate&#xD;
           the positive predictive value of the CELTiC panel for detecting advanced neoplasia and&#xD;
           CRC at on observed sensitivity of 90%; (v) to estimate the Area under the receiver&#xD;
           operator characteristic curve (c-statistic); (vi) to estimate the association between&#xD;
           CELTiC score and FIT concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. SAMPLE SIZE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CRC screening programs of Italy and the Netherlands differ in multiple aspects: in Italy,&#xD;
      individuals between 50 and 69 years old are screening every two years with FIT set at a&#xD;
      threshold of 20 ug Hb/g feces. In contrast, the Netherlands screens individuals between 55&#xD;
      and 75 years old every two years with FIT set at a threshold of 47 ug Hb/g feces. Therefore,&#xD;
      if we were to analyse the results from a combination of these two populations, the results&#xD;
      may not be externally valid; the population would consist of more individuals with a&#xD;
      relatively high FIT results compared to any other FIT-population in the world. Since FIT is&#xD;
      an important risk factor for AN, this may induce selection bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we have opted to perform two analyses: one with all individuals recruited in Italy&#xD;
      (FIT &gt;= 20), and one with all individuals with a FIT of 47 ug Hb/g or higher (both in the&#xD;
      Netherlands and Italy). We will aim to estimate a cut-off of CELTiC with a sensitivity of 90%&#xD;
      for detecting AN. In addition, we are interested in an estimate with a 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval that is not wider than 5% at either side and, for practical reasons, to split the&#xD;
      recruiting between Italy in the Netherlands in a 3:2 ratio. Given the positive predictive&#xD;
      value of FIT in both screening programs at their respective cut-offs, we will need in total&#xD;
      800 participants for this trial, 347 of whom need to be diagnosed with AN.&#xD;
