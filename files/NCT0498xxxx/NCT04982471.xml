  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Connect® Lymphoma Disease Registry is a US-based, multicenter, prospective observational&#xD;
      (non-interventional) cohort study designed to collect real-world, participant-level data&#xD;
      longitudinally in participants diagnosed with various subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Disease Registry is designed to capture the patient characteristics, practice patterns,&#xD;
      and therapeutic strategies evaluated in community and academic centers when treating&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), R/R follicular lymphoma&#xD;
      (FL), and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). The data collected in this Registry&#xD;
      will facilitate the evaluation of the current treatment landscape for non-Hodgkin lymphoma&#xD;
      (NHL), including the clinical effectiveness, safety. No investigational product or drug will&#xD;
      be administered as part of this study. Enrolled patients will receive treatment and&#xD;
      evaluations for their disease according to the standard of care and routine clinical practice&#xD;
      at each study site. All treatments that patients receive for their disease will be recorded,&#xD;
      including any previous lymphoma treatments. Clinical outcomes will be documented as part of&#xD;
      an objective clinical assessment. In addition, patient-reported health-related quality of&#xD;
      life (HRQoL) outcomes data will be collected from patients using various validated&#xD;
      instruments. Social support data will also be collected.&#xD;
