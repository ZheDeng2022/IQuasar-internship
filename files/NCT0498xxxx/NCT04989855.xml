    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, one arm phase II study aimed to observe the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      tislelizumab combined with fruquintinib in treatment of patients with pMMR / MSS locally&#xD;
      advanced rectal cancer with high immune score.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      48 patients of pMMR / MSS locally advanced rectal cancer with high immune score will be&#xD;
      administered with tislelizumab (200mg IV d1, Q3W ) combined with fruquintinib (5mg QD d1-d14,&#xD;
      Q3W) with a total of 2 cycles as neoadjuvant therapy. After TME, tislelizumab and&#xD;
      fruquintinib will be given again for up to 6 months as adjuvant therapy. If the patient after&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy is evaluated as SD/PD, the neoadjuvant therapy will be converted to&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy/chemotherapy or palliative therapy, and then the patient will&#xD;
      be treated according to the norms of adjuvant therapy for rectal cancer if TME is performed.&#xD;
      If the patient choose Watch &amp; Wait when evaluated as CR, tislelizumab plus fruquintinib for&#xD;
      at least one year is requested.&#xD;
