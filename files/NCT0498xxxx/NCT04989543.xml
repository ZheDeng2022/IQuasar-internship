    <measure>Determine and compare the degree of vaginal bacterial alpha diversity in the absence (healthy population) or presence of bacterial vaginosis (pathological population).</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of vaginal bacterial alpha diversity in healthy and pathological conditions (bacterial vaginosis) will be evaluated by the Shannon index. It will be determined by the identification of the bacterial species (16s RNA analysis) present on a vaginal swab taken during the selection visit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine and compare in healthy versus pathological conditions (bacterial vaginosis) : - vaginal specific richness in enterotypes, - The diversity of vaginal bacterial species by other indices, - The overall composition of the vaginal microbiota.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Enterotypic richness will be assessed by 16 S analyses on the vaginal swab taken during the selection visit.&#xD;
The α-diversity will be calculated using other indices.&#xD;
The overall composition of the vaginal microbiota will be assessed from a taxonomic point of view on the vaginal swab taken during the selection visit by calculating the percentage (relative quantification).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>- Identify threshold values of bacterial diversity beyond which a bacterial vaginosis would be established; - Validate these thresholds by comparison with the Nugent score and the Amsel diagnosis.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>The possible thresholds of bacterial diversity above which bacterial vaginosis is observed will be validated by comparison with the Nugent score made during the screening visit and the Amsel diagnosis.</description>
