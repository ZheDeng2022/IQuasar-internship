      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acetabular reconstruction in situ after extensive pelvic resection is technically challenging&#xD;
      because the significant loss of bone stock and bony landmarks. The aim of the present study&#xD;
      was to investigate the feasibility of an individualized navigation template for acetabular&#xD;
      reconstruction following pelvic malignancy resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This retrospective cohort study included patients who underwent type II or II+III pelvic&#xD;
      tumor resection and reconstruction using a modular hemipelvic prosthesis. In the&#xD;
      template-guided group (n = 10), a navigation template was designed and applied to assist&#xD;
      acetabular reconstruction. In the traditional operation group (n = 14), the patients&#xD;
      underwent the same surgery but without the navigation template. To compare the displacement&#xD;
      of the hip rotation center before and after surgery between the two groups, an innovative&#xD;
      method based on pelvic CT was developed and a validation group of cases was used to assess&#xD;
      the effectiveness of this measurement approach. In the validation group (n = 12), patients&#xD;
      undergoing periacetabular puncture or curettage without hip joint reconstruction were&#xD;
      included. The displacements for the validation group were calculated and compared with 0 cm,&#xD;
      the theoretical value. Subsequently, the displacements between the template-guided group and&#xD;
      the traditional operation group were compared.&#xD;
