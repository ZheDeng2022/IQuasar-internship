  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present project is to study the effect of a smartphone-based serious&#xD;
      game intervention for depressive symptoms. The serious game is based on Cognitive Behavior&#xD;
      Therapy CBT, being behavioural activation and the promotion of physical activity one of the&#xD;
      most important components.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of quarantine on people's daily lives, a&#xD;
      dramatic increase in people suffering from symptoms of depression is expected; one of the&#xD;
      most common mental disorders globally, the primary cause of suicide deaths in Europe and the&#xD;
      major contributor to the overall global burden of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are effective treatments for depression, more than half of those affected&#xD;
      worldwide (and more than 90% in many countries) do not receive these treatments. The dominant&#xD;
      model of treatment delivery (individual face-to-face therapy) will not be enough to reach the&#xD;
      majority of people who need treatment. Hence, one of the most important challenges within&#xD;
      this scope is the design of new forms of treatment delivery to maximize the efficacy and&#xD;
      dissemination of psychological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) has allowed a new effective&#xD;
      ways of treatment, endorsed by several studies; and the use of serious video games as a&#xD;
      partial or complete form of treatment, whose own characteristics make them potentially&#xD;
      effective for the treatment of mental health, has opened the possibility of a still very new&#xD;
      field of study. The arrival of smartphones has increased the possibilities of designing&#xD;
      online therapies for mental health and facilitated the use of games as therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the objective of the present project is to study the effect of a smartphone-based&#xD;
      serious game intervention for depressive symptoms through a two armed pilot randomized&#xD;
      control trial. A minimum of 40 participants diagnosed with mild to moderate depression&#xD;
      symptoms will be randomly assigned to one of the two experimental conditions: a&#xD;
      smartphone-based serious game condition, and a waiting list control condition. Our hypothesis&#xD;
      is that the smartphone-based serious game intervention will produce a significant improvement&#xD;
      in depressive, anxious symptomatology and improved well-being after treatment compared to the&#xD;
      waiting list control group.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) (Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996) at pre, post intervention and at 3 and 12 months follow-ups</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI-II is one of the most widely used questionnaires to evaluate the severity of depression in pharmacological and psychotherapy trials. It consists of 21 items about the different symptoms characterizing the major depression disorder, summed to obtain the total score, which can be a maximum of 63 points. The instrument has good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha of 0.76 to 0.95) and a test-retest reliability of around 0.8.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) (Watson, Clark &amp; Tellegen, 1988; Sandín et al., 1999) at pre, post intervention and at 3 and 12 months follow-ups.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>the PANAS consists of two 10-item mood scales that assess two independent dominant dimensions of affective structure: positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA). Each scale ranges from 10 to 50. The PANAS is brief, reliable, and has shown excellent internal consistency (alpha between 0.84 and 0.90) and convergent and divergent validity. The Spanish version has also shown high internal consistency (α = 0.87 and 0.89 for PA and NA in men, respectively, and α = 0.89 and 0.91 for PA and NA in women, respectively</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Depression Severity and Impairment Scale (ODSIS) (Bentley et al., 2014) at pre, post intervention and at 3 and 12 months follow-ups.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ODSIS is a brief, 5-item self-report measure for assessing the frequency and severity of depression, as well as functional impairments in pleasurable activities, work or school interference, and social relationship interference associated with depression. The items are scored on a scale from 0 to 4, and they function similarly across clinical and nonclinical samples. The ODSIS has shown excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha between .91 and .94) and good convergent/discriminant validity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) (Norman et al., 2006) at pre, post intervention and at 3 and 12 months follow-ups.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The OASIS is a 5-item self-report measure, rated from 0 to 4, that can be used to assess the frequency and severity of anxiety disorders, multiple anxiety disorders, and subthreshold anxiety symptoms. The scale also provides measures of functional impairments in pleasurable activities, work or school interference, and social relationship interference associated with anxiety symptoms. The OASIS has demonstrated strong psychometric properties with good internal consistency (alpha = 0.80), test-retest reliability (K = 0.82), and convergent validity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>System Usability Scale (SUS) (Bangor et al., 2008; Brooke, 1996) at post intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SUS is a brief, reliable scale for measuring the usability of a program. It consists of a 10-item questionnaire with 5 response options, from 0 (&quot;strongly disagree&quot;) to 4 (&quot;strongly agree&quot;). Its purpose is to collect the user's opinion about the usability of the system, and unacceptable usability may indicate that the user has had technical difficulties with the program. The SUS adjective rating scale (from &quot;Worst imaginable&quot; to &quot;Best imaginable&quot;) will be used to provide a qualitative comparison of usability scores.</description>

    <description>Smartphone-based serious game intervention consists in the use of a serious game designed specifically to improve depressive symptoms. The psychological content consists of CBT intervention with the following psychotherapeutic components: Motivation for change, Psychoeducation, Cognitive Flexibility, Behavioural Activation, and positive psychotherapeutic strategies. To encourage physical activity, the serious game incorporates a mixed reality through physical activities such as taking a walk in real life affects aspects inside the game.</description>
