      The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of a whole-food, plant-based (WFPB) diet&#xD;
      to produce symptomatic remission in Crohn's Disease patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to evaluate the efficacy of a whole-food, plant-based (WFPB)&#xD;
      diet in the treatment of active Crohn's Disease (CD). Epidemiologic studies suggest that&#xD;
      environmental factors, including diet, likely play a role in the pathogenesis and disease&#xD;
      course of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Evidence also exists to support the idea that&#xD;
      dietary practices, such as adherence to a plant-based as opposed to a more &quot;western&quot; diet,&#xD;
      can significantly modify the microbiome composition and intestinal barrier function - both of&#xD;
      which likely impact the disease course of IBD. The overall hypothesis is that adoption of a&#xD;
      WFPB diet will reduce both symptoms and intestinal inflammation in CD patients, as well as&#xD;
      increase microbial diversity. Patients will be randomized to receive education on and adopt&#xD;
      either WFPB or FODMAP diet, which will be adhered to for a total of 12 weeks. Two primary&#xD;
      outcomes which will be assessed are rates of clinical remission based on sCDAI and also&#xD;
      reduction in intestinal inflammatory burden based on fecal calprotectin. Several secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will also be reviewed to include assessment for alterations in the gut microbiome&#xD;
      and intestinal permeability, rates of clinical response based on sCDAI, changes in systemic&#xD;
      inflammation based on CRP, and adherence rates to the diet interventions.&#xD;
