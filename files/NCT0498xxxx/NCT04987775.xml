      This phase II study will test if N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) promotes CNS recovery from chronic&#xD;
      oxidative stress and depletion of antioxidants in Gulf War Illness (GWI) participants.&#xD;
      Physical function assessments and neuroimaging will be used to determine whether NAC improves&#xD;
      the CNS redox state when compared to placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the 1990-91 Gulf War (GW), military personnel were exposed to numerous chemical and&#xD;
      environmental agents during deployment including spraying of pesticides, petroleum combustion&#xD;
      products, and nerve gas (White et al., 2016). Exposure to these chemical and environmental&#xD;
      agents can damage cell function and more specifically, mitochondrial function, which&#xD;
      negatively affects energy production and can lead to oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.&#xD;
      Animal models using similar exposures have documented this in the central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS) compartment (Shetty, GA., et al., 2017). This disruption in mitochondrial function and&#xD;
      energy production is likely tied to resulting symptoms of Gulf War Illness (GWI) including&#xD;
      fatigue, headaches, joint and muscle pain, gastrointestinal and sleep disturbances,&#xD;
      neurologic and neuropsychological symptoms, respiratory issues, and cardiovascular problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Gulf War Illness Clinical Trials and Interventions Consortium (GWICTIC) plans to evaluate&#xD;
      N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) as a promising approach to help the CNS recover from chronic&#xD;
      oxidative stress and depletion of antioxidants. The Congressionally Directed Medical Research&#xD;
      Program's (CDMRP's) two Gulf War Illness Consortiums (GWICs) and others have added to the&#xD;
      growing evidence of the role of CNS oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in symptoms of&#xD;
      GWI, yet there is little definitive work on the delivery of antioxidants to the CNS&#xD;
      environment. In this phase II clinical trial, we aim to determine if NAC has the ability to&#xD;
      target mitochondrial dysfunction and reverse oxidative stress in the CNS. Based on our early&#xD;
      experiences with antioxidants in GWI and other complex disease states along with the proven&#xD;
      record of NAC in reducing glutathione (GSH) deficits, it is possible that this antioxidant&#xD;
      will help to restore mitochondrial function and provide a more targeted approach to improve&#xD;
      outcomes in Veterans with GWI.&#xD;
