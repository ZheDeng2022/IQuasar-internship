  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this mixed-methods proposal is to answer the focused research&#xD;
      question: What tailoring is necessary and sufficient to achieve optimal engagement with and&#xD;
      efficacy of Sleep Healthy Using the Internet (SHUTi) for caregivers? The SHUTi program is a&#xD;
      fully-automated Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) program.&#xD;
      We will identify caregiving-related user- and environment characteristics that affect the use&#xD;
      and impact of SHUTi, and other Internet interventions more broadly, for caregivers. We will&#xD;
      recruit 100 high-intensity caregivers with insomnia to complete a baseline assessment of&#xD;
      insomnia and caregiving context. Caregivers will then receive access to SHUTi in an&#xD;
      open-label trial. At the end of the 9-week intervention period, caregivers will complete&#xD;
      post-assessment and be categorized according to their level of engagement with the 6 SHUTi&#xD;
      intervention lessons (or weekly &quot;Cores&quot;). We will test whether caregivers' engagement with&#xD;
      SHUTi (i.e., being a non-user vs. incomplete user vs. complete user) is associated with their&#xD;
      caregiving-related user characteristics (i.e., caregiving strain, self-efficacy, and guilt)&#xD;
      and environment characteristics (i.e., proximity to care recipient; care recipient&#xD;
      functional, cognitive, and behavioral status; caregiving tasks). Caregivers' barriers to and&#xD;
      motivations for SHUTi engagement will be described from open-ended survey responses specific&#xD;
      to participants' level of engagement as part of post-assessment. We will identify non-users'&#xD;
      barriers to SHUTi adoption, the extent to which barriers were related to caregiving, and what&#xD;
      modifications may have increased their motivation to try SHUTi. We will also identify users'&#xD;
      (incomplete and complete) SHUTi usage barriers and motivations, the extent to which these&#xD;
      were related to caregiving, and how tailoring may improve usage by increasing salience to&#xD;
      caregivers. Thematic coding will also examine how caregivers' recommendations generalize to&#xD;
      other evidence-based digital health interventions. Among caregivers using SHUTi, we will test&#xD;
      whether the effects of SHUTi on cognitive mechanisms of change targeted by SHUTi (i.e., more&#xD;
      adaptive sleep beliefs, internalized sleep locus of control) are associated with differences&#xD;
      in caregiving-related user or environment characteristics.&#xD;
