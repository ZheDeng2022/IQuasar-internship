  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic peripheral neuropathy(DPN) is one of the major complications of diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      which accelerates the occurrence of ulceration of diabetic foot and amputation of lower&#xD;
      extremities as well as severely affects the quality of life. The treatment of this condition&#xD;
      has remained unsatisfactory with a good response to conventional medications. It is now&#xD;
      evident that vitamin D deficiency is common in diabetic patients and especially in these&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The present research is therefore&#xD;
      designed to observe the effect of exogenous administration of vitamin D in diabetic&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy patients of Bangladesh.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic peripheral neuropathy(DPN) is one of the common complications of long-standing&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus with a prevalence of 30 to 50%. Progressive pain, numbness, sensory and&#xD;
      motor deficit accelerates the occurrence of ulcers of the diabetic foot and amputation of&#xD;
      lower extremities which severely affects the quality of life. The incidence and prevalence&#xD;
      rate is rising worldwide including in Bangladesh. The treatment of this condition has&#xD;
      remained unsatisfactory with a good response to conventional medications. It is now evident&#xD;
      that vitamin D deficiency is common in diabetic patients and especially in these patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Recent studies have proved that there is an&#xD;
      apparent vitamin D deficiency in diabetic peripheral neuropathy patients. However, some&#xD;
      recent trials attempted to assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation to improve&#xD;
      patient's pain symptoms and neurologic function. Most of them showed positive findings. Aim:&#xD;
      This proposed study is therefore an effort whether there is any role of vitamin D in&#xD;
      improving symptoms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy patients. Method: This study will be a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. It will be conducted in the department of&#xD;
      pharmacology, BSMMU in collaboration with the department of endocrinology, BSMMU in between&#xD;
      November 2020 to February 2022. A total of 66 patients suffering from diabetic peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy will be selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The diagnosis of&#xD;
      diabetic peripheral neuropathy will be performed by a consultant of the endocrinology&#xD;
      department. A validated version of the visual analogue scale (VAS) and Michigan Neuropathy&#xD;
      Screening Instrument(MNSI) will be used to assess patients at baseline after 8 weeks. The&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled and randomly allocated in two arms: control and intervention. The&#xD;
      patient in the control arm will receive a placebo for 8 weeks starting after the day of the&#xD;
      initial assessment. On the other hand intervention arm will receive vitamin D (40,000 IU)&#xD;
      weekly orally. Blood samples will be collected to measure serum vitamin D level at baseline&#xD;
      and again after 8 weeks of therapeutic intervention. Regularity of medicine intake will be&#xD;
      ensured over the telephone, pill count, and from the patient's compliance sheet. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis: Statistical analysis will be done by SPSS version 24. Unpaired 't' test will be&#xD;
      done to compare between two means of interventional group and placebo group. Paired 't' test&#xD;
      will be done to compare between two means before and after the intervention. Proportion test&#xD;
      'Z' will be done to compare the proportion between the intervention group and placebo group.&#xD;
      The calculated 'p' value may suggest the level of significance (significant at p &lt; 0.05).&#xD;
      Ethical consideration: After approval from IRB every eligible patient will be informed about&#xD;
      the intervention and the study from IRB every eligible patient will be informed about the&#xD;
      intervention and the study objectives. The patient will also be informed that they can&#xD;
      participate in this study of their free will and also they are free to refuse to participate&#xD;
      or to withdraw at any time without compromising their medical care. Patients who will take&#xD;
      part in the study willingly with written consent will be interviewed. The patient's&#xD;
      confidentiality will be strictly maintained. The patient's personal data regarding the name,&#xD;
      age, sex, and other information will not be disclosed anywhere and will only be used for&#xD;
      research purposes.&#xD;
