  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to learn how long it takes for people with MM to have a relapse&#xD;
      after their first treatment. Not all participants will have a relapse during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit their clinic every 3 months and be treated according to their&#xD;
      clinic's standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sponsor will not be involved in how participants are treated but will provide&#xD;
      instructions on how the clinics will record what happens during the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, prospective study of participants with MM relapses. This study&#xD;
      will assess the low detection rate of biochemical relapses which will improve routine&#xD;
      clinical practices and management of participants with MM in real world practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 350 participants. The data will be collected both&#xD;
      prospectively and/or retrospectively at the specialized care (hematology) and will be&#xD;
      recorded into electronic case report forms (e-CRFs) of the electronic data capture (EDC)&#xD;
      system. Participants will be assigned to the following observational cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants With Complete Response (CR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants With Very Good Partial Response (VGPR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants With Partial Response (PR)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center study will be conducted in Russian Federation. The overall duration of the&#xD;
      study will be approximately 4 years. The overall time for treatment and follow-up period will&#xD;
      be approximately 2.5 years for each participant.&#xD;
