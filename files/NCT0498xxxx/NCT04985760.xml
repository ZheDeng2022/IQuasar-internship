  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trimer 4571 is a vaccine designed to stimulate the development of broadly neutralizing&#xD;
      antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV. Trimer 4571 is investigational, meaning it is not approved by&#xD;
      the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). There is limited human experience with the Trimer&#xD;
      4571 vaccine administered with aluminum hydroxide (alum) and the vaccine has not been tested&#xD;
      in people with HIV prior to this study although it has been tested in healthy volunteers. The&#xD;
      goal of this study is to see if Trimer 4571 is safe and well tolerated and to see if it will&#xD;
      help the immune system produce bnAbs against HIV.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The immune system is composed of special cells, proteins, tissues, and organs that protect&#xD;
      against germs and microorganisms and is the body's defense against infections. Antibodies are&#xD;
      a type of protein that helps the body fight infection and are usually made by a person's own&#xD;
      immune system. A type of antibody that can recognize and block many types of HIV from&#xD;
      entering healthy cells are called broadly neutralizing antibodies, or 'bnAbs', and may also&#xD;
      activate other immune cells to help destroy HIV-infected cells. Research has shown that&#xD;
      people with HIV who develop bnAbs against the virus are better able to control the infection.&#xD;
      While the immune systems of some people with HIV show signs of early bnAb production, only a&#xD;
      small percentage of people with HIV naturally develop bnAbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 32 participants will be sequentially enrolled and randomized 3:1 by chance like&#xD;
      rolling dice to receive either the Trimer 4571 vaccine or a placebo vaccine that does not&#xD;
      contain Trimer 4571.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to attend 11 study visits over a period of approximately 50 weeks&#xD;
      and receive 3 doses of their assigned study vaccine: one at Entry, one at Week 8 and one at&#xD;
      Week 20. Researchers will compare the results from participants who get the Trimer 4571&#xD;
      vaccine with results from participants who get the placebo vaccine. Participants, the&#xD;
      researchers and the clinic staff will not know which vaccine participants are getting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Week 20, participants will be followed for 24 additional weeks with study visits and&#xD;
      tests to monitor their health and safety and to see how the study vaccine affects the immune&#xD;
      system and the virus.&#xD;
