    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to investigate whether 100 mg/5 mL cefixime trihydrate dry syrup&#xD;
      manufactured by PT. Bernofarm, Indonesia was bioequivalent to its reference product, 100 mg/5&#xD;
      mL Suprax® dry syrup manufactured by Odan Laboratories Ltd., Canada registered trademark of&#xD;
      Astellas Pharma Inc., Japan.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Twenty two healty subjects were given a single dose of 100 mg/5 mL cefixime trihydrate dry&#xD;
      syrup or or 100 mg/5 mL Suprax® dry syrup with 240 mL of water. Then the blood samples for&#xD;
      cefixime trihydrate was drawn and analyzed using HPLC. All subjects sample plasma were&#xD;
      analyzed for pharmacokinetic evaluation.&#xD;
