  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to discover whether patients with CMT type 1 and 2 have&#xD;
      neuromuscular junction transmission deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to collect information of different clinical and electrophysiological&#xD;
      test procedures to perform possible future clinical trials in CMT patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective observational pilot study involving two investigational sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Department of Neurology, Arhus University Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Department of Neurology, Ohio State University&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 20 patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease and 10 healthy age-matched&#xD;
      controls will be included with each site including 10 CMT patients and 5 Healthy Controls.&#xD;
      CMT patients will undergo electrophysiological (repetitive nerve stimulation and single fiber&#xD;
      EMG analyses) and functional (different tests of muscle strength, fatigability, dexterity,&#xD;
      and balance) testing on 4 separate occasions. Healthy controls will undergo&#xD;
      electrophysiological testing at baseline only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess whether patients with CMT have deficits in NMJ transmission, results from&#xD;
      repetitive nerve stimulation and single fiber EMG analyses in CMT patients will be compared&#xD;
      to those obtained in healthy controls at baseline. To inform future clinical trials, results&#xD;
      relability and tolerability estimates obtained from sequential electrophysiological and&#xD;
      functional tests will be calculated&#xD;
