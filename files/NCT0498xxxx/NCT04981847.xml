  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to use a two-stepped study to examine both the adoption of the&#xD;
      three dietary patterns as presented by the United States Dietary Guidelines (USDG) and&#xD;
      testing of a refined, culturally tailored one-year intervention examining the three diet&#xD;
      patterns. For this study, African American adult participants with overweight/obesity and&#xD;
      ≥three type 2 diabetes (T2DM) risk factors will be recruited to participate in this two-step&#xD;
      study. This present study is for our Step 1: formative pilot work to culturally-tailor a&#xD;
      dietary intervention of the three healthy eating patterns presented by the USDG for 12 weeks:&#xD;
      1) U.S.-Style, 2) Mediterranean, or 3) Vegetarian.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The U.S. Dietary Guidelines (USDG) form the basis of federal nutrition programs and policy&#xD;
      and provide valuable guidance to health initiatives and industries. The updated 2015 USDG&#xD;
      moved away from a focus on individual nutrients to a greater focus on dietary patterns. The&#xD;
      USDG state that healthy eating goals can be met through a variety of dietary patterns, but&#xD;
      present healthy diet in three main ways: 1) Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern, 2) Healthy&#xD;
      Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern, and 3) Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern. Currently, US&#xD;
      adults are falling short of the nutrition recommendations (fruit/vegetable intake,&#xD;
      greens/beans, whole grains, etc.) set forth by the USDG and measured by the Healthy Eating&#xD;
      Index (HEI). While the USDG are the basis of nutrition guidelines, the research informing&#xD;
      these dietary pattern recommendations has largely been drawn from observational studies among&#xD;
      mostly white populations. In addition, there has been very limited cultural tailoring of&#xD;
      these dietary patterns that would ensure that these diets are acceptable to diverse&#xD;
      populations, in particular, African Americans (AAs) living in the south, who experience a&#xD;
      disproportionate burden of chronic disease, especially type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Currently, US&#xD;
      adults are not meeting nutrition recommendations (fruit/vegetable, whole grains, etc.) set&#xD;
      forth by the USDG and measured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the present study, AA adult participants with overweight/obesity and ≥three T2DM risk&#xD;
      factors will be recruited to participate in the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Conduct a 3-month randomized trial among AAs comparing adoption of the 3 dietary&#xD;
      patterns [1) US, 2) Med, or 3) Veg] using existing materials from the USDG and examine&#xD;
      differences in diet quality (HEI) and T2DM risk factors (weight, HgbA1c).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Drawing on participants' experiences in Aim 1, conduct qualitative work to refine and&#xD;
      culturally tailor the dietary pattern intervention for an AA audience.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in this group will be assigned to follow the Healthy US dietary pattern as presented by the US Dietary Guidelines. As described here https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/usda-food-patterns: This eating pattern is based on the types and amounts of foods Americans typically consume. The main types of food in this eating pattern include a variety of vegetables; fruits; whole grains; fat-free or low-fat dairy; seafood, poultry, meat, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and soy products.</description>

    <description>Participants in this group will be assigned to follow the Mediterranean dietary pattern as presented by the US Dietary Guidelines. As described here https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/usda-food-patterns: This eating pattern contains more fruits and seafood and less dairy than the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern. There is also less calcium and vitamin D because it includes fewer dairy foods.</description>

    <description>Participants in this group will be assigned to follow the Vegetarian dietary pattern as presented by the US Dietary Guidelines. As described here https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/usda-food-patterns: This eating pattern contains no meat, poultry, or seafood. Compared with the Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern, it contains more soy products, eggs, beans and peas, nuts and seeds, and whole grains.</description>
