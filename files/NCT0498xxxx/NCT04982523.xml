  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Late adolescence and early adulthood are the most exposed to trauma. College students exposed&#xD;
      to trauma may experience depression, anxiety, stress, and difficulties adapting to college&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression symptoms are the most common reactions that people experience after traumatic&#xD;
      experiences. Depression also harms college students reactions that people experience after&#xD;
      traumatic experiences. It is difficult for people who are depressed to meet their social&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trauma also has adverse physical effects, including dysfunction of the hypothalamus and&#xD;
      adrenal axis, lowering blood cortisol levels. As a result, the body's immune system is&#xD;
      disturbed, leaving people more exposed to diseases and experiencing more pain and fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, women are more vulnerable to PTSD than men. Women with post-traumatic stress&#xD;
      and depression are also more likely to be exposed to several diseases. Moreover, when&#xD;
      traumatized female college students experience life stress, it worsens their mental health&#xD;
      and interferes with their studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive behavioral therapy is the most effective content composition method for trauma&#xD;
      intervention. CBT should be improved by helping to reduce PTSS and depression and managing&#xD;
      various aspects of life, such as nutrition, activity, and rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One major advantage of online programs is that they do not face any time or space&#xD;
      constraints, and they are also less expensive than face-to-face programs. More importantly,&#xD;
      online programs can reduce psychological barriers to participation. This is especially&#xD;
      important for women who are more likely to feel shame and stigma about interpersonal traumas,&#xD;
      such as those arising from relationships and sexual trauma, which are obstacles to their&#xD;
      access to face-to-face programs. College students can easily access online programs because&#xD;
      of their familiarity with the Internet, so the programs can be immediately available in&#xD;
      response to crises without requiring them to expose personal information to unfamiliar&#xD;
      therapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the interventions program was based on the Roy Adaptation Model to address&#xD;
      post-traumatic physical and mental health problems among female college students in Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The post-traumatic stress scores, depressive symptom scores of participants who access&#xD;
           the program will decrease more than those who do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The functional health scores, college adaptation scores of participants who access the&#xD;
           program will increase more than those who do not.&#xD;

      1. Study Design This study used a randomized control group pretest-posttest design to&#xD;
           verify the effectiveness of the proposed program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants &amp; Recruitment Initial participants were recruited from eight universities&#xD;
           in Korea through advertisements on SNS and bulletin boards at the university. Applicants&#xD;
           indicated their interest in the study by contacting the research director via SNS,&#xD;
           email, or SMS. The research director sent a reply message with the research information&#xD;
           and an initial screening survey link. The applicants were initially screened for&#xD;
           post-traumatic stress and depression. For inclusion, the participants had to be female&#xD;
           college students between 19 and 29 years with a traumatic experience and post-traumatic&#xD;
           stress symptom scores of 22-66, which is a cutoff that can be diagnosed as&#xD;
           post-traumatic stress disorder; anything above 66 is a severe post-traumatic stress&#xD;
           disorder condition that cannot be suitably addressed in this study (Eun, 2005; Lee et&#xD;
           al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following participants were excluded: those who experienced childhood sexual abuse;&#xD;
           those who had experienced violent conflict or war, including North Korean defectors; and&#xD;
           those who had a post-traumatic stress score greater than 66 points. According to a prior&#xD;
           study, those who experienced childhood sexual abuse, war, or civil war are at a higher&#xD;
           risk of suicide attempts. Therefore, they were excluded because their profiles did not&#xD;
           match the purpose of this study (Hirai &amp; Clum, 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The number of subjects for this study was calculated by G Ã— power using a calculating&#xD;
           power of 0.8 for the replicate measurement variance analysis, a medium effect size of&#xD;
           0.25, and a significance level of .05 (Cohen, 1988), resulting in a total of 28 people.&#xD;
           Fifty-eight people will be recruited, taking into account the dropout rate of 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Procedure The experimental group's pre- and post-outcome measures were collected at&#xD;
           pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 1-month follow-up. Data were collected from the&#xD;
           control group three times for three months. After the three surveys, the control group&#xD;
           was provided the same program as the experimental group if the participants chose to&#xD;
           join. All questionnaires were conducted using Google Survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Interventions The proposed program consisted of eight sessions conducted twice per week,&#xD;
           consisting of 5 minutes of introductory material, 12-15 minutes of main content, and 5&#xD;
           minutes of concluding content. The introduction included a brief exercise since&#xD;
           exercises can relieve post-traumatic stress symptoms by changing the body's cortisol&#xD;
           concentrations (Kim et al., 2013). The main content intended to improve the control&#xD;
           processes and each of the four adaptive modes of the Roy Adaptation Model. No session&#xD;
           lasted longer than 25 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants are given homework and feedback through SNSs. The program's sessions were&#xD;
           accessible through blog entries posted on https://www.tistory.com. Every post in the&#xD;
           blog required a password. Links and passwords for each session were provided to the&#xD;
           participants through SNS. The program was accessible from any electronic device with&#xD;
           Internet access, including computers and smartphones, and was strictly accessible&#xD;
           through links provided by the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The program was partially revised considering the topics' practicality after a&#xD;
           feasibility study and consultation with experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
