      The intervention involves the identification of 140 patients (70 per group), fed throughout&#xD;
      the duration of the study with the two different solutions indicated. The subject will be&#xD;
      interviewed by identified and trained personnel in order to collect the information and data&#xD;
      required by the study with frequency indicated for the individual evaluation sheets. The&#xD;
      subject himself will be provided with all the contact and availability information of the&#xD;
      referents of the firm for the purpose of requesting information or reporting events. The&#xD;
      subject in the studio will be contacted weekly in order to evaluate the trend by the study&#xD;
      referents, according to his availability, and personally interviewed by staff belonging to&#xD;
      the research group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-motor symptomatology in Parkinson's disease (PD) is related to the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients . Malnutrition in the subject with Parkinson's is a still relevant variable that&#xD;
      hesitates in sarcopenia and increased motor deficits in relation to loss of muscle mass and&#xD;
      energy deficit. Guidelines from the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism&#xD;
      (ESPEN) recommend monitoring and implementing interventions in the presence of weight loss or&#xD;
      body mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disphagia is a syndrome common in Parkinson's patients, even in the early stages of the&#xD;
      pathology. The study by Pflug and collaborators showed that only 5% of the patients observed&#xD;
      were completely free from swallowing deficiency, while in 55% of subjects (66/119) aspiration&#xD;
      or penetration of food and liquids in the airways were reported regardless of the stage of&#xD;
      illness. Several studies, cited by Curtis and collaborators, show that the prevalence of&#xD;
      disphagia varies between 11 and 97% of patients during the course of the disease. This&#xD;
      condition affects both food safety, with the risk of aspiration and ab-ingestis, and&#xD;
      malnutrition conditions, hydration deficiency, also affecting the overall survival of&#xD;
      patients in relation to the onset of pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a nursing point of view, great interest has the integrated nutritional indices, easy and&#xD;
      quick-to-use tools, which manage to determine promptly the presence and risk of malnutrition&#xD;
      and which can be used daily in the patient's evaluation. The most suitable is the Mini&#xD;
      Nutritional Assessment (MNA), which determines the risk of malnutrition before modification&#xD;
      of biochemical parameters. MNA has a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 97%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adoption of scales that evaluate non-motorcycle-related symptoms helps to identify the&#xD;
      sindromic dimension of the pathology, highlighting its components that impact the overall&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who follow a level 3 and 4 modified texture diet of the IDDSI Framework scheme&#xD;
      frequently encounter an overall reduction in energy and protein intake, determined by the way&#xD;
      the meal is prepared in self-production, associated with an often drastic reduction in fluid&#xD;
      intake with consequences in both systemic and specific terms for the gastrointestinal tract.&#xD;
      Monitoring liquids introduced by subjects with swallowing deficiency is a Grade B&#xD;
      recommendation in the ESPEN guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disphagia is a frequent condition in the subject with Parkinson's disease, particularly in&#xD;
      the advanced stages, recent studies begin to show a decay in the safety of swallowing and&#xD;
      maintenance in the airway in these subjects, even in relatively early stages of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the application of a specific nutritional program for patients with swallowing&#xD;
      problems is recommended in the prevention of malnutrition in patients with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease. Previous studies showed the rapid reversibility of malnutrition in hospitalized&#xD;
      elderly subjects with cognitive and functional impairment if enrolled in a specific&#xD;
      nutritional program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the strong impact that eating difficulties have on the state of health of&#xD;
      parkinson's disease patients suffering from disphagia, the widespread spread of dietary&#xD;
      frailties related to the various degrees of disphagia and the importance that patients with&#xD;
      slight difficulty swallowing or chewing do not develop further pathologies related to a&#xD;
      nutritional deficit , it is necessary to study the effectiveness of specific nutritional&#xD;
      programs developed to meet the person's need for nutrition The aim of the study is to improve&#xD;
      the nursing-care management of Parkinson's disease patients with disphagia&#xD;
