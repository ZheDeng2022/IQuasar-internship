    <textblock>
      This study was a parallel, randomized controlled trial with a longitudinal research design.&#xD;
      Participants were randomly assigned to either the Baduanjin exercise group or the control&#xD;
      group. The Baduanjin exercise group received a 12-week Baduanjin exercise programme. The&#xD;
      control group received usual care. Fatigue, sleep quality, psychological distress, quality of&#xD;
      life were assessed by a structured questionnaire at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks&#xD;
      after enrollment.&#xD;

      This study was a parallel, randomized controlled trial with a longitudinal research design.&#xD;
      Participants were randomly assigned to either the Baduanjin exercise group or the control&#xD;
      group. Patients in the intervention group underwent a 12-week Baduanjin exercise programme&#xD;
      consisting of 12 weeks of Baduanjin exercise, a 35-min Baduanjin exercise demonstration&#xD;
      video, a picture-based educational brochure, and a performance record form. The control group&#xD;
      received usual care. Fatigue, sleep quality, psychological distress, quality of life were&#xD;
      assessed by a structured questionnaire at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks after&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in the modified Piper Fatigue Scale scores</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 week, 8 week, 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline modified Piper Fatigue scale at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks.The shortened modified Piper Fatigue scale is composed of 15 items that measure two domains of fatigue: severity and temporality. Each item is scored from 0 to 3, with a total possible score of 0-45. Higher scores indicate greater fatigue.</description>
