  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a 3 months prospective, open label, and parallel study to test the efficacy of 3&#xD;
      different corticosteroids in the management of interstitial lung diseases. Followed by a&#xD;
      pharmacoeconomic analysis to find which regimen (betamethasone, dexamethasone or&#xD;
      prednisolone) is the most cost-effective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three different corticosteroid regimens were evaluated for the management of interstitial&#xD;
      lung diseases (ILDs) with specific focus on hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) where the&#xD;
      patients were divided into 3 treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group I: patients receiving weekly pulse doses of betamethasone IM injection (equivalent&#xD;
           dose to that of prednisolone daily dose in a week).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group II: patients receiving weekly pulse doses of dexamethasone IV injection&#xD;
           (equivalent dose to that of prednisolone daily dose in a week).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group III: patients receiving oral prednisolone daily (dose range 15-20 mg/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
           10 mg oral prednisolone oral ≡ 1.5 mg dexamethasone intravenous ≡ 1.2 mg betamethasone&#xD;
           intramuscular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the administration of the above-mentioned medications, the patients were followed-up&#xD;
      over 3 months to evaluate their disease progression. Informed consent was obtained from all&#xD;
      subjects or their surrogate after explanation and understanding of the nature, purpose, and&#xD;
      potential risks of the study. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee,&#xD;
      Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University (protocol serial number: CL (2183)) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A special patient information sheet was designed to collect all information required for data&#xD;
      analysis. The sheet was designed to be divided into several sections:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic Data The first section of the patients' information sheet was designed to&#xD;
           accommodate the basic general and demographic data (name, address, age, telephone&#xD;
           number, social status, weight, and height of the patient). These details were documented&#xD;
           from the patient's medical notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medical Data Medical records were used to obtain other data including date and time of&#xD;
           examination, the diagnosis, medications on recruitment (if any), smoking habits,&#xD;
           patient's medical history, in addition to the patient's medication history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Parameters Used to Measure Effectiveness as KL-6, PFTs, ESR, CRP&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Parameters to Evaluate Treatment Safety Liver Function Tests, Random Blood Glucose&#xD;
           (RBG), Blood Pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost Effectiveness Analysis The study is designed from patient perspective where the direct&#xD;
      medical costs as well as the indirect costs (e.g., loss of patients' income) are studied. The&#xD;
      costs are collected directly from the patient prospectively throughout the study period. All&#xD;
      costs were actual covering the treatment expenses as: the cost of the medications, the cost&#xD;
      of administration, the cost of the hospital stay due to ILD during the study period, the cost&#xD;
      of the physician's visit and the cost afforded by the patient in order to administer the&#xD;
      recommended medication, any extra costs due to exacerbations or adverse effects due to the&#xD;
      use of corticosteroids and costs of transportation and days-off.&#xD;
