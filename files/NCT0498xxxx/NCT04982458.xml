  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a diagnostic study. Patients were included from patients with clinically suspected or&#xD;
      confirmed heart failure, and 68Ga-FAPI and 13N-NH3 gated myocardial imaging were performed to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of 68Ga-FAPI PET imaging in visualizing the degree of myocardial&#xD;
      fibrosis in patients with heart failure. The subjects completed 68Ga-FAPI and 13N-NH3 gated&#xD;
      myocardial imaging in a one-stop process, and collected general information, clinical data,&#xD;
      echocardiography, blood routine, liver and kidney function indicators, 68Ga-FAPI and 13N-NH3&#xD;
      PET imaging results and other imaging data of the patients and volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibroblast activated protein (FAP) is a type II membrane-bound glycoprotein that is highly&#xD;
      specifically expressed in activated fibroblast reactions. The 68Ga labeled fibroblast&#xD;
      activated protein inhibitor (68 ga-fapi) has shown advantages of high uptake and high image&#xD;
      contrast in imaging the activated fibroblast response, including its successful use in&#xD;
      visualizing the degree of liver fibrosis. The molecular imaging probe targeting FAP combined&#xD;
      with the mature myocardial perfusion imaging agent 13N-NH3 can help us to achieve the&#xD;
      following objectives: On the one hand, to investigate the myocardial fibrosis in patients&#xD;
      with heart failure and to visualize the formation of fiBER-activated protein in the process&#xD;
      of heart failure; At the same time, the performance of 68GA-FAPI in differential diagnosis of&#xD;
      heart failure and grading of heart failure degree was discussed, so as to make up for the&#xD;
      insufficiency of clinical routine imaging technology in the diagnosis of myocardial fibrosis&#xD;
      in heart failure.&#xD;
