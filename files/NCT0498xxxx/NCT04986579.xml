    <textblock>
      This research is being done to compare rates of hair loss of people with metastatic breast&#xD;
      who use scalp cooling versus those who do not use scalp cooling after receiving standard of&#xD;
      care treatment with either sacituzumab govitecan, trastuzumab deruxtecan, or eribulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The name of the study intervention involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paxman Scalp Cooling System&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, controlled, pivotal clinical investigation to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of the Paxman Scalp Cooling System (PSCS) at preventing hair loss in people&#xD;
      undergoing treatment for metastatic breast cancer with either Sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU-132&#xD;
      or Trodelvy™), trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a or Enhertu®), or Eribulin (Halaven®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Paxman Scalp Cooling System as a&#xD;
      treatment option for preventing hair loss while patients are undergoing chemotherapy. This&#xD;
      system has however not been specifically studied to look at its ability to prevent hair loss&#xD;
      in patients specifically receiving sacituzumab govitecan, trastuzumab deruxtecan, or&#xD;
      eribulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility, photographs, hair loss&#xD;
      assessments, questionnaires and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatment with scalp cooling with standard of care&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment and will be followed for 2-4 weeks after completion of treatment with&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 120 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paxman Coolers Limited is a medical device company and is supporting this research study by&#xD;
      providing access to the investigational device, Paxman Scalp Cooling System.&#xD;
