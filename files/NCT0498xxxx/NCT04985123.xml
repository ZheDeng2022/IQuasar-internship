  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will identify a patient population who wishes to address a variety of concerns&#xD;
      about the size, shape, or appearance of their penis with the placement of a subcutaneous&#xD;
      Silicone Block Penile Implant. Because the Silicone Block is placed subcutaneously, the&#xD;
      device can provide immediate and permanent improvements to the appearance of a man's penis.&#xD;
      The most notable improvements are enhanced penile cosmesis, improved penile girth, and&#xD;
      improved exposure of the penile shaft outside the plane of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan is to conduct a study to examine the outcomes of this procedure with respect to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidences of adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in flaccid penile length (through physical measurements pre and post-operatively&#xD;
           in a consistent manner)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in flaccid penile girth (through physical measurements pre and post-operatively&#xD;
           in a consistent manner)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in satisfaction scores with respect to penile size and patient&#xD;
           self-confidence/self-esteem (through validated questionnaires)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Inclusion criteria include men who are over 18 and under 65, circumcised, who have the&#xD;
             perception of inadequate penile girth or appearance of length of penis, or penile&#xD;
             deviation from straight plane in flaccid condition for whatever reason. Etiologies may&#xD;
             include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A retractile penis or &quot;buried penis&quot; from infrapubic pannus&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A loss of length following radical prostatectomy or other trauma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Congenital or acquired (e.g., Peyronie's Disease) mild curvature of the penis with&#xD;
             indentation deformity and with curvature less than 30 degrees with no plan to have&#xD;
             other corrective procedures (e.g. surgery, intralesional injection of collagenase&#xD;
             clostridium histolyticum)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient perception of a penis of inadequate size and patient desire for cosmetic&#xD;
             enhancement&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior penile girth enhancement procedure of any sort, including grafts or subcutaneous&#xD;
             injections, previous Xiaflex injection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of immunosuppression and/or HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men who are on anti-coagulation medication which cannot be stopped&#xD;
