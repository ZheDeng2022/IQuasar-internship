  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate safety and effectiveness of the Lacrosse NSE ALPHA&#xD;
      coronary dilatation catheter during PCI in subjects with stenotic coronary arteries.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigation is a prospective, multi-center, single arm clinical study. The study will&#xD;
      be conducted in up to 15 investigational sites in the U.S. This study will enroll and treat&#xD;
      200 subjects, including a minimum of 30 subjects with in-stent restenosis (ISR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population for this study is subjects with stenotic coronary artery disease who are&#xD;
      suitable candidates for PTCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening for initial inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible subjects will be asked&#xD;
      to participate in the study by signing a consent form. Following consent, subjects will&#xD;
      undergo a baseline visit where additional eligibility criteria will be assessed. An angiogram&#xD;
      will be completed to assess for angiographic eligibility. If a non-target lesion is&#xD;
      identified, it must be treated successfully prior to target lesion treatment. Once treatment&#xD;
      of the target lesion(s) has been attempted, the subject will be considered enrolled in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed through hospital discharge.&#xD;
