      1. Study design This is an interventional, randomized, controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Description of the study The very premature newborn will be identified by daily&#xD;
           evaluation of the infants admitted for consultation in the income book.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Informed consent will be requested from the infant´s father, mother or legal guardian&#xD;
           between the fifth and tenth day of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fortification will be done according to the randomization group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Outline of the study design&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Excel calculation sheet of individualized supplementation according to the&#xD;
                composition of breast milk in the target fortification group. Methodology of&#xD;
                analysis of breast milk in FOSS analyzer.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In the adjusted fortification group, urea concentration levels will be kept between&#xD;
                19-30 mg / dL&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fenton curves or https://www.growthcalculator.org/ will be used for Z-scores&#xD;
                calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Growth speed calculation: Weight gain: (1000x ln [Final weight / Initial weight]) /&#xD;
                number of days.&#xD;
&#xD;
                4 Duration of the study for each participant The duration of participation in the&#xD;
                study and the fortification intervention period will be a maximum of 132 days.&#xD;
