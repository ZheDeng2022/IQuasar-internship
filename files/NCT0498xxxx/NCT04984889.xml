  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for Japanese participants with congenital protein C deficiency. The main aim of&#xD;
      this study is to check how much TAK-662 stays in their blood over time. This will help the&#xD;
      study sponsor (Takeda) to work out the best dose to give patients in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive 1 single infusion of TAK-662.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will stay at the clinic until 3 days after the infusion. Then, participants will return&#xD;
      to their clinic 7days after the infusion to check side effect from the study treatment.&#xD;

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g. a clinically significant abnormal laboratory value), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug whether or not it is considered related to the drug.</description>
