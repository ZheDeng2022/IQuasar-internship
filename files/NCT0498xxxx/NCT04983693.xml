  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to develop and test the feasibility and preliminary effects of&#xD;
      a program to enhance the capacity of predominantly African American churches to support&#xD;
      congregants and their family caregivers who are living with dementia. In particular, this&#xD;
      project will examine how dementia-friendly faith village worship services support the&#xD;
      well-being of caregivers and care recipients in two African American churches.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Historically, churches have been the backbone of support for African American families. As a&#xD;
      source of informal support, affiliations with churches serve as an extension to the family,&#xD;
      providing social support to older African Americans not always available from close family&#xD;
      and friends. African Americans often turn to their church and worship services for support&#xD;
      when in distress. In recent years, the question that often arises is: &quot;Are African American&#xD;
      faith communities living out components of their church doctrine in relation to their love&#xD;
      and commitment to one another?&quot; Surprisingly, many African American churches do not have&#xD;
      programs to support their congregation's aging-in-community or the families and congregants&#xD;
      living with dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      African Americans are more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to be diagnosed with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia, and 20% of persons living with dementia will&#xD;
      be African American by 2050. Similarly, the number of their family caregivers will rapidly&#xD;
      grow over the next 20 years. Currently, approximately 15 million family caregivers in the&#xD;
      United States serve as significant care resources for persons living with dementia. Persons&#xD;
      living with dementia experience progressive distress and confusion, which produces emotional&#xD;
      strain, burden, social isolation, and depression for caregivers. This underscores the need to&#xD;
      strengthen support services and identify resources and meaningful activities that promote&#xD;
      physical and mental well-being for African American family caregivers and community-dwelling&#xD;
      persons living with dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dementia restricts the person and the caregiver from participating in religious communities&#xD;
      and familiar religious practices; both become increasingly uncomfortable in church settings&#xD;
      due to fear of embarrassment, uncertainty about the person's behavior, and even stigma. The&#xD;
      caregiving experience often leads to social isolation as caregivers devote all of their time&#xD;
      to their family members, thus diminishing their ability to attend church and experience an&#xD;
      atmosphere that can support them. Churches can also provide opportunities for individuals&#xD;
      living with dementia to continue living in meaningful ways. Along with the setting,&#xD;
      socializing with others can be a great strength for these individuals and their family&#xD;
      members. Faith-based institutions play a significant role in the lives of individuals living&#xD;
      with dementia, primarily through being present for them and the family members to support&#xD;
      their quality of life. Research has shown separate benefits for caregivers attending church&#xD;
      and the role religion plays in elders living with dementia. However, there is little work&#xD;
      exploring how participation in religious practices together (caregiver and person living with&#xD;
      dementia) might promote quality of life for these families. A dementia-friendly faith village&#xD;
      worship service could provide a culturally organic way for such families to retain connection&#xD;
      with a powerful social network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place in the south Atlanta Metropolitan area. Two predominantly African&#xD;
      American churches from Fulton and Fayette counties have been identified and are eager and&#xD;
      enthusiastic to participate in this project. Interested caregivers will be screened for&#xD;
      family eligibility via phone. If eligible, times will be scheduled to consent in person prior&#xD;
      to data collection. Those consenting will agree to take part in baseline data collection,&#xD;
      attend six dementia-friendly worship services in person or online, provide post-intervention&#xD;
      data, and take part in more in-depth qualitative interviews. Caregivers will complete surveys&#xD;
      and take part in interviews, while only observational data will be collected for persons&#xD;
      living with dementia (PLWD).&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Zarit Burden Inventory Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-intervention (up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Zarit Burden Interview is a 22-item scale of objective and subjective caregiver burden. Responses are given on a 5-point scale where 0 = never and 4 = nearly always. Total scores range from 0 to 88 where higher scores indicate greater feelings of being burdened with providing care.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Expressive Support Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-intervention (up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Socioemotional support is assessed with the Expressive Support Scale. This instrument includes 8 items measuring the amount of help and support that caregivers receive from relatives and friends. Responses are given on a 4-point scale where 1 = strongly disagree and 4 = strongly agree. Total scores range from 8 to 32 and higher scores indicate greater support.</description>

    <measure>Change in Positive Appraisal of Care Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-intervention (up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Consequential gain is assessed with the Positive Appraisal of Care Scale. This instrument includes 6 items asking about personal, positive aspects of being a caregiver. Responses are given on a 4-point scale where 0 = not at all applicable and 3 = very much applicable. Total scores range from 0 to 18, where higher scores indicate greater positive consequential gain from caregiving.</description>

    <measure>Change in Dyadic Relationship Scale Caregiver Version Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-intervention (up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The caregiver version of the Dyadic Relationship Scale includes 11 items which are responded to on a 4-point scale where 1 = strongly disagree and 4 = strongly agree. There are two subscales which assess dyadic strain (5 items) and positive dyadic interaction (6 items). Total scores for the dyadic strain subscale range from 5 to 20 and higher scores indicate greater levels of strain. Total scores for the positive dyadic interaction subscale range from 6 to 24 and higher scores indicate greater positive interactions.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-intervention (up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The RMBPC is a 24-item scale reporting on frequency of disturbing care recipient behaviors and severity or caregiver reactions to these behaviors. Respondents indicate how frequently problems have occurred on a 5-point scale where 0 = never occurred and 4 = daily or more often. Total frequency scores range from 0 to 96 with higher scores indicating greater frequency of memory and behavior problems exhibited by the PLWD.</description>

Respondents indicate the degree to which problems have bothered or upset them on a 5-point scale where 0 = not at all and 4 = extremely. Total reaction scores range from 0 to 96 with higher scores indicating more bothered or upset by memory and behavior problems exhibited by the PLWD.</description>

    <measure>Observation During Worship Service</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Caregivers and PLWD will be observed during worship services. Observations will focus on the (a) participation and response of the person living with dementia and caregiver to the worship service, (b) interactions within the dyads, and (c) interactions of person living with dementia and caregiver with church leaders and members of congregation. Observations are assessed qualitatively and a summary score is not determined.</description>
