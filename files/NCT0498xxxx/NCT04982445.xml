  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GLACIER (Giving Long Acting CABENUVA in an Infusion centER) is an interventional study&#xD;
      examining the administration of CABENUVA (Cabotegravir long acting [LA] plus Rilpivirine LA)&#xD;
      intramuscular (IM) in infusion centers in South-eastern United States. In this study, the&#xD;
      intervention is the process of using an infusion center as the location to receive the&#xD;
      CABENUVA IM injections. The acceptability and feasibility of the IC to deliver CABENUVA IM&#xD;
      injections will be assessed from the perspectives of the participants, HIV care providers and&#xD;
      IC staff. In this study, Month 1 is the Baseline visit.&#xD;
