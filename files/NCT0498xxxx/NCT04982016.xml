  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through preoperative fluid therapy, to investigate whether it can alleviate the&#xD;
      microcirculation dysfunction after induction of anesthesia, and reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      perioperative fluid therapy-related complications, thereby accelerating rehabilitation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing minimally invasive coronary artery bypass graft surgery were randomly&#xD;
      divided into crystal group, colloid group and control group. The preoperative fluid&#xD;
      reactivity was evaluated according to the passive leg lifting test (PLR). When stroke volume&#xD;
      increased (△SV)&gt;16%, the patients in the crystal (carbonate Ringer solution) and the colloid&#xD;
      group (hydroxyethyl starch solution) were treated with volume therapy, while the control&#xD;
      group was not treated with PLR test and volume therapy. Vascular occlusion test was used to&#xD;
      observe the effect of anesthesia induction on tissue oxygen saturation recovery slope&#xD;
      (RecStO2) after volume therapy, Goal-directed fluid therapy was used during operation, and&#xD;
      the postoperative microcirculation function and the incidence of related complications were&#xD;
      observed.&#xD;
