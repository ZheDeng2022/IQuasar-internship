  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to examine changes in childhood obesity associated with&#xD;
      the implementation of a Trauma Informed Care approach with weight counseling and management&#xD;
      among low-income minority children in a primary care setting.&#xD;

      Prospective mixed methods pilot study, using both qualitative and quantitative measures. This&#xD;
      study will be conducted in two phases. In Phase 1 (Year 1), the investigators plan to use a&#xD;
      modified Delphi procedure called the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method in which the&#xD;
      investigators will form a multidisciplinary panel to develop a consensus of incorporating the&#xD;
      TIC practices based on FOCUS into current best practices for childhood obesity prevention and&#xD;
      treatment among low-income minorities to be facilitated by primary care providers. In Phase 2&#xD;
      (Year 2), the investigators will train and implement the Primary Care Provider-mediated FOCUS&#xD;
      TIC-COM among providers for obese children and their caregivers / parents in the MLK OPC&#xD;
      Family Medicine Clinic. During this phase, the investigators plan to examine the feasibility&#xD;
      and acceptability of delivering the FOCUS TIC-COM in the primary care setting at MLKOPC&#xD;
      through surveys and focus groups with both providers and the parents / caregivers of&#xD;
      overweight / obese children. The investigators will also explore whether the FOCUS TIC-COM&#xD;
      impact on childhood obesity (as perceived by child's parent / caregiver) and increase&#xD;
      linkages to behavioral health care regarding trauma / toxic stress. At 3 month intervals, the&#xD;
      investigators will train a subset of providers in the intervention and they will implement&#xD;
      the intervention immediately after training.&#xD;

The health care providers at the family medicine clinic within MLK-OPC will be trained to implement FOCUS TIC-COM with children who are overweight or obese. The investigators plan to survey and perform focus groups with health care providers and the parents / caregivers of children who were identified as overweight or obese by their doctor.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Four rounds of rating over the course of 6 month to 1 year (Year 1 of study)</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators plan to use a modified Delphi procedure called the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method to reach consensus regarding the content and implementation of a Primary Care Provider-mediated FOCUS TIC-COM approach to address childhood obesity in low-income minority communities. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method consists of four rounds of rating clinical indicators or practice guidelines derived from current literature on TIC that will be incorporated into the current standard of childhood obesity prevention and management. A benefit-to-cost ratio will be rated on a 9 point Likert scale, where 1 means that the expected harms greatly outweigh the expected benefits in relation to cost, and 9 means that the expected benefits greatly outweigh the expected harms in relation to cost. Necessity rating scale will be on a Likert scale of 1 to 9, where 1 means that the practice guideline is not necessary at all, and 9 means that the practice guideline is extremely necessary.</description>

    <measure>FOCUS TIC-COM Training Evaluation - Provider's Perceived confidence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and immediately after training (Year 2 of study)</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators plan to conduct a pre/post training evaluation measuring perceived confidence in FOCUS TIC-COM approach for overweight/obese children. The investigators will use a 5 point likert scale to measure confidence level in FOCUS TIC-COM approach, where 1 means &quot;not confident at all&quot; and 5 means &quot;very confident&quot;. The 5 point likert scale for confidence has the following values: 1 means &quot;not confident at all&quot;; 2 means &quot;not very confident&quot;; 3 means &quot;somewhat confident&quot;; 4 means &quot;fairly confident&quot;; and 5 means &quot;very confident&quot;.</description>

    <description>The investigators plan to collect health care provider satisfaction in delivering the FOCUS TIC-COM. The investigators will measure satisfaction of various elements of the intervention using a 5 point Satisfaction Likert scale, where 1 means &quot;very unsatisfied&quot; and 5 means &quot;very satisfied&quot;.</description>

    <description>The investigators plan to collect parent / caregiver satisfaction in receiving the FOCUS TIC-COM intervention.

    <time_frame>Last 6 months of Year 2 of study</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will conduct focus groups with both health care providers and parents/caregivers of overweight/obese children exposed to FOCUS TIC-COM to assess intervention feasibility and acceptability. The investigators will ask questions in the focus group discussion on whether the Primary Care Provider-mediated FOCUS TIC-COM is relevant, appropriate and sustainable for the primary care setting and if the intervention should be disseminated. In addition, the investigators will examine the demand, practicality, adaptation, integration, expansion and efficacy of the intervention through the focus group discussion. The focus group questions will be derived from the RE-AIM framework: Reach into the target population; Effectiveness / Efficacy; Adaptation by target settings, institutions, and staff; Implementation - consistency and cost of delivery; Maintenance of intervention effects.</description>

    <description>FOCUS TIC-COM is a program that helps doctors coach families to recognize how emotions or feelings about various life stressors may affect a child's dietary choices and physical activity. FOCUS TIC-COM is for families of children who have been identified by their doctor as overweight or obese. The goal of the program is to help children and their families understand how their mental health may impact their physical health and develop strategies to address their mental health needs.</description>
