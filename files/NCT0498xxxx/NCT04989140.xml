      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ixazomib, oral&#xD;
      dexamethasone and in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma who have received lenalidomide.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM), the second most common hematological malignancy, is a clonal plasma&#xD;
      cell disorder characterized by the secretion of monoclonal immunoglobulins. The annual&#xD;
      incidence of newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) patients is about 2-3/100,000. In the past 20 years,&#xD;
      the median overall survival (OS) of MM patients has prolonged from 3 to 5 years to 8 to 10&#xD;
      years since many novel agents developed on the pipeline of treatment. For patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, the combination of new drugs can prolong the patient's&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). At present, guidelines recommend&#xD;
      the use of 3-4 drugs combined with chemotherapy containing proteasome inhibitors,&#xD;
      immunomodulators or daratumomab for the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory&#xD;
      multiple myeloma treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bortezomib combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRd) is the first-line induction&#xD;
      program recommended by guidelines; It has been widely used in the first-line treatment of MM&#xD;
      patients. Therefore, when the disease relapses, the VRd regimen is not effective again.&#xD;
      Research data shows that the second-generation oral proteasome inhibitor drug ixazomib&#xD;
      combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (IxaRd) is used to treat the disease. In the&#xD;
      treatment of RRMM patients, the progression-free survival period was significantly better&#xD;
      than that of the lenalidomide and dexamethasone groups, and at the same time, it did not&#xD;
      significantly increase the adverse reactions. The second-generation PI drug, Ixazomib, was&#xD;
      approved in China in May 2018 and is widely used in RRMM patients. In addition, because most&#xD;
      patients with multiple myeloma use lenalidomide in the first-line treatment and maintenance&#xD;
      treatment, a large proportion of RRMM patients are resistant to lenalidomide. Pomalidomide,&#xD;
      the third-generation oral immunomodulator drug, can overcome lenalidomide resistance and has&#xD;
      better safety in patients with renal insufficiency MM. The results of clinical trials&#xD;
      confirmed that pomalidomide combined with a proteasome inhibitor and dexamethasone is better&#xD;
      than a dual-drug regimen of pomalidomide and dexamethasone in RRMM patients. A convenient and&#xD;
      safe full oral regimen, that is, ixazomib combined with pomalidomide and dexamethasone&#xD;
      (IxaPd) is expected to improve the efficacy and survival of RRMM patients. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a three-drug oral regimen of ixazomib,&#xD;
      pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed MM who have received lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the screening visit, informed consent will be obtained from all subjects who are deemed&#xD;
      potentially eligible for enrollment in the study, according to the protocol-specified&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.Eligible patients are receive treatment IxaPD. Ixazomib 4&#xD;
      mg, capsules, orally, once on Days 1, 8 and 15 of every 28-day cycle , pomalidomide 25mg qd&#xD;
      day 1~21 of every 28-day cycle, Dexamethasone 40 mg (20 mg for patients &gt;75 years of age) was&#xD;
      given on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of every 28-day cycle. Treatment was continued until disease&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable toxicity.Progression free survival, overall survival, time to next&#xD;
      treatment, overall response rate and safety issues will be recorded. Drug doses will be&#xD;
      adjusted or withdrawn based on the degree of toxicities.&#xD;
