  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  This randomized controlled study will be carried out on 60 adult patients undergoing&#xD;
           primary total hip replacement in Tanta University Hospitals. All Patients will receive&#xD;
           spinal anesthesia with either sham or real US-guided PENG block.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary outcome will be the time to first request for rescue analgesia. The&#xD;
           secondary outcome will be the postoperative Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score and the&#xD;
           total morphine consumption (rescue analgesia) in the first 24 h postoperatively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  This prospective randomized double-blinded study will be carried out on 60 adult&#xD;
           patients admitted to Tanta University Hospitals for 6 months started immediately after&#xD;
           approval of the Institutional Ethical Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A written informed consent will be obtained from each patient. All data of patients will&#xD;
           be confidential with secret codes and private files for each patient, all given data&#xD;
           will be used for scientific purposes only after an explanation of the purpose of the&#xD;
           study to all patients. - Any unexpected risks encountered during the course of the&#xD;
           research will be cleared to the patients as well as to the ethical committee on time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary endpoint is a prolongation of the postoperative analgesia and reduction of&#xD;
           the postoperative analgesic consumption. The study will be terminated if local&#xD;
           anesthetic toxicity occurs and this will be announced to the participants and to the&#xD;
           ethical committee at the time and adequate measures will be taken to resolve and avoid&#xD;
           these risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group allocation will be done by using computer-generated software of randomization&#xD;
           introduced into sealed opaque envelope technique. A blinded nurse, who does not&#xD;
           participate in the study or data collection, will read the number contained in the&#xD;
           envelope and make group assignments. All the nerve blocks will be performed by one&#xD;
           anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Control Group: (30 patients) will receive sham PENG (just 1mL saline)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PENG Group: (30 patients) will receive real PENG (20mL of bupivacaine 0.25% plus&#xD;
                0.2mg/ml dexamethasone)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      •Preoperative assessment will be done by: History taking. Clinical examination. Laboratory&#xD;
      investigations including complete blood count, bleeding and clotting times, APTT, liver and&#xD;
      kidney function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the pre-anesthetic assessment, all patients will be familiarized with the Numeric&#xD;
      Rating Scale (NRS) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the holding area, After the establishment of intravascular access by introducing an&#xD;
           18-gauge intravenous (IV) cannula, all the patients will be preloaded with Ringer's&#xD;
           lactate solution (7 mL/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On arrival at operation room, Routine monitoring of heart rate by ECG, noninvasive blood&#xD;
           pressure (NIBP), pulse oximetry will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Lumbar puncture will be performed at the level of L3-L4/L4-L5 intervertebral space&#xD;
                with a 25-gauge spinal needle. After ensuring free flow of cerebrospinal fluid, 2&#xD;
                mL of hyperbaric bupivacaine solution (0.5%) (10mg)) with 0.5 mL (25 µg) fentanyl&#xD;
                will be injected. The sensory block will be assessed by loss of sensation to&#xD;
                pinprick test. The level of the sensory block should achieve at least a level of&#xD;
                T10. Moreover, the motor block will be assessed by modified Bromage score till&#xD;
                reaching at least a score of 2. (0; means the ability of the patient to move the&#xD;
                hip, knee, and ankle, 1; means the inability of the patient to move the hip, but&#xD;
                can move the knee and ankle, 2; means the inability of the patient to move the hip&#xD;
                and knee, but can move the ankle, and finally 3; means the inability of the patient&#xD;
                to move the hip, knee, and ankle). If the sensory and motor block levels will not&#xD;
                be achieved within 20 minutes, the patient will be excluded from the study and&#xD;
                receive general anesthesia. If the sensory and motor block will be achieved, the&#xD;
                patient will receive an ultrasound-guided PENG block before starting the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ThePENG block will be performed with the patient in the supine position in the&#xD;
                operative area with adequate groin exposure. The probe will first be placed at the&#xD;
                anterior superior iliac spine in the transverse plane, and then will be moved&#xD;
                caudally to identify the anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS). The probe will be&#xD;
                then rotated to align the AIIS and iliopubic eminence (IPE). This will reveal the&#xD;
                iliopsoas tendon and muscle together with femoral vessels superficially. A 22-G&#xD;
                100-mm echogenic needle will be inserted in-plane from lateral to medial, and the&#xD;
                tip will be kept at the midpoint of AIIS and IPE deep to psoas tendon. After&#xD;
                lifting of the psoas tendon by hydrolocation, the patients in the PENG group will&#xD;
                receive 20 ml of (0.25%) bupivacaine with 0.2 mg/ml dexamethasone that will be&#xD;
                injected in 5 ml aliquots after negative aspiration.The control group will receive&#xD;
                1 mL of normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After completion of the surgical procedure, a patient will be transferred to&#xD;
                Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU). Paracetamol 15 mg/kg IV will be administered&#xD;
                every 6 hours after discharge to the ward.&#xD;
