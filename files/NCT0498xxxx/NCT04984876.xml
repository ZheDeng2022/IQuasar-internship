      This is a 52-week, Phase 3 multi-center, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study to assess the safety and clinical efficacy of two dosing regimens of ligelizumab (240&#xD;
      mg and 120 mg) subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks (SCq4w) in participants with a medically&#xD;
      confirmed diagnosis of IgE-mediated peanut allergy. Participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      ligelizumab 240 mg, ligelizumab 120 mg, or placebo (5 treatment arms, randomization ratio of&#xD;
      2:2:2:2:1) for the double-blind placebo-controlled treatment period (up to Week 12).&#xD;
      Participants initially assigned to the 8-week placebo arms will receive the first dose of&#xD;
      blinded ligelizumab treatment at the Week 8 visit. Participants initially assigned to the&#xD;
      16-week placebo arm will receive the last dose of placebo before the double blind placebo&#xD;
      controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) at week 12 and the first dose of blinded ligelizumab&#xD;
      treatment at the Week 16 visit.&#xD;
