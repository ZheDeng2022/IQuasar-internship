  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Organ dysfunctions are associated with high morbidity and mortality. The SOFA (Sequential&#xD;
      Organ Failure Assessment) score developed by Vincent et al. sequentially assesses the&#xD;
      presence and severity of dysfunctions in six organ systems: respiratory, cardiovascular,&#xD;
      coagulation, hepatic, neurological and renal. Although the SOFA score was created to quantify&#xD;
      organ dysfunctions, the obvious relationship between organ dysfunctions and mortality has&#xD;
      been widely documented. Dynamic measurements of the SOFA score assess response to treatment&#xD;
      and can be used to search for perpetuating sources of severity and reassess the treatment&#xD;
      plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study will be to assess the impact of an admission SOFA score&#xD;
      equal to or greater than 2 and subsequent interventions on outcomes related to the 48-hour&#xD;
      delta SOFA on ICU and hospital mortality, length of stay in the ICU, duration of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, time of vasoactive drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into three groups: those who did not trigger the SOFA trigger on&#xD;
      admission to the ICU (Group 1), those who triggered the SOFA trigger and improved on the&#xD;
      third day (Group 2) and, finally, those who triggered the SOFA trigger and worsened on the&#xD;
      third day (Group 3).&#xD;

        The SOFA score of all patients admitted to the ICU and with inclusion criteria was&#xD;
        calculated and whenever the score was equal to or &gt; 2, the attending physician was&#xD;
        notified, the dysfunction(s) that resulted in the score was informed and the physician was&#xD;
        asked to inform through the therapeutic plan the interventions it would adopt to improve&#xD;
        the result after 48 hours&#xD;
