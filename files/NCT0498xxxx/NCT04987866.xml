  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite numerous strategies for preventing or alleviating pain associated with propofol and&#xD;
      rocuronium injections, it remains common and distressing for patients. Vibration is an&#xD;
      effective method of reducing pain during facial cosmetic injections and some venipuncture&#xD;
      procedures. But it has not been previously studied in the context of propofol or rocuronium&#xD;
      injection pain. This randomized study aims to evaluate the effect of vibration anesthesia on&#xD;
      the incidence and severity of propofol and rocuronium injection pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to their rapid onset and short duration of action, ease of titration, recovery, and&#xD;
      favorable profile for side effects, propofol and rocuronium are agents frequently used&#xD;
      together in anesthesia practice and for rapid-sequence intubation. However, both cause severe&#xD;
      discomfort due to pain in the injection arm. Some patients recall the induction of anesthesia&#xD;
      as the most painful part of the perioperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vibration anesthesia has repeatedly been shown to alleviate pain sensation effectively and&#xD;
      safely. Vibration anesthesia device is designed to reduce the pain from minor procedures,&#xD;
      such as injection of medications, suture or staple removal, phlebotomy and even venipuncture&#xD;
      pain in pediatric patients. The advantages of this device include its low cost, lack of&#xD;
      adverse effects, and ease of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown to reduce pain with a mechanism based on the gate control theory, which&#xD;
      states that vibrations stimulate the dorsal horn neurons, the sites at which pain signals are&#xD;
      modulated and thus block full transmission of the pain.The investigators therefore proposed&#xD;
      this randomized controlled study to compare the effectiveness of a vibration device for&#xD;
      propofol and rocuronium injection pain during general anesthesia induction.&#xD;

    <measure>preventing or reducing propofol injection pain</measure>
    <time_frame>patients were observed during and after the injection of propofol for 20 seconds by an observer</time_frame>
    <description>Observer rated the pain responses according to a four-point scale. After the injection of propofol to, we also asked the patients whether they had any discomfort.The severity of propofol- injection was evaluated using the following four-point pain response scale developed by McCrirrick and Hunter: level 0: (no pain) no verbal/ facial/ motor reaction to the injection; level 1: (mild pain) a minor verbal/ facial/ motor reaction to the injection but no physical activity or wrist joint movements; and level 2: (moderate pain), pain when asked by the anesthesiologist, or complaint of pain during the injection accompanied by physical activity- facial grimacing or withdrawal of the arm (elbow-shoulder); and level 3: (sever pain), a response accompanied by a facial expression of pain, or a strong vocal response, tears, arm withdrawal, and full body reaction ( including other body movements)</description>

    <measure>preventing or reducing rocuronium injection pain</measure>
    <time_frame>patients were observed during and after the injection of rocuronium for 20 seconds by an observer</time_frame>
    <description>The movement response to rocuronium injection pain was evaluated by the same observer on a four-point scale (FPS). The scale was 0: no movement, 1: movement only the wrist, 2: movement of only the arm (elbow-shoulder) and, 3: general response, movement more than one extremity. 2 minutes after induction, intubation was completed.</description>

    <description>The participants who were chose an opaque envelope containing yellow paper represented the vibration group (Group V). After 1 min of pre-treatment with the vibration device on the intravenous catheter trace, we manually injected 2-2,5 mg/kg, 1% propofol (Propofol 1%, Fresenius 20 ml flacon, Germany) over 15 s. Observer rated the pain responses according to a four-point scale which developed by McCrirrick and Hunterand. Also asked the patients whether they had any discomfort. After the propofol injection, pain scores were observed during propofol injection and 20 seconds after the injection, and hemodynamic records were taken. 0,6 mg/kg rocuronium (Esmeron® 50 mg.5ml-1 N.V. Organon, Oss, Holland) were injected over 10 seconds. The movement response to rocuronium injection pain was evaluated by the same observer on a four-point scale (FPS) during and after 20 seconds rocuronium injection.</description>
