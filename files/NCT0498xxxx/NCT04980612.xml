  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a development study with clinical outcomes. The investigators aim to develop and test&#xD;
      an 8-week MBPR (Mindfulness-Based Pain Reduction) program, which draws on intervention work&#xD;
      and clinical experience in the investigative team to optimize a mindfulness-based&#xD;
      intervention for individuals with chronic pain. The overall goal of this study is to ensure&#xD;
      that the MBPR program has been carefully refined and manualized in an in-person setting&#xD;
      before performing clinical trials comparing MBPR to MBSR (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction)&#xD;
      to test whether it improves pain outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes a Pain Attention Task that separates insula activation during&#xD;
      experimental heat application between different pain attention conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MBPR will be an optimized mindfulness program specifically designed for treating chronic low&#xD;
      back pain (cLBP) that the investigators aim to develop and test in this project. 4 groups of&#xD;
      10 participants will receive MBPR consecutively to refine the MBPR curriculum. The format is&#xD;
      the same as MBSR: 8 weeks of weekly 2½-hour group sessions and a daylong retreat. All&#xD;
      sessions include training to enhance mindful interoceptive awareness through focused&#xD;
      attention in the region of pain, the lower back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A final group of 20 participants will be randomized to receive MBPR or MBSR. Total N=50 (40&#xD;
      MBPR; 10 MBSR). MBSR is a standardized and manualized 8-week program, delivered once a week&#xD;
      in 2½-hour group sessions and a daylong retreat. It trains individuals in several mindfulness&#xD;
      practices, e.g. focus on breath, varying degrees and directions of object orientation, open&#xD;
      monitoring of awareness of intero- and exteroceptive stimuli and thoughts, de-reification&#xD;
      (i.e. the notion that thoughts and perceptions are not always true to reality), and&#xD;
      meta-awareness (i.e., awareness of thinking) in addition to focused attention. The program&#xD;
      typically includes audio-recording and a workbook for home practice and has shown benefits in&#xD;
      patients with cLBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project also includes an ancillary brain imaging study designed to build on neuroscience&#xD;
      reports of markedly decreased brain function and structure in the insular cortex (IC) of&#xD;
      patients with cLBP. This project has the potential to reveal a potential central mechanism by&#xD;
      which mind-body and acceptance-based approaches improve chronic pain conditions, e.g. cLBP.&#xD;
      It may reveal a new paradigm for the treatment of cLBP with key importance and consequences&#xD;
      for future behavioral intervention studies for pain.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Chronic low back pain (cLBP) defined according to the NIH Research Task Force&#xD;
             recommendation on Research Standards for cLBP: pain at least half the days in the past&#xD;
             6 months, by using 2 questions and a human figure drawing illustrating the region as&#xD;
             the space between the lower posterior margin of the rib cage and the horizontal&#xD;
             gluteal fold.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Average pain in the last month at least 3 out of 10 on Numeric Rating Scale [range 0 -&#xD;
             10, for 0 signifying no pain and 10 signifying worst pain imaginable]. This level of&#xD;
             pain allows comparability of the study results with the majority of cLBP studies. Pain&#xD;
             rated less than 3 is too mild to detect improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Men and women aged 18 years old and older. The investigators are not enrolling younger&#xD;
             children as they are not part of the Intensive Pain Rehabilitation Therapy program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Eligibility will be assessed using the following questions: &quot;(1) How long has back&#xD;
             pain been an ongoing problem for you? and (2) How often has low-back pain been an&#xD;
             ongoing problem for you over the past 6 months?&quot; A response of greater than three&#xD;
             months to question 1, and a response of &quot;at least half the days in the past 6 months&quot;&#xD;
             to question 2 would meet the cLBP eligibility criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ability to speak English. We do not have the capacity, given the resources available&#xD;
             in this proposal, to translate all course material and conduct groups into another&#xD;
             language. The investiagtors have previously enrolled Hispanic participants into other&#xD;
             studies who were fluent in English, and expect to do this in the proposed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Owning a smart phone&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Unable to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A substance abuse, mental health, or medical condition that, in the opinion of&#xD;
             investigators, will make it difficult for the potential participant to participate or&#xD;
             that may need immediate changes in medical management that will affect study outcome&#xD;
             measures. Such conditions may include cancer, liver failure, renal failure, pain&#xD;
             conditions from inflammatory diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing&#xD;
             spondylitis, lupus), malignancies or abdominal aortic aneurysm, muscle weakness from&#xD;
             radiculopathy. Radiculopathy or sciatic pain is NOT excluded as long as the condition&#xD;
             is stable and does not lead to significant movement restrictions or &lt;4/5 muscle&#xD;
             weakness. Persons with significant substance abuse or mental health conditions that&#xD;
             interfere with social functioning may be disruptive. Other medical or mental health&#xD;
             conditions that need immediate changes in management need to be addressed before&#xD;
             starting the study so that more reliable baseline measurements can be made. Patients&#xD;
             who may need assessment for potentially necessary surgical interventions may not be&#xD;
             able to complete the study. Regular opioid prescription is not an exclusion if stable&#xD;
             over the past 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Spine related current or history of spine infection, spine tumor, vertebral fracture,&#xD;
             cauda equina syndrome. Condition would increase heterogeneity of the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Blindness, severe vision problems, deafness, severe hearing problems, bipolar or manic&#xD;
             depression and not taking medication, major depression, psychoses (major), a substance&#xD;
             abuse condition, dementia, unable to get up and down from the floor. Condition might&#xD;
             make it difficult to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Some other serious medical conditions that may alter key study outcomes, including&#xD;
             untreated hypothyroidism, renal failure, and cirrhosis. Conditions that may alter key&#xD;
             study outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Involvement in a lawsuit related to their back. Complicated medico-legal issues that&#xD;
             could lead to individuals having a financial incentive to not report improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Involved in Worker's Compensation claim.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Pregnant, breast-feeding, or planning to get pregnant in the next 12 months or less&#xD;
             than 3 months post-partum. Particular back problems than may be associated with&#xD;
             pregnancy and delivery may confound study outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Lack of stable housing or plan to move out of the area within the next 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. MRI-related exclusion criteria: Cardiac pacemaker, metal fragments in eyes/skin/body&#xD;
             (shrapnel), subjects who have ever been a metal worker/welder; history of eye&#xD;
             surgery/eyes washed out because of metal, aortic aneurysm clips, prosthesis, by-pass&#xD;
             surgery/coronary artery clips, hearing aid, heart valve replacement, subjects with an&#xD;
             I.U.D, a shunt (ventricular or spinal), electrodes, metal plates/ pins/screws/wires,&#xD;
             or neuro/bio-stimulators (TENS unit), vision problems uncorrectable with lenses,&#xD;
             claustrophobia; inability to lie still on one's back for approximately 60 minutes;&#xD;
             prior neurosurgery; older tattoos with metal dyes; unwillingness to remove nose, ear&#xD;
             or face jewelry, braces or permanent dental retainers. Iron-containing metal parts in&#xD;
             the body can potentially be dislocated by strong magnetic fields and preclude&#xD;
             assessment with MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Received a steroid or botox injection in or near the spine in the last 3 months. This&#xD;
             may alter key study outcomes.&#xD;
