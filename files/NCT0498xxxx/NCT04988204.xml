  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a rapidly growing epidemic worldwide and is an&#xD;
      increasingly important etiology of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD&#xD;
      affects approximately 90 million people in the United States (US) amounting to an annual cost&#xD;
      of $100 billion yearly. It is projected to become the leading cause of liver transplantation&#xD;
      in the US by 2030 and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. NAFLD is a&#xD;
      spectrum of liver diseases, ranging from simple steatosis (nonalcoholic fatty liver, NAFL) to&#xD;
      hepatic steatosis associated with inflammation (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH), which&#xD;
      can be associated with liver scarring (hepatic fibrosis) and cirrhosis. There are limited&#xD;
      therapeutic options that have been shown to effectively reduce or reverse the progression of&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifestyle modification is the backbone of therapy, but difficult to achieve. A modest amount&#xD;
      of weight loss of approximately 3% can reduce liver steatosis and a 10% weight loss can&#xD;
      reduce the NASH and improve liver fibrosis. The American Association of the Study of Liver&#xD;
      Diseases (AASLD) guidelines state that &quot;a combination of a hypocaloric diet (daily reduction&#xD;
      by 500-1000 kcal) and moderate intensity exercise is the best likelihood of sustaining weight&#xD;
      loss over time.&quot; There are several barriers to adopting a healthy lifestyle involving both&#xD;
      patient and physician limitations. The aim of this study is to engage patients in a lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention program that has already been shown to be successful in achieving weight loss&#xD;
      goals and adopting healthier lifestyle patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CDC Diabetes Prevention Program, (DPP) was a large (n=3,234) multicenter study aimed to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of lifestyle intervention or treatment with metformin on the incidence of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Lifestyle intervention reduced the incidence of T2DM by 58% (95% CI,&#xD;
      48-66%) and metformin reduced the incidence by 31% (95% CI, 17-43%) as compared to placebo.&#xD;
      To prevent one case of diabetes over three years, 6.9 persons would have to participate in&#xD;
      the lifestyle-intervention program, and 13.9 would have to receive metformin. The CDC DPP&#xD;
      program has been adapted and tested in the multiple different community and state-wide&#xD;
      programs including the YMCA, WorkWellNYC and NYS DPP. In these real-world models, the life&#xD;
      style intervention program has been delivered in a group-based format by DPP lifestyle&#xD;
      coaches. These programs have been successful like that of the randomized trial and&#xD;
      improvements were sustainable at 6 and 12 month follow up after completion of the program.&#xD;
      The program is now available and reimbursable through Medicare (Medicare Diabetes Prevention&#xD;
      Program).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study, the researchers will enroll 20 patients with NAFLD in an adapted DPP&#xD;
      program and follow study participants for 1 year. The rationale for the proposed research is&#xD;
      to apply the DPP to NAFLD because of the close relationship with Diabetes and determine the&#xD;
      real-world outcome of the DPP program on weight loss in patients with NAFLD. If the&#xD;
      researchers illustrate that weight loss can be achieved and is sustainable in patients with&#xD;
      NAFLD enrolled in lifestyle intervention programs, the researchers can develop innovative&#xD;
      approaches to deliver such a program nationwide in a cost-effective and sustainable manner.&#xD;
