  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the opening up of the two-child policy , the composition of pregnant women in China has&#xD;
      changed significantly . The proportion of high-risk pregnant women in the elderly has&#xD;
      increased significantly , and the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes has also increased .&#xD;
      Among them , gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) is the most common complication during&#xD;
      pregnancy . The incidence of GDM in China is as high as 18 % due to the economic growth ,&#xD;
      lifestyle changes and dietary habits . GDM not only threatens perinatal maternal and child&#xD;
      health , but also increases the risk of offspring insulin resistance , obesity and metabolic&#xD;
      diseases in adulthood . But it is still lack of experience on intervening and managing them&#xD;
      effectively. Therefore , on the basis of previous studies , this study intends to explore the&#xD;
      effects of intensive diet and exercise intervention by obstetricians and nutritionists on&#xD;
      pregnancy weight gain , pregnancy outcome , glucose and lipid metabolism and postpartum&#xD;
      weight retention under the mobile medical platform through a large sample cluster&#xD;
      intervention test in the real world. In order to supervise and improve the compliance of the&#xD;
      intervention subjects and realize the ultimate change of their behaviors, this study intends&#xD;
      to use the APP software, the mobile medical technology, to monitor and evaluate diet ,&#xD;
      exercise and weight. Through the above research , it aims to improve the current management&#xD;
      schemes of diet and weight during pregnancy , not only helps to optimize and improve the&#xD;
      quality of perinatal health care , but also prevents the adult chronic diseases from the&#xD;
      fetal period. This research has important theoretical and practical value .&#xD;

      This is a cluster intervention study. A randomized controlled trial in pregnant women will be&#xD;
      initiated at 8-12 weeks of gestation util delivery. Pregnant women who received routine&#xD;
      antenatal examination in Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital will be divided into two&#xD;
      groups . One group contained 1000 cases as the control group , and the other group contained&#xD;
      1000 cases as a whole . The intervention contents included health education , nutritional&#xD;
      analysis and individualized dietary guidance combined with mobile medical treatment and&#xD;
      face-to-face teaching during the early , middle and late pregnancy stages. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be the incidence of GDM and the secondary outcome will be the incidence of&#xD;
      hypertensive disorders of pregnancy , cesarean section , premature delivery , macrosomia,&#xD;
      large for gestational age and so on.&#xD;
