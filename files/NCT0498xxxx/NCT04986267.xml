  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate how hormonal contraceptives affect ACL rupture&#xD;
      incidence within menstrual cycle phases. It is thought hormones such as estrogen and&#xD;
      progesterone (which fluctuate throughout the normal menstrual cycle) play a role in the&#xD;
      laxity of ligaments within the body. It is hypothesised that around the time of ovulation the&#xD;
      ACL undergoes increased laxity, leaving it more likely to be injured. This study will look at&#xD;
      the phase of the menstrual cycle in which the ACL injuries occur and whether there are&#xD;
      differences due to the use and type of hormonal contraception participants may be using (such&#xD;
      as Combined oral contraceptive, Mirena, Implanon), which can modify the levels of circulating&#xD;
      estrogen and progesterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves participants completing an anonymous electronic survey after presenting&#xD;
      to a sports or orthopaedic clinic with an ACL rupture. The survey collects information about&#xD;
      participant's current ACL injury and any previous knee injuries; typical menstrual cycle&#xD;
      patterns and the use of hormonal contraception; and history of sports participation.&#xD;
      Responses will be analysed to look for similarities and differences in ACL injury occurrence&#xD;
      by menstrual cycle phase and hormonal contraceptive use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hormonal contraceptives that are known to reduce ovulatory rises in estrogen will have&#xD;
           the most consistent pattern of ACL rupture incidence across all phases of the menstrual&#xD;
           cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There will be a mitigated risk of ACL rupture in the preovulatory phase of the menstrual&#xD;
           cycle, relative to the other phases, in women using hormonal contraception compared to&#xD;
           those not using hormonal contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There will be a higher proportion of ACL ruptures during the preovulatory phase of the&#xD;
           menstrual cycle in non-hormonal contraceptive users.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Anterior Cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture has been observed at higher rates in females than&#xD;
      males during sporting competition, particularly during the preovulatory phase of the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle. During the menstrual cycle, estrogen secretion varies from 10 to 100 fold&#xD;
      throughout the cycle. A possible explanation for the ACL injuries being observed in the&#xD;
      preovulatory phase, is that increases in estrogen levels increases the laxity of the ACL,&#xD;
      predisposing it to risk of rupture. Studies investigating knee joint laxity, concluded that&#xD;
      increased joint laxity was associated with an increased risk of ACL injury. In addition,&#xD;
      measurement of knee laxity found no changes in laxity over time in males, but greater&#xD;
      anterior displacement of the knee during the preovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle&#xD;
      compared with the ovulatory and postovulatory phases in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of hormonal contraception typically maintains estradiol levels at ~25 pg/ml and decreases&#xD;
      the ovulatory rise in estrogen. A study of the use of hormonal contraceptive in alpine skiers&#xD;
      with ACL rupture reported that 74% of women were in the preovulatory phase (vs 26% in the&#xD;
      postovulatory), experienced an ACL rupture. However, in women with ACL rupture in the&#xD;
      preovulatory phase, 72.5% of the women were not using a hormonal contraceptive. A recent&#xD;
      systematic review suggested an association between hormonal fluctuations and ACL injury and&#xD;
      that hormonal contraceptives offer 20% reduction in risk of injury. Multiple modalities of&#xD;
      hormonal and contraceptive control are available to females within Australia, but the&#xD;
      efficacy of different hormonal contraceptives for reducing the risk of ACL rupture is&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate: 1) whether there are differences in risk of an ACL rupture&#xD;
      incidence within menstrual cycle phases in females using different types of hormonal&#xD;
      contraception. 2) whether there are differences in the pattern of ACL rupture incidence&#xD;
      within menstrual cycle phases in females using vs not using hormonal contraception. 3)&#xD;
      whether ACL rupture incidence in female athletes not using hormonal contraceptives are more&#xD;
      prevalent during the pre-ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a cross-sectional design, with data being collected in women presenting at&#xD;
      sports medicine or orthopaedic clinics with ACL rupture. On presentation at the clinic with&#xD;
      ACL rupture, the study will be introduced to patients by a clinician and they will be shown a&#xD;
      recruitment flyer that includes a QR code. On scanning the QR code patients will be taken to&#xD;
      a RedCap survey website that they can enter an email in to receive, via automated reply&#xD;
      email, a Participant Information Sheet and link to an anonymous study survey. The survey will&#xD;
      take approximately 7 minutes to complete and asks questions about how the participants ACL&#xD;
      injury occurred, any previous knee injuries, their menstrual cycle phase that the injury&#xD;
      occurred in, their usual menstrual cycle characteristics, their use of hormonal&#xD;
      contraceptives and the main sport they play.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injury data will be analyzed according to menstrual cycle phase to confirm whether the&#xD;
      preovulatory phase presents higher risk of ACL rupture than the ovulatory/postovulatory&#xD;
      phase. Data will be stratified by hormonal contraception use and type to evaluate whether the&#xD;
      injury occurrence pattern within the menstrual cycle differs by hormonal contraceptive use,&#xD;
      such that the anticipated higher incidence in the preovulatory phase is mitigated with&#xD;
      hormonal contraceptive use (and type).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hormonal contraceptives that are known to reduce ovulatory rises in estrogen will have&#xD;
           the most consistent pattern of ACL rupture incidence across all phases of the menstrual&#xD;
           cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There will be a mitigated risk of ACL rupture in the preovulatory phase of the menstrual&#xD;
           cycle, relative to the other phases, in women using hormonal contraception compared to&#xD;
           those not using hormonal contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There will be a higher proportion of ACL ruptures during the preovulatory phase of the&#xD;
           menstrual cycle in non-hormonal contraceptive users.&#xD;
