  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to understand why some people who have had COVID-19 develop scarring of the&#xD;
      lungs and why some people recover more quickly than others.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 suffer from long term symptoms,&#xD;
      predominantly breathlessness and fatigue whether or not they were admitted to hospital. While&#xD;
      there are a number of causes of long-term breathlessness following COVID-19 one of the most&#xD;
      common, and potentially concerning with regards to long term prognosis is Interstitial Lung&#xD;
      Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fibrogenic potential of SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown but is predicted to be&#xD;
      substantial based on the experience of previous coronavirus outbreaks and emerging data from&#xD;
      this pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators do not yet understand how scarring occurs following SARS-CoV-2, nor why&#xD;
      there is resolution in some individuals and persistent or progressive disease in others. The&#xD;
      investigators therefore plan to undertake bronchoscopy (camera test into the lungs) to&#xD;
      examine for changes in the way the cells lining the lung behave, using genetics, and&#xD;
      differences in the bacteria living in the airways in patients whom have developed scarring&#xD;
      following COVID-19.&#xD;
