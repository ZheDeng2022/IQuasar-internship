      This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and radiographic success of pulpotomy in cariously&#xD;
      exposed vital immature first permanent molars using calcium hydroxide and calcium&#xD;
      silicate-based material (Biodentine ™). After a 12 months postoperative period, Biodentine ™&#xD;
      proved very useful as a successful pulpotomy agent in young permanent teeth.&#xD;

      Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and radiographic success of pulpotomy in&#xD;
      cariously exposed vital immature first permanent molars using calcium hydroxide and calcium&#xD;
      silicate-based material (Biodentine ™).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was carried out on patients attending an outpatient clinic in Pediatric Dentistry&#xD;
      and Dental Public Health Department - Faculty of Dentistry - Cairo University - Egypt. A&#xD;
      total of thirty-five patients had thirty-eight vital immature first permanent molar with deep&#xD;
      caries, who satisfied the eligibility criteria and completed the follow-up period. Their age&#xD;
      ranged between six years to nine years old with a mean age of 7.5+/-1 years. All teeth were&#xD;
      mandibular. In this study, pulpotomy was performed to preserve the vitality and function of&#xD;
      the remaining radicular pulp tissue, followed by applying one of the investigated pulp&#xD;
      capping materials.&#xD;

    <description>Non-setting Calcium hydroxide Pulpotomy capping agent. Deepak. Promotion Industrial Park, Bari Brahmana, Jammu - 181133 India form : powder and liquid. application : Calcium hydroxide was mixed with saline to a thick consistency immediately before use. The paste was carefully placed on the pulp stump surface 2-3 mm thick over a small sterile wet cotton with a small condenser, and the excess material was scraped off.</description>

    <description>Pulpotomy refers to the removal of the entire coronal pulp to the level of the root canal orifice(s) or as much as 2-3 mm apical to the orifices. Pulpotomy has indications similar to those of a partial pulpotomy except that the pulp in question is likely to have more extensive inflammation. Since pulpal inflammation is unlikely to extend past the canal orifices, pulpotomy is similar to a partial pulpotomy except that the entire mass of coronal pulp tissue is removed</description>
