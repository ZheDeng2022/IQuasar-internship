  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the development of American Sign Language by deaf and hard of hearing&#xD;
      (DHH) children and their parents.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, adult participants who give written&#xD;
      informed consent and children whose parents who give written permission will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the study. They will participate in preliminary language tasks to assess baseline performance&#xD;
      on American Sign Language (ASL) measures. Subsequently they will have weekly sessions with an&#xD;
      ASL Specialist to support their development of ASL, following a 6-week on/6-week off ABABABAB&#xD;
      sequence.&#xD;

The Bayesian procedure developed by Swaminathan et al. (2014) involves fitting piece-wise linear or curvilinear trends across the phases, modeling dependencies in the observations with a suitably chosen autoregressive error scheme, and using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to obtain the posterior distributions of the model parameters and effect size measures</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in ASL Phonological Production Accuracy over 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants copy ASL signs produced on video; their productions are scored for phonological accuracy and reported as percent correct out of all possible phonological features. Weekly measures are taken for SCD analysis.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in ASL Production Frequency over 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants engage in naturalistic play sessions which are videorecorded. Sessions are analyzed for the number of productions in ASL over a 15-minute period. Weekly measures are taken for SCD analysis.</description>
