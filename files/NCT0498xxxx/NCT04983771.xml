  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, prospective, observational study, conducted under the auspices of the&#xD;
      University of Oxford to evaluate ultrasound image analysis by human experts and an artificial&#xD;
      intelligence device in the context of ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia (UGRA).&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Ethical Approval:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultrasound scans/still frame images used in this study have been acquired from an earlier&#xD;
      study conducted at Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU) (ClinicalTrials.gov ref:&#xD;
      NCT04906018). OHSU Institutional Review Board approval (STUDY00022920) was granted for&#xD;
      collection of the ultrasound scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval for the assessment of these scans by regional anaesthesia experts, has been&#xD;
      obtained from Oxford University Research Ethics Committee for Medical Sciences&#xD;
      (R75449/RE001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block Areas Included:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Delphi study was undertaken earlier in the research programme: 'International Consensus on&#xD;
      the Minimum Anatomical Structures to Identify on Ultrasound for the Performance of Plan A&#xD;
      Blocks in Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anaesthesia: A Regional Anaesthesia UK Delphi Study'&#xD;
      (work currently unpublished).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As ScanNav Anatomy PNB has undergone development and validation work for all of these blocks&#xD;
      apart from the femoral nerve block, the remaining six Plan A block regions will be considered&#xD;
      for this project. These regions (and structures assessed) are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interscalene level brachial plexus (Structures: anterior scalene, middle scalene, C5&#xD;
           nerve root, C6 nerve root)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Axillary level brachial plexus (Structures: axillary artery, axillary vein, conjoint&#xD;
           tendon, median nerve, musculocutaneous nerve, radial nerve, ulnar nerve)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Erector spinae plane (Structures: transverse process, erector spinae muscle group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rectus sheath plane (Structures: rectus abdominis, rectus sheath (anterior layer),&#xD;
           rectus sheath (posterior layer), peritoneum)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adductor canal (Structures: femoral artery, sartorius, saphenous nerve/nerve complex)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Popliteal level sciatic nerve (Structures: sciatic nerve)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardisation of Ultrasound Scans used for Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultrasound videos and still frames will undergo review during the earlier (OHSU) study,&#xD;
      including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does this ultrasound scan obtain the correct view for this block? [Yes/no]&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does the video or still frame contain any atypical anatomy? [Yes/no]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The answer for question 1 must be 'Yes' and for question 2 must be 'No' for the scan to be&#xD;
      included in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selecting Ultrasound Scans for Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the acceptable ultrasound scans, five will be selected (at random) for each region. This&#xD;
      will be done for each of the six block regions, providing a total of 30 scans/still frame&#xD;
      images overall. A suitable still frame in each scan sequence will be selected by the&#xD;
      investigators and saved as an image file in the Portable Network Graphic (PNG) format for&#xD;
      later segmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expert Reviewers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 15 UGRA experts will be recruited from centres in the UK. One-three will be&#xD;
      recruited from each of seven centres:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aneurin Bevan University Health Board&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Guy's &amp; St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NHS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NHS Tayside&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust&#xD;
&#xD;
      All experts must hold a UK-recognised qualification for independent practice in anaesthesia&#xD;
      (i.e., be qualified to perform UGRA independently and supervise others) and be a member of a&#xD;
      relevant professional society (e.g., RA-UK, ESRA, ASRA). They must also meet at least three&#xD;
      elements of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completed advanced training in UGRA or have &gt;10 years of independent practice in UGRA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hold a qualification related to UGRA (e.g., EDRA, higher degree or equivalent)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regularly delivers direct clinical care using UGRA, including for 'awake' surgery where&#xD;
           indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regularly teaches UGRA in the course of their clinical work, including advanced&#xD;
           techniques (Plan B/C/D blocks) where indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
      Defining the Ground Truth:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UGRA experts will all view each video in turn, on a tablet computer. At the end of each&#xD;
      one they will be asked to mark the boundaries of the relevant anatomical structures (listed&#xD;
      above) for the corresponding still frame image using the tablet and a stylus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 21 anatomical structures across all the regions assess. Each region will&#xD;
      represented by five ultrasound scans. Thus, 105 structures (21 x 5) will each be assessed by&#xD;
      around 15 experts. The expert segmentation masks (for each annotated structure) will be&#xD;
      processed in the following manner to derive an average mask for each structure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each segmentation mask, ms, for a given structure will be segmented such that ms = f(m)&#xD;
           = {1 if mask present 0 if mask not present&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For each pixel, ps, the frames will be summed across all n segmentation masks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This will give a final mask, mf, where mf = { p : 0 ≤ p ≤ n }&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The mf will then be filtered with a threshold such that mt = f2(mt) = { 1 if pf &gt; t n 0&#xD;
           otherwise&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the above description, ms represents a segmentation mask produced by each expert. Areas&#xD;
      enclosed by an expert's segmentation outline will be allocated a numerical value of 1 (0 if&#xD;
      not enclosed by an area of segmentation). Each pixel in the final mask (mf) will be summed&#xD;
      across all (n) the segmentation masks of the experts, to give a final value of 0 - n. At&#xD;
      least 75% of experts must enclose the pixel in their individual segmentation mask for the&#xD;
      pixel to be included in the overall ground truth. ≥75% has been chosen to be consistent with&#xD;
      the strong recommendations made in the earlier Delphi study. Lastly, mf will then be filtered&#xD;
      at this threshold to produce the ground truth mask (mt). The algorithm defined above will be&#xD;
      run using Python2 in jupyter-lab ('Project Jupyter').&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variability in Expert Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The correlation in the expert markings will be compared using the Dice/Intersection over&#xD;
      Union (IoU) and Hausdorff co-efficients. Dice/IoU will be used for all structures except&#xD;
      those identified by a non-enclosed area, where the Hausdorff co-efficient will be used. These&#xD;
      structures are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conjoint tendon&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transverse process&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rectus sheath (anterior layer)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rectus sheath (posterior layer)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peritoneum&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison to ScanNav Anatomy PNB:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ground truth will provide an expert 'gold standard' against which ScanNav Anatomy PNB&#xD;
      will be compared. The level of correlation of ScanNav Anatomy PNB highlighting will be&#xD;
      compared to the expert ground truth in the same statistical manner as above&#xD;
