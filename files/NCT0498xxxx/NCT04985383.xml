    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the AKST1210 column at blood-flow&#xD;
      rates greater than 250 mL/min in subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing&#xD;
      hemodialysis (HD). The study will assess the safety, tolerability, and impact on HD&#xD;
      parameters when the AKST1210 column is used at a blood-flow of up to 450 mL/min.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study in 12 to 15 subjects between 40 and 75 years of age with ESRD on&#xD;
      HD. The objective of this study is to explore the safety and tolerability of the AKST1210&#xD;
      column at blood-flow rates greater than 250 mL/min in subjects with ESRD undergoing HD. The&#xD;
      proposed study will assess the safety, tolerability, and impact on HD parameters when the&#xD;
      AKST1210 column is used at a blood-flow rates of up to 450 mL/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of IDH events will be one factor used to determine column size/blood-flow rate&#xD;
      escalation/de-escalation as well as discontinuation from the study. The planned duration of&#xD;
      subject participation is approximately 12 weeks.&#xD;
