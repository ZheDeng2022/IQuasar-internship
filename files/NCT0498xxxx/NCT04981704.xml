  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of multiple-doses of itraconazole,&#xD;
      phenytoin and paroxetine on the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of poziotinib in healthy&#xD;
      adult participants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-part study. Participants will be enrolled in Part 1 (Effects of&#xD;
      Itraconazole), Part 2 (Effects of Phenytoin), or Part 3 (Effects of Paroxetine) on the&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics of Poziotinib. Each part will be an open-label, fixed-sequence, 2-period&#xD;
      study and may be conducted concurrently. For each study part, participants will be housed on&#xD;
      Day -1 of Treatment Period 1 in the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) and will remain confined in&#xD;
      the CRU until after the last scheduled blood draw and/or study procedures in Treatment Period&#xD;
      2. In each part, there will be a washout period of at least 8 days between poziotinib doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 75 (25 in each part) healthy, adult male and female participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      targeting a female/male ratio greater than or equal to (≥) 1:3 in each study part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In part 1, CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers will be primarily enrolled with a goal of enrolling&#xD;
      at least 2 CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. In Parts 2 and 3, only CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers&#xD;
      will be enrolled. In Part 2, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers will be excluded.&#xD;
