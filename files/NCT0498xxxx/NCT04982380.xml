  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constipation is one of the common complication of diabetes mellitus, whose pathogenesis was&#xD;
      previously recognized as decreased gastrointestinal motility caused by diabetic autonomic&#xD;
      neuropathy. It is always treated with gastrointestinal motility drugs or laxatives which may&#xD;
      have side effects such as gut microbiota dysbiosis and withdraw symptoms. Recently,&#xD;
      researches have indicated that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated&#xD;
      with alterations in the structure of the gut microbiota and have begun to treat diabetic&#xD;
      constipation by improving gut microbiota of these patients. The rational use of&#xD;
      microecological preparation for the prevention and treatment of diabetic constipation has&#xD;
      received increasing attention. This trial is aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Combined Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus and Bacillus Cereus Tablets, Live&#xD;
      (Siliankang) in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and constipation, and to&#xD;
      analyze its influence on gut microbiota and blood glucose.&#xD;

      This is a 16 week, 1:1 randomised, controlled, open label, two-arm, parallel-group trial&#xD;
      evaluating efficacy and safety of Combined Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus and&#xD;
      Bacillus Cereus Tablets, Live (Siliankang) in patients with type 2 diabetes and constipation.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into experimental group or control group treated with Siliankang&#xD;
      or placebo tablets respectively. Total trial duration for the individual subject will be&#xD;
      approximately 16 weeks including screening, 12-weeks treatment and 4-weeks follow-up.&#xD;
      Patients will attend at 2-week, 8-week, 12-week and 16-week throughout the trial taking&#xD;
      physical examination, having blood test, collecting faecal specimen and completing the&#xD;
      questionnaire of constipation under the direction of doctors.&#xD;
