  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Outpatient psychosomatic aftercare after inpatient rehabilitation pursues the goal of helping&#xD;
      patients to transfer the achieved rehabilitation result in everyday life and professional&#xD;
      life. The Hanover Curriculum has been established as a treatment programme for psychosomatic&#xD;
      aftercare. This comprises 25 weekly group sessions and two single therapies at the beginning&#xD;
      and at the end of the therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Germany a vast majority of rehabilitants in a psychosomatic rehabilitation clinic has an&#xD;
      indication for psychosomatic aftercare, but it is used only by less than half of the patients&#xD;
      due to a lack of aftercare therapists. If there is a therapist in the patient's vicinity,&#xD;
      there are often long travelling times to the therapist or the patients might feel stigmatized&#xD;
      participating in a face-to-face therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the expansion of internet-based aftercare services is recommended. Advantages are that&#xD;
      they can be carried out at home, possible cost and time savings and improvement of the care&#xD;
      situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several meta-analyses provide high evidence for the effectiveness of internet-based therapy&#xD;
      offers in depressive and anxiety disorders that are frequent among psychosomatic&#xD;
      rehabilitation patients. First randomised controlled studies show that internet-based&#xD;
      aftercare services can lead to a symptomatic improvement and to a reduction of relapses. It&#xD;
      is currently not clear whether established aftercare concepts, such as the Curriculum&#xD;
      Hannover, are also effective in an internet-based format (Curriculum Hannover Online).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project consists of a superiority study, examining whether participation in&#xD;
      Curriculum- Hannover-Online leads to a stronger adoption and maintenance of the health&#xD;
      improvements achieved in inpatient rehabilitation in comparison to care as usual, and an&#xD;
      equivalnece study, examining, wether the Curriculum Hannover Online is an equivalent&#xD;
      treatment option to the existing face-to-face aftercare therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of information and communication technology with the aim of promoting mental health&#xD;
      can be described as &quot;e-Mental Health&quot;, which is regularly used synonymously with the term&#xD;
      &quot;internet-based interventions&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to the study situation on internet-based aftercare interventions, especially in&#xD;
      Germany, the research is in an early phase. An overview of the possible uses of&#xD;
      internet-based treatment approaches in rehabilitation can be found in Lin, Ebert, Lehr,&#xD;
      Berking and Baumeister (2013) and - based on the contributions of the Rehabilitation Science&#xD;
      Colloquium since 2008 - Baumeister, Lin and Ebert (2013). However, the first randomised&#xD;
      controlled studies on aftercare show, in agreement with the studies outlined above, that&#xD;
      corresponding offers led to a reduction in relapses compared to Care as Usual (CAU) (Bauer,&#xD;
      Okon, Meermann, Kordy, 2013; Ebert, Tarnowski, Gollwitzer, Sieland&amp; Berking, 2013).Both&#xD;
      interventions represent new conceptual developments. Regarding the positive findings on the&#xD;
      effectiveness of internet-based interventions and with a view to the suboptimal care&#xD;
      situation, Kobelt, Winkler and Petermann (2011), for example, recommend the expansion of&#xD;
      internet-based aftercare services and their evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned project aims to develop an internet-based variant of the aftercare concept&#xD;
      Curriculum Hannover (Curriculum-Hannover-Online), to integrate it into routine care and to&#xD;
      test its effectiveness. The technology of the virtual classroom is particularly suitable for&#xD;
      internet-based interventions providing group therapy (cf. Wolever et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, the existing manual for Curriculum Hannover (cf. Kobelt et al., 2002) is&#xD;
      adapted in the course of the process for the needs of an online intervention. The therapists&#xD;
      will be prepared for the specifics of the medium through a train-the-trainer-training for&#xD;
      learning how to specifically establish and maintain a therapeutic relationship between&#xD;
      therapist and participants. It is assumed that this new program for outpatient aftercare&#xD;
      after inpatient psychosomatic rehabilitation can be an effective and useful therpy for&#xD;
      patients who do not have access to the existing face-to-face aftercare therapies.. The&#xD;
      Virtual Classroom is a direct, video- or audio-synchronous and multimedia contact between&#xD;
      therapist and patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main question of the superiority study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Does participation in the Curriculum-Hannover-Online lead to improved uptake and&#xD;
      maintenance of the health improvements achieved in inpatient rehabilitation? B. Can the&#xD;
      implementation of the Curriculum-Hannover-Online be designed in such a way that its use as a&#xD;
      routine procedure in rehabilitation can be recommended? C. Can the Curriculum-Hannover-Online&#xD;
      be accepted by the relevant stakeholders to the same extent as the face-to-face version of&#xD;
      the Curriculum-Hannover-Online? For the successful introduction of a new treatment approach,&#xD;
      in addition to the proof of its effectiveness, significant challenges have to be overcome&#xD;
      with regard to the organisation of work processes, the involvement of all actors involved in&#xD;
      the process (especially patients, practitioners, management).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main question of the equivalence study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.Does participation in the Curriculum-Hannover-Online lead to an equivalent adoption and&#xD;
      maintenance of the health improvements achieved in inpatient rehabilitation? B. Can the&#xD;
      implementation of the Curriculum-Hannover-Online in addition to the offer of the face-to-face&#xD;
      variant be designed in such a way that its use as a rou- tine procedure in rehabilitation can&#xD;
      be recommended? C.Can the Curriculum-Hannover-Online be accepted by the relevant stakeholders&#xD;
      to the same extent as the face-to-face version of the Curriculum-Hannover-Online? D.Can&#xD;
      characteristics be identified that allow a differential indication for the recommendation to&#xD;
      participate in the Curriculum Hannover in its online or face-to-face variant? E.What are the&#xD;
      additional advantages of the Curriculum Hannover Online from the perspective of patients,&#xD;
      therapists, service providers and health care providers? Both studies will be conducted as&#xD;
      two-arm randomised controlled trials. Individual rehabilitation patients will be randomised&#xD;
      to the respective study arms. The system is based on a randomisation list (permuted blocks of&#xD;
      variable length) with the help of the &quot;Randlist&quot; software at the sites. The order of the&#xD;
      completed questionnaires determines the position in the list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data of the participants will be treated in accordance with the data security regulations&#xD;
      (DSGVO), good scientific practice and the ethical requirements. Furthermore, all patients are&#xD;
      informed about the project, ethics and data protection in a generally understandable way by a&#xD;
      cover letter from their clinic before the treatment. All project staff are obliged to comply&#xD;
      with the ethics guidelines and to maintain confidentiality. The pre- and post-data of the&#xD;
      patients are combined by means of a personal code, which does not allow any conclusion about&#xD;
      the participant.&#xD;

    <description>The methodology uses a natural variation design within the Dr. Becker Clinical Group. The interventions consist of a face-to-face or a digital psychosomatic aftercare basing upon the concept of the Curriculum Hanover. A control group is included that does not receive these two interventions (but receives a similar rehabilitation treatment to the intervention groups).</description>
