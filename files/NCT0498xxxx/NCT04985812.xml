  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerability of JNJ-67484703&#xD;
      administrations in participants with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite receiving&#xD;
      methotrexate (MTX) therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      JNJ-67484703 is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 kappa (huIgG1κ) antibody that is being&#xD;
      developed as a treatment for systemic autoimmune disorders. The primary hypothesis of this&#xD;
      study is that treatment with JNJ-67484703 as compared to placebo will result in a similar&#xD;
      tolerability and safety profile, as a measure of participants with abnormalities in vital&#xD;
      signs, physical examinations, and laboratory safety tests. This study will be conducted in 3&#xD;
      phases: screening phase (up to 6 weeks), treatment phase (up to 10 weeks), and follow-up&#xD;
      phase (up to 14 weeks). The duration of study participation will be approximately 30 weeks.&#xD;
      Safety assessment like electrocardiogram (ECG), adverse events will be performed during the&#xD;
      study. Efficacy assessment like joint assessments, pain assessments, RA joint pain severity&#xD;
      assessment, patient's and physician's global assessment of disease activity, health&#xD;
      assessment questionnaires, duration of morning stiffness, functional assessment of chronic&#xD;
      illness therapy-fatigue will be performed during the study.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AEs) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. TEAEs are AEs with onset during the treatment phase or that are a consequence of a pre-existing condition that has worsened since baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A serious adverse event based on International Council for Harmonization (ICH) and European Union (EU) guidelines on pharmacovigilance for medicinal products for human use is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: a) results in death; b) is life-threatening (the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.); c) requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; d) results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; e) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; f) is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with TEAEs by System Organ Class (SOC) with a Frequency Threshold of 5 Percent (%) or More</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with TEAEs by SOC with a frequency threshold of 5% or more by study intervention will be reported. TEAEs are AEs with onset during the treatment phase or that are a consequence of a pre-existing condition that has worsened since baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Disease Activity Index Score 28 using C-reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28-CRP is a derived score combining tender joints (28 joints), swollen joints (28 joints), CRP, and patient's global assessment of disease activity (GH). The set of 28 joint count is based on evaluation of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal (MCP)1, MCP2, MCP3, MCP4, MCP5, proximal interphalangeal (PIP)1, PIP2, PIP3, PIP4, PIP5 joints of both the upper right extremity and the upper left extremity as well as the knee joints of lower right and lower left extremities. Scores below 3.2 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving American College of Rheumatology (ACR)20, ACR50, and ACR70 Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ACR responses are presented as numerical measurement of improvement in multiple disease assessment criteria. For example, ACR20 response is defined as percent improvement of 20 or higher from baseline in both swollen joint count (66 joints) and tender joint count (68 joints), combined with a percent improvement of 20 or higher from baseline in 3 of the following 5 assessments: patient's assessment of pain by visual analog scale (VAS), patient's global assessment of disease activity by VAS, physician's global assessment of disease activity by VAS, patient's assessment of physical function measured by health assessment questionnaire-disability index (HAQ-DI, a 20-question instrument assessing 8 functional areas), and CRP. ACR50 and ACR70 are similarly defined except percent improvement threshold from baseline is 50 and 70, respectively.</description>
