      An outbreak of the novel coronavirus nCoV-19 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the coronavirus&#xD;
      disease-19 (COVID-19), was first detected in Hubei province, Wuhan, China, on December 31,&#xD;
      2019. It has rapidly spread globally with approximately 157,343,044 confirmed cases and&#xD;
      3,278,510 deaths till 7th May, 2021 [1]. World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID- 19&#xD;

      The world is facing the second wave of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic which is&#xD;
      the most troublesome challenge to public health. The second wave is running and nobody knows&#xD;

      health, science, and medical sectors [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the World Health Organization, about 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic,&#xD;

&#xD;
      We know a lot about the transmission and clinical feature of COVID-19, but relatively little&#xD;
      about what happens after someone recovers. Much is still unknown about how COVID-19 will&#xD;

      B. INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An outbreak of the novel coronavirus nCoV-19 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the coronavirus&#xD;
      disease-19 (COVID-19), was first detected in Hubei province, Wuhan, China, on December 31,&#xD;
      2019. It has rapidly spread globally with approximately 157,343,044 confirmed cases and&#xD;
      3,278,510 deaths till 7th May, 2021 [1]. World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID- 19&#xD;
      pandemic on 11th March 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The world is facing the second wave of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic which is&#xD;
      the most troublesome challenge to public health. The second wave is running and nobody knows&#xD;
      where we are in the course of this disease. It becomes a significant challenge for the public&#xD;
      health, science, and medical sectors [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the World Health Organization, about 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic,&#xD;
      15% result in moderate to severe symptoms (requiring oxygen) and about 5% are critical&#xD;
      infections, which require ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are learning something new every day. Our understanding of the pandemic is growing and&#xD;
      changing daily. The world is focusing on the short term - flattening the curve, treating the&#xD;
      sick and discovering a vaccine. But there is more to this pandemic than the short term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We know a lot about the transmission and clinical feature of COVID-19, but relatively little&#xD;
      about what happens after someone recovers. Much is still unknown about how COVID-19 will&#xD;
      affect people over time. There's still much to be learned from those who have recovered from&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are still only one year and four months beyond the first emergence of COVID-19, so it's&#xD;
      too early to tell what the extent of any long-term impacts will be.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most people who have COVID-19 recover completely within a few weeks [3]. But some people -&#xD;
      even those who had mild disease, continue to experience symptoms after their initial&#xD;
      recovery. Older people and people with many serious medical conditions like diabetes, COPD,&#xD;
      heart disease, kidney disease etc. are the most likely to experience these lingering COVID-19&#xD;
      symptoms. The most common symptoms that linger over weeks, even months are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fatigue&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cough (dry)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shortness of breath&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Headache&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Joint pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confusion and even hallucinations. But, our body has surprising healing capacity; most&#xD;
           of these symptoms will improve by six months. However, some people recovering from&#xD;
           COVID-19 will likely suffer from long-term health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although COVID-19 is seen as a disease that primarily affects the lungs, it can damage many&#xD;
      other organs as well. This organ damage may increase the risk of long-term health problems.&#xD;
      Some of the most common long-term effects are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lungs: The pneumonia associated with COVID-19 can often cause long-standing damage to the&#xD;
      tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs [4]. The resulting scar tissue i.e. pulmonary fibrosis&#xD;
      can lead to long-term breathing problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart: A recent study from the University of Frankford in Germany showed abnormal heart&#xD;
      findings in more than 75% of people studied who had recently recovered from COVID-19. Imaging&#xD;
      tests taken months after recovery from COVID-19 have shown lasting damage to the heart&#xD;
      muscle, even in people who experienced only mild COVID-19 symptoms. This may increase the&#xD;
      risk of heart failure or other heart complications in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain: COVID-19 can cause strokes [5], seizures and Guillain-Barre syndrome, even in young&#xD;
      people. COVID-19 may also increase the risk of developing Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood clots and blood vessel problems: COVID-19 can predispose to form clots. While large&#xD;
      clots can cause heart attacks and strokes, much of the heart damage caused by COVID-19 is&#xD;
      believed to stem from very small clots that block tiny blood vessels (capillaries) in the&#xD;
      heart muscle. Other organs affected by blood clots include the lungs, legs, liver and&#xD;
      kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychiatric issues: Most people recovering from COVID-19 experience anxiety, depression, or&#xD;
      cognitive impairment. Some may develop more serious Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) due&#xD;
      to the trauma of the illness and treatment [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kidney: Patient may develop kidney complications which could lead to a need for long-term&#xD;
      dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A lot of things may happen in long run in those who recovered from COVID-19. Our&#xD;
      understanding of COVID-19's long term effects will depend greatly on ongoing studies over the&#xD;
      next decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To assess long-term effects of COVID-19 in patients who were affected with COVID -19&#xD;
           (RT-PCR +ve) from 1st July to 30th December, 2020 recorded in PCR Lab of Sher-E-Bangla&#xD;
           Medical College Hospital, Barishal i.e. six months or more before the initiation of&#xD;
           study and recovered fully.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Specific Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To detect the system-based complications and assess their incidence, and compare the results&#xD;
      with other studies in home and abroad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: An observational retrospective study. Study Population: COVID -19 (RT-PCR +ve)&#xD;
      patients from 1st July to 30th December, 2020 recorded in PCR Lab of Sher-E-Bangla Medical&#xD;
      College Hospital, Barishal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COVID-19 (RT-PCR +ve) patients age 20 years and above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those patients whose mobile numbers are recorded in the register.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those patients who/their attendants are available on mobile phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persons below 20 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those patients whose mobile numbers are not recorded in the register.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those patients who/their attendants are not available on mobile phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those who died by this time from causes unrelated to COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size (n):&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the sample size the following formula was followed n= n= the desired sample size&#xD;
      z= Standard normal deviate usually set at 1.96 p= Proportion in the population; if not known,&#xD;
      it is regarded as 0.5 (50.0%), here p is 0.27 q= 1-p d= Degree of accuracy which is&#xD;
      considered as 0.05 According to this formula the targeted sample was 302. But attempt will be&#xD;
      taken to take more sample population as far as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple random sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Place of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        4. Prescription of registered doctor if any&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Investigations if any.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case definition:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Long-term effects of COVID-19 are those complications which develop or persist after 6&#xD;
           (six) months of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. System-based complications should follow the standard definition and are listed in the&#xD;
           questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be carried out by using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences&#xD;
      version 23 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). The mean and Standard deviation&#xD;
      values will be calculated for continuous variables. t- test and analysis of variance (ANOVA)&#xD;
      will be employed for continuous data. P values &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. PROCEDURE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will be conducted in Sher-E-Bangla Medical College, Barishal, Bangladesh.&#xD;
      Those who were RT-PCR positive for corona in PCR Lab of Sher-E-Bangla Medical College,&#xD;
      Barishal from 1st July to 30th December, 2020 and recovered fully, will be listed from&#xD;
      register of PCR Lab and their contact numbers will be collected from there. They will be&#xD;
      contacted via cell phone and information will be collected after initial exchange of&#xD;
      wellbeing and verbal consent. The conversation will be conducted by a registered physician as&#xD;
      per prescribed questionnaire. If any complication is reported, then that will be confirmed&#xD;
      either by the diagnosis of a registered physician (if already seen) or the patient will be&#xD;
      advised to come and confirmed by respective specialist according to complication and specific&#xD;
      investigation (if available). Follow-up will be done for at least 6 months after 6 months&#xD;
      from the date of RT-PCR +ve by 3 telphonic conversation. All information will be registered&#xD;
      in data collection form and analysed thereafter.&#xD;
