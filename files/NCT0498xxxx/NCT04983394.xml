      This study, which will be conducted in Sivas Cumhuriyet University, Physical Medicine and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Clinic, was diagnosed with COVID-19 from an oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      swab sample more than 90 days ago with polymerase chain reaction, whose symptoms have&#xD;
      continued since the diagnosis of COVID-19, and inpatient treatment. 63 adult female and male&#xD;
      post-COVID syndrome patients who did not develop pneumonia or organ failure findings will be&#xD;
      included. Those who have had acute myocardial infarction in the last 6 months, have&#xD;
      cardiovascular system disease such as uncontrolled hypertension, arrhythmia, aneurysm,&#xD;
      cardiac failure, have undergone fracture or orthopedic surgery in the last 3 months, have a&#xD;
      known chronic respiratory system disease, cause widespread pain such as fibromyalgia syndrome&#xD;
      Those who have a disease or cannot be mobilized independently will not be included in the&#xD;
      study. The sample size was determined as d=0.80 Î±=0.05 p=0.80410 n=54 using the G*Power&#xD;
      3.1.9.4 program. Considering the 15% drop-out risk, 63 patients were planned to be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data of all participants, including age, gender, height, weight and body mass&#xD;
      index, and the time elapsed since the diagnosis of COVID-19 will be recorded. In addition,&#xD;
      participants' pain intensity, functional capacity, general health status, mood, and fatigue&#xD;
      levels will be evaluated.&#xD;
