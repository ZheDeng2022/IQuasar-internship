  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study intends to establish a prediction method and evaluation system for&#xD;
      polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) complicated with affective disorder, such as depression and&#xD;
      anxiety, through the epidemiological investigation. Randomized controlled studies on the&#xD;
      efficacy of various intervention methods should be carried out to develop early intervention&#xD;
      measures and methods in order to reduce the harm of psychological disorders, to facilitate&#xD;
      the mental health of PCOS patients, and thus to improve the quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PCOS is the most common reproductive endocrine and metabolic disease in women of adolescence&#xD;
      and childbearing age. Ovulation/anovulation and hyperandrogenemia are the main features.&#xD;
      About 50-60% of patients present insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia. The prevalence of PCOS&#xD;
      in women of childbearing age is as high as 5-10%, about 50-80% of whom are infertile. The&#xD;
      probability of miscarriage in PCOS is higher than that of controls, ovulation induction or in&#xD;
      vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET). Pregnancy complications in PCOS patients, such&#xD;
      as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, etc., and long-term complications of metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome and endometrial cancer are more likely to happen. These not only greatly affect&#xD;
      women's reproductive health, but also seriously endanger their psychological status. A large&#xD;
      sample of data has shown that the risk of depression in women with PCOS is 3.78 times that of&#xD;
      the control women, 5.62 times for anxiety, and 1.78 times for bipolar disorder. With the&#xD;
      economic development, people's living standards continue to improve, and more and more&#xD;
      attention is paid to the quality of life including their own mental health. However, there is&#xD;
      few data on the risk factors of depression, anxiety and other psychological disorders in&#xD;
      women with PCOS. There is a lack of effective evaluation and prediction systems and&#xD;
      intervention measures. It is urgent to establish a risk assessment system for PCOS&#xD;
      complicated with psychological diseases through scientific and systematic research, to&#xD;
      formulate comprehensive intervention measures to improve the quality of life of women with&#xD;
      PCOS and to reduce the incidence of affective disorders.&#xD;
