  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety by determining the incidence rates of all&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs) including serious adverse events (SAEs)/serious adverse drug reactions&#xD;
      (ADRs), unexpected AEs and ADRs that are not reflected in the precautions for use, ADRs&#xD;
      already known, non-serious ADRs and other safety related information among participants who&#xD;
      have received alogliptin for type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a long-term prospective, observational post-marketing surveillance study of&#xD;
      alogliptin in participants with T2DM. The study assessed the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      alogliptin for its approved indication within a real-world setting in South Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 3000 participants. The data is collected prospectively at&#xD;
      the study sites and recorded in electronic case report forms (e-CRFs). All the participants&#xD;
      are assigned to a single observational cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Nesina® Tablet&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multi-center study is conducted in South Korea. Data is collected at 13 and 26 weeks&#xD;
      after enrollment during standard of care office visits. The overall study was conducted&#xD;
      during a 6-year re-examination period.&#xD;
