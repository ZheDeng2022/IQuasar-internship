    <textblock>
      In a 20-year retrospective study, all skiers and snowboarders with a peroneal nerve injury at&#xD;
      the fibular head treated surgically at the Department of Plastic, Reconstructive and&#xD;
      Aesthetic Surgery at the Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria, were included. Covering a&#xD;
      period from 1999/2000 to 2018/2019.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      All data were gained in a clinical routine context, and the study design was retrospective.&#xD;
      The work was approved by the local ethics committee of the Medical University of Innsbruck,&#xD;
      Innsbruck, Austria (EK Nr.: 1300/2019). We reviewed medical charts from over a 20-year&#xD;
      period, including all patients with a PNI after a ski- or snowboard-related accident&#xD;
      requiring surgical intervention at the Department of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic&#xD;
      Surgery of the Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We analyzed the demographical data, including age, gender, and citizenship, as well as&#xD;
      included variables concerning the winter sport activity (i.e., ski or snowboard, owned or&#xD;
      rented, self-inflicted without collision or collision caused by another skier or snowboarder,&#xD;
      professional or recreational athlete). We also analyzed the injury itself (i.e., PNI as main&#xD;
      injury, open or closed, motoric, sensible or both, fracture, muscle injury, complete or&#xD;
      incomplete transection), as well as the treatment.&#xD;
