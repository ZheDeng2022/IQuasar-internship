  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with intestinal failure have a lack of tolerance for food in the intestine. The&#xD;
      children are dependent on intravenous nutrition over a long period of time period to ensure&#xD;
      growth and development. The condition is characterized by bacterial overgrowth in the&#xD;
      intestine, with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and flatulence as physical symptoms. Mental health&#xD;
      is affected in the form of lower quality of life, lack of school participation and less&#xD;
      social contact with peers. The investigators own (unpublished) data show that children with&#xD;
      intestinal failure have a lower quality of life than healthy people. Standard treatment is&#xD;
      antibiotics, but the effect of these is short-lived, and many must have repeated courses.&#xD;
      Prebiotics are indigestible carbohydrates (fiber) in foods that positively affect the&#xD;
      bacterial flora and promote intestinal health. In this project the investigators want to see&#xD;
      if supply of prebiotics can change the bacterial balance, reduce symptoms of bacterial&#xD;
      overgrowth and increase quality of life. The study is unique, as Prebiotics have not&#xD;
      previously been used in the treatment of intestinal failure. If successful, it can pave the&#xD;
      way for a new and better treatment method that can potentially be transferred to other&#xD;
      conditions with imbalance in the intestinal flora. The study is a randomized intervention&#xD;
      study and is consist of two phases. In phase 1, the effect of 4 weeks of open intervention&#xD;
      with prebiotics is studied to establish so-called &quot;proof of concept&quot;. Data from phase 1 are&#xD;
      used to look at connections between the composition of intestinal flora, nutritional status&#xD;
      and bowel function. The intervention involves the use of a prebiotic product (Stimulance,&#xD;
      Nutricia), which is added to childs regular food. In phase 2, patients are randomized into&#xD;
      two groups. One group will continue with the product for 6 months, while the other group does&#xD;
      not receive prebiotics.&#xD;

      Quality of life and gastrointestinal symptoms are measured using validated forms for four&#xD;
      weeks before intervention phase 1, at start-up and after phase 1, as well as after phase 2.&#xD;
      Stool samples are collected at the same time points. Weight, height is measured and blood&#xD;
      tests are collected at the start and end of phases 1 and 2. Data on diet and nutritional&#xD;
      treatment are collected at the start and end of the two phases. The stool samples are&#xD;
      analyzed for short fatty acids (marker for good intestinal health), the composition of the&#xD;
      intestinal flora and inflammation markers. Blood samples are analyzed for infection markers,&#xD;
      intestinal health markers and nutritional markers. Nutritional data, are analyzed for&#xD;
      nutrient content and the dependence on nutritional support is calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that the study will lead to an improved quality of life for the&#xD;
      patient group through increased tolerance to food in the intestine, reduced antibiotic use&#xD;
      and reduction of gastrointestinal symptoms. The project is patient-oriented.&#xD;
