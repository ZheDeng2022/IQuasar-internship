  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is a progressive and generalised skeletal muscle disorder involving the&#xD;
      accelerated loss of muscle mass and function that is associated with increased adverse&#xD;
      outcomes including falls, functional decline, frailty, and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot project, the investigators want to explore the potential of the high-definition&#xD;
      surface electromyography technology (HD-sEMG) for the diagnosis of sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a monocentric, descriptive, cross-sectional, parallel group study to develop a new&#xD;
      diagnostic method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to include 50 people aged 75-95 years hospitalized in the acute geriatric ward&#xD;
      and suspected of sarcopenia (Score ≥4 on the SARC-F screening questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion duration will be 12 months and adding a 1-month patient follow-up as part of&#xD;
      routine care, the total study duration will be 13 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have their body composition (muscle mass, fat mass, and bone mass) using dual&#xD;
      X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Muscular strength will be assessed by handgrip strength.&#xD;
      Physical performance will be assessed. Additional data will be collected from their medical&#xD;
      records.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aging of the population is a major public health problem with its multifactorial impact&#xD;
      on quality of life and maintenance of autonomy. Unfortunately, one consequence of aging is&#xD;
      sarcopenia, which affects the intrinsic and functional properties of muscle. It is a risk&#xD;
      factor for loss of autonomy, falls, frailty and is associated with increased mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcopenia is defined as a progressive loss of muscle mass, strength and physical&#xD;
      performance. Classically, sarcopenia is assessed by imaging techniques (MRI, DEXA) or&#xD;
      bioelectrical impedancemetry for aspects related to the assessment of muscle mass loss. MRI&#xD;
      or DEXA are not widely available and/or access is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For functional aspects, grip strength measurements are often used. Currently sarcopenia&#xD;
      cannot be diagnosed and evaluated by a single examination, including both the morphological&#xD;
      (muscle mass) and functional aspects. Furthermore, several biological markers are associated&#xD;
      with muscle mass, strength, and function, but these biomarkers are not specific to skeletal&#xD;
      muscle and are weakly associated with clinical goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, despite the important interest in assessing the qualitative/functional and&#xD;
      quantitative aspect of skeletal muscle in neuromuscular impairment, there is currently no&#xD;
      tool that routinely assesses these aspects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, developing new approaches for non-invasive assessment of sarcopenia, is a&#xD;
      major issue. In this pilot project, the investigators aim to develop a medical device derived&#xD;
      from high-definition surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) technology, non-invasive and&#xD;
      portable, for the diagnosis of sarcopenia.&#xD;

    <description>Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is considered the most effective procedure to date for assessing muscle mass and confirming the diagnosis of sarcopenia. DEXA is the same examination as bone densitometry (to assess osteoporosis) and through body composition analysis, it measures skeletal muscle mass index (SMMI in kg/m2, skeletal muscle mass/height2), percentage of muscle mass, fat mass and fat distribution (android/gynoid). Whole-body DEXA measurement is fast (3-10 minutes depending on the device), non-invasive, accurate, and minimally technician dependent. It induces an irradiation of 2-5 µSv, which is low compared to the daily natural irradiation (5-7 µSv).</description>
