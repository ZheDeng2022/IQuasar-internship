    <description>W-GenZD is powered by natural language processing and machine learning techniques, the brief, self-guided intervention draws from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT-A) and some elements of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), depending on the presenting situation, to help the adolescent develop emotion regulation skills in the context of their everyday life. In this way, the mobile medical application is designed to be targeted, relevant, tailored, and integrated into the lived experience of adolescents, capable of delivering the appropriate technique for the problem at hand, at the time of need.</description>
