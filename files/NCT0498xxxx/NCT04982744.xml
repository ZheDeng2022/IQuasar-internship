  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ReLF is a retrospective and prospective registry, finalized to care and research. It is&#xD;
      articulated in main sections - strongly related and mutually dependent on each other -&#xD;
      corresponding to different data domains: personal information, clinical data, genetic data,&#xD;
      genealogical data, surgeries, etc. This approach has been individuated in order to&#xD;
      corroborate and integrate data from different resources and aspects of the diseases and to&#xD;
      correlate genetic background and phenotypic outcomes, in order to better investigate diseases&#xD;
      pathophysiology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The common way to collect patient information is frequently chaotic and inconvenient&#xD;
      (sometimes even unsafe), particularly when dealing with rare diseases. The need to simplify&#xD;
      the diagnostic process and to overcome the difficulties of data storage and analysis,&#xD;
      suggested in 2020 to implement the Registry of Li Fraumeni and Li Fraumeni Like syndromes&#xD;
      (ReLF)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ReLFrelies on an IT Platform named GeDI (Genotype-phenotype Data Integration platform).&#xD;
      This solution, realized by a collaboration among Department of Rare Skeletal Disorders and a&#xD;
      local software-house (NSI - Nier IT Solution), is a GDPR-compliant, multi-client,&#xD;
      web-accessible system and it has been designed according to current medical informatics&#xD;
      standards (Orphacode, ICD-10, Human Genome Variants Society, Findability Accessibility&#xD;
      Interoperability Reusability -FAIR- Principles). GeDI is continuously implemented to improve&#xD;
      management of persons with Osteogenesis Imperfecta and to help researchers in analysing&#xD;
      collected information. ROI is articulated in main sections:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ø Personal data: it comprises general information, birth details and residence data Ø Patient&#xD;
      data: including the patients internal code, the hospital code and other details on patients Ø&#xD;
      Diagnosis: the diagnosis, the status (affected, suspect, etc.), age at diagnosis,&#xD;
      comorbidities, allergies, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ø Genogram: a tool to design family transmission of the disease, flanked by info on diseases&#xD;
      status of all included relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ø Clinical events: records several signs and symptoms of Li Fraumeni and Li Fraumeni like&#xD;
      syndromes (representing the main disease features) and 12 additional items to describe the&#xD;
      disease Ø Genetic Analysis and Alteration: including technique, sample information, duration&#xD;
      of analysis, etc. In addition, this section comprises detailed information on detected&#xD;
      pathological variants (gene, international reference, DNA change, Protein change, genomic&#xD;
      position, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ø Visits: it includes the typology of the visit (genetic, orthopaedic, rehabilitation,&#xD;
      paediatric, etc.), the date of the visit, treatment, prescription, imaging, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ø Surgeries: this section contains information on the surgeries type, the age of the&#xD;
      patients, the site/localization of the procedures, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ø Documents: this repository is allowed to store all type of documents (radiological reports,&#xD;
      imaging, consents, clinical reports, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ø Consents: this section comprises a complete overview of all collected consents, including&#xD;
      the date of collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ø Samples: it comprises the type of samples (DNA, tissue, whole peripheral blood, etc.)&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Natural History and Epidemiology</measure>
    <time_frame>Since the disease is rare, the timeframe is strictly related to patients enrolment and consequently to amount of collected data. Considering the low prevalence of this disease, the time frame is up to 10 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of epidemiological information (incidence, prevalence measured as percentages and/or ratios).&#xD;
Anthropometric data: weight in kg, height in cm. In addition, weight and height will be combined to report BMI as kg/m^2 Clinical details of the tumor: site of the lesion, number of recurrence(s), presence/absence of metastasis, size of lesion in cm^3 Additional clinical data: type of surgery, age at surgery in years are updated at each follow up and retrospectively (when possible).&#xD;
Clinical reports, medical charts and imaging are the primary source of data.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Genotype-Phenotype Correlation</measure>
    <time_frame>The timeframe is strictly related to patients enrolment and consequently to amount of collected data. Considering the low prevalence of this disease, the time frame is up to 10 years.</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome comprises the correlation between genotype and phenotype. This includes, but is not limited to, clinical features and genetic background. This will be pursued using the information collected during visits and follow-ups and the genetic information resulting from molecular investigations.&#xD;
Collection of genetics background (target gene, type of mutation, clinical significance are reported following HGVS nomenclature) and family history (in terms of inheritance by maternal or paternal line).&#xD;
Anthropometric data (weight in kg, height in cm. In addition, weight and height will be combined to report BMI in kg/m^2), clinical details (site of the lesion, recurrence, metastasis), orthopaedic and functional features are updated at each follow up.</description>

    <time_frame>The timeframe is strictly related to patients enrolment and consequently to amount of collected data. Considering the low prevalence of this disease, the time frame is up to 10 years.</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome aims to investigate similarities and difference of tumoral manifestation (site of the tumor, type of tumor, age at onset, grade of leasion) in patients affected by Li Fraumeni or Li Fraumeni Like syndromes within the families and among the families.</description>
