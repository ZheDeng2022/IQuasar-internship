    <textblock>
      This study is a phase III which includes two treatment phases. The phase 1 study is a&#xD;
      multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel group that provide&#xD;
      primary efficacy and safety data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 2 study is a single-arm, open-label conducted in a subset of subjects who completed&#xD;
      the phase 1 study to provid additional long-term safety and efficacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The phase 1 study which includes the screening phase (up to 3 weeks) and treatment phase (12&#xD;
      weeks). After signing the informed consent, the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      confirmed preliminarily at screening visit and reconfirmed at Day 1 (baseline). At least 418&#xD;
      eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 6.5mg of intravaginal&#xD;
      prasterone or placebo once-daily for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 2 study which includes the treatment phase (26 weeks). A total of 100 subjects who&#xD;
      have completed Phase 1, not occur adverse event（AE） grade ≥3 or serious adverse event (SAE),&#xD;
      or recover all AE grades ≤1, and voluntary to participate in Phase 2 study. After signing the&#xD;
      ICF, the subject will receive 6.5mg of intravaginal for 26 weeks.&#xD;
