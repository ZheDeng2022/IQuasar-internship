      Corona-virus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus 2, and this virus was first originated from Wuhan city of Hubei province of China&#xD;
      spreading around the globe. The prominent symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, dyspnea,&#xD;
      and other symptoms noted in patients affected by COVID-19 that includes; chills, repeated&#xD;
      shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and new loss of taste or smell. In&#xD;
      addition, the emergency warning signs of COVID-19 include difficulty breathing or shortness&#xD;
      of breath, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion or inability to arouse and&#xD;
      bluish lips or face and the patients experiencing any of these signs should get immediate&#xD;
      medical attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herbal medicines are used by many people to try to improve their health upon the believe that&#xD;
      &quot;natural products&quot; are always safe, and good for immunity based on the traditional knowledge&#xD;
      .There is a potential of Nigella Sativa to treat the patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nigella Sativa (NS), a widely used medicinal plant of the family Ranunculaceae ; commonly&#xD;
      known as Black Cumin, has been shown to exert antiviral effects against a variety of viruses&#xD;
      such as Mouse Cytomegalovirus and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) . The components' antimicrobial&#xD;
      properties against various microbes as well as their anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulatory&#xD;
      effects have also been established .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune system defends the body from foreign, invading organisms, promoting protective&#xD;
      immunity, while maintaining tolerance to self. The implications of vitamin deficiency on the&#xD;
      immune system have become clearer in recent years, and in the context of vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency, the increased susceptibility to infection observed, especially in a genetically&#xD;
      susceptible host to autoimmunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The classical actions of vitamin D are to promote calcium homeostasis, and to promote bone&#xD;
      health. In humans, vitamin D is obtained from the diet, or synthesized in the skin as vitamin&#xD;
      D is cutaneously produced after exposure to UV light, its synthesis is influenced by&#xD;
      latitude, season, use of sun-block and skin pigmentation. Melanin absorbs UV radiation&#xD;
      inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin D from 7-dihydrocholesterol. This initial vitamin D&#xD;
      compound is inactive form; hydroxylation in the liver to form the active 25 hydroxy vitamin&#xD;
      D3 (25 D). Vitamin D is the most reliable measurement of an individual's vitamin D status. It&#xD;
      is converted in the kidney to the active compound 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25 D) or&#xD;
      calcidiol by 1-Î±-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), an enzyme which is stimulated by parathormone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A principal defense against uncontrolled inflammation, and against viral infection in&#xD;
      general, is provided by T regulatory lymphocytes (Tregs). Treg levels have been reported to&#xD;
      be low in many COVID-19 patients, and can be increased by vitamin D supplementation. Low&#xD;
      vitamin D levels have been associated with an increase in inflammatory cytokines, and a&#xD;
      significantly increased risk of pneumonia, and viral upper respiratory tract infections.&#xD;
