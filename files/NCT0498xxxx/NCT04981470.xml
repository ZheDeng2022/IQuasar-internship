      The baroloop Study is a non-randomized, prospective, single-arm, multi center First in Human&#xD;
      (FIH) study with the primary objective being the assessment of the safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      using the baroloop System in subjects with uncontrollable hypertension. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to document the effect of the baroloop device on the blood pressure and quality&#xD;
      of life in subjects with hypertension. Up to 10 subjects will be enrolled in up to 3 sites in&#xD;
      Europe.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of Life as measured by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

             pressure (DBP) &gt; 90 mm Hg on antihypertensive medicines on two visits separated by a&#xD;
             minimum of four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Mean 24-hour systolic ABPM ≥ 130 mm Hg and mean 24 hour diastolic ABPM ≥ 80 mm Hg&#xD;

             were taken as prescribed during the ABPM measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
