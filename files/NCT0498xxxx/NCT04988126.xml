  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim in this study is to evaluate pain, fatigue and quality of life in patients with&#xD;
      Covid-19 pneumonia in long-term follow-up and to investigate their relationship with&#xD;
      pneumonia severity, age, presence of comorbidity and depression level.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients over the age of 18 who are hospitalized in the Pandemic Service, and are positive&#xD;
      for COVID-19 PCR, will be included in the study if the participants read the informed consent&#xD;
      form and volunteer for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' age, comorbidities, initial symptoms, and pneumonia severity (mild/moderate/severe)&#xD;
      will be recorded. Pain, fatigue and depression assessments will be made on the first day of&#xD;
      hospitalization, at discharge, at the 1st month and 3rd month after discharge. The 1st and&#xD;
      3rd month evaluations of the patients will be made by contacting the participants by phone.&#xD;
      In addition to the 1st and 3rd month evaluations, the quality of life will also be evaluated&#xD;
      with the SF-12 questionnaire.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12th week</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline visual analog scale (VAS) myalgia, arthralgia, cervical, thorocic and lumbar pain at 4th and 12th week.&#xD;
Pain intensity was measured with visual analogue scale for pain (0-10 mm; 0 means no pain, 10 means severe pain) which is used to measure musculoskeletal pain with very good reliability and validity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12th week</time_frame>
    <description>The scale evaluates the fatigue severity of the participants in the last week. Answers are scored on a seven point scale where 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree. The minimum score possible is nine and the highest is 63. The higher the score, the more severe the fatigue is and the more it affects the person's activities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety And Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12th week</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a measure designed to assess anxiety and depression symptoms in patients. The HADS is a fourteen item scale that generates: Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. A subscore of &gt; 7 for depression and &gt; 10 for anxiety would indicate a clinical case.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short form 12 (SF-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12th week</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 is an easy-to-administer questionnaire with proven reliability and validity, obtained by shortening and simplifying the SF-36. It is used in the assessment of physical and mental health, the two main components of general health. SF-12 surveys eight domains of health, such as physical functionality, physical role limitations, pain, general health, vitality, social functionality, emotional role limitations, and mental health. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better physical and mental health functioning</description>
