  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective analysis was performed on patients with bursal-side partial-thickness rotator&#xD;
      cuff tears who underwent arthroscopic surgery from January 2009 to December 2011. To&#xD;
      investigate the diagnosis and arthroscopic treatment of partial rotator cuff bursa lateral&#xD;
      tear, and to evaluate the postoperative functional outcome and tendon healing.&#xD;

      To study the surgical method and clinical effect of arthroscopic treatment for partial tear&#xD;
      of rotator cuff bursa. A retrospective analysis was performed on patients bursal-side&#xD;
      partial-thickness rotator cuff tears who underwent arthroscopic surgery from January 2009 to&#xD;
      December 2011. Preoperative X-ray and MRI were performed. Rotator cuff repair was performed&#xD;
      during the operation. UCLA shoulder scoring scale was used to evaluate the joint at&#xD;
      preoperative and final follow-up.&#xD;
