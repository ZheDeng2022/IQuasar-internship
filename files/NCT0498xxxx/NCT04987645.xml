  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized trial comparing the use of only water or water and air&#xD;
      insufflation during colonoscopy insertion by trainees. This study will be looking at the&#xD;
      impact that water-assisted colonoscopy has on resident learning. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the use of water only compared to water and air will improve the learning&#xD;
      experience for trainees.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, the investigators will offer participation in the study when patients present&#xD;
      for their scheduled routine colonoscopy. The participants will be asked to give consent for&#xD;
      the colonoscopy procedure and participation in the trial. After consent is obtained and&#xD;
      information is taken from the participants, each participant would be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either water only or water and air insufflation on insertion via a computer-generated random&#xD;
      number. All patients over the age of 18 presenting for their scheduled colonoscopy at either&#xD;
      the Health Sciences Centre or St. Clare's Mercy Hospital in St. John's, Newfoundland, can&#xD;
      participate in the study. The colonoscopy will then be done in the usual manner with&#xD;
      appropriate sedation. Patients will then be debriefed regarding their colonoscopy following&#xD;
      the procedure in recovery.&#xD;

             consent, known bowel obstruction, emergency colonoscopy. It will be noted if patients&#xD;
