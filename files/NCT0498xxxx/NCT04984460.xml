    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the results of different detection methods for&#xD;
      non-gestational fungal vaginitis (VVC), and to evaluate the significance of different fungal&#xD;
      states in the results for diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study was divided into two phases: in the first phase, the vaginal secretions of 1000&#xD;
      enrolled patients with fungal vaginitis were detected with 3/4 different methods, and the&#xD;
      sensitivity, specificity and consistency of these methods were compared; In the second stage,&#xD;
      1000 patients from the first stage were selected to meet the follow-up stage and divided into&#xD;
      two groups. The test of Follow-up fungal culture and fluorescence morphological detection of&#xD;
      liquid-based thin-layer film-making fungi were performed periodically. At last, the applicant&#xD;
      will analyze the data, write the paper and publish the article.&#xD;
