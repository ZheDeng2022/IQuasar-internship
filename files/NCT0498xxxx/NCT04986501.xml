      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the oral rinse comparing to&#xD;
      MucoPEG™ and Biotene®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized open-label crossover study with 42 patients receiving treatment.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either the MucoPEG™ or the Biotene® Dry Mouth&#xD;
      Gentle Oral Rinse in the first period. Patients will use the assigned oral rinse two times a&#xD;
      day for two weeks. Patients will switch to the other treatment after a wash-out period of one&#xD;
      week.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to compare MucoPEG™ and it temporal change to those of the&#xD;
      Biotene® Dry Mouth Gentle Oral Rinse in patients with Xerostomia. The study will gather data&#xD;
      on patient reported outcomes on the safety and performance of the product, mouth-feel&#xD;
      qualities and any changes in dry mouth.&#xD;
