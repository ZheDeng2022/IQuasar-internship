    <textblock>
      This Phase 1, first-in-human, multiple dose-escalation, randomized, double-blinded,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study is evaluating SYNB1934 in healthy volunteers (HV). Eligible subjects&#xD;
      receive investigational product (IP) and undergo safety monitoring, evaluations, and&#xD;
      subsequent follow-up after IP administration.&#xD;

      This study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, kinetics, and pharmacodynamics of SYNB1934&#xD;
      within the following 2 study parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 is an inpatient, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in HV male&#xD;
      and female subjects in up to 5 dose cohorts (6 treated: 2 placebo) for 5 days of dosing to&#xD;
      identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). During the second cohort an additional 6 treated&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled; all treated subjects in Cohort 2 will complete a second treatment&#xD;
      period with SYNB1618 in a cross-over design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 is an open-label, randomized sequence, crossover study of SYNB1934 that will be&#xD;
      initiated after determination and selection of a well-tolerated dose in Part 1. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive treatment with SYNB1934 with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), will complete a treatment&#xD;
      washout period, and receive SYNB1934 treatment without a PPI. Initially 16 HV male and female&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled with the option of expanding Part 2 up to 60 HV subjects.&#xD;

    <description>Toxicity is graded in accordance with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. Adverse events (AEs) are reported based on clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, and any other medically indicated assessments from the time informed consent is signed through the end of the safety follow-up period.&#xD;
AEs are considered to be treatment emergent (TEAE) if they occur or worsen in severity after the first dose of study treatment. TEAEs are considered treatment-related if relationship to study drug is possibly related, probably related, or definitely related.</description>
