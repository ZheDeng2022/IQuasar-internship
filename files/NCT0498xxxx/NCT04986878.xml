  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adductor canal block (ACB) has emerged as an option for postoperative regional analgesia in&#xD;
      patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Various approaches to the performance of peripheral nerve blocks for postoperative pain&#xD;
      control in patients undergoing TKA have been described in the literature. These approaches&#xD;
      include lumbar plexus block, femoral nerve block (FNB), with or without a sciatic nerve&#xD;
      block, and most recently the ACB. FNB is a commonly used modality for postoperative analgesia&#xD;
      after TKA. It is considered by some as the gold standard or the cornerstone of postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia after TKA. However, FNB reduces quadriceps muscle strength essential for&#xD;
      mobilization and active contribution in any physical rehabilitation program. Quadriceps&#xD;
      weakness places the patients at risk of falling. which may be detrimental to postoperative&#xD;
      recovery. The ACB has recently emerged as an appealing alternative to FNB as it is&#xD;
      predominately a sensory nerve block of a more distal branch of the femoral nerve ( the&#xD;
      saphenous nerve).&#xD;

    <description>Following sterile preparation and draping, an ultrasound survey of the medial thigh was performed, halfway between the superior anterior iliac spine and the patella. The superficial femoral artery has been identified beneath the sartorius muscle in a short-axis view, with the vein just inferior and the saphenous nerve just lateral to the artery. A 20 Gauge, 120 mm, non-cuttings tip echogenic needle (SonoPlex STIM, Germany) needle was introduced in-plane, and 2 to 3 mL of LA bolus (0.25 % Bupivacaine) was used to confirm proper needle placement in the adductor canal near the saphenous nerve. Then, a bolus of 20 ml of Bupivacaine 0.25 % was injected through the needle</description>
