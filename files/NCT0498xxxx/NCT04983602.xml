  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ED PLUS Emergency Department Discharge Physiotherapy Led Community Service is a pilot&#xD;
      feasibility randomized controlled trial investigating the role of an integrated care&#xD;
      intervention consisting of comprehensive geriatrics assessment in older adults in the&#xD;
      emergency department and a physiotherapy-led community based intervention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients who are aged 65 years and over will be screened using the Identification of&#xD;
      Seniors at Risk (ISAR) Tool in the emergency department of a University Teaching Hospital.&#xD;
      Those with a score of 2 or above in the ISAR and suitable for discharge home will be&#xD;
      randomised. The first treatment arm will undergo geriatric medicine item directed&#xD;
      Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) from admission to emergency department (ED). The&#xD;
      non-treatment arm will under usual patient care. The second treatment arm will undergo&#xD;
      geriatric medicine team directed CGA from admission to ED and a physiotherapy led community&#xD;
      based 6 week intervention in the patient's home. A dedicated multidisciplinary team of&#xD;
      geriatric medicine trainee, occupational therapist, physiotherapist and medical social worker&#xD;
      will carry out the assessment. For those randomised to the second treatment arm, a&#xD;
      physiotherapist will assess and carry out a 6 week interventions that arise from that&#xD;
      assessment and liaise with the patients General Practitioner (GP), medical social worker and&#xD;
      other health care professionals. The overall aims of ED PLUS are assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      the 6 week physiotherapy led intervention. Feasibility will be determined by the following&#xD;
      outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Recruitment rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Adherence rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) Acceptability of the programme&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv) Retention&#xD;
&#xD;
      v) Incidents&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims are to improve function, reduce anxiety and depression, improve quality of&#xD;
      life and prevent unnecessary ED admission.&#xD;

This process will be continued during the study and will be documented. The participants in this group will under baseline data collection prior to randomisation and follow up.</description>

The team (consisting of a geriatric specialist registrar, specialist geriatric nurse, senior pharmacist, senior physiotherapist, senior occupational therapist, and senior medical social worker) in both ED and AMAU will assess all participants in the intervention group and perform CGA. Potential participants will be approached regarding trial recruitment post ED triage thereby ensuring rapid assessment shortly after hospital arrival by the teams in both AMAU and in ED.</description>

The team in both ED and AMAU will assess all participants in the intervention group and perform CGA. Potential participants will be approached regarding trial recruitment post ED triage thereby ensuring rapid assessment shortly after hospital arrival by the teams in both AMAU and in ED. Additionally the participants in this arm will undergo a 6 week physiotherapy led intervention in the community involving 3 home visits and weekly telephone support. The intervention will involved assessment of the patients function in terms of strength, balance and mobility. Following assessment the intervention will be aimed at addressing deficits in the function of the participants, review of their medical management by a geriatrician trainee and focusing on self management of their own program.</description>
