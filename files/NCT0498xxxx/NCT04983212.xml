  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental implants are widely used in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients, but&#xD;
      the interaction between immune status and success of implant therapy, especially in such&#xD;
      patients, is not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to assess the prevalence of peri-implantitis in HIV-positive patients and to&#xD;
      evaluate the presence of a possible correlation between the immunological profile and&#xD;
      serological values of the same HIV-positive patients, of peri-implantitis, and of possible&#xD;
      differences between all-on-4 and single crown/bridge prostheses in terms of peri-implant&#xD;
      disease and the variables analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cross sectional study included 85 adult HIV-positive patients (394 implants) with at&#xD;
      least one dental implant loaded for more than a year who were followed for at least one year.&#xD;
      The patients were divided into patients with all-on-4 prosthesis and those with single&#xD;
      crowns/bridges to assess the differences between the two types of prostheses in the&#xD;
      inflammatory state, in the presence of mucositis and peri-implantitis, and in the variables&#xD;
      analyzed. The following clinical parameters were assessed: full-mouth plaque score (FMPS),&#xD;
      full-mouth bleeding score (FMBS), probing pocket depth (PPD) in six sites per implant and&#xD;
      tooth (deepest value for each implant and tooth was registered), PI and BoP measured as&#xD;
      presence/absence at six sites per implant and tooth, presence of suppuration, mobility&#xD;
      (measured by manual palpation) and number of lost teeth.&#xD;

      2.1 Study design This cross-sectional mono-centric observational study assessed the&#xD;
      prevalence of peri-implant disease in HIV-positive patients and was performed in accordance&#xD;
      with the Helsinki Declaration of Human Studies. All procedures were approved by the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of Vita-Salute San Raffaele University (on 15/7/2020 with number of protocol&#xD;
      &quot;PERIHIV&quot;-EC Reg. N. 10/INT/2020) in Milan, Italy. This study has been reported according to&#xD;
      the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines&#xD;
      and checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Patient sample Each patient was informed about all pertinent aspects of the study by the&#xD;
      investigator (LC), and an appropriate informed consent was obtained prior to the start of the&#xD;
      study. The study included 85 adult patients between 46.56 and 55.6 years (median 51.32 years)&#xD;
      with at least one dental implant and a total of 394 dental implants with a mean follow-up of&#xD;
      3 years (range from 2 years to 5 years). Demographic, clinical, and laboratory information of&#xD;
      the patients was collected and implant were positioned in the same Hospital in which patients&#xD;
      are in treating with antiretroviral therapy for the HIV-infection (Ville Turro Dental Clinic&#xD;
      of Vita-Salute San Raffaele University in Milan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Inclusion and exclusion criteria All patients (&gt;18 years old) who had undergone&#xD;
      prosthetic rehabilitation using one or more dental implants, with at least 1 year of&#xD;
      follow-up after loading, and who had returned for a maintenance appointment at the Ville&#xD;
      Turro Dental Clinic of Vita-Salute San Raffaele University in Milan. All patients were&#xD;
      undergoing antiretroviral therapy (ART) at the same hospital. Patients who discontinued&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy and patients not undergoing therapy, subjects with uncontrolled&#xD;
      systemic diseases (diabetes [HbA1c&gt;7]) or under treatment with any medications that may have&#xD;
      an effect on bone turnover and mucosal healing (steroids, bisphosphonate therapy ) were&#xD;
      excluded. Pregnancy or breastfeeding women were also excluded. All patients were included in&#xD;
      a maintenance oral hygiene program (every 4 months) and who discontinued the oral maintenance&#xD;
      (more than 1 appointment) were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 surgery procedure All implants were placed by two skilled implant surgeons; most of the&#xD;
      implants (328) were 3,8 mm diameter (83.2%), 46 were 3,3 mm (11.7%) and 20 were 4,5 mm&#xD;
      (5.1%). Implants were placed at level or slightly below the bone crest (1 mm) and in all&#xD;
      cases the complete bone healing was reached (at least 3 months) before implant loading. Bone&#xD;
      healing was assessed after at least 3 months of undisturbed healing, with periapical&#xD;
      radiographs and if confirmed, final impression was taken. For implant-supported single crown&#xD;
      and bridge, after final impression, definitive cemented single crown or bridge were achieved.&#xD;
      Only in cases of not adequate prosthetic space, with not sufficient abutment retention for&#xD;
      cemented prostheses, screw-retained prosthetic rehabilitations were made. Regarding the full&#xD;
      arch rehabilitations, the all-on-four protocol described by Malò were followed in all cases.&#xD;
      In addition the bone was leveled before implant placement using a rongeur and with the aid of&#xD;
      the carbide burs in order to form a flat bone plane in which place the implant. This allows&#xD;
      the elimination of the bone spicules, fractured bone and damaged buccal bone and the creation&#xD;
      of a flatbed in which was easy to insert the implants and achieve the prosthetic&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Two implants were placed in the posterior sectors (tilted) and two in the&#xD;
      anterior sector (straight) after the bone leveling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Clinical evaluation Data pertaining probing pocket depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BoP)&#xD;
      and plaque index (PI) around the implants and teeth of HIV-positive patients included in the&#xD;
      study were collected by probing implant and dental sulcus with a calibrated dental probe&#xD;
      (0,25 N)(Hawe Click-Probe®, KerrHawe SA, Switzerland) by one skilled operator (L.C.). The&#xD;
      following clinical parameters were assessed: full-mouth plaque score (FMPS), full-mouth&#xD;
      bleeding score (FMBS), probing pocket depth (PPD) in six sites per implant and tooth (deepest&#xD;
      value for each implant and tooth was registered), PI and BoP measured as presence/absence at&#xD;
      six sites per implant and tooth, presence of suppuration, mobility (measured by manual&#xD;
      palpation) and number of lost teeth. Demographic data and implant site characteristics were&#xD;
      checked in a specific case report form. For each HIV-positive patients, the following&#xD;
      information was reported: age, gender, smoking habit (number of cigarettes), number of dental&#xD;
      implants, health condition (i.e. diabetes presence), history of periodontitis and frequency&#xD;
      of maintenance (number of maintenance appointments in 1 year). Data relating to the&#xD;
      immunological and systemic profile of the patients (HIVRNA load, CD4+ level, CD8+ level,&#xD;
      hemoglobin level, platelet count) were collected through the database of the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each implant, the following data were collected: diameter, location, time in function,&#xD;
      type of prosthesis (crown/bridge or all-on-4). The patients were divided into two groups,&#xD;
      according to the type of prosthesis inserted after implant placement, to assess the&#xD;
      differences between the two types of prostheses in the inflammatory state, and therefore, in&#xD;
      the presence of mucositis and peri-implantitis as well as in the variables analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5 Radiologic examination and assessment of bone level When an implant showed BoP with or&#xD;
      without suppuration and/or PPD ≥ 3 mm after gentle probing, a periapical radiograph was taken&#xD;
      using the long-cone paralleling technique and using Rinn rings for the periapical images. The&#xD;
      position of the marginal bone was measured manually on ultra speed radiographic film (Ultra&#xD;
      speed, Kodak, USA) using a dental caliper (0 to 10 mm) and with the aid of 4.5X magnification&#xD;
      (EyeMag Pro F, Zeiss). The distance to the marginal bone was measured at the mesial and&#xD;
      distal aspects of the implants to the adjacent bone. The implant platform was used as&#xD;
      reference for the measurements. Two vertical lines were drawn parallel to the vertical line&#xD;
      crossing the centre of the implant. The largest value was recorded. Assessments were&#xD;
      performed by one investigator (PC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6 Case definitions for peri-implant conditions The criteria described in 2017 in&#xD;
      Periodontology World Workshop by Renvert (2018) were used for peri-implant disease diagnosis:&#xD;
      Peri-implant mucositis was diagnoses in presence of visual inspection demonstrating the&#xD;
      presence of peri-implant signs of inflammation, presence of profuse bleeding and/or&#xD;
      suppuration on probing; an increase in probing depths compared to baseline and absence of&#xD;
      bone loss in relation to the baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peri-implantitis was diagnoses in presence of bleeding on probing and/or suppuration,&#xD;
      increasing probing pocket depths as compared to measurements obtained at placement of the&#xD;
      supra-structure and progressive bone loss in relation to the radiographic bone level&#xD;
      assessment at 1 year following the delivery of the implant-supported prosthetics&#xD;
      reconstruction. In the absence of initial radiographs and probing depths, radiographic&#xD;
      evidence of bone levels ≥ 3 mm apical of the most coronal portion of the intra-osseous part&#xD;
      of the implant and/or probing depths ≥6 mm in conjunction with profuse bleeding were used for&#xD;
      the diagnosis. Gentle probing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.7 Case definitions for history of periodontitis The criteria described in 2017 in&#xD;
      Periodontology World Workshop by Tonetti (2018) were used for history of periodontitis&#xD;
      diagnosis: Presence of periodontitis was detected as clinical attachment loss (CAL) with&#xD;
      reference to the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) not ascribed to non-periodontal causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Interdental CAL detectable at ≥ 2 non-adjacent teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Buccal or oral CAL ≥3 mm with pocketing &gt;3 mm detectable at ≥2 teeth CAL was assessed&#xD;
           with the periodontal probing or with direct visualization to detect the CEJ. Moreover to&#xD;
           confirm the CAL periapical radiographs and/or rx OPT were used.&#xD;
