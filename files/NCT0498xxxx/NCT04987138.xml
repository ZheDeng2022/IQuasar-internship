      Prospective, multi-center, multinational, 2:1 randomized, single-blinded, controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial of the Zenflow Spring System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the treatment group will undergo Zenflow Spring placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the control group will undergo a Sham procedure. Patients and site&#xD;
      personnel administering follow-up assessments will be blinded to the randomized treatment&#xD;
      through completion of the 3-month follow-up visit. Once a patient has completed their 3-month&#xD;
      follow-up assessments, they will be unblinded. Following unblinding, patients who received a&#xD;
      Sham procedure may elect to receive treatment with the Zenflow Spring System or alternatively&#xD;
      they may exit the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of study participation is 60 months for patients who receive a Spring Implant&#xD;
      and 3 months for subjects in the Control Arm.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The patient and site personnel administering follow-up assessments to 3 months will be blinded to the study assignment. Unblinding will occur at 3 months post procedure after follow-up assessments are completed.&#xD;
All patients will be asked post-treatment if they believe they are in the Treatment Arm, Control Arm, or do not know. The blinding questionnaire will be administered at discharge and at the 1-month and 3-month follow-up assessments.&#xD;
Control Arm patients can receive treatment with the Zenflow Spring System within 30 days after their 3-month follow-up assessments are completed, and their symptoms warrant treatment and enrollment criteria are met.</masking_description>

    <description>The Zenflow Spring Implant is an electropolished and passivated nickel titanium alloy (nitinol) implant. The implant is constructed from a single wire strand formed into ring elements connected by spine sections. There are four sizes of implants ranging from 16 mm to 24 mm in length and 14 mm to 16 mm in diameter to implant in the subject's prostatic urethra. The implant is placed in the urethra using a custom delivery catheter and cystoscope (Spring Scope). The implant is intended to be permanent but can be removed if necessary.</description>

    <description>A18 Fr Foley Catheter is placed into the patient's bladder. To mimic the Treatment Arm procedure, the Foley Catheter balloon will be inflated in the bladder. Once inflated, slight tension will be applied against the subject's bladder neck. While tension is being applied the site staff will follow a script to simulate the Zenflow procedural steps. Additionally, devices will be used to produce mock deployment sounds of the Zenflow procedure. Once complete, the balloon will be deflated and the catheter will be removed, completing the procedure.</description>
