  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the heart rhythm disorder Atrial Fibrillation (AF) affects 2% of the population, the&#xD;
      impact it has on an effected individual can be highly variable. Some people are asymptomatic&#xD;
      whilst others can experience debilitating symptoms or heart failure (HF)- weakness of the&#xD;
      heart muscle. The reason why this variability exists in unknown and how AF actually drives HF&#xD;
      is unclear. HF can also be caused by many other reasons and it can be difficult to identify&#xD;
      those patients with HF caused by AF versus patients with AF but their HF is due to a&#xD;
      different reason. This is important as it would help us to identify those patients most&#xD;
      likely to improve their heart function after the treatment of AF and thus gain more from&#xD;
      invasive treatments like AF catheter ablation; which is effective at restoring normal heart&#xD;
      rhythm but has some risks attached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators suspect the characteristics of the AF, such as how irregularly it makes the&#xD;
      heartbeat, can be used to predict who will respond better. Studies of heart cells in the lab&#xD;
      as well as animal models have suggested this characteristic may be the cause of AF-induced&#xD;
      heart muscle weakness and reduce cardiac output, making it a potential predictor that can be&#xD;
      measured. Other potential predictors will be measured during pre-procedural scans and tests&#xD;
      too. The investigators will also explore whether there are predictors of which patients gain&#xD;
      the most symptomatic benefit and gain insight into why some people develop symptoms of AF,&#xD;
      whereas others do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By studying the structural and functional sequelae of catheter ablation in patients with HF&#xD;
      the investigators hope to better understand the relationship between the two diseases.&#xD;

    <description>Assessment of HRV shall be performed in all enrolled patients. Ventricular HRV will be derived from a continuous 24-hour period of a 48-hour ambulatory Holter recording during AF. Participants will be requested to avoid alcohol and caffeine from 24-hours prior to fitting and any activity more strenuous than walking for the recording duration. After initial fitting, a 20-minute high-resolution ECG recording will be performed lying supine at rest.</description>
