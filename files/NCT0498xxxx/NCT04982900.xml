      This study is a multi-center, prospective, double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
      The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EGFR-TKI on residual GGOs after surgery&#xD;
      in patients with multiple primary lung cancers with ground glass nodules. This study is&#xD;
      expected to prove that compared with placebo in the control group, EGFR-TKI can significantly&#xD;
      reduce the residual GGOs lesions in patients with EGFR-positive multiple primary lung cancers&#xD;
      with ground-glass opacity, and bring a higher objective response rate (ORR), thus provides&#xD;
      new insights for treatment of these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of the most deadly malignant tumors in the world. It is estimated that&#xD;
      0.2-20% of lung cancer patients have multiple primary lung cancers at the time of diagnosis,&#xD;
      and many of them present with multiple ground glass opacities. The surgical method for such&#xD;
      multiple lesions depends on their number, anatomical location and size, as well as the age&#xD;
      and pulmonary function of the patient. It is easily affected by the subjective judgment of&#xD;
      the surgeon. Besides, many of these patients develop multiple lesions that cannot be resected&#xD;
      at the same time, and there haven't been established a standard therapy for residual GGO&#xD;
      lesions after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, EGFR-TKI is&#xD;
      recommended for the adjuvant treatment of stage IB-ⅢA NSCLC with EGFR mutations. However, it&#xD;
      is not clear whether EGFR-TKI is effective for multiple primary lung cancers or the residual&#xD;
      GGOs after surgical resection of the EGFR mutation positive main cancers. At present, there&#xD;
      have been retrospective studies showing that application of EGFR-TKIs targeted therapy can&#xD;
      significantly reduce the diameter of residual GGOs after surgery resection of EGFR&#xD;
      mutation-positive primary lesions for MPLC patients, and reduce the secondary surgery caused&#xD;
      by the progression of the lesion. However, there is no prospective Studies confirming the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of EGFR-TKI on these postoperative residual GGOs lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a multi-center, prospective, double-blind, comparative clinical research. This&#xD;
      study plans to enroll 138 patients with multiple primary lung cancers (cTis-T1c, N0, M0) that&#xD;
      manifest GGO and cannot be resected at the same time, patients should have undergone surgical&#xD;
      resection of the EGFR mutated main lesion, and have no less than 1 GGO lesion remaining after&#xD;
      surgery. Eligible patients will be randomly divided into the treatment group (receiving&#xD;
      furmonertinib mesilate tablets) or control group (placebo) at a ratio of 1:1. The grouping&#xD;
      process was strictly double-blind for both the investigators and subjects. By collecting the&#xD;
      relevant data of patients' baseline images, pathology, and follow-up images during treatment,&#xD;
      statistical analysis is used to evaluate the effectiveness (response rate, objective&#xD;
      remission rate), safety, and relevant influencing factors (including CTR value of the main&#xD;
      lesion, number of residual lesions, diameter of the largest residual lesion, higher stage of&#xD;
      the main lesion, residual lesion's density, etc.) of EGFR-TKI treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is expected to prove that compared with the placebo in the control group, EGFR-TKI&#xD;
      can significantly reduce the diameter of residual GGO lesions in patients with EGFR-positive&#xD;
      multiple primary lung cancers with ground-glass density, and bring a higher objective&#xD;
      response rate (ORR) but did not significantly increase the incidence of adverse effects.&#xD;

    <description>AST2818 is an irreversible and highly selective EGFR inhibitor independently discovered and developed by Allist. It has the potential to become the best-in-class drug in the third-generation EGFR-TKIs. Data from the preclinical studies and the completed clinical studies show that AST2818 has the following advantages: 1) AST2818 has good target selectivity and tissue distribution specificity; 2) The objective response rate of AST2818 for the patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR T790M mutation is outstanding, reaching 74.1% in the key registration clinical study; 3) AST2818 has a good safety profile and is well-tolerated; 4) AST2818 and its active metabolites have a superior ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and have a good therapeutic efficacy on brain metastases frequently seen in patients with NSCLC.</description>
