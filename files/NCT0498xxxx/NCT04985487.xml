  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will collect safety information and evaluate effectiveness in patients who&#xD;
      are prescribed Beovu ® Injection, Beovu ®Prefilled Syringe (brolucizumab) in the approved&#xD;
      indication after receiving informed consent over a period of 12 weeks. In addition,&#xD;
      longer-term data (24 weeks, optionally 36 weeks) will be collected.&#xD;

    <measure>Proportion of patients gaining or losing more than 15 letters on the ETDRS chart</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12, week 24, optionally week 36</time_frame>
    <description>The ETDRS chart has been introduced as a standardized visual acuity (VA) testing chart. It uses 14 lines of 5 Sloan letter optotypes in each line in logarithmic progression. The space between lines and letters is proportionally equal keeping the effect of contour interaction constant. The threshold VA corresponds to the line in which 3 out of 5 optotypes were correctly identified. Alternatively, a by-letter scoring system (-0.02 logMAR credited for each letter correctly read) can be used. The testing distance can be varied; the corresponding visual acuity can be read easily from the chart. The chart is mounted on a box that is backlit by fluorescent tubes. For repeated measurements, the chart itself can be exchanged, providing different letters for different eyes.</description>
