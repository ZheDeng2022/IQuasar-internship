      This study is an open and observational phase Ⅲ follow-up clinical trial based on the&#xD;
      previous Phase III clinical trial of Sabin Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine.The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the immunity persistence of SIPV in infants after 4 doses of&#xD;
      vaccination.A total of 450 subjects who have received 4 doses of the experimental vaccine or&#xD;
      control vaccine will be enrolled,about 3.0ml of venous blood will be collected from each&#xD;
      enrolled subject at the age of 4 years (48 to 54 months) and 5 years (78 to 84 months) after&#xD;
      the last vaccination, respectively,and the serum will be separated for neutralizing antibody&#xD;
      detection.The antibody levels of the experimental vaccine group and the control vaccine group&#xD;
      will be compared to evaluate the immunity persistence of SIPV.&#xD;

      The serum samples of this study will be only used for neutralizing antibody detection to&#xD;
      evaluate immune persistence, and the use of other studies requires the consent of the&#xD;
      subject's guardian and the approval of the ethics committee. Except for the serum submitted&#xD;
      for testing, the remaining serum will be stored at the study site until the end of the study,&#xD;
