  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effects of beetroot juice supplements on lower-limb strength&#xD;
      and muscular endurance in physically active women, due to the presence of NO3- in beetroot&#xD;
      juice.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Beetroot juice (BJR) is used as an ergogenic aid, but no study has analyzed its' effects on&#xD;
      explosive force production in physically active women. It has been proposed that females&#xD;
      could blunt reduction of NO2- to NO based on a higher oxidative skeletal muscle phenotype&#xD;
      than males. However, it has been observed a higher increase on plasma NO2- levels after&#xD;
      supplementation compared to and a greater enhancement on muscle contractile function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the absence of any study that has analyzed the effect of NO3- supplements on jump&#xD;
      ability and power production on weightlifting on female population; the purpose of this study&#xD;
      will be to investigate the possible ergogenic effect of BJR on physically active women on&#xD;
      explosive force production and muscular endurance in a lower-limb body weightlifting&#xD;
      protocol, due to the presence of NO3- in BJR and its effects.&#xD;
