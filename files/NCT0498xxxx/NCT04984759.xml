  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year almost a million infants are born small for gestational age due to malaria&#xD;
      infection in pregnancy. These infants are at risk for stillbirth or neonatal death, and being&#xD;
      born too small predisposes the survivors to increased metabolic diseases later in life.&#xD;
      Plasmodium vivax (PV) is the second most common malaria species globally. Its relapsing&#xD;
      nature results in multiple episodes of PV in a single pregnancy, compounding growth&#xD;
      restriction and stillbirth risk. Women with PV in one pregnancy may harbor dormant parasites&#xD;
      (hypnozoites) in their liver the cause illness and poor fetal growth in a subsequent&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only radical cure with 8-aminoquinolines (8AQ)- primaquine (PMQ) or tafenoquine (TQ) - can&#xD;
      eliminate hypnozoites, but these drugs are contraindicated in pregnancy. The postpartum&#xD;
      period presents a key window of opportunity for giving radical cure to women of childbearing&#xD;
      age with PV. Pharmacokinetic data is needed to support safe use of these drugs postpartum and&#xD;
      World Health Organization has identified pharmacokinetic studies of 8AQ in lactation as a&#xD;
      research priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primaquine is excreted minimally in mature breast milk, at &lt;1% of the weight-adjusted&#xD;
      relative infant dose (RID). As the main adverse event associated with both 8AQ - hemolysis&#xD;
      glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient individuals - is dose-dependent and&#xD;
      negligible at low doses, this finding strongly supports its safe use in later lactation. This&#xD;
      study is needed to determine if primaquine can also be given safely in the early postpartum&#xD;
      period. There is no published data on tafenoquine excretion in breastmilk, and this study&#xD;
      would quantify safety throughout early and late lactation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug safety studies in lactation are essential to ensure medications are not denied and&#xD;
      unnecessary interruption of breastfeeding is avoided. Demonstration of safety of radical cure&#xD;
      for breastfeeding women in the postpartum period would allow women with PV in pregnancy and&#xD;
      lactation to receive 8AQ after delivery, preventing illnesses in the postpartum period and&#xD;
      subsequent pregnancies. Improved uptake of radical cure through elimination of unnecessary&#xD;
      contraindications supports malaria elimination and community health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to characterize the transfer of tafenoquine and primaquine&#xD;
      in breast milk of mothers receiving radical cure doses of 8AQ throughout the different phases&#xD;
      of lactation - colostrum, transitional milk, and mature milk - in order to determine the&#xD;
      degree of infant exposure.&#xD;

      The study will take place at clinics of the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit (SMRU),&#xD;
      Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Tak Province, Thailand. The clinics serve a&#xD;
      population of migrant workers resident along the Thailand-Myanmar border. Non-pregnant&#xD;
      breastfeeding women that access care at SMRU (postnatal care, outpatient, vaccine and routine&#xD;
      baby care departments) will be invited to participate with their breastfed children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All lactating women and their children will be G6PD phenotypically normal. Participants will&#xD;
      be enrolled as follows; Arm 1: Primaquine mother-neonate pairs Arm 2: Tafenoquine&#xD;
      mother-child pairs Arm 3: Tafenoquine mother-neonate pairs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic sampling plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PMQ pharmacokinetic sampling (Mother/Neonate pairs - Arm 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mothers: Dense pharmacokinetic venous blood and breast milk sampling will be&#xD;
                performed during day 1 and 14; one sample of blood and breast milk will collected&#xD;
                at a single timepoint on days 3, 5 and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Neonate: One capillary blood sample will be collected on the same days as maternal&#xD;
                sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TQ pharmacokinetic sampling (Mother/child pairs - Arms 2, and 3):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mothers: Dense pharmacokinetic venous blood and breast milk sampling will be&#xD;
                performed during the first day after dosing, followed by one sample of blood and&#xD;
                breast milk at a single time point on days 2, 3, 8, 15, 29, 43 and 75 (allowing a&#xD;
                description of approximately 95% of the total drug exposure).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Child: One capillary blood sample will be collected on the same days as maternal&#xD;
                sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers and children will be closely monitored for safety throughout the 75 day follow up&#xD;
      period including regular assessments of adverse events, Hb, Hct and MetHb levels.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic drug measurements of primaquine, carboxyprimaquine and tafenoquine will be&#xD;
      performed at the Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine&#xD;
      Research Unit (MORU), Bangkok, Thailand. Drug concentrations will be quantified by liquid&#xD;
      chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Interim data review will be&#xD;
      done by an external drug safety monitoring board (DSMB) before recruitment of Arm 3. The&#xD;
      board will review safety data and any available PK data. If PK data is not yet available and&#xD;
      there are safety concerns, recruitment in Arm 3 may be suspended until PK data from Arms 1&#xD;
      and 2 are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants with any adverse events will be followed until the event has stabilized or&#xD;
      resolved (unless the participant refuses such follow up care). Free care will be offered&#xD;
      through SMRU clinics. For severe harm caused by study procedures following this protocol,&#xD;
      Oxford University insurance will support additional health care beyond SMRU's capacity.&#xD;
