  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking to learn more about future menstrual bleeding in women who have&#xD;
      started using intrauterine contraception methods. &quot;Intrauterine contraception&quot; means that a&#xD;
      device is inserted into a woman's uterus by her doctor. The device then releases a birth&#xD;
      control treatment into the uterus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers have found that when women use intrauterine contraception, its effects on the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle can cause changes to how often and for how long women will bleed. This is one&#xD;
      of the main reasons women may stop using their intrauterine contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, the researchers in this study wanted to learn about a tool that can be used to predict&#xD;
      future bleeding events. This tool was developed based on the results of previous clinical&#xD;
      studies that researched menstrual bleeding. This tool is a smartphone application called&#xD;
      MyIUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include about 3,000 women who have recently had intrauterine contraception&#xD;
      inserted and who use the MyIUS app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no visits with a study doctor in this study. After the intrauterine&#xD;
      contraception has been inserted, the women will start to record any events of bleeding in the&#xD;
      MyIUS app. After they have recorded events of bleeding for a total of 90 days, the MyIUS app&#xD;
      will give a prediction of menstrual bleeding expected for the next 180 days. The women who&#xD;
      sign the electronic informed consent form will continue to record their bleeding events for a&#xD;
      total of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will then collect this information. They will use this information to find&#xD;
      out how well the MyIUS app can predict future menstrual bleeding.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to demonstrate that the bleeding prediction algorithm which was&#xD;
      developed and validated based on clinical trial data also works in a real-world setting.&#xD;
