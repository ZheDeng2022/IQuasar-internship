      This is an open-label, single-arm, multi-center„ÄÅnon-interventional real-world study, which&#xD;
      evaluate treatment pattern, safety and efficacy of Niraparib as first-line maintenance&#xD;
      treatment for Chinese patient with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer , fallopian tube cancer,&#xD;
      and primary peritoneal cancer in real world clinical practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 300 patients will be enrolled. Eligible patients will be those with&#xD;
      histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer, carcinoma of fallopian tube or primary&#xD;
      peritoneal carcinoma. Patients must have received one line of platinum-based chemotherapy,&#xD;
      and be in clinically complete or partial response following the platinum-based chemotherapy&#xD;
      prior to enrollment in the study. Patients will be treated with Niraparib according to the&#xD;
      physician's judgement till disease progression, discontinuation for other reasons or death.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is treatment pattern of Niraparib as first-line maintenance treatment&#xD;
      for ovarian cancer patients. The second endpoints include AE, PFS and quality of life.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-5L is a well-validated, general preference-based, health-related QoL instrument. The EQ-5D-5L encompasses 5 domains, asking patients to rate their perceived health state today on the following dimensions: Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort, and Anxiety/Depression. Each domain has 5 possible levels: &quot;no problems&quot; (Level 1), &quot;slight problems&quot; (Level 2), &quot;moderate problems&quot; (Level 3), &quot;severe problems&quot; (Level 4), and &quot;extreme problems&quot; (Level 5). Each domain is assigned a level, and levels are combined to create a 5-digit number describing the patient's health state. For each patient, an index value is determined from a published country-specific value set. This index value or utility score ranges from 0 to 1.00 (with 1.0 representing perfect health) and is used in the calculation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) that are used to inform economic valuations of health interventions. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
