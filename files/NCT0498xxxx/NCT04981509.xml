      This phase II trial studies the effects of combination therapy with bevacizumab, erlotinib,&#xD;
      and atezolizumab in treating patients with hereditary leiomyomatosis and kidney cancer that&#xD;
      has spread to other places in the body (advanced). Bevacizumab is in a class of medications&#xD;
      called antiangiogenic agents. They work by stopping the formation of blood vessels that bring&#xD;
      oxygen and nutrients to tumors. This may slow the growth and spread of tumors. Erlotinib is&#xD;
      in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of a&#xD;
      protein called EGFR that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread&#xD;
      of cancer cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Combination therapy with bevacizumab, erlotinib, and atezolizumab may&#xD;
      stabilize or shrink advanced hereditary leiomyomatosis and kidney cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the complete response (CR) rate according to standard Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) in patients with 1) advanced renal cell&#xD;
      cancer (RCC) associated with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) and 2)&#xD;
      advanced sporadic/non-HLRCC papillary renal cell cancer treated with a combination of&#xD;
      bevacizumab, erlotinib, and atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of bevacizumab, erlotinib, and&#xD;
      atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) as complete response (CR) + partial&#xD;
      response (PR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine disease control rate (DCR) - confirmed response, or stable disease (SD)&#xD;
      lasting for at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess progression-free survival time (PFS) according to RECIST 1.1. V. To assess&#xD;
      overall survival (OS). VI. To assess the duration of response. VII. To assess response to&#xD;
      treatment using immune-modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate immunologic modulation associated with the administered treatment regimen,&#xD;
      including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. Peripheral immune subset analysis before and on treatment. Ib. Evaluation of relevant&#xD;
      soluble factors before and on treatment. (e.g., cytokine profiles) Ic. Tumor tissue immune&#xD;
      infiltration cells before and after treatment (immune microenvironment, CD8/CD4/CD3 cells,&#xD;
      T-Cell receptor clonality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Id. Evaluation of tissue PDL1/PD1 expression and their correlation with outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess specific genomic alterations (including FH, NRF2 pathway) and determine if&#xD;
      there is a correlation with clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes and atezolizumab IV over&#xD;
      30-90 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Patients also receive erlotinib orally (PO) once daily&#xD;
      (QD) on days 1-21 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because study drugs may have the potential&#xD;
             for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential&#xD;
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             study drugs, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with study&#xD;

             (fluoroquinolone antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and norfloxacin;&#xD;
