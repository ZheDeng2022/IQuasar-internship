    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to use a clinical micro-ultrasound to systematically image the&#xD;
      prostate before biopsy or surgery. The images from the ultrasound system will be saved and&#xD;
      compared to other imaging modalities and pathology in order to develop better tools.&#xD;

    <description>Perform a detailed pathologic and imaging correlation between findings on micro-ultrasound, MRI and final surgical histopathology in men who undergo prostatectomy. For prostatectomy specimens, Dice score will be computed, comparing the pixel-wise labels from the annotated pathology specimen to the annotations on multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and micro-ultrasound (this is a unit-less coefficient).Hausdorff Distance, which will give us the greatest distance between the overlapping lesions, with units in millimeters will be reported</description>

    <description>EV29L transducer will be inserted in the subject's rectum. Cine sweeps will be performed to save images of:&#xD;
The entire prostate from posterior to anterior (may require 2 sweeps to cover base and apex)&#xD;
The peripheral zone using the highest zoom setting (30mm depth) on the system (may require 2 sweeps to cover base and apex). Analysis of these images will be performed after surgery but before prostatectomy</description>
