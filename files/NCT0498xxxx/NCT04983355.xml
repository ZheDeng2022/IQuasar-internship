  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This interventional, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of a dietary supplementation of a fish hydrolysate Peptidyss on sleep&#xD;
      quality and anxiety.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 44 healthy participants (n=22 female, n=22 male) aged 35-60 years inclusive are&#xD;
      included into the study, in a cross-over design. The participants will take both products,&#xD;
      the fish hydrolysate Peptidyss and the placebo during a period of 4 weeks per product. The&#xD;
      total duration of the study per participant is 127 days. The study visits are defined as&#xD;
      Screening Visit and Study Inclusion (V0), Pre-Intervention-1-Visit (V1),&#xD;
      Post-Intervention-1-Visit (V2), Follow-up-Intervention-1-Visit / Pre-Intervention-2-Visit&#xD;
      (V3), Post-Intervention-2-Visit (V4) and Follow-up-Intervention-2-Visit (V5). The 4 weeks&#xD;
      between V2 and V3 will serve as a washout phase between Intervention-1 and Intervention-2. No&#xD;
      further follow-up visit is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of Peptidyss® on sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of Peptidyss® on sleep quality,&#xD;
      anxiety, perceived stress and quality of life.&#xD;
