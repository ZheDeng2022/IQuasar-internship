  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of smoking in the homeless population (70%) is over 4 times that of the&#xD;
      general population (15%). Homeless adults have not experienced similar declines in tobacco&#xD;
      use as the general population has over the past three decades. Homeless adults are interested&#xD;
      in smoking cessation and make quit attempts, but are less successful in quitting smoking than&#xD;
      the general population. Trials of group behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy for smoking&#xD;
      cessation have not led to substantial long-term abstinence (i.e., abstinence for 6 months or&#xD;
      more), suggesting that these interventions alone are insufficient to improve quit rates among&#xD;
      homeless adults. Many homeless adults seek health care in safety net clinics; these clinics&#xD;
      could bring cessation interventions to scale. Contingency management is a powerful behavior&#xD;
      change intervention that reinforces positive health behaviors through the provision of modest&#xD;
      incentives (e.g., cash). In this pilot randomized controlled trial, the investigator will&#xD;
      test the feasibility and acceptability of a contingency management intervention that provides&#xD;
      incentives for smoking cessation for people experiencing homelessness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT), the investigator will (1) adapt a&#xD;
      known-efficacious extended CM cessation intervention to a novel population and setting, with&#xD;
      the ultimate goal of increasing long-term abstinence among homeless adults seeking care in&#xD;
      safety net health clinics, (2) develop a corresponding RCT protocol, and (3) conduct a pilot&#xD;
      RCT to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the RCT. If the pilot RCT is feasible and&#xD;
      acceptable, the investigator will test the adapted intervention in a subsequently-funded,&#xD;
      full-scale RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess feasibility and acceptability of a CM intervention through:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measuring biochemically-verified point prevalence abstinence at 6 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measuring participant adherence to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Gathering information on the number of visits attended.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assessing the retention protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess feasibility and acceptability of a CM intervention through:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Biochemically-verified 7-day point months follow-up at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prolonged abstinence at 3 months and 6 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Point-prevalent abstinence at 12 months&#xD;
