  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, prospective, genotype-match controlled for primary estimand, non&#xD;
      randomized, multicenter, international Phase 2 clinical trial designed to investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of ER004 administered intraamniotically as a treatment for unborn XLHED&#xD;
      male subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (XLHED) is a rare developmental disease affecting&#xD;
      body parts derived from the embryonal ectoderm. It is caused by a broad spectrum of mutations&#xD;
      in the ectodysplasin A gene (EDA). The main symptoms of XLHED are hypo- or anhidrosis, oligo-&#xD;
      or anodontia, and hypotrichosis. Current treatment options are limited to the management of&#xD;
      disease symptoms and prevention of complications. Effective corrective treatment for XLHED&#xD;
      remains a high unmet medical need. ER004 represents a first-in-class signaling protein&#xD;
      replacement molecule designed for specific, high affinity binding to the endogenous EDA1&#xD;
      receptor (EDAR). The proposed mechanism of action of ER004 is the replacement of the missing&#xD;
      EDA1 protein in patients with XLHED. The aim of this prospective, open-label, genotype-match&#xD;
      controlled, multicenter Phase 2 trial is to confirm the efficacy and safety results for ER004&#xD;
      administered intra-amniotically in a larger cohort of subjects. The target population will&#xD;
      consist of male XLHED fetuses/subjects with EDA mutation confirmed by genetic diagnosis of a&#xD;
      mutation in one of the maternal EDA alleles and ultrasonographic diagnosis of a significantly&#xD;
      reduced number of fetal tooth germs, or by documented direct genetic diagnosis of a&#xD;
      hemizygous EDA mutation. In the main study phase, efficacy and safety of the treated subjects&#xD;
      will be assessed up to 6 months of age and safety of the mothers will be assessed up to 1&#xD;
      month after delivery of the child. In long-term follow-up phase, efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      treated subjects will be assessed up to 5 years of age. Treated subjects sweating ability&#xD;
      will be compared to an untreated relative from his family, when available, or from a matched&#xD;
      controlled subject from a previous natural history.&#xD;

          -  For fetal Subject : Second major anatomic anomaly (not related to the underlying&#xD;
             XLHED) that contributes to a significant morbidity or mortality risk, or&#xD;
             echocardiogram or ultrasonography or other findings that indicate a high risk of fetal&#xD;
             demise or risk of preterm birth. Any condition other than XLHED that is likely to have&#xD;
             an impact on the number of tooth germs. Any other medical condition which in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator would not allow for safe conduct of the study for the&#xD;
