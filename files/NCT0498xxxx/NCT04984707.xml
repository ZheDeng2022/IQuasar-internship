      The study is a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel Group, Dose Escalation&#xD;
      Study in Healthy Male Subjects with Androgenetic Alopecia to Evaluate the Safety,&#xD;
      Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of KX-826 Following Topical Single Ascending Dose&#xD;
      Administration&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 40 subjects will be evaluated with 32 subjects randomized to receive active drug&#xD;
      and 8 subjects randomized to receive placebo in a double-blind fashion (ten subjects in each&#xD;
      dose cohort with two subjects randomized to placebo for total of four dose cohorts).Subjects&#xD;
      were to be assigned to 1 of the 4 dose levels, 3 mg. 12 mg, 48 mg and 96 mg of KX-826 or&#xD;
      placebo to match the active product, administered as a topical application.&#xD;
