  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, double-blind, Phase 1/2a&#xD;
      clinical study to investigate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and exploratory&#xD;
      efficacy of a vaccine regimen consisting of an Ad26.Mos4.HIV prime and a boost with Modified&#xD;
      Vaccinia Ankara (MVA)-BN-HIV in combination with broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAb)&#xD;
      PGT121, PGDM1400, and VRC07-523LS in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected&#xD;
      study participants on suppressive anti-retroviral therapy (ART).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 36 adults randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 3 groups (vaccines+ bNAbs,&#xD;
      vaccine+placebo, placebo+bNAbs), respectively. The study population will include HIV-infected&#xD;
      adults who are on suppressive ART for at least 48 weeks prior to screening. The study&#xD;
      comprises of a screening period of 10 weeks (Stage 0), a 24-week vaccination and follow-up&#xD;
      period (Stage 1), a 4-week bNAb administration period and a 20-week bNAb washout period&#xD;
      (Stage 2), and a 24-week monitoring period (Stage 3). An analytical antiretroviral treatment&#xD;
      interruption (ATI) to assess rates of sustained virologic suppression will be conducted&#xD;
      during Stages 2-3. Participants will record solicited signs and symptoms in a diary on the&#xD;
      evening after each study drug administration and then daily for the next 7 days. Further&#xD;
      safety evaluations will include monitoring of AEs, physical examinations, vital sign&#xD;
      measurements, clinical laboratory tests (including urinalysis, CD4 count and HIV RNA), and&#xD;
      for women, also pregnancy testing. Blood samples will be taken at specific clinic visits to&#xD;
      assess immune and virologic responses as well as the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of&#xD;
      bNAbs.&#xD;
