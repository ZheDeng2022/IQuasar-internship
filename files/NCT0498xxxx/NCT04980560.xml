  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the association between gut microbiota composition and the&#xD;
      magnitude and duration of immune response in subjects who have received different COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccines in Hong Kong and to identify the differences compared to those COVID-19 recovered&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, emerged as a new zoonotic pathogen of humans at the end of&#xD;
      2019 and rapidly developed into a global pandemic in March 2020. Over 106 million COVID-19&#xD;
      cases including 2.3 million deaths have been reported to the WHO as of February 9th 2021.&#xD;
      Overall 80% of cases are mild/moderate or asymptomatic while 20% may develop severe or&#xD;
      critical disease with respiratory failure requiring oxygen support and intensive care. As of&#xD;
      16 February 2021, 10789 cases have been confirmed in HK with 193 deaths while 10231 patients&#xD;
      have been discharged from acute public hospitals with a mean length of stay of 15 days. Up to&#xD;
      16 Feb., 2021, there were 568 patients with COVID-19 have been managed at the Prince of Wales&#xD;
      Hospital (PWH) with 12 deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies showed that the quality of life of the patients who have recovered from COVID-19 was&#xD;
      impaired. This situation is similar to some patients who suffered from SARS-CoV1 infection in&#xD;
      2003.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natural infection by virus triggers an effective system immunity so that the host can resist&#xD;
      or highly reduce the chance of re-infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many cases, this protection can maintain a long period of time. On the other hand,&#xD;
      vaccination, which aims to induce the similar immunity but in a controlled manner, presents&#xD;
      only selected antigen(s) to the host through different delivery strategies. Lacking a normal&#xD;
      virus replication cycle, vaccination can only partially mimic the infection process that&#xD;
      makes the immunogenicity or durability of the vaccines sometimes not as effective as natural&#xD;
      infection. This situation was also observed during the development of SARS and MERS vaccines.&#xD;
      A number of studies focused on examining the humoral and cellular immunities from the&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients during their acute stage or only few months after recovery. However, the&#xD;
      long-term immunities (over a year) from the patients are not yet very clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HKSAR government has procured 2 different types of COVID-19 vaccines for all the HK&#xD;
      citizens that is one of the few regions/countries adopt this strategy. BioNTech mRNA&#xD;
      vaccination programme will commence in early March 2021 and Sinovac inactivated whole virus&#xD;
      vaccine will also be available soon for vaccination after formal approval recently. All these&#xD;
      vaccines are so far only evaluated at their own designated population and countries and there&#xD;
      is still lack of prospective study to &quot;side-by-side&quot; comparing the microbial biomarkers in&#xD;
      the stool of different vaccines. Having different vaccines which will soon be available in&#xD;
      Hong Kong, it would be of great interest to investigate and compare the microbial biomarkers&#xD;
      in the stool of recovered COVID-19 patients versus those who have received different COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccines by setting up a 2-year longitudinal study.&#xD;
