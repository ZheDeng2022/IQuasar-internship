  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patients with unilateral and bilateral cleft lip and palate received alveolar bone graft&#xD;
      surgery. Two time points of cone beam CT were taken for all the patients: post-operative 6&#xD;
      months, and post-operative 2 years. All the CT images were reviewed for the analysis of&#xD;
      grafted bone density.&#xD;

      Patient Information and Data Collection Patients who had nonsyndromic unilateral or bilateral&#xD;
      cleft lip and alveolus with or without cleft palate and received ABG at our center between&#xD;
      2016 and 2018 were enrolled. All patients underwent at least 2 CBCT scans after operation.&#xD;
      Postoperative image acquisition was performed at two time points, namely 6 months (T1) and 2&#xD;
      years (T2) after ABG. The ABG procedures for all patients were performed by the same senior&#xD;
      surgeon per the protocol of our center, which comprises an iliac cancellous bone graft and&#xD;
      the sealing of the Scarpa fascia to the defect before the bone graft is packed.2,12 Patient&#xD;
      who had syndromic cleft alveolus, who underwent two-stage ABG (performed for bilateral&#xD;
      cases), or who exhibited failed grafted tissue were excluded. In total, 40 patients were&#xD;
      enrolled in the present study. The demographic and clinical variables for ABG were&#xD;
      retrospectively collected through a review of medical charts. All CBCT images were obtained&#xD;
      using an i-CAT CBCT scanner (Imaging Sciences International, Hatﬁeld, PA, USA); the&#xD;
      parameters for the images are as follows: 120 kVp, voxel size of 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.4 mm3, 40-s&#xD;
      scan time, and 22 × 16-cm field of view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMD Measurement The Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) was applied for image&#xD;
      analysis. In addition, areas of interest were checked in the axial view slice by slice to&#xD;
      locate the grafted tissue. Three methods (A, B, and C), which differed by the size of the&#xD;
      selected area, were designed to measure Hounsfield units (HU). For all methods, we first&#xD;
      identified the most superior and inferior planes transecting the grafted tissue.&#xD;
      Subsequently, the middle plane of the grafted tissue was identified. For the selected plane,&#xD;
      the distance between two teeth had to be larger than 2.5 mm in diameter; this was required&#xD;
      for all three methods. On each plane, the selected circular area is defined as being located&#xD;
      at the midpoint of the line between the centers of the two adjacent teeth. The HU of the&#xD;
      selected area could be obtained using PACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Method A, the circular zone located 1 mm from the adjacent teeth was selected. For Method&#xD;
      B, the largest circular zone that exactly transected the two adjacent teeth or was tangent to&#xD;
      the surrounding cortical bone was selected. For Method C, a circle was drawn with a diameter&#xD;
      of 2 mm. Furthermore, an area of 2 × 0.5 mm2 in the pogonion was selected to obtain its HU at&#xD;
      T1 and T2; this was the reference for calibration (Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 1).&#xD;
      HU was the reference for BMD13 and represented the average density of the three planes.&#xD;
      Calibrated BMD (BMDc, %) was defined using the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      〖BMD〗_c (%)=〖HU〗_(selected zone)/〖HU〗_pogonion ×100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Density enhancement rate (%) was calculated using the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Density enhancing rate (%)= (〖BMD〗_cT2-〖BMD〗_cT1)/〖BMD〗_cT1 ×100, where BMDcT2 is BMDc&#xD;
      measured at T2, and BMDcT1 is the BMDc at T1. All the BMD and pogonion density data were&#xD;
      measured by one examiner and repeated twice on different dates that were separated by a&#xD;
      3-month interval; the second round of measurements was conducted without reference to the&#xD;
      first-round measurements. The average of the six sets of data (two measurements for each of&#xD;
      the three planes) was used for the final statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis In the descriptive analysis, continuous variables were summarized by&#xD;
      means ± standard deviations. All variables were examined for normal distribution using the&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk test. Student's t-test was performed to compare the means of continuous&#xD;
      variables with normal distribution, and a chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test was used&#xD;
      for categorical data. Furthermore, we performed analysis of variance with repeated measures&#xD;
      to compare the differences between the three methods with respect to BMDc measurements and&#xD;
      density enhancement rates in normally distributed data; for data that were not normally&#xD;
      distributed, Friedman test was used. To compare the differences in BMDc at T1 and T2, we&#xD;
      performed a paired t-test and a Wilcoxon signed-rank test for bilateral cleft due to small&#xD;
      sample size. Bland-Altman plots were used to evaluate the agreement of each method.&#xD;
      Intrarater reliability for the three methods was calculated using intraclass correlation&#xD;
      coefficients (ICCs). All statistical tests were two-tailed, and a p value less than 0.05 was&#xD;
      considered statistically significant. All data were analyzed using SPSS 24.0 (SPSS, Chicago,&#xD;
      IL, USA).&#xD;
