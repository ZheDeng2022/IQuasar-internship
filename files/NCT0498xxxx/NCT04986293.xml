  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When using highly conformal radiotherapy techniques, such as proton therapy, a controlled&#xD;
      breathing pattern and a minimal breathing amplitude could greatly benefit the treatment of&#xD;
      mobile tumors. This reduction in tumor motion may be achieved with the use of a ventilator&#xD;
      that is able to regulate and modulate the breathing pattern. CPAP provides a constant level&#xD;
      of positive airway pressure. Compared to spontaneous breathing, the use of CPAP increased&#xD;
      lung volume and can result in a significant decrease in tumor movement and a significant&#xD;
      decrease in both mean lung and mean heart radiation dose. These results were found in&#xD;
      patients treated for limited stage disease, it is not clear if this approach is feasible for&#xD;
      patients with more advanced stage of disease that undergo radiotherapy with curative intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP), tidal volume excursions are determined by the&#xD;
      pressure difference between the set inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and the set&#xD;
      expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP). This mode of ventilation increases lung volume&#xD;
      comparable to CPAP, but also to control tidal volumes and breathing frequency. However, BiPAP&#xD;
      has never been studied in the setting of motion mitigation during radiotherapy and BiPAP&#xD;
      might be more difficult to adjust to for patients compared to CPAP. Therefore, the current&#xD;
      study is proposed to evaluate whether or not CPAP or BiPAP is of benefit in patients that&#xD;
      undergo radiotherapy for larger intra-thoracic tumor volumes.&#xD;

      The study will follow a 2-step approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First (Phase 1, n=10), the feasibility of short-term use of CPAP and BiPAP and its effects on&#xD;
      (regional) lung volumes, tidal volumes and breathing frequency will be investigated in&#xD;
      patients with intra-thoracic tumors who are planned for radiotherapy. This is necessary to&#xD;
      select the best setting of CPAP or BiPAP with which minimal tumor motion is expected (and&#xD;
      that is feasible for the patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase (n=21), the particular setting found in fase 1 is investigated: weekly&#xD;
      repeated radiotherapy planning (4D) CT scans with and without CPAP/BiPAP will be aquired to&#xD;
      evaluate the influence on tumor motion and dose to the target and organs at risk.&#xD;
      Radiotherapy will be deliverd according to local protocol without the use of CPAP/BiPAP.&#xD;
