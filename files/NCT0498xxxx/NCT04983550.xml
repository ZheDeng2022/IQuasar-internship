    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label, phase II clinical study to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of SG001 in combination with doxorubicin hydrochloride&#xD;
      liposome injection in patients with platinum-resistant relapsed intermediate to advanced&#xD;
      epithelial ovarian cancer, and to provide a basis for recommending the SG001 combination&#xD;
      dosing regimen for subsequent studies. This study will enroll patients with histologically or&#xD;
      cytologically confirmed epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer, FIGO stage&#xD;
      II-IV, platinum-resistant relapse (defined as disease progression within 6 months after the&#xD;
      last platinum-containing chemotherapy) and non-platinum refractory (defined as disease&#xD;
      progression within 4 weeks after the first platinum-containing chemotherapy) with up to three&#xD;
      prior lines of platinum-containing systemic chemotherapy, up to two lines of platinum-free&#xD;
      systemic chemotherapy, and at least one measurable tumor lesion (according to RECIST 1.1).&#xD;
