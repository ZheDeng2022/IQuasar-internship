  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose the research is to obtain preliminary data about the change in fitness from&#xD;
      admission to discharge in patients undergoing an Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT) ,&#xD;
      assessed by the 6 minute walk test as the primary objective and the SF-36 as the secondary&#xD;
      objective. All subjects will wear a Fitbit monitor while admitted for the ASCT to record&#xD;
      their daily activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll 20 subjects with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma or lymphoma (10 with&#xD;
      each diagnosis) scheduled to undergo ASCT at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the informed consent form, intake data will be collected on all subjects will&#xD;
      include age, diagnosis, Karnofsky performance status, and comorbidity index. Subjects will&#xD;
      complete an SF-36 questionnaire that assesses their functional and emotional status. Each&#xD;
      subject will undergo a 6-minute walk test (6MWT) while wearing a Fitbit monitor to record the&#xD;
      number of steps taken. After admission, subjects will be randomly assigned to either the&#xD;
      control or intervention group. Subjects in the control arm will receive an activity monitor&#xD;
      but the physician, nurse, and patient will not receive any feedback from the device. Patients&#xD;
      will be blinded to any data capture from their activity monitor. Participants in the&#xD;
      intervention arm will receive an activity monitor and they will receive feedback from the&#xD;
      activity tracker and the in-room TV screen. Study participants in this arm will engage with&#xD;
      their physicians and nurses around achievement of daily step goals by viewing the in-room TV&#xD;
      display of daily step counts on rounds. After discharge, all subjects will again complete the&#xD;
      SF-36 questionnaire and perform a 6MWT at a routine clinic visit, within 30 days of the&#xD;
      transplant procedure. Descriptive statistics in the form of mean and standard deviation will&#xD;
      be used to summarize patient physical activity as measured by 6MWT.&#xD;
