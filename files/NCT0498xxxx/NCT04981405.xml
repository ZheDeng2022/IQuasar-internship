  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational case-control study to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness&#xD;
      against hospitalisation with COVID-19 related conditions in St. Petersburg, Russia. Two sets&#xD;
      of cases and control will be retrospectively analyzed to compare vaccination proportions and&#xD;
      other characteristics to infer vaccine effectiveness from odds ratios. The first set of cases&#xD;
      will be extracted from the data on hospitalisation of patients with COVID-19 to First Pavlov&#xD;
      State Medical University of Saint-Petersburg hospitals, and controls will be patients&#xD;
      hospitalised with other conditions. The second set of cases and controls will be based on&#xD;
      patients referred to Medical Institute named after Berezin Sergey for computed tomography.&#xD;
      Cases will be patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 status computed tomography confirmed&#xD;
      pneumonia or patients referred to hospitalisation, and control will be patients without&#xD;
      pneumonia and not referred to hospitalisation.&#xD;
