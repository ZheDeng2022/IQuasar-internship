  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a single-blind, randomized controlled design to investigate the additional therapeutic&#xD;
      effects of individualized educational training on traditional rehabilitation programs for&#xD;
      preschool children with developmental delays.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 20 preschool children with developmental delay who are receiving traditional&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be randomized into two groups, including the intervention group&#xD;
      (traditional rehabilitation program with individualized educational training: one time per&#xD;
      week, 50 min per session, with a total of 4 sessions in one month) and the control group&#xD;
      (traditional rehabilitation program without individualized educational training).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic effects, including pediatric daily activity, attention, cognitive function,&#xD;
      functional performance, quality of life, and physical functional performance at baseline,&#xD;
      after one month of treatment, and 3 months after the treatment, will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluators will be blinded to the group's allocation during the whole course of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A total of 20 children with developmental delays who are receiving traditional rehabilitation programs will be enrolled. The participants will be randomized into two groups, including the intervention group (traditional rehabilitation program with additional educational training) and the control group (traditional rehabilitation program without educational training). The intervention group will receive 1 month of individualized educational training, 50 min per session, 1 session per week, a total of 4 sessions. All of the evaluations will be performed before training, re-evaluated 1 month after completion of treatment, and 3 months after completion of the treatment in the study group. The control group will be evaluated at the baseline, 1 month, and 6 months later, respectively.</intervention_model_description>
