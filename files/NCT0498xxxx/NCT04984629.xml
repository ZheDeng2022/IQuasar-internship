      A study designed to treat patients with back pain associated with degenerative lumbar disc&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As people age, the nucleus pulposus reduces in volume which leads to annular bulging and&#xD;
      biomechanical instability that produces altered load bearing forces between the anterior and&#xD;
      posterior spinal elements (i.e., discs and facets). Loss of volume of the nucleus pulposus&#xD;
      directly affects disc height, often causing pain, numbness or motor weakness due to contact&#xD;
      with nerve roots or the spinal cord. The ReGelTec HYDRAFIL System may offer some potential&#xD;
      advantages over conventional, spinal fusion and total disc replacement techniques applied in&#xD;
      the treatment of symptomatic lumbar degenerative disc disease (DDD). Nucleus augmentation&#xD;
      (NA) provides the opportunity to address lumbar DDD in a percutaneous approach while&#xD;
      preserving function. Conceptually, nucleus augmentation will add to the armamentarium of&#xD;
      surgical techniques for treating moderate to severe DDD to provide an early stage&#xD;
      device-based intervention to augment the vertebral segment, and arrest changes that lead to&#xD;
      progressive degeneration and ultimately may lead to more invasive surgeries such as&#xD;
      discectomy, total disc replacement or spinal fusion.&#xD;

    <description>The ReGelTec HYDRAFIL System is comprised of delivery system, 17G delivery needle and a syringe prefilled with HYDRAFIL Implant - Figure 1. Each delivery system is a Single Use Device that will be used for a single implant, then disposed of after injection. A new delivery system is required for each implant, as deemed necessary based on the screening MRI to target the degenerative discs in the lumbar spine.</description>
