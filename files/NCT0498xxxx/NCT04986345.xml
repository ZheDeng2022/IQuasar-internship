    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevalence has steadily been rising in the past decades and its&#xD;
      complications, including cardiovascular diseases (CVD), are a major public health concern.&#xD;
      Insulin resistance, an important component of T2D, is associated with vascular dysfunctions,&#xD;
      which directly contributes to the pathogenesis of CVD, such as atherosclerosis, and&#xD;
      hypertension, particularly with the elderly. It is also suggested that glucose variability,&#xD;
      measured with continuous glucose monitors (CGM), is an independent risk factor of CVD in T2D&#xD;
      individuals, exposing them to an increased risk of premature death. Moreover, in part because&#xD;
      of immune dysregulation, women with T2D are at a heightened risk of developing CVD compared&#xD;
      to males. Indeed, monocyte inflammatory profile is altered during the aging process and in&#xD;
      women with T2D. This, in turn, causes vascular dysfunction which is associated with a&#xD;
      pro-thrombotic state, and exacerbates atherosclerosis and arterial stiffening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To lower CVD risk and to maintain an adequate glycemic control, Diabetes Canada recommends&#xD;
      aerobic exercise of high-intensity interval training (HIIT). However, this recommendation is&#xD;
      solely based on the improvement of cardiorespiratory fitness in type 2 diabetes individuals&#xD;
      (level of evidence: grade B, level 2). Furthermore, most of these studies use exercise&#xD;
      protocols with ergocycles, which limit the ecological validity considering that the elderly&#xD;
      population prefers to walk. Though, it is essential to evaluate the impact of different&#xD;
      walking HIIT protocols on clinical targets such as arterial pressure, glycemic&#xD;
      variability/control using ambulatory blood pressure monitors (ABPM) and CGM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preliminary data collected in our laboratory shows that a low volume HIIIT program (6 × 1&#xD;
      min) is insufficient to improve glycemic control/variability and ambulatory blood pressure&#xD;
      over 24 hours in elderly diabetic women, despite reducing inflammatory gene expression in&#xD;
      monocytes. Interestingly, pro-inflammatory monocytes are linked with hyperglycemia and play a&#xD;
      crucial role in the atherosclerotic process, while also being associated with arterial&#xD;
      stiffening in individuals with kidney failure, a common T2D complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results raise several questions, including the role played by the length of HIIT&#xD;
      intervals on clinical targets. While our preliminary results didn't impact ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure over 24 hours with shorter intervals (6 × 1 min), other studied showed a reduction&#xD;
      of this parameter with longer intervals (4 x 4 min). Therefore, the leading hypothesis of&#xD;
      this study is that longer high intensity intervals (Wisløff protocol: 4 x 4 min) will reduce&#xD;
      ambulatory blood pressure over 24 hours in a greater extent than shorter intervals (10 x 1&#xD;
      min). Indeed, reduced shear stress induced by shorter intervals could damper cellular and&#xD;
      molecular responses to exercise bouts, thereby limiting the effects on arterial stiffness and&#xD;
      blood pressure in the hours following exercise. Moreover, changes in gene expression do not&#xD;
      guarantee changes at the protein level, and proteins are the real effectors of cellular&#xD;
      response. Hence, proteomics will be useful to better understand monocyte response to&#xD;
      different HIIT protocols and, possibly, the clinical benefits of this training method.&#xD;
      Indeed, longer intervals could induce greater variations to the monocytes' proteome, favoring&#xD;
      an anti-inflammatory phenotype, and those changes could be associated with reduced arterial&#xD;
      stiffness and blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is therefore to compare the effect of two treadmill HIIT&#xD;
      modalities (4x4 min vs. 10x1 min) on arterial stiffness, ambulatory blood pressure over 24&#xD;
      hours and on glycemic variability in elderly women with T2D. The secondary objective is to&#xD;
      assess the proteomic changes in monocytes induced by the two HIIT modalities and to correlate&#xD;
      them with changes in clinical parameters.&#xD;
