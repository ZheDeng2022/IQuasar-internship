  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial aims to investigate the efficacy of freeze-dried bovine&#xD;
      hydroxyapatite/secretome composite application for the management of long bone defects and&#xD;
      other bone healing disorders in the lower extremities.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The gold standard for treating bone defect conditions is autologous bone graft (autograft).&#xD;
      Autograft promotes bone healing due to its osteoconductive (serving as a foundation that&#xD;
      facilitates bone growth), osteoinductive (stimulates progenitor cells), and osteogenesis&#xD;
      (acting as a precursor of osteoblasts and osteoclasts) properties. However, donor site&#xD;
      morbidity and persisting pain following harvest remains a major problem. Hence, we attempt to&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy of other bone substitutes, i.e., bovine hydroxyapatite/secretome&#xD;
      composite, to treat long bone defects and other bone healing disorders in the lower&#xD;
      extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bovine hydroxyapatite (BHA) is a xenograft (animal-derived graft) with osteoconductive&#xD;
      properties. Simultaneously, the secretome of the mesenchymal stem cells contains cytokines,&#xD;
      chemokines, and growth factors, which possess osteoinductive properties. Thus, we hypothesize&#xD;
      that the combination (composite) of BHA/secretome (in the form of freeze-dried (FD)&#xD;
      BHA/secretome composite) will promote bone healing ability that is equal to autografts while&#xD;
      eliminating donor-site morbidity in the patient.&#xD;

    <measure>X-ray evaluation immediately following surgery.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day-0</time_frame>
    <description>A two-view (anterior-posterior/AP and lateral) radiograph will be taken immediately following surgery. The x-ray evaluation will be carried out by a blinded outcome assessor using a scoring system named Radiographic Union Score (Whelan et al., 2010) to assess bone union based on fracture line, callus, and graft resorption on plain radiograph after fracture. This score ranges from 4 to 12, with a higher score indicating a more favorable outcome (better bone healing).</description>

    <measure>Functional evaluation at 8 weeks following surgery.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The functional evaluation will be assessed by using a scoring system named LEFS (Lower Extremity Functional Scale). LEFS is a widely known and validated patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) comprising 20 questions that is used to assess lower extremity functions. The patients will be asked to rate the activity listed from 0 to 4 (0 refers to an extreme difficulty/unable to perform activity, while 4 refers to having no difficulty at all). A higher score (maximum 80 points) indicates a very high function (i.e., a more favorable outcome).</description>
