  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first purpose of this study is to characterize the relationship among propulsion&#xD;
      workload, self-selected propulsion speed, and propulsion kinetics/kinematics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second purpose is to assess the between days repeatability/reliability of the above&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a repeated measures clinical trial. All participants will complete the following: 1)&#xD;
      Acclimation to propelling a manual wheelchair on a wheelchair ergometer; 2) Graded exercise&#xD;
      test on the wheelchair ergometer to 80% of age adjusted estimated maximal heart rate; and 3)&#xD;
      N=20 one minute propulsion bouts on the wheelchair ergometer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will complete two visits in a 14 day period. Visit 1 will require 3-4 hours.&#xD;
      Visit 2 will require 2-3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During visit 1 participant will complete: 1) Acclimation to propelling a manual wheelchair on&#xD;
      a wheelchair ergometer; 2) Graded exercise test on the wheelchair ergometer to 80% of age&#xD;
      adjusted estimated maximal heart rate; and 3) N=20 one minute propulsion bouts on the&#xD;
      wheelchair ergometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During visit 2 participants will repeat the N=20 one minute propulsion bouts on the&#xD;
      wheelchair ergometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wheelchair ergometer propulsion acclimation: Participants will complete a minimum of 2&#xD;
      minutes of wheelchair propulsion to acclimate. Additional propulsion time will be completed&#xD;
      as needed. Propulsion workload will be varied during the acclimation. Acclimation propulsion&#xD;
      may be repeated as needed during study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Submaximal wheelchair ergometer test protocol: Participants will rest quietly in the&#xD;
      wheelchair for several minutes. After resting, participants will begin propelling at a&#xD;
      comfortable speed at a low initial workload. Workload will be increased every minute.&#xD;
      Propulsion speed will remain constant across all workloads. Test will end when participants&#xD;
      reach 80% of age adjusted estimated maximum heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wheelchair propulsion workload assessment: Participants will complete 20 one-minute&#xD;
      propulsion bouts at a self-selected speed. Each one minute propulsion bout will be followed&#xD;
      by a 2 minute rest period. Each propulsion bout will be at a different workload. After the&#xD;
      first 10 propulsion bouts, participants will be provided with an extended rest period (5 to&#xD;
      30 minutes). For each participant, the maximum workload to be tested is based on their&#xD;
      estimated maximum workload. Estimate maximum workload is based on the Heart Rate-Workload&#xD;
      relationship documented during the submaximal test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The workloads of the N=20 propulsion bouts will be divided into two groups of N=10 (Group A&#xD;
      and Group B). The total workload of each group will be equal. Within each group, workload&#xD;
      sequence is fixed and arranged in a non-ascending or descending order. Completion order of&#xD;
      the groups will be counterbalanced within sex. Within participants, completion order will be&#xD;
      counterbalanced across days&#xD;
