    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the correlation of the calculated portosystemic&#xD;
      pressure gradient (PPG) obtained by direct portal and hepatic pressure measurements with the&#xD;
      EchoTip® Insight™ and indirect portal vein pressure measurements using the interventional&#xD;
      radiology based hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) procedure.&#xD;

    <description>Under general anesthesia, to quantify the correlation between the calculated PPG from the EchoTip® Insight™ direct measurements (difference between direct portal vein pressure and direct hepatic vein pressure) and indirect HVPG measurement (difference between transjugular free hepatic venous pressure (FHVP) and wedge hepatic venous pressure (WHVP) obtained during an IR procedure.</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo procedure where HVPG is obtained under mild sedation, next the patients will undergo anesthesia and mechanical intubation where HVPG measurements will be obtained simultaneously with the EchoTip Insight measurement. For patients receiving a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), direct portal vein pressure measurements will be obtained by the EchoTip® Insight™ and compared to the transjugular direct portal vein measurement obtained during the interventional radiology (IR) procedure.</description>
