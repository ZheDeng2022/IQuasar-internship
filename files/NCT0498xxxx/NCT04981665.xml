  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center, phaseⅡstudy to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TACE&#xD;
      sequential tislelizumab as adjuvant therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who&#xD;
      are at high risk of recurrence after curative resection.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor with high morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Surgical resection is the most important radical treatment. However, the recurrence rate is&#xD;
      high especially in the patients with high risk of recurrence after curative resection. How to&#xD;
      reduce postoperative recurrence and improve survival is currently a direction that is worth&#xD;
      exploring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now there is no standard postoperative adjuvant therapy. Previous studies have shown&#xD;
      that TACE combined with PD-1 inhibitors has a synergistic enhancement effect, and this study&#xD;
      is to explore the efficacy and safety of TACE sequential tislelizumab as adjuvant therapy in&#xD;
      HCC patients who are at high risk of recurrence after curative resection.&#xD;
