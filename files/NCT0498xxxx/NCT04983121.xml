    <textblock>
      Next-generation Site-specific human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeting&#xD;
      Antibody-drug Conjugate (ARX788) is an antibody-conjugated drug. Results from the phase I&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic trial of ARX788 single drug in Chinese patients with&#xD;
      advanced HER2 breast cancer indicated a good safety of the test drug, and responses to&#xD;
      anti-tumor therapy were observed in the target dose group. Phase II clinical trial is being&#xD;
      carried out gradually. This trial is designed to observe the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      pyrotinib maleate combined with ARX788 neoadjuvant treatment in stage II-III HER2-positive&#xD;
      breast cancer patients experiencing a poor efficacy of trastuzumab and pertuzumab.&#xD;

      This study adopts a single-arm, multi-center, open design. As per the initial plan, 30 stage&#xD;
      II-III human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer patients who&#xD;
      have received neoadjuvant therapy containing trastuzumab and pertuzumab and have been&#xD;
      assessed as stable disease (SD) during the neoadjuvant treatment (an increase of 0-20%),&#xD;
      disease progression (PD), inoperable or failing to meet the breast-conserving requirements&#xD;
      will be enrolled to receive pyrotinib combined with Next-generation Site-specific&#xD;
      HER2-targeting Antibody-drug Conjugate (ARX788) neoadjuvant therapy. The main purpose of the&#xD;
      study is to observe the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib combined with ARX788 neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment in stage II-III HER2-positive breast cancer.&#xD;

    <description>Postoperative pathological results will be used to assess the residual tumor area of primary breast tumor (area in mm×mm), the cell density of the residual tumor（cell density in percentages）, the proportion of carcinoma in situ (proportion of carcinoma in percentages), the number of positive lymph nodes and the diameter of largest metastasis with residual nodes (diameter in mm). The RCB class can be estimated from the above five pathological parameters through a network calculation: RCB-0 in grades: pCR; RCB-I in grades: minimal residual tumor; RCB-II: moderate residual tumor; RCB-III in grades: extensive residual tumor.</description>

    <description>The subjects who sign an informed consent will enter the treatment period after screening. Each eligible subject will receive pyrotinib, 320 mg once a day, with 21 days as a session, for 6 sessions in total before operation. Next-generation Site-specific human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeting Antibody-drug Conjugate (ARX788) will be intravenously injected at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg, once every 3 weeks, with 21 days as a session, for 6 sessions before surgery. Breast MRI and other imaging examinations will be reviewed every 2 sessions to evaluate the curative effect, and the patient's baseline will be defined based on the imaging report at the time of enrollment. If a definite effect (complete response/partial response) is achieved, surgical treatment will be performed within 4 weeks (&gt; 2 weeks) after completion of 6 sessions of neoadjuvant therapy.</description>
