  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Bright Futures Guideline recommends 2 visits&#xD;
      for all healthy term newborn infants in the first 6 weeks of life, first at 3-5 days of life&#xD;
      and the second at around a month. However, compliant parents of infants are known to get at&#xD;
      least 1-2 extra visits due to primary care provider's concern about appropriate weight gain.&#xD;
      These weight check visits as they take up extra time, car gas, parking charges, loss of work&#xD;
      time and paying for childcare during the visits. Clinic resources are also unnecessarily&#xD;
      utilized. Remote home monitoring of infant weights with the use of technology could reduce&#xD;
      the need for office visits and improve efficiency on the provider side, enhance parental&#xD;
      satisfaction and decrease transmission of viruses in the winter season. The main objective is&#xD;
      to monitor the daily weight of term infants born at 37 completed weeks of greater, discharged&#xD;
      from the newborn nursery, remotely through the electronic medical record by the primary care&#xD;
      provider and to reduce any extra visit in the first six weeks of life. Using block&#xD;
      randomization, the infants will be assigned to either group A, where no home telemonitoring&#xD;
      of weight will take place or group B, where the parent will be provided with a weighing&#xD;
      scale. The parent will enter the weight into the MyChart application on the smartphone or on&#xD;
      the computer which will be tracked by the pediatrician. The pediatrician will take the&#xD;
      decision whether to bring the infant in for a weight check visit based on the weight&#xD;
      information. If the weight gain is satisfactory, the pediatrician will see the patient at&#xD;
      around 1 month of age per recommendation and the parents will stop the weight checks at that&#xD;
      time. The sample size required was 16 on each arm (total 32) which has been increased to 20&#xD;
      each arm to account for technical problems and/or loss to follow up.&#xD;

      Title: Impact of a pilot home weight telemonitoring program on the number of office visits by&#xD;
      infants in the first six weeks of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: Currently American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)Bright Futures Guideline recommends&#xD;
      five health supervision or office visits in the first 6 months of life for infants discharged&#xD;
      from the newborn nursery. This includes 2 visits in the first 6 weeks, first at 3-5 days of&#xD;
      life and the second at around a month.1 However, compliant parents of infants are known to&#xD;
      get at least 1-2 extra visits due to primary care provider's concern about appropriate weight&#xD;
      gain. These weight check visits are an inconvenience to the parent(s) as they not only take&#xD;
      up extra time, but also utilize the limited resources these parents have. Travel car gas,&#xD;
      parking charges, loss of work time and paying for childcare during the visits are some of the&#xD;
      ways the finances are affected. There is also utilization of resources in the clinic, as well&#xD;
      as time slots that could be utilized to see other patients. Previous studies have shown&#xD;
      greater maternal satisfaction with effective telemonitoring of weight at home.2,3 Remote home&#xD;
      monitoring of infant weights with the use of technology could reduce the need for office&#xD;
      visits and improve efficiency on the provider side, enhance parental satisfaction and&#xD;
      decrease transmission of viruses in the winter season. Reduction in the number of visits to&#xD;
      the outpatient visit may also help in curbing the spread of coronavirus in the pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To monitor the daily weight of infants remotely through the electronic medical record by&#xD;
           the primary care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To reduce any extra visit in the first six weeks of life of an infant other than those&#xD;
           recommended by AAP, primarily for a concern of appropriate weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population: Newborns with gestation of 37 weeks and zero days or more, discharged from&#xD;
      the newborn nursery who will follow-up with a clinician within the Cleveland Clinic health&#xD;
      system (CCHS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposal: Institutional Review Board approval will be obtained before the study initiation.&#xD;
      The study will require taking consent from parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In a prospective pilot randomized controlled study, using computer generated&#xD;
      randomization, infants born at Fairview Hospital meeting the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      randomized to either group A (home telemonitoring of daily weight, scale provided to parents)&#xD;
      or group B (no home telemonitoring, no scale provided). If the infant falls in the group A,&#xD;
      the parent(s) of the infant will be given a weighing scale before discharge from the newborn&#xD;
      nursery at Fairview Hospital with detailed instructions on how to use the scale. The&#xD;
      instructions will be in English only. The parent(s) will be requested to document daily&#xD;
      weight (at least 5 days a week) till the 1 month visit of the infant to the Pediatrician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population/workflow process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parent(s) in group A will be provided with the instructions on how to weigh their infant&#xD;
      and document the weight in patient portal provided by the Cleveland Clinic. The entire&#xD;
      process will be demonstrated to the parent(s) in the newborn nursery prior to discharge. The&#xD;
      daily weight will be monitored by the pediatrician via the flowsheet through the electronic&#xD;
      medical record (EMR). The infant's pediatrician is defined as the first clinician (Physician&#xD;
      or Nurse Practitioner) the infant visits at the outpatient visit after discharge from the&#xD;
      newborn nursery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parent could also call the office with concerns about weight gain as instructed by the&#xD;
      pediatrician's office. If the weight gain of the infant is appropriate, the pediatrician will&#xD;
      continue to monitor and see the infant at 1 month of life as recommended by the AAP. But if&#xD;
      there are any concerns, the provider will be free to intervene as per his/her discretion. The&#xD;
      parent will stop weight documentation after the 1-month pediatrician visit. The number of&#xD;
      visits needed by infants will be compared between the groups at the 6 months mark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and safety monitoring plans:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study entails use of a standard commercially available weighing scale for use at&#xD;
      home by the parent. If used correctly, this intervention poses less than minimal risk to the&#xD;
      infant. All the communication that will take place between the provider and the parent will&#xD;
      be through HIPAA compliant platforms - MyChart and Epic. Parents' will be encouraged to&#xD;
      contact the PI directly for any concerns about the process of weighing or safety of the data.&#xD;
      All data will be stored in HIPAA compliant RedCap database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An IRB approved consent form in English will be used. The consent interview will take place&#xD;
      in the parents' private room in the Fairview 4 North unit. Sufficient time will be provided&#xD;
      to the parent to make a decision about participating in the study. The consent interview will&#xD;
      be conducted by the study PI or the co-investigator. The consent will be documented in an IRB&#xD;
      approved consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parent of the subject (newborn) will be provided with information regarding the research.&#xD;
      If the treating team allows the mother to take her baby home with her, it will be assumed&#xD;
      that the mother is the responsible guardian who is able to give consent for the study. The&#xD;
      capacity to consent will be decision that will be made by the study team after consultation&#xD;
      with the treating team of the mother and baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a risk of breach in confidentiality because of the data leak from being transmitted&#xD;
      from the smartphone MyChart app to the electronic medical record. The use of the MyChart app&#xD;
      is guided by the standard agreements/terms of use/privacy policy of the Cleveland clinic. All&#xD;
      standard precautions including compliance to HIPAA will apply to this process of data&#xD;
      transfer. Therefore, the research does not involve no more than the standard security risks&#xD;
      that apply to the use of MyChart application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information will be kept confidentially in a HIPAA compliant data repository, RedCap.&#xD;
      After the study is completed, the data will be destroyed or de-identified. All data will be&#xD;
      coded before analysis. Any personal information that could identify individuals will be&#xD;
      removed or changed before files are shared with other researchers or results are made public.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study may or may not benefit the infant directly by reducing the number&#xD;
      of times the infant would have to visit the Pediatrician in-person, depending on his/her&#xD;
      study group. But participation in this study may provide information that may reduce the&#xD;
      number of visits required for infants to visit their doctors in-person in the first month of&#xD;
      life. The knowledge to be gained from this research may be beneficial for other patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no charges to be billed for the research. The only cost of the study is the&#xD;
      purchase of 20 weighing scales for which adequate funding is available. The PI and&#xD;
      Co-investigators will manage to take consent and follow the 20 infants who will be in group A&#xD;
      (weighed by the scale). Statistical analysis will be performed by the PI. No other cost is&#xD;
      expected in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The aim is to demonstrate a difference of 1 visit in the first 6 weeks&#xD;
      of life between the groups (2 vs 3). Considering an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80%, 16&#xD;
      infants in each group [16 with weighing scales (group A) and the 16 without (Group B)] will&#xD;
      be needed. Considering 25% loss of follow-up due to technical issues or drop-out, our total&#xD;
      subjects is estimated to be 20 subjects in each group (total 40). The parents will be&#xD;
      instructed to document 5 weight measurements in a week but an Intent to treat analysis will&#xD;
      be utilized to include all infants in Group B who have weight documentation &lt; 5 times in a&#xD;
      week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding: The study is funded by AAP district V SONPM grant program.&#xD;
