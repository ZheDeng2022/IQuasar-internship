      IMPROVE is an implementation study aiming to explore the effects of two bundled&#xD;
      implementation strategies on the intervention fidelity of the Healthy School Start program&#xD;
      (primary outcome) while simultaneously monitoring effects on health outcomes of children and&#xD;
      parents (secondary outcomes). Thirty schools in two municipalities will receive the HSS&#xD;
      program reaching about 1400 families per school year, for two years.&#xD;

      IMPROVE aims to conduct a hybrid type 3 evaluation design to test the effects of bundled&#xD;
      implementation strategies on the intervention fidelity (primary outcome) of the Healthy&#xD;
      School Start (HSS) program while simultaneously monitoring effects on health outcomes of&#xD;
      children and parents (secondary outcomes). The HSS is a 4-component family support program&#xD;
      for children starting school (5-7 years of age) promoting healthy dietary habits and physical&#xD;
      activity in the home environment to prevent childhood obesity and parent risk of developing&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPROVE is a cluster-randomized controlled trial with two arms to evaluate and compare the&#xD;
      effects of two different bundles of implementation strategies on intervention fidelity&#xD;
      expressed as adherence and responsiveness at 12 and 24 months. Thirty schools in two&#xD;
      municipalities will participate in the study reaching about 1400 families per school year. In&#xD;
      stakeholder workshops, key implementation determinants were identified according to the&#xD;
      domains of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Through a consensus&#xD;
      process with stakeholders, two bundles of implementation strategies were tailored to address&#xD;
      context-specific determinants. Schools randomly assigned to group 1 will receive bundle 1&#xD;
      (Basic) and group 2 will receive bundle 1+2 (Enhanced), consisting mainly of external&#xD;
      facilitation, fidelity monitoring and feedback strategies. Secondary outcomes will include&#xD;
      acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, organisational readiness as perceived by school&#xD;
      staff, child weight status and diet, and parents' risk of type 2 diabetes. Linear and ordinal&#xD;
      regression analysis will be used to test the effect on the primary and secondary outcomes,&#xD;
      taking clustering into consideration where needed. Process evaluation will be conducted&#xD;
      through key stakeholder interviews to investigate experiences of the program and stakeholder&#xD;
      perceptions on sustainability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This systematic approach to investigating the effects of two different bundles of&#xD;
      implementation strategies tailored to context-specific determinants on the fidelity of the&#xD;
      HSS intervention will provide new insight into feasible implementation strategies and the&#xD;
      external supports needed for a school-based health program like the HSS to be effective and&#xD;
      sustainable. Results will help inform how to bridge the gap between the research on&#xD;
      school-based health programs and routine practice in schools.&#xD;
