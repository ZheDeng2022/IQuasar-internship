      Talzenna will be approved for the treatment of gBRCA advanced breast cancer in Korea. In&#xD;
      accordance with the Standards for Re-examination of New Drug, it is required to conduct a&#xD;
      PMS. Post marketing surveillance is required to determine any problems or questions&#xD;
      associated with Talzenna after marketing in Korea, with regard to the following clauses under&#xD;
      conditions of general clinical practice. Therefore, through this study, effectiveness and&#xD;
