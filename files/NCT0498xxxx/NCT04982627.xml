  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct pilot study to assess effects of brief negotiation interview (BNI) Chatbot among&#xD;
      individuals involved in the Connecticut criminal justice system with opioid use disorder&#xD;
      (OUD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 2 years (1 year for study activities, 1 year for data analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness of a BNI Chatbot on&#xD;
      patients with OUD compared with Standard Care (SC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Study Sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The offices of the Center for Progressive Recovery, LLC and the New Haven Police Department&#xD;
      Detention Center (NHPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population includes adult individuals with OUD who are involved in the Connecticut&#xD;
      criminal justice system and not currently receiving medication-assisted treatment for their&#xD;
      OUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Variable:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attendance at participants first treatment appointment within four weeks of referral among&#xD;
      participants in the BNI Chatbot vs. Standard Care (SC) groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome and Exploratory Outcome Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include readiness and intention to engage in buprenorphine (bup)&#xD;
      treatment, and urine toxicology test-confirmed drug use at four weeks among participants in&#xD;
      BNI Chatbot vs. SC groups. Exploratory outcomes include ratings of feasibility, acceptability&#xD;
      and satisfaction between study groups, and a comparison of study findings to engagement data&#xD;
      from previous in-person studies, including BNI+bup, and other digital programs, such as&#xD;
      reSET-O, and DynamiCare.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Enrollment and Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria with the research associate (RA), who will&#xD;
      be following a &quot;Recruitment Script&quot; (see below) will be offered participation and written&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained. Participants will be randomly assigned (via&#xD;
      http://www.randomization.com) to receive either the BNI Chatbot or Standard Care (SC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SC: The RA will provide participants with an electronic link, which provides OUD and bup&#xD;
           education, and lists OUD treatment options and descriptions and locations, including bup&#xD;
           prescribers. After reviewing, participants will be asked to choose from among the list&#xD;
           of and a referral will be made based on the receiving treatment providers' procedures.&#xD;
           These participants will not have access to the BNI chatbot. However, the referral&#xD;
           facilitation, the electronic link will direct participants to a short Feasibility,&#xD;
           Acceptability and Satisfaction (FAS) Assessment to obtain feedback on the process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BNI Chatbot: Participants will receive a link to register for the chatbot. Following&#xD;
           registration, they will complete the initial chat, which includes instructions for the&#xD;
           entire study. The chatbot will then guide the participant through multiple BNIs focused&#xD;
           on the goal of bup engagement, with the following steps: 1) Raise the Subject/Establish&#xD;
           Rapport; 2) Enhance Motivation; 3) Provide &amp; Elicit Feedback; and 4) Negotiate a Plan.&#xD;
           The chatbot then reminds the participant of their reasons why they might engage in OUD&#xD;
           treatment based on their responses to Steps 2 &amp; 3, and their negotiated plan. The&#xD;
           chatbot will electronically connect participants to a treatment provider of their&#xD;
           choice, based on available options. Based on their choice, individuals in the BNI&#xD;
           Chatbot group choosing to engage in bup treatment will be assessed by the Clinical&#xD;
           Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) and those in active withdrawal may be offered a&#xD;
           telehealth appointment immediately (to the extent possible), which would occur during&#xD;
           the enrollment and help facilitate a prescription for bup. The telehealth appointment&#xD;
           may be with a different treatment provider than the one that they choose to meet with&#xD;
           post-enrollment. If the participant is prescribed bup during this telehealth&#xD;
           appointment, the RA will pick up the prescription for participant and deliver it to the&#xD;
           participant immediately upon release from the police, courthouse or probation office (to&#xD;
           the extent possible). At the end of the encounter, participants will be prompted to&#xD;
           complete the feasibility, acceptability and satisfaction (FAS) assessment electronically&#xD;
           to obtain feedback on the process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: While participants are financially responsible for their own healthcare, we will only&#xD;
      refer them to treatment options that are listed as being covered by their health insurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Assessment: Demographics and status of the participant's case in the criminal&#xD;
      justice system will be collected by the RA via a mobile tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One Month Assessment: At four weeks post-randomization, we will collect the following data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient-facing assessment: Participants will complete a brief follow-up assessment to&#xD;
           collect information on readiness and intention to engage in bup treatment and ratings of&#xD;
           satisfaction regarding their assigned intervention (BNI chatbot or Web-based OUD &amp;&#xD;
           Treatment Referral Resources). Additionally, they will be contacted by phone 1-month&#xD;
           post-randomization to assess self-reported treatment attendance and drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment providers: The RA will call treatment providers to collect information&#xD;
           regarding participants' attendance and record urine toxicology results during the one&#xD;
           month post-randomization, as well as any treatment/prescriptions provided for their&#xD;
           opioid use disorder. Information will be provided to the RA over the phone and recorded&#xD;
           in the electronic study database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Payments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a $25 gift card after the completing the initial enrollment,&#xD;
      including their first use of whichever web application the are assigned (BNI Chatbot or SC).&#xD;
      Participants will receive an additional $25 gift card following completion of the one-month&#xD;
      follow-up assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will participate in two visits, including 1) enrollment, randomization, and&#xD;
      baseline assessment, web application completion (BNI Chatbot or SC, both of which are&#xD;
      delivered via the web) and 2) one-month follow-up. The initial visit will take up to 45&#xD;
      minutes and the follow-up assessment will take up to 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An in-person recruitment/written consent has been submitted with this protocol, which&#xD;
      describes in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and risks. The consent will be&#xD;
      given to the participant via a mobile tablet and paper (if they request), and participants&#xD;
      will be given as much time as needed to review the information and ask any questions they may&#xD;
      have. will be answered by the RA in a way that does not reveal, or ask the individual to&#xD;
      reveal, any PHI. If the individual's questions have been satisfactorily answered or if they&#xD;
      have no questions, then they are given the option of signing the consent form on the tablet.&#xD;
      If they sign the consent form, a copy of it will be emailed to them. They are then asked to&#xD;
      sign a release of information allowing us to contact the substance use disorder treatment&#xD;
      center that has appointments available at that time to confirm attendance and treatment one&#xD;
      month later. If the individual signs the release of information, then we will email them a&#xD;
      copy. Randomization and study interventions are then completed as outlined in the protocol.&#xD;
      Written documentation of informed consent is required prior to enrollment and randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening &amp; Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Below is a detailed outline of how recruitment, enrollment/informed consent and data&#xD;
      collection will occur throughout the study. Overall, the NHPD's only involvement in this&#xD;
      study is to provide space and access for recruitment and enrollment, and they will not&#xD;
      provide or receive any study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The NHPD detention center (i.e., &quot;lockup&quot;) at 1 Union Ave, New Haven, CT, provides space&#xD;
           for the study's RA to sit during set hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. NHPD shares with the RA which cells have nonviolent offenders (i.e., offenses in the&#xD;
           past 5 years will not have been violent in nature) and can be approached.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All nonviolent offenders will be given a Study Flyer by RA and then asked if they are&#xD;
           willing to hear more about a research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If yes, the prospective individual will be handed a study mobile tablet and a pair of&#xD;
           disposable headphones so that they may hear the RA read the &quot;Recruitment Script&quot; (see&#xD;
           attached), which will guide the RA through describing the study and answering any&#xD;
           questions from the prospective participant in such a way as not to reveal any protected&#xD;
           health information (PHI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Following the reading of the script, the prospective participant is handed a mobile&#xD;
           tablet (e.g., iPad) where they can note their interest by clicking one of several&#xD;
           options, including &quot;I want to answer eligibility questions,&quot; which then provides the&#xD;
           questions for the patient to read and answer on the tablet. The individual also has the&#xD;
           option of having the RA read the questions but still provide the answers on the tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. If the individual is eligible, then they can note their interest in participating by&#xD;
           clicking one of several options, including &quot;I want to read the Consent Form&quot; or &quot;I want&#xD;
           the RA to review the Consent Form without revealing any private information&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RA will enroll subjects in the study after they have been referred, screened for&#xD;
      eligibility criteria, and provided informed consent. If screening/enrollment is completed in&#xD;
      person, written informed consent will be collected. If screening/enrollment is completed by&#xD;
      phone or video chat, a copy of the consent form will be emailed to the participant and the&#xD;
      time/date of verbal consent will be documented and retained for study records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline visit (30-45 minutes, depending on group)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  SC: The RA will provide participants with an electronic link, which provides&#xD;
                     OUD and bup education, and lists OUD treatment options and descriptions and&#xD;
                     locations, including bup prescribers. After reviewing, The RA will ask&#xD;
                     participants to choose a treatment option and, if the participant so chooses,&#xD;
                     a referral will be made based on the receiving treatment providers'&#xD;
                     procedures. These participants will not have access to the BNI chatbot but&#xD;
                     will be prompted to complete a brief FAS assessment electronically.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  BNI Chatbot: Participants will receive a link to register for the chatbot.&#xD;
                     Following registration, they will complete the initial chat, which includes&#xD;
                     instructions for the entire study. The chatbot will then guide the participant&#xD;
                     through multiple BNIs focused on the goal of bup engagement and electronically&#xD;
                     connect participants to the treatment provider of their choice. They may be&#xD;
                     offered and connected with a telehealth appointment immediately, as outlined&#xD;
                     above, and may receive the physical prescriptions immediately once released&#xD;
                     from police, probation or the courthouse. After the encounter, participants&#xD;
                     will be prompted to complete a brief FAS assessment electronically.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Baseline Assessment - Demographics and status of case in criminal justice system,&#xD;
                provided by the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participant payment ($25 gift card)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. One-month assessment (5-15 minutes, depending on group)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At 4 weeks post-randomization, participants will complete a brief follow-up&#xD;
                assessment to collect information on satisfaction of the treatment referral&#xD;
                process. Participants in the BNI Chatbot group will also provide feedback on&#xD;
                feasibility, acceptability and satisfaction of the chatbot and participants in the&#xD;
                SC group will provide feedback on feasibility, acceptability and satisfaction of&#xD;
                the electronic education and referral process. Assessments will be conducted via&#xD;
                the chatbot (BNI Chatbot group only) or in-person or by phone. To facilitate&#xD;
                scheduling, the RA will have access to all participants' scheduled probation&#xD;
                appointments during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participant payment ($25 gift card)&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study and Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of study procedures, the research team will review data for completeness&#xD;
      and attempt to complete any missing data, as possible. If patients withdraw from the study&#xD;
      early, investigators will retain data collected up until discontinuation of the study.&#xD;
