      PROACTIVE Parent is an educational program designed to improve parenting skills to more&#xD;
      effectively manage child behavior and social and emotional needs in children with depressive&#xD;
      symptoms. PROACTIVE Parent (PROviding ACcess To InnoVative &amp; Evidence-Based Intervention) is&#xD;
      a new service delivery model that uses telehealth methodology to engage parents in managing&#xD;
      their child's mental health needs. PROACTIVE Parent aims to provide parents with information&#xD;
      about their child's mental health symptoms and diagnosis, options for evidence-based&#xD;
      treatment interventions, and a free, online application for identifying appropriate and&#xD;
      accessible treatment options. PROACTIVE Parent is also designed to provide parents a deeper&#xD;
      understanding of the function of child behavior, and strategies to promote effective behavior&#xD;
      management and healthy coping. Parents will also learn skills to manage their own emotional&#xD;
      dysregulation to promote calm parental responding and healthy parent-child interaction and&#xD;
      communication. The investigators will assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness of a 10-week curricultum. Outcomes include parent reports of acceptability,&#xD;
      utility, feasibility of program elements, and the preliminary effectiveness of the program in&#xD;
      improving parent activation, parent empowerment, parent emotion dysregulation, and reducing&#xD;
      child mental health and behavioral symptoms, and barriers to treatment participation.&#xD;

      PROACTIVE Parent is an educational program designed to improve parent knowledge, capacity and&#xD;
      confidence to more effectively manage child behavior and social and emotional needs in&#xD;
      children with depressive symptoms. PROACTIVE Parent (PROviding ACcess To InnoVative &amp;&#xD;
      Evidence-Based Intervention) is a new service delivery model that uses telehealth methodology&#xD;
      to educate parents about their child's mental health (MH) symptoms and treatment, teach&#xD;
      parents skills to promote a safe, regulated environment for their youth, and teach parents&#xD;
      how to work with their child's therapists to support treatment goals at home and in the&#xD;
      community. PROACTIVE Parent will teach parents the function of child behavior, the role of&#xD;
      symptomatology in child behaviors, and strategies to promote effective behavior management&#xD;
      and healthy coping. Parents will also learn skills to manage their own emotional&#xD;
      dysregulation to promote calm parental responding and promote healthy parent-child&#xD;
      interaction and communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PROACTIVE Parent model is ideally suited to promote parent's active management of child&#xD;
      MH care. Children depend on parents to navigate a complex system of care and support&#xD;
      children's coping in the home and community. However, parents may not know how to navigate&#xD;
      appropriate treatments, how to communicate with their child's therapist to support treatment&#xD;
      goals in the home, or how to interact with their child in a way that supports positive mental&#xD;
      health outcomes. These parents require a service model that builds parent capacity to manage&#xD;
      their child's MH care. The conceptual framework for the proposed work draws on the concept of&#xD;
      parent activation and engagement in their child's MH care, and regulating affect. Activation&#xD;
      refers to the parent's knowledge, capacity, and commitment to manage their child's MH care.&#xD;
      Engagement refers to actions parents take to manage their child's care. Emotion regulation&#xD;
      skills help parents to manage their affect, to engage in calm responding to children's needs&#xD;
      and assist children in regulating affect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROACTIVE Parent is delivered in weekly 30-minute telehealth coaching sessions over the&#xD;
      course of 10 weeks. Parent coaches use motivational interviewing and psychoeducation to&#xD;
      improve parent activation and management of their child's MH care. Parent coaches provide&#xD;
      parent-training and evidence-based skills training to promote effective parent behavior,&#xD;
      healthy coping, and positive parent-child interaction. The parent coach will deliver the&#xD;
      PROACTIVE Parent model via telehealth with supplemental online resources, using a publically&#xD;
      available service referral system to connect parents to evidence-based treatments and MH&#xD;
      providers if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit Foster Parents of youth in care aged 8 - 13 years, with&#xD;
      symptoms or history of depression to examine acceptability, feasibility and preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness of the PROACTIVE Parent program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Aims of this project include an open trial, and exploration of the relationship between&#xD;
      parent activation and youth MH outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Conduct a pilot study to test acceptability, utility, feasibility, and preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness. The primary outcomes include: 1) Acceptability, 2) Usefulness, and 3)&#xD;
      Feasibility (all measured by post-session questions and post-intervention Customer&#xD;
      Satisfaction Survey; Feasibility will also include number of people referred who meet&#xD;
      eligibility, number of parents who enroll after referral, time to complete assessments). Aim&#xD;
      2: Assess the preliminary effectiveness of the model to improve parent activation, and&#xD;
      empowerment. Aim 3: Assess the preliminary effectiveness to reduce the number, severity, and&#xD;
      frequency of child MH symptoms and maladaptive behaviors. Aim 4: Assess preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness of improving parent scores on the DERS and barriers to treatment participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the PROACTIVE Parent model demonstrates feasibility and effectiveness, it could serve as a&#xD;
      model for scaling up to a population-based approach to MH treatment for all children.&#xD;
