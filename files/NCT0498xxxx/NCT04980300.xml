  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to examine the efficacy of an innovative Telehealth Physical&#xD;
      Therapy (PT) program for adults with knee osteoarthritis (OA) to increase physical activity&#xD;
      over 12 weeks in adults with knee OA compared to a control group receiving web-based&#xD;
      resources about knee OA. One hundred individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA), who are over&#xD;
      the age of 45, and are also looking to move more, will be randomized into a brief or expanded&#xD;
      intervention group. The brief intervention includes an online, guided video orientation from&#xD;
      a physical therapist to web resources for strengthening exercises, physical activity, and&#xD;
      pain management strategies for knee OA. The expanded program includes up to 5 online&#xD;
      consultations with a physical therapist over a 12-week period who will prescribe&#xD;
      strengthening exercises, physical activity goals, and pain management strategies for knee OA.&#xD;

      Delaware PEAK (Physical therapy Exercise and Activity for Knee osteoarthritis) is a delivered&#xD;
      remotely by a physical therapist over 5 one-on-one video conference (Zoom Platform)&#xD;
      consultations lasting 45 to 60 minutes each over 12 weeks. Each consultation focuses on&#xD;
      strengthening exercises, physical activity goals, and education to debunk common OA-related&#xD;
      myths and misconceptions. Delaware PEAK utilizes a well-established behavioral counseling&#xD;
      method, Motivational Interviewing, to increase self-efficacy (confidence) related to&#xD;
      exercise, while delivering all aspects of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this project is to examine the efficacy of Delaware PEAK to increase&#xD;
      physical activity in adults with knee OA compared to a control group receiving web-based&#xD;
      resources about knee OA and exercise. The rationale for our study is that there is a need to&#xD;
      examine whether PEAK can directly target the mismatch between OA recommendations and practice&#xD;
      patterns. Our central hypothesis is that Delaware PEAK will increase physical activity and&#xD;
      will increase the belief that exercise is helpful and not harmful, compared with a control&#xD;
      group receiving web-based OA treatment resources. Successful completion of this proposal will&#xD;
      provide the evidence necessary to scale up this low-cost intervention, with the goal of&#xD;
      increasing the number of adults who use exercise to manage their knee OA and thus reducing&#xD;
      the burden of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives of this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine if there is an increase in physical activity over 12 weeks among study&#xD;
           subjects receiving Delaware PEAK, i.e., the expanded intervention, compared with a&#xD;
           control group receiving an orientation to existing web-based resources, i.e., the brief&#xD;
           intervention. (H1): Adults who receive the expanded intervention will have a greater&#xD;
           increase in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) as measured by a research&#xD;
           grade accelerometer (Actigraph GT3X), compared with those receiving the brief&#xD;
           intervention over 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore changes in A) health beliefs and B) self-efficacy following PEAK. (H2):&#xD;
           Adults who receive the expanded intervention will have positive changes in health&#xD;
           beliefs for physical activity and PT, and self-efficacy for exercise compared with those&#xD;
           who receive the brief intervention over 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the Expanded Intervention arm will receive five virtual consultation sessions, delivered by a physical therapist over 12 weeks (at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 7, and 10) and lasting approximately 45-60 minutes each. Each session will focus on lower extremity strengthening exercises, physical activity (i.e., walking), and education about knee osteoarthritis. Participants will be provided with an exercise manual, tracking log, educational manual, and a step counter. Participants will be prescribed up to 6 exercises (quadriceps, hip abductor/gluteal, hamstrings/gluteal, calf, balance) and daily walking step goals. Progression will be a joint decision by the participant and physical therapist. Education will include information on knee osteoarthritis, managing pain, being active, weight loss, dealing with setbacks, and progressing activity. The physical therapist will also discuss barriers and facilitators to meeting and progressing goals as appropriate.</description>
