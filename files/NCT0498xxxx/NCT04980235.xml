  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      pelvic floor muscles play an important role in supporting the pelvic organs. Vaginal birth&#xD;
      leads to defects in pelvic muscles and hence subsequent pelvic organ prolapse and urinary and&#xD;
      fecal incontinence can occur . Transperineal ultrasonography study pelvic floor pathology&#xD;
      with minimal discomfort to the patient and lower cost than magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;

      355 eligible Egyptian women had been enrolled Maternal Medical, surgical and obstetrical&#xD;
      history was obtained. Demographic data (maternal age, maternal body mass index, duration of&#xD;
      second stage labor, episiotomy, maternal injuries, neonatal birth weight, and neonatal head&#xD;
      circumference were obtained. A modified questionnaire on symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction&#xD;
      was filled by the patients in both visits. vaginal examination with the women to detect any&#xD;
      pelvic organ prolapse (quantified according to POP-Q classification system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ultrasound volumes were acquired 7days after delivery and another examination 6weeks&#xD;
      post-delivery by one experienced sonographers using a GE Voluson p8 (GE Healthcare) equipped&#xD;
      with a 4-8-MHz curved array 3D/4D ultrasound transducer. After emptying the bladder,&#xD;
      ultrasound was done while the patient in the supine position. The probe was covered with&#xD;
      clean glove adjusted and wrapped with an adhesive tape to make it firmly contacted to the&#xD;
      probe and then placed on the perineum in the sagittal plane. The field of view angle was set&#xD;
      to a maximum of 70° in the sagittal plane and the volume acquisition angle to 85° in the&#xD;
      axial plane. Two 3D volumes (one with the patient at rest and one during Valsalva maneuver)&#xD;
      were recorded.&#xD;
