    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that 3 months' treatment with SZC versus placebo will enable RASi&#xD;
      (Irbesartan) maximisation in a cohort of patients with diabetic kidney disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inhibiting the renin angiotensin (RAS) system has been the cornerstone of therapy for&#xD;
      patients with proteinuric CKD for almost 2 decades, to slow the decline in renal function,&#xD;
      delay the presence of dialysis and reduce cardiovascular events and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence in both the cardiac and renal literature that suggests that maximising the&#xD;
      dose of RAS therapy leads to improved outcomes over smaller doses of RAS therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, many of the studies on which we base our care use doses which are higher than what&#xD;
      the majority of our patients are taking. Thus patients are being systemically undertreated by&#xD;
      therapies which have been shown to have robust reno protection. With up to 80% of patients on&#xD;
      RASi therapy are not on maximal RASi therapy , putting them at risk of a more rapid&#xD;
      progression and poorer outcomes and increased healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important reason for this is the presence or fear around hyperkalaemia. With reports of&#xD;
      significantly increased rate of hyperkalaemia seen following increases in prescribing of RASi&#xD;
      therapy. These concerns have lead NICE to recommend not starting patients on RASi therapy if&#xD;
      their potassium is &gt;5mmol/l, and KDOQI guidelines recommending consideration of stopping RASi&#xD;
      therapy if serum potassium is &gt;5.5mmol/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are thought to confer long term renal&#xD;
      protection through reduction of proteinuria. The reduction in glomerular pressure is a major&#xD;
      mechanism leading to a reduction in proteinuria, and hence renal protection, however as a&#xD;
      consequence there will also an acute fall in eGFR. Therefore, when starting/up titrating&#xD;
      ACEi/ARB it is expected that there will be an acute fall in eGFR, which is expected to be&#xD;
      more than compensated for due to the subsequent long term renal protection. Indeed, current&#xD;
      NICE guidelines do not suggest any alteration in management until the drop in eGFR is &gt;25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a currently huge unmet need to optimise RASi therapy in those patients with&#xD;
      hyperkalaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been recent advances in novel therapeutics which can lower potassium in patients.&#xD;
      One such agent is Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SZC is a highly selective inorganic cation exchanger designed to entrap potassium in the&#xD;
      intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown to effective in lowering potassium in patients with heart failure,&#xD;
      Diabetes, CKD and RASi therapy. With around a 1mmol/l fall in the serum potassium on those&#xD;
      treated with SZC, compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 5-large clinical trials it appears efficacious, well tolerated and safe.&#xD;
