  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, observational, cross-sectional, study on socio-economic burden related to&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN). Investigators will collect CIPN&#xD;
      healthcare related costs on a detailed clinical patient-level. As a sub-study, data obtained&#xD;
      in this cross-sectional study, will be compared with administrative larger datasets on&#xD;
      patients affected by cancer. The aim is to run a test for potential proxy variables which are&#xD;
      available in larger administrative datasets, even if not directly measuring CIPN, to learn&#xD;
      more about the impact of CIPN.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, cross-sectional, pilot study of chemotherapy-induced peripheral&#xD;
      neurotoxicity (CIPN) patients, aiming at ascertaining the socio-economic burden related to&#xD;
      CIPN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will collect the following information:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General medical and oncological history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological assessment formalized via:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  NCI-CTC v.5 sensory and motor&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PI-NRS&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  DN4&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  TNSc©&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Jamar grooved Pegboard test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient reported outcome measures related to CIPN:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  FACT-GOG NTX v.4©&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  EORTC CIPN20©&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Socio-economic framework: demographic characteristics and working conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sub-study is also planned. For this purpose, a comparison with administrative databases,&#xD;
      and in particular the data related to cancer patients, will be performed. Unlike the data&#xD;
      adopted in the main analysis of the cross-sectional study, the data provided by&#xD;
      administrative datasets do not include direct information on CIPN. Investigators will study&#xD;
      whether administrative datasets include variables that could be adopted as proxy for CIPN. It&#xD;
      will test the reliability of these proxy variables by comparing the expected distribution of&#xD;
      CIPN patients in the latter dataset, with the observed distribution in the outpatient dataset&#xD;
      - given specific characteristics of the patients. An analysis of this kind would support the&#xD;
      activity of policy makers engaged in the treatment of cancer-related problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: at least 75 consecutive patients who suffer from CIPN and at least 75&#xD;
      consecutive patients before chemotherapy will be enrolled to gain precise information on CIPN&#xD;
      severity and its impact on socio-economic indicators. Subjects will be evaluated once, after&#xD;
      obtaining written informed consent. A trained investigator will perform the selected&#xD;
      healthcare-assessed scales and supervise the patient-completed measures.&#xD;
