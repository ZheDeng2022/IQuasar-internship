  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a one-arm, fixed-sequence study to compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of SHR6390 in&#xD;
      absence and presence of prior administration of proton pump inhibitor Omeprazole. The&#xD;
      increased gastric pH achieved by the treatment with multiple doses of Omeprazole might affect&#xD;
      the absorption process of SHR6390.&#xD;
