  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with symptoms of voiding dysfunction may be associated with detrusor underactivity or&#xD;
      bladder outlet obstruction. However, the prevalence of detrusor underactivity and bladder&#xD;
      outlet obstruction remained obscure. Thus, the aim of this study was to elucidate the&#xD;
      prevalence of detrusor underactivity and bladder outlet obstruction in women with and without&#xD;
      symptoms of voiding dysfunction.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Between February 2005 and December 2020, all women with lower urinary tract symptoms but&#xD;
      without cystocele who visited the urogynecological department of a medical center for&#xD;
      urodynamic evaluation were reviewed. Those women who have no complete data of maximum flow&#xD;
      rate, voided volume, post-void residual volume and detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate&#xD;
      were excluded from this study. Detrusor underactivity was defined when the detrusor pressure&#xD;
      at maximum flow rate was less than 20 cmH2O, the maximum flow rate was less than 15 mL/s, and&#xD;
      the bladder voiding efficiency was less than 90 %. Bladder outlet obstruction was defined&#xD;
      when the the detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate was not less than 40 cmH2O, and the&#xD;
      maximum flow rate was less than 12 mL/s. Those women without detrusor interactivity or&#xD;
      bladder outlet obstruction were allocated to the non-DU/BOO group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATA software was used for statistical analysis. Chi2 test, univariate and multivariable&#xD;
      logistic regression test were used for statistical analysis as appropriate. A p &lt; 0.05 was&#xD;
      considered as statistically significant.&#xD;
