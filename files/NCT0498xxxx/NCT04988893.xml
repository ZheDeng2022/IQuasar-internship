      The prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically recently. Obesity is a pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      state which leads to chronic low grade inflammation having different systemic effects. This&#xD;
      may make obesity an independent risk factor for severe acute postoperative pain. No&#xD;
      prospective studies have been conducted to specifically evaluate the quality of recovery&#xD;
      after caesarean delivery for women with morbid obesity when compared to non-obese&#xD;
      parturients. In addition, while there is biological plausibility to infer worse pain scores&#xD;
      in parturients with obesity, the magnitude of this difference is unknown and information&#xD;
      guiding adjustments in pain management are lacking.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically over the recent past in both developed&#xD;
      and developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is a pro-inflammatory state which leads to chronic low grade inflammation. It has&#xD;
      been well studied that this very inflammation and oxidative stress is responsible for&#xD;
      cardiovascular pathologies seen in these patients. As a result, the post-operative period is&#xD;
      characterized by a phase of prolonged systemic inflammatory response, which makes obesity an&#xD;
      independent risk factor for severe acute pain. As a matter of fact, an extreme rise in IL-6&#xD;
      in patients with obesity has been demonstrated post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, adipose tissue acts as an endocrine organ by releasing a number of other&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory proteins. Cytokines are known to promote various metabolic, hemodynamic and&#xD;
      immunologic changes post-surgery, and in the setting of exaggerated inflammatory response can&#xD;
      lead to increased pain and hemodynamic instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very few studies have evaluated the recovery experience of patients with obesity in the acute&#xD;
      postoperative period. Patients with obesity undergoing general abdominal surgery have been&#xD;
      shown to have worse surgical outcomes, increased complication rates, and increased analgesic&#xD;
      requirements.7 However, in spine surgery, there have been conflicting evidence supporting a&#xD;
      difference in pain scores in patients with obesity. Despite there being no clear guidelines&#xD;
      on post-operative pain control between these two groups, providers reported prescribing less&#xD;
      opioid analgesics post-operatively to patients with obesity when compared to patients not&#xD;
      suffering from this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Obstetric Quality of Recovery Score (ObsQoR) was initially developed and validated as a&#xD;
      measure of patient reported outcome after caesarean delivery. It started as an 11-item&#xD;
      questionnaire (ObsQoR-11), which was further simplified to 10-items (ObsQoR-10) following&#xD;
      patient feedback where moderate and severe pain questions were combined into a single item.&#xD;
      This tool measures pain, nausea or vomiting, dizziness, shivering, comfort, mobility, ability&#xD;
      to hold and feed the baby, personal hygiene maintenance, and feeling in control, to provide a&#xD;
      global inpatient postpartum quality of recovery score out of 100. A systematic review&#xD;
      assessing measurement properties of available patient-reported outcome measures using COSMIN&#xD;
      (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments) methodology,&#xD;
      recommended ObsQoR as the best available instrument to measure functional recovery following&#xD;
      caesarean delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No prospective studies have been conducted to specifically evaluate the quality of recovery&#xD;
      after caesarean delivery for women with morbid obesity when compared to non-obese&#xD;
      parturients. In addition, while there is biological plausibility to infer worse pain scores&#xD;
      in parturients with obesity, the magnitude of this difference is unknown and information&#xD;
      guiding adjustments in pain management are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that parturients with Class 3 obesity experience impaired&#xD;
      quality of recovery scores after elective cesarean delivery as measured by the ObsQoR-10 when&#xD;
      compared to non-obese parturients.&#xD;
