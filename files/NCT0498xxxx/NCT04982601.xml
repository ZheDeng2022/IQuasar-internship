    <textblock>
      Aims:The study was conducted to investigate the effect of Yoga-based exercise program on&#xD;
      pain, range of motion(ROM), sleep quality, depression and quality of life in female patients&#xD;
      with myofascial pain dysfunction(MPD) of temporomandibular disorders .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: MPD will be included in the study. Yoga based exercise program will be performed to&#xD;
      the first group as 3 times in a week for 6 weeks. The second group will be the control group.&#xD;
      Outcome measurements; pain ,sleep quality, depression and quality of life will be evaluated.&#xD;
      Evaluations will be repeated before and 6 weeks after exercise.&#xD;

      Before the treatment, evaluations made immediately after the 6-weeks exercise program ended.&#xD;
      As the primary outcome measures; jaw pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Neck Pain And Disability&#xD;
      Scale (NPDS), neck and jaw range of motion (ROM) measurements; for secondary outcome&#xD;
      measurements; the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PUQI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and&#xD;
      Short Form 36 (SF36) are used. All measurements are repeated at the 6th week after yoga&#xD;

    <description>Pain intensity felt in the chin was evaluated with VAS at rest. They were asked to draw their pain level on a 10 cm scale between 0-10 points as 0=no pain, 10 unbearable pain</description>

    <measure>Neck Pain And Disability Scale (NPDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is examined with Neck Pain and Disability Scale (NPDS). The severity of neck pain, duration of symptoms, and the disability of each item in the specified activities are evaluated. Each item is scored between 0-5 points. The total score is the sum of the points in each item and ranges from 0 to 100. High scores indicate more severe pain and effect</description>

    <measure>Neck and jaw range of motion (ROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The neck and chin area of the patients were measured with a ROM universal goniometer. While neck normal joint motion flexion (0-65 째), extension (50 째), lateral flexion (45 째) and rotation (60-80 째) were measured, TMJ movements, mandibular depression, protrusion, deviation movements were measured. Measurements were taken 3 times and the mean value was recorded</description>

    <measure>Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PUQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a questionnaire that evaluates sleep quality with questions asked in 7 main topics as: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficacy, sleep disorders, use of sleep medication and daytime functions.
