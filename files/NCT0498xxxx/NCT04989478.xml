    <textblock>
      This study aims to describe the dynamic changes in nutritional biomarkers in the blood during&#xD;
      the postprandial period, i.e. the time period from the last meal and into the fasting state.&#xD;
      In total 36 healthy, young men and women will be recruited in Bergen, Norway, and after&#xD;
      receiving a standardized breakfast meal they will consume only water for the next 24 hours.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Throughout the day, humans switch back and forth between the fed, postprandial (after a&#xD;
      meal), and the postabsorptive (fasting) metabolic state. This is followed by a shift in fuel&#xD;
      utilization from primarily using glucose to predominantly rely on Î²-oxidation of fatty acids.&#xD;
      Consequently, circulating concentrations of biomarkers may fluctuate in response to this&#xD;
      changing metabolic state. Much is known about the hormonal and metabolic effects of fasting,&#xD;
      including lower insulin secretion, increased release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue,&#xD;
      increased ketogenesis, glycogen breakdown, and activated gluconeogenesis. However, less is&#xD;
      known about the effect on other biochemical markers in the postabsorptive period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When evaluating nutritional biomarkers, both in clinical practice and in research, it is&#xD;
      common practice to distinguish between fasting or non-fasting blood samples, based on time&#xD;
      since the last meal. The extent to which different biomarkers are influenced by fasting&#xD;
      status vary, and accordingly, several diagnostic cutoffs, e.g. plasma glucose for diabetes&#xD;
      diagnosis, vary according to whether the sample was fasting or not. However, as the&#xD;
      adaptation to fasting is a gradual process, it is expected that any changes in biomarker&#xD;
      concentrations are also gradual. Further, as circulating metabolite concentrations are&#xD;
      determined as a result of input (intestinal absorption and release from tissues), metabolism,&#xD;
      and removal (utilization, storage, and excretion), we cannot reasonably assume that these&#xD;
      changes are linear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few previous studies have aimed at describing the dynamics of fasting metabolism,&#xD;
      demonstrating that the circulating metabolome changes during prolonged fasting in a dynamic&#xD;
      manner. However, as data collection started after an overnight fast period, these studies do&#xD;
      not provide data on the initial postprandial period and the adaptation to the fasting state.&#xD;
      This study will extend the knowledge on the dynamics of human postprandial metabolism, by&#xD;
      monitoring circulating concentrations of biomarkers during the 24 hours after a standardized&#xD;
      breakfast meal. The investigators aim to capture the adaptation period from the fed to the&#xD;
      fasting state and provide time-resolved data on a broad range of nutritional biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled participants will attend the study center after an overnight fast, following a&#xD;
      standardized evening meal consumed 12 hours before attendance. Anthropometric measurements&#xD;
      (body weight, height, waist circumference, and body composition) will be taken in the fasting&#xD;
      state, and a fasting blood sample will be drawn. After completing a standardized breakfast&#xD;
      meal, the participants will remain at the study center for 12 hours, and blood will be&#xD;
      frequently collected at specified time points. The participants will return to the study&#xD;
      center the following morning for a final 24h fasting blood sample.&#xD;
