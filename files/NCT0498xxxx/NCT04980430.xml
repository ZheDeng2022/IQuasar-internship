  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Virtual reality (VR) is a relatively new, emerging field within healthcare. Studies have&#xD;
      analyzed public perceptions of virtual reality in healthcare using social media, but few have&#xD;
      actually demonstrated and educated these modalities to communities. Because vision care can&#xD;
      be costly and inaccessible, especially in communities with few physicians, this study aims to&#xD;
      evaluate whether communities would be open to new technology. For example, it has been&#xD;
      determined that 80% of vision loss is preventable with adequate screening technology, a key&#xD;
      factor in ameliorating the economic and emotional burden of eye disease. Therefore, through&#xD;
      demonstrations and educational presentations by medical students, gaps in understanding&#xD;
      perceptions, willingness to adopt, and general demographics of those seeking better eye care&#xD;
      will be understood.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is critical to show healthcare leaders that communities seek new, lower cost, and&#xD;
      more accessible technologies for vision care. This study will also be used to expand use of&#xD;
      the technology in other communities and prove a use case for it. Ultimately, this can help&#xD;
      benefit communities to ensure that all are receiving proper vision care and to address common&#xD;
      conditions in a timely manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants agree to participate, individuals will be educated about vision care and the&#xD;
      use of virtual reality technology by a medical student or trained volunteer using a VR&#xD;
      headset. This entire process will take about 5 minutes. Participants will be allowed to take&#xD;
      breaks and medical students and/or volunteers will be nearby to answer any questions they may&#xD;
      have throughout the study. There will be no results given to patients during the study nor&#xD;
      will they be advised to use any information to inform future healthcare decisions. The&#xD;
      purpose of the study is demonstrative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the demonstration, a survey will be given to each participant about their experience&#xD;
      with the VR technology along with demographic information. This will be kept confidential and&#xD;
      will only be accessed by those approved. The survey will take approximately 5 minutes. In&#xD;
      addition, we will offer educational materials on the conditions that the vision tests are&#xD;
      used to screen for.&#xD;
