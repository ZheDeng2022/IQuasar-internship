    <textblock>
      Establish of high-risk screening criteria to earlier identify possible childhood LOPD for&#xD;
      early treatment and better prognosis. Therefore, validation of the high-risk screening&#xD;
      criteria for childhood LOPD will be critical for identifying children of LOPD in Taiwan.&#xD;
