    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open label study to investigate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of osimertinib plus bevacizumab versus osimertinib montherapy in treatment-naïve&#xD;
      recurrent or metastatic NSCLC patients harbouring EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Enrolled patients will be randomized 1:1, the experimental arm is osimertinib plus&#xD;
      bevacizumab, while the control arm is osimertinib monotherapy. Osimertinib monotherapy arm is&#xD;
      dosed at a 80 mg once per day; osimertinib plus bevacizumab arm is dosed at osimertinib 80 mg&#xD;
      orally once every day combined with bevacizumab 15mg/kg by intravenous drip infusion on day 1&#xD;
      of a 21-day (within 3 days) cycle. All treatment will be done continuously until RECIST&#xD;
      1.1-defined progression as assessed by the Investigator or another discontinuation criterion&#xD;
      is met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo the efficacy assessments based on RECIST 1.1 assessment criterion every&#xD;
      6 weeks, until disease progression as assessed by the Investigator. The follow-up assessment&#xD;
      after disease progression will be repeated every 12 weeks until study complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, patients will undergo the safety assessment in the whole treatment period and&#xD;
      28-day safety follow-up after discontinued study drug for any reason or study complete.&#xD;
