  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if it is feasible to use neoadjuvant immunotherapy (or immunotherapy plus&#xD;
      chemotherapy) to reduce treatment intensity and improve long-term quality of life while&#xD;
      maintaining very high cure rates.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will receive 3 cycles/9 weeks of Cemiplimab (IV infusion) prior to curative&#xD;
      treatment, with or without Carboplatin/Paclitaxel. The addition of carboplatin and paclitaxel&#xD;
      depends on the presence of measurable benefit to participant. Assessments of patient progress&#xD;
      are conducted weekly by multidisciplinary team and at week 9 or 10 a de-escalation decision&#xD;
      will also be used to determine if patient receives de-escalated or non-minimally de-escalated&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      De-Escalated Treatment: Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS) or Low Dose Radiation Therapy (42Gy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-Minimally De-Escalated Treatment: Surgery + Post-Operative Radiation Therapy or 60 Gy&#xD;
      Chemoradiation Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curative intent will be followed by adjuvant Cemiplimab for 4 months (5 doses every 21 days).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) is a 20 item quality of life instrument specifically focusing on swallowing. The total score ranges from 20 to 100 with the higher score indicating higher level of function. Each item is scored on a 5 point Likert scale (strongly disagree, disagree, no opinion, agree, strongly agree).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life as measured by the Sydney Swallow Questionnaire (SSQ).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The SSQ consists of 17 questions, (16 visual analogue scales (VAS) and one question scored on a Likert scale (0-5). The score for each VAS question is the distance in mm from the origin (left extremity) to the patient's mark on the visual analogue scale. The total score is calculated by summing the 16 individual VAS scores and the Likert scale (0-5) multiplied by 20. Thus converting the range of possible scores for Likert question from 0-5 to 0-100, consistent with the remaining 16 questions, to yield a total score out of a possible maximum of 1700. Higher scores indicate higher symptomatic severity of oral-pharyngeal dysphagia.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have pathologically confirmed HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinoma of the oropharynx. Confirmed HPV-positive disease of other subsites are&#xD;
             uncommon but also eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HPV testing must be compliant with the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) positivity is sufficient to enroll and initiate&#xD;
                  treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  p16 IHC positivity is to be validated using an HPV nucleic acid based secondary&#xD;
                  assay (HPV ISH, HPV polymerase chain reaction (PCR), HPV ctDNA) before or during&#xD;
                  the neoadjuvant phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HPV DNA in situ hybridization (ISH) is acceptable if positive, however a negative HPV&#xD;
             DNA ISH should be confirmed by HPV RNA ISH or other nucleic acid based method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HPV16 type (non-HPV16 related cancers are not eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In the rare event that a subject starts treatment based on p16 IHC alone and HPV&#xD;
                  type determination is not yet available, subject may commence neoadjuvant&#xD;
                  treatment based on p16 IHC alone, as along as HPV nucleic acid testing is&#xD;
                  pending. Patients with non-HPV16 associated tumors will have to leave the study.&#xD;
                  Given the prevalence of HPV16 (~90-95%) and usual rapid turnaround of HPV16&#xD;
                  RNA-ISH (other assays) this is not expected, but the primary goal is not to have&#xD;
                  unnecessary treatment delay for subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of ≥10 unstained 5 micron slides. Subjects who cannot fulfill this&#xD;
             requirement will need to undergo a new biopsy prior to enrollment on study.&#xD;

             residual nodal disease, or surgical biopsy/excision of the tumor with residual disease&#xD;
             is acceptable).&#xD;

                  prior to start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  The standard Cockcroft and Gault formula or the measured glomerular&#xD;
                       filtration rate must be used to calculate creatinine clearance for&#xD;
                       enrollment or dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must sign a study-specific informed consent form prior to study entry.&#xD;
             Subjects should have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sex, and Reproductive Status:&#xD;

               -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) as defined as premenopausal woman capable&#xD;
                  of becoming pregnant), must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
                  (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to&#xD;
                  the start of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women must not be breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the&#xD;
                  duration of treatment with study drug(s) plus 5 half-lives of study drug(s) plus&#xD;

                  completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for&#xD;
                  method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drug(s) plus&#xD;
                  5 half-lives of study drug(s) plus 90 days (duration of sperm turnover) for up to&#xD;

             cardiomyopathy, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric&#xD;
