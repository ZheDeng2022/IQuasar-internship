  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of the BackInAction research study is to determine the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      standard course of acupuncture (15 sessions of acupuncture over 3 months) and an enhanced&#xD;
      course of acupuncture (an additional 6 sessions of acupuncture over months 4-6) in improving&#xD;
      back-related disability in older adults (65+ years) with chronic low back pain compared to&#xD;
      usual care alone. Key secondary aims are to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture in&#xD;
      improving a composite score of pain intensity and pain interference.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: A critical gap exists in evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      treatments for older adults (65+ years) with chronic low back pain. Acupuncture has been&#xD;
      found to be effective in treating chronic low back pain in younger adults. Yet trials have&#xD;
      rarely included older adults, who have more comorbidities and may respond differently than&#xD;
      typical trial participants. BackInAction has been designed to address this gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The main goal of BackInAction is to evaluate the effectiveness of a standard course&#xD;
      of acupuncture (up to 15 sessions of acupuncture over 3 months) and an enhanced course of&#xD;
      acupuncture (up to an additional 6 sessions of acupuncture over months 4-6) in improving&#xD;
      back-related disability in older adults with chronic low back pain compared to usual care&#xD;
      alone. Key secondary aims are to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture in improving a&#xD;
      composite score of pain intensity and pain interference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Outcomes: In this pragmatic, three-arm parallel groups multi-site randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial, the investigators will recruit and randomize 789 adults â‰¥ 65 years of age&#xD;
      with chronic low back to standard acupuncture, enhanced acupuncture, or usual medical care&#xD;
      alone in four health-care systems. These include two integrated health care systems, a&#xD;
      fee-for-service system and a network of federally qualified health centers. Primary outcome&#xD;
      data will be collected by questionnaire at 3-, 6-, and 12-months post-randomization. In&#xD;
      addition, short monthly surveys will capture data on physical function and a composite score&#xD;
      of pain intensity and pain interference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions and Duration: Standard acupuncture will consist of 3 months (90 days) of&#xD;
      acupuncture needling, with a proposed minimum of 8 treatments and a maximum of 15. Enhanced&#xD;
      acupuncture will include the standard acupuncture plus an additional 3-month maintenance&#xD;
      period, with a maximum of six additional treatments. Usual medical care will consist of the&#xD;
      care that individuals receive according to their insurance benefits plus anything else they&#xD;
      pay for out of pocket. The investigators will ask those assigned to usual medical care to&#xD;
      avoid acupuncture for the year they are enrolled in the study. Both active treatment arms&#xD;
      will also have access to usual medical care. Participants will be enrolled in the study for&#xD;
      12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Population: BackInAction will include patients at least 65 years of age with&#xD;
      uncomplicated chronic low back pain with or without radiculopathy. The investigators plan to&#xD;
      enroll a total of 789 participants (263 per study arm). Participants will be recruited from&#xD;
      four health plans, with varying numbers of participants from each site. Randomization will be&#xD;
      stratified by health care system, age category and gender. The investigators expect the&#xD;
      racial and ethnic mix will roughly parallel that of the older Medicare population.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in back-related disability at 6-month post randomization (continuous)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6-month</time_frame>
    <description>Change in back-related disability is defined as score change in Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), a 24-item questionnaire which asked whether 24 specific activities were limited due to back pain during the past week. The RMDQ is scored from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating more disability. Greater change between baseline and 6-months would indicate greater improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Study primary outcome timepoint: Baseline to 6 months; Test of Standard Acupuncture: Baseline to 3 months; Test of Maintenance effect: Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MCID is measured by a 30% improvement (reduction) on the RMDQ. Because the MCID reflects clinical improvement, this measure indicates what proportion of individuals in each study group improved at least 30% at each follow-up timepoint on the RMDQ.</description>

    <description>Change in pain intensity and pain interference with enjoyment of life and general activity will be measured by PEG, a 3-item pain-intensity and pain-related interference composite measure assessing pain intensity, and pain interference with enjoyment of life and general activity. Each item is measured by a 0 to 10 scale with 10 indicating greater pain intensity or pain interference. The scores are then averaged with a higher average score indicating greater pain interference/intensity.</description>

    <description>The MCID is measured by a 30% improvement (reduction) on the PEG. Because the MCID reflects clinical improvement, this measure indicates what proportion of individuals in each study group improved at least 30% for a particular follow-up timepoint on the PEG.</description>

    <time_frame>Study primary outcome timepoint: Baseline to 6 months; Test of Standard Acupuncture: Baseline to 3 months; Test of Maintenance effect: Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement and Information System (PROMIS) Physical functioning short form 6b from the PROMIS-29 (6 items). The 6-item Physical function scale measures self-reported ability to perform activities rather than the actual performance of those activities. Each question has five response options, ranging from one to five. Raw scores range from 6 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater ability. The scores are then standardized using a T-score metric in which 50 is the reference mean and 10 is the standard deviation (SD) of that population.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient global impression of change (PGIC) at 3-, 6-, and 12- months</measure>
    <time_frame>Study primary outcome timepoint: 6 months; Test of Standard Acupuncture: 3 months; Test of Maintenance effect: 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Global Impression of Change in Overall Pain (1 item). This is a 0 to 6 scale ranging from much worse to much better, with higher scores indicating more improvement.</description>
