  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tabula Rasa HealthCare (TRHC), doing business as CareKinesis, is the first national pharmacy&#xD;
      that provides science-based medication risk identification and mitigation technologies and&#xD;
      services. CareKinesis utilizes medication decision support tools and pharmacists certified in&#xD;
      geriatrics to provide pharmacy services for various healthcare organizations including PACE&#xD;
      organizations (described above). Presently, CareKinesis services more than 35 PACE&#xD;
      organizations, including approximately 100 PACE sites, across the United States. As a&#xD;
      national PACE pharmacy provider since 2011, CareKinesis focuses on improving medication&#xD;
      regimens to reduce medication-related risks while enhancing economic, clinical and humanistic&#xD;
      outcomes. Pharmacist-led PGx clinical services and medication safety reviews are currently&#xD;
      being offered to PACE organizations under the direction of licensed healthcare prescribers by&#xD;
      TRHC (CareKinesis). Our aim is to extend and meticulously study PGx testing for more PACE&#xD;
      patients and conduct a prospective preemptive PGx study to determine feasibility of&#xD;
      implementation and effect on outcomes. After mutual agreement, these services may also be&#xD;
      extended to other organizations where TRHC provides pharmacy services, and data will be&#xD;
      collected with patient consent.&#xD;

      This project aims to include patients enrolled in PACE organizations or other healthcare&#xD;
      organizations serviced by TRHC. PGx testing will be performed by a vendor contracted by TRHC&#xD;
      (CLIA certified). Genetic testing for CYP450 isoforms like CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6,&#xD;
      and CYP3A5, and transporters like SLCO1B1, ABCB1, and ABCG2 will be conducted, along with&#xD;
      other genes in individual vendors' testing panel. The results will be integrated into TRHC's&#xD;
      proprietary CDSS (Medication Risk Mitigation Matrix, Tabula Rasa Healthcare, Moorestown, NJ).&#xD;
      Phenotypes related to CYP450 isoforms will be used to guide pharmacists to identify drug-drug&#xD;
      interactions (DDIs), drug-gene interactions (DGIs), and drug-drug-gene interactions&#xD;
      (DDGIs).(16) Clinical pharmacists will translate PGx results combined with a comprehensive&#xD;
      DDI review into actionable clinical recommendations. Prescribers will review the pharmacist's&#xD;
      recommendation, and based on their clinical assessment will decide whether or not to&#xD;
      implement the therapy recommendation. Endpoints like number and type of pharmacist&#xD;
      recommendations and uptake by physicians, follow-up drug regimens, and outcomes will be&#xD;
      collected for up to 12 months [baseline (data from the previous year), 3, 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      post-PGx intervention] for each patient to get a longitudinal perspective of implementing PGx&#xD;
      into CDSS systems.&#xD;

        Tabula Rasa Healthcare (TRHC) partners with Programs of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly&#xD;
        (PACE) that provides comprehensive medical and supportive services for community-dwelling&#xD;
        persons, mostly older adults (&gt;55 years), as an alternative to institutionalization. The&#xD;
        aim of PACE is to improve overall quality of life in four domains (physical, psychological,&#xD;
        social, and spiritual) using a multidisciplinary approach.&#xD;
