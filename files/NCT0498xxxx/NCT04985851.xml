    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomised, multicenter, Phase II study. This study is planned to&#xD;
      enroll 80 eligible patients to receive durvalumab combined with up to 4 cycles of etoposide&#xD;
      and platinum-based chemotherapy (EP). And approximately 64 patients who complete the 4 cycles&#xD;
      of durvalumab + EP treatment and don't have progressive diseases (Non-PD patients) will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive maintenance treatment durvalumab + anlotinib (Arm 1) or&#xD;
      durvalumab (Arm 2) until confirmed progressive disease. Prophylactic cranial irradiation&#xD;
      (PCI) is allowed at the investigators' discretion as per SoC guidance for ES-SCLC. Patients&#xD;
      will attend a safety follow up visit 90 days after last dose of durvalumab. Tumor assessments&#xD;
      will be performed at Screening with follow-up at Week 6 ±1 week and Week 12 ±1 week from the&#xD;
      date of the first cycle treatment, and then every 8 weeks ±1 week until confirmed objective&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;

      Target subject population Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with histologically or&#xD;
      cytologically documented extensive disease (American Joint Committee on Cancer Stage (8th&#xD;
      edition) IV SCLC [T any, N any, M1 a/b]), or T3-4 due to multiple lung nodules that are too&#xD;
      extensive or have tumor/nodal volume that is too large to be encompassed in a tolerable&#xD;
      radiation plan. Patients must have World Health Organization/Eastern Cooperative Oncology&#xD;
      Group performance status of 0-1, weight &gt; 30 kg and adequate organ and marrow function. All&#xD;
      patients are suitable for firstline platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of treatment Unless specific treatment discontinuation criteria are met, patients in&#xD;
      Arms 1 and 2 will continue therapy until disease progression, as per investigator assessment.&#xD;
      Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration Durvalumab 1500 mg will be&#xD;
      administered for all patients via IV infusion concurrently with EP q3w starting on week 0 for&#xD;
      4 cycles. Non-PD patients who completed the 4 cycles of Durvalumab + EP will be randomized&#xD;
      1:1 into Arm 1 and Arm 2. Eligible patients should begin continuous treatment in 3 days after&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1: Durvalumab 1500 mg monotherapy will be continued q4w. Anlotinib will be&#xD;
           administered according to prescribing information in general use. The dose is 12mg, QD,&#xD;
           PO, 14 days-on and 7 days-off.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  N.B. If a patient's weight falls to 30 kg or below (≤30 kg) the patient should receive&#xD;
           weight-based dosing equivalent to 20 mg/kg of durvalumab until the weight improves to&#xD;
           &gt;30 kg, at which point the patient should start receiving the fixed dosing of durvalumab&#xD;
           1500 mg. Anlotinib is available at three dose levels, 12 mg, 10 mg, and 8 mg. Dose&#xD;
           reduction may take place whenever toxicity that is not controlled with optimal&#xD;
           supportive care is noted during the study. If a subject subsequently tolerates treatment&#xD;
           well at that level in the judgment of the investigator, the dose may be increased to the&#xD;
           next dose level. If a subject cannot tolerate treatment after dose reduction to 8 mg,&#xD;
           treatment will be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2: Durvalumab 1500 mg monotherapy will be continued q4w.&#xD;
