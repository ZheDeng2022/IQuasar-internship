  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether the combination of rituximab and high dose&#xD;
      methylprednisolone can be given together, can reduce the amount of cancer cells that are&#xD;
      present prior to starting venetoclax, and therefore make it safer to take venetoclax.&#xD;
      Patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic&#xD;
      lymphoma (SLL) will be treated in this study. Subjects will be assessed for their risk of&#xD;
      tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), a potentially serious side effect associated with venetoclax and&#xD;
      rituxan. TLS is caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells. TLS can lead to kidney failure&#xD;
      or abnormal heart rhythm. Depending on their TLS risk, patients will be assigned to one of&#xD;
      two treatment arms. Patients who are at high risk for TLS at baseline will receive&#xD;
      HDMP/Rituximab for 1 cycle before beginning venetoclax. Patients who are at low risk for TLS&#xD;
      at baseline will not receive HDMP/Rituximab and will instead start directly with venetoclax.&#xD;
      Once the proper dose of venetoclax is reached, both arms will continue venetoclax for up to 2&#xD;
      years and receive rituximab for 5 cycles. The purpose is to determine if HDMP/Rituximab prior&#xD;
      to venetoclax is efficient at reducing tumor burden and lowering the risk of developing TLS.&#xD;
      Although all of these drugs are approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with CLL or&#xD;
      SLL, and although the combination of rituximab and venetoclax is approved by the FDA for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with CLL or SLL, the combination and dosing schedule in this trial are&#xD;
      considered experimental.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the percentage of patients who have a reduction of lymphadenopathy (from&#xD;
      greater than to less than 5 cm in largest diameter) and/or absolute lymphocyte count (from&#xD;
      greater than to less than 25k/uL) following 1 or 2 cycles of HDMP + rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the rate of laboratory or clinical TLS with this strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the safety (CTCAE4) of this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the overall efficacy (iwCLL) of this overall strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the percentage of patients who have undetectable minimal residual disease&#xD;
           in the bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Percentage of patients that have a decrease in tumor burden from levels of disease that&#xD;
      meet &quot;Medium/High-tumor burden&quot; criteria to meet &quot;Low tumor burden&quot; criteria for disease&#xD;
      burden following 1 or 2 cycles of HDMP + Rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Percentage of patients that have a decrease in tumor burden from levels of disease that&#xD;
           meet &quot;Medium/High-tumor burden&quot; c criteria to meet &quot;Low tumor burden&quot; criteria for&#xD;
           disease burden following 1 cycle of HDMP + Rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Percentage of patients that have a decrease in tumor burden from levels of disease that&#xD;
           meet &quot;Medium/High-tumor burden&quot; criteria to meet &quot;Low tumor burden&quot; criteria for disease&#xD;
           burden following 2 cycles of HDMP + Rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rate of laboratory TLS (from start of treatment until completion of venetoclax ramp-up)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Rate of clinical TLS (from start of treatment until completion of venetoclax ramp-up)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Adverse events by CTCAE4 definitions&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Overall Response rate, Partial Response rate, and Complete response rate per iwCLL&#xD;
           criteria after 9 months of venetoclax and at completion of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD) rate based on bone marrow biopsy after 9&#xD;
           months of venetoclax, and at completion of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single center, open-label, pilot/feasibility study to determine the feasibility of HDMP/R as&#xD;
      a debulking approach prior to venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CLL/SLL who require therapy, and have disease burden meeting criteria for&#xD;
      Medium or High Risk Tumor Burden (based on: lymph nodes &gt;/= 5 cm in diameter and/or absolute&#xD;
      lymphocyte count &gt;/= 25k/uL) are enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive HDMP + Rituximab for 1 cycle, followed by reassessment of Tumor&#xD;
           Burden,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If Tumor Burden classification is low after HDMP + Rituximab (lymph nodes &lt; 5cm in&#xD;
           diameter AND absolute lymphocyte count &lt; 25k/uL), patients will initiate venetoclax dose&#xD;
           ramp-up, with ramp-up schedule according to venetoclax package insert.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who still have a disease burden (lymphadenopathy &gt; 5 cm or ALC &gt; 25k/iL) that&#xD;
           meets criteria for medium or high risk of TLS after 1 cycle of HDMP + Rituximab are&#xD;
           given the option to repeat a 2nd cycle of HDMP + Rituximab prior to venetoclax dose&#xD;
           ramp-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of ramp-up (venetoclax to 400 mg), all patients will continue Venetoclax 400&#xD;
      mg (or highest tolerated dose) for up to 2 years. Patients will also continue rituximab 500&#xD;
      mg/m2 q 28 days through Cycle 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of the disease burden after a maximum of 2 cycles of HDMP + Rituximab is the&#xD;
           primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assessment of the disease burden after 1 cycle of HDMP + Rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessment of the disease burden after 2 cycles of HDMP + Rituximab (for the subset of&#xD;
           patients that do not meet criteria for low tumor burden after 1 cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clinical and laboratory TLS events between start of treatment and the completion of&#xD;
           venetoclax dose-ramp up (Cycle 2, Day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Presence or absence of detectable MRD in the marrow will be assessed after approximately&#xD;
           9 months of venetoclax and completion of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Radiology assessment after approximately 9 months of venetoclax and completion of study&#xD;
           (unless prior imaging studies are without measurable disease)&#xD;
