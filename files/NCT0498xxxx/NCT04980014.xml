    <textblock>
      The purpose of this post marketing surveillance (PMS) study is to estimate the proportion of&#xD;
      all adverse events (AEs) including serious adverse events (SAEs) and serious adverse drug&#xD;
      reactions (SADRs) in participants who are treated for type 2 diabetes mellitus under&#xD;
      NesinaAct® tablet therapy (alogliptin/pioglitazone) once daily by physicians in the&#xD;
      real-world clinical practice setting over a period of 26 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this survey is called NesinaAct® tablet. A surveillance is planned&#xD;
      to examine safety and effectiveness of NesinaAct® tablet therapy in participants who are&#xD;
      being treated for type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 730 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study observes percentage of participants with adverse events (AEs) including serious&#xD;
      adverse events (SAEs) and serious adverse drug reactions (SADRs) administered a dose of&#xD;
      NesinaAct® tablet (alogliptin/pioglitazone) once daily as prescribed by the physician in&#xD;
      routine practice over a period of 26 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial is conducted in a total of 19 sites in Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data is collected between October 2 2015 to August 30 2019 from the re-examination period&#xD;
      up to 26 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>An SAE is an adverse event resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Serious ADRs are defined as SAEs that are, in the investigator's opinion, of causal relationship to the study treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>First dose of surveillance drug treatment to within 30 days after the end of the treatment (up to 153 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any and all undesirable or unintended signs (including abnormal clinical laboratory values), symptoms, or disease that are incurred when the drug is administered, and is not related to causal relationship with the drug. An ADR is a harmful and unintended reaction resulting from usual administration and use of the drug, whose causal relationship with the drug cannot be excluded, and if causal relationship with the drug is unknown among AEs reported spontaneously, it is regarded as ADR. An unexpected ADR is an ADR with difference in the nature or severity, specificity, or the outcome, compared to the product licensure/notification of the drug.</description>
