  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of single and&#xD;
      multiple oral administered doses of HS-10360 in healthy subjects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, single ascending doses&#xD;
      (SAD) study followed by multiple ascending doses (MAD) clinical trial to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of HS-10360 tablet (s) in Chinese healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately five sequential dose levels will be evaluated in SAD phase. Two sentinel&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled in the first cohort and minimal 72 hours post-dose safety data will&#xD;
      be evaluated before the remaining subjects are enrolled in this cohort. Approximately three&#xD;
      sequential dose cohorts (the specific dose levels should be further determined according to&#xD;
      the SAD results) will be evaluated in MAD phase. Each subject will receive only one dose&#xD;
      regimen in this study. Safety data up to Day12 (±2) in SAD and up to Day28 (±2) in MAD will&#xD;
      be reviewed prior to the next dose level. The number of Cohorts in SAD and MAD would be&#xD;
      adjusted based on the assessment of SRC.&#xD;
