    <textblock>
      The goal of Part 1 of this clinical research study is to find the highest dose of (Imbruvica)&#xD;
      ibrutinib that can be given to patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The goal of&#xD;
      Part 2 of this clinical research study is to learn if the dose of ibrutinib found in Part 1&#xD;
      can help to control the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of this drug will also be studied in both parts of the study.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study&#xD;
      group based on when you join this study. Up to 4 groups of up to 6 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in Part 1 of the study, and up to19 participants will be enrolled in Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in Part 1, the dose of ibrutinib you receive will depend on when you join&#xD;
      this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of ibrutinib.&#xD;
      Each new group will receive a higher dose of ibrutinib than the group before it, if no&#xD;
      intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of&#xD;
      ibrutinib is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in Part 2, you will receive ibrutinib at the highest dose that was&#xD;
      tolerated in Part 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take ibrutinib pills 1 time each day, at about the same time every day. You may take&#xD;
      your dose of ibrutinib with or without food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle is 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of all cycles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Cycle 2 only, blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
           (PK) testing before your dose and then 4 more times over the next 6 hours after your&#xD;
           dose. PK testing measure the amount of study drug in the body at different timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about ½ teaspoon) or urine will be&#xD;
           collected for pregnancy testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 8 weeks, you will have a CT, MRI, or x-ray to check the status of the disease. You will&#xD;
      have the same type of scan performed as you did at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best&#xD;
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Dosing Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 30 days after your last dose of study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about ½ teaspoon) or urine will be&#xD;
           collected for pregnancy testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow Up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 6 months you will be asked to come into the clinic or you will be called by a member of&#xD;
      the study staff to ask how you are doing and if you have started any new anti-cancer&#xD;
      treatments. If you are called, it should take about 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Ibrutinib is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). It is&#xD;
      considered investigational to use this drug to treat NSCLC. The study doctor can explain how&#xD;
      the study drug is designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 43 participants will be enrolled on this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

    <time_frame>56 days</time_frame>
    <description>Primary endpoint of this study is overall response rate using RECIST 1.1 criteria. Best overall response is best response recorded from start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since treatment started). Participant's best response assignment depends on achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Disease control rate defined as rate of complete response + partial response + stable disease. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis). Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>
