      Research hypothesis: Release of levonorgestrel from Metraplant-E levonorgestrel releasing&#xD;
      intrauterine contraceptive device is inadequate to be used as a medical line of treatment of&#xD;
      dysfunctional uterine bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to evaluate the therapeutic effect of the intrauterine system&#xD;
      (Metraplant-E) in the treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding.&#xD;

      Primary outcome : The investigators aim to evaluate the short term release of levonorgestrel&#xD;
      from the Metraplant-E levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCDs).&#xD;
      This is in a trial to determine to what extent the intrauterine release of levonorgestrel&#xD;
      would reduce MBL in women with menorrhagia and if the treatment would increase the body iron&#xD;
      stores and the degree of patient satisfaction and acceptability of treatment for the patients&#xD;
      with dysfunctional uterine bleeding. This will be conducted through a questionnaire offered&#xD;
      to the women participating in this study which is designed on Likert scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Endometrial biopsy prior to and 6 months after the insertion of the intrauterine system&#xD;
      (Metraplant-E).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) Haemoglobin level measurement in gm/dl and serum ferritin level on same occasions as when&#xD;
      endometrial biopsy is done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) The amount of monthly menstrual blood loss after the insertion the Metraplant-E&#xD;
      levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine contraceptive devices using the following scores:&#xD;
      bleeding index,total bleeding score and Pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Women seeking contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Women with history of menorrhagia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pre and perimenopausal women who are married or previously married.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Failure of other medical treatment to control menorrhagia such as hemostatics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Women who did not tolerate copper IUD (intrauterine device) due to increased amount of&#xD;
           menstrual blood loss which could lead to anemia.&#xD;
