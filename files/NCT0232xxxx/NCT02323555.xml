      A prescription of injectable anticancer therapy requires the collection of medical data&#xD;
      (interview and physical examination) and often allied (laboratory tests). This requirement is&#xD;
      made on the day of the arrival of the patient to not prepare these treatments incorrectly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving the prescription of treatment, it will take about 1 hour to prepare for&#xD;
      pharmacy and more in times of high activity, to provide the day hospital pockets treatment,&#xD;
      incompressible time when the patient waits to have his treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A process has been selected (Optima) to anticipate prescribing injectable cancer treatments&#xD;
      and their manufacturing to reduce patient waiting times on the day of his coming François&#xD;
      BaclesseCentre day hospital.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the investigators daily activity evaluated patients received 65-70 day hospital,&#xD;
      assessing the feasibility of the project with an internalized platform seems most relevant to&#xD;
      completely control the process and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will consist of anticipation paramedic telephone consultation followed by a&#xD;
      medical prescription validation will trigger the production of chemotherapy prematurely&#xD;
      before the coming of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The François Baclesse Center therefore supports the idea of an early day hospital, that is to&#xD;
      say a prescription and production pockets of chemotherapy before the arrival of the patient&#xD;
      in the service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project was named PROJECT OPTIMA for &quot;Optimize requirements and preparations&#xD;
      chemotherapy Ambulatory Medicine&quot; with a paramedic telephone consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So this ambitious project is the first experience of a French advance routine injectable&#xD;
      anticancer therapies, all protocols combined in a Centre for the Fight against Cancer but&#xD;
      also in a hospital reference competent oncology and chemotherapy and whose preparation&#xD;
      process of chemotherapy administered by injection is fully internalized and centralized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting this program routine, it is essential to validate through a research project&#xD;
      concordance between paramedic telephone consultation structured using tools and medical&#xD;
      consultation but also define the profiles of patients and types of chemotherapy injectable&#xD;
      likely to benefit safely from this program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Part 1: where are compared two tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  paramedical examination conducted by telephone two days before the arrival of the&#xD;
           patient by a trained nurse, according to a predetermined grid, as a basis for medical&#xD;
           decisions prescription &quot;virtual&quot; or non-treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical examination performed on the day of the coming of the patient for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This component will run for three months and will evaluate the rate of discrepancies between&#xD;
      these 2 types of prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this period, any prescription or administration of treatment will be validated at the&#xD;
      end of the paramedical examination phones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This component will also detect and specify protocols suitable injectable cancer treatment&#xD;
      and develop a typology of patients for whom the anticipation process is more efficient and&#xD;
      more secure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, the investigators can think that the anticipation process will not be effective for&#xD;
      all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For example, a patient with a brain tumor will often diminished cognitive abilities including&#xD;
      its memory abilities. Responses to the telephone interview conducted by the nurse may be&#xD;
      incomplete or even false due to its memory disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, waiting times and patient satisfaction will be evaluated and used as a&#xD;
      reference for the second part of the study whose objective is to evaluate the benefits of&#xD;
      this early prescription used routinely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • 2nd part: It is an assessment process routinely used after defining the profile of patients&#xD;
      and types of treatment protocols, including the phone call from the nurse, the early&#xD;
      prescription of chemotherapy, early production and day, medical consultation control before&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this step will be compared to expectations time, patient satisfaction and treatment&#xD;
      wrongly prepared before and after the launch of Optima.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prerequisites:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All nurses to conduct telephone interviews will be trained on two days conducted by EFEC&#xD;
           (European School of Oncology Training) whose purpose is to explain the issues of the&#xD;
           telephone interview for resulting prescription chemotherapy for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nurses phone platform dedicated to the call of patients will experience in service,&#xD;
           allowing them to develop acuity to identify clues that signpost to important pieces of&#xD;
           information for the management of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in two stages for a period of three months each, which should&#xD;
      allow in the investigators activity to include 450 patients by step, based on 3 patient came&#xD;
      through, about 1350 came by step ..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The homepage of the day hospital service capacity is 40 places for activity 65-70 patients&#xD;
      per day. Approximately 300 patients are admitted each week with about 42 new patients each&#xD;
      week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators welcome all specialties outside of Hematology (digestive oncology, ENT and&#xD;
      Pneumology, urogynecologic, breast screening, brain tumors and sarcomas).&#xD;
