  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an important need for effective smoking cessation programs that both (a) promote the&#xD;
      effective use of pharmacological aids, such as nicotine replacement products and bupropion,&#xD;
      and (b) provide cognitive-behavioral support for stopping smoking.The Internet is an&#xD;
      increasingly attractive intervention medium for delivering behavior change interventions,&#xD;
      including smoking cessation.This study examined smoking cessation rates among adults&#xD;
      participating in a randomized controlled trial of the Smokefree Partners: 21 Days to Freedom&#xD;
      ™ program, a theoretically based, online smoking cessation program that included message&#xD;
      tailoring and interactivity combined with the live personal support of a smoking cessation&#xD;
      coach. Coaching support was provided almost entirely asynchronously via prescripted but&#xD;
      individually tailored emails.&#xD;

      The Smokefree Partners: 21 Days to Freedom combined online video, text, and interactive tools&#xD;
      to promote the effective use of pharmacological aids (PA) - nicotine replacement products and&#xD;
      bupropion (Zyban®) - and provide cognitive-behavioral support for users as they attempted to&#xD;
      stop smoking. Smoking cessation content was based on the U.S. Surgeon General's Clinical&#xD;
      Guidelines, Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence, 2008 update. Presentation of some of the&#xD;
      content (e.g., gender of the narrator, PA recommendations) was tailored to the user on&#xD;
      demographic and smoking history information provided during registration and within the&#xD;
      introductory session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two critical features provided social support and accountability. First, each user was&#xD;
      assigned a &quot;live&quot; smoking cessation coach to provide support via individually tailored phone&#xD;
      or email contacts (contact preference specified by the user). Users also received automated&#xD;
      email reminders and prompts from the program. Second, a bulletin board/forum feature was&#xD;
      added to promote social support among users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Smokefree Partners intervention was a multi-session intervention in which users&#xD;
      experienced a controlled and scheduled exposure to 21 discrete web site sessions. The program&#xD;
      required users to wait at least 10 hours between sessions (i.e., login was &quot;locked&quot; until 10&#xD;
      hours had passed after a user's previous Web site session). Carefully timed and tailored&#xD;
      coaching messages provided cessation tips and prompted users to return to the web site to&#xD;
      view the next session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program was evaluated online in a randomized clinical trial of smokers recruited through&#xD;
      major worksites across the United States. The aim of the evaluation was to determine if a&#xD;
      theoretically based, online smoking cessation program that included message tailoring and&#xD;
      interactivity combined with the live personal support of a coach would result in improved&#xD;
      quit rates when compared to a wait-list control condition.&#xD;

    <description>Current smoking status was determined with two items: (a) a stage of change measure indicating smoking status and (b) a measure indicating the number of cigarettes smoked in the past 7 days. Abstinence at 30-day posttest and 120-day follow-up was confirmed by the participant choosing both (a) the response of &quot;I do not currently smoke; I quit in the last 6 months&quot; to the stage of change measure and (b) a response of &quot;0&quot; to the question &quot;During the past 7 days, how many cigarettes did you smoke each day?&quot;</description>

Treatment users were encouraged to use pharmacological aids in their quit attempt, but smoking cessation aids were not provided.</description>
