    <textblock>
      This phase III trial studies rituximab and yttrium Y-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan to see how well&#xD;
      they work compared to rituximab alone in treating patients with untreated follicular&#xD;
      lymphoma. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's&#xD;
      immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow&#xD;
      and spread. Radioactive substances linked to monoclonal antibodies can bind to cancer cells&#xD;
      and give off radiation which may help kill cancer cells. It is not yet known whether&#xD;
      rituximab works better with or without yttrium Y-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan in treating&#xD;
      follicular lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Test the hypothesis that a single dose of Zevalin (yttrium Y-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan)&#xD;
      rituximab immunotherapy (RIT) will increase the complete remission (CR) rate over that&#xD;
      achieved with standard rituximab in patients with untreated asymptomatic follicular lymphoma&#xD;
      (FL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Test the hypothesis that Zevalin RIT will improve progression-free survival. II. Test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that Zevalin RIT will improve time to next (any) therapy and time to next&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Study the incidence of exon 2 B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 protein (bcl2) mutations in&#xD;
      patients with asymptomatic follicular lymphoma (AFL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Measure regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tissue monocytes in on-study FL tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Measure serum cytokines and vitamin D at on study and month 6. IV. Evaluate beta-2&#xD;
      microglobulin plus lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) score as a prognostic factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Measure absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), absolute monocyte count (AMC), and ALC/AMC ratio&#xD;
      at on study and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Compare quality of life as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy&#xD;
      (FACT)-Lymphoma (Lym) between arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1 and 8 and yttrium Y-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan&#xD;
      over 10 minutes on day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36,&#xD;
      48, and 60 months and then every 12 months for 5 years.&#xD;
