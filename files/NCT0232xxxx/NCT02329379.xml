      1. To elucidate the therapeutic role of levothyroxine on the patient with atypia of&#xD;
           undetermined significance (AUS) goiter, we would design a prospective, open label and&#xD;
           non-randomized trial to verify the therapeutic effects on goiter with AUS by means of&#xD;
           TSH (Thyrotropin; Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone) suppression related reduction of goiter&#xD;
           volume with subsequent alleviation of previous cytological malignant tendency. During&#xD;
           following for 1-2 years after therapy with simultaneous monitor of possible adverse&#xD;
           effects of levothyroxine (eltroxin), we collected blood samples and gathered all&#xD;
           necessary data as well as performed thyroid sonography with fine-needle aspiration (FNA)&#xD;
           for the subjects. Furthermore, we would finish our individual study for each enrolled&#xD;
           subject if his/her condition exhibited the criteria of primary end point: reduced goiter&#xD;
           volume under sono &gt;15% or cytology: benign for 2 times; operation for thyroidectomy, CAD&#xD;
           attack, refractory arrhythmia, newly DM (Diabetes Mellitus), etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To re-evaluate the current prevalence of goiter within Taiwanese adults, we recruited&#xD;
           all patients who presented possible thyroid related symptoms, such as unexplained body&#xD;
           weight loss with increased appetite, palpitation, hand tremors, neck swelling,&#xD;
           hoarseness and abnormal sensation over throat. Only the patients with goiter proven by&#xD;
           thyroid sono in euthyroid status without other preexisting major disorders can be&#xD;
           enrolled in our trial to undergo open label, non-randomized study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of goiter in Taiwanese adults was found to be 19.4% in males, 33.6% in females&#xD;
      and 25% in total about 20 years ago even though there was no iodine-deficient area reported&#xD;
      in Taiwan. The result implied that goiter not only became a quite common disorder, but also&#xD;
      deserved further investigation, particularly since 0.7% of goiter would be diagnosed as&#xD;
      thyroid cancers by means of fine-needle aspiration (FNA). However, the recent research&#xD;
      indicated 5-15% of results after fine-needle aspiration directly disclosed malignant&#xD;
      cytology. On the other hand, about 80% of initial results of FNA would appear non-malignant&#xD;
      cytology. The most common feature of them was found to be indeterminate cytology, which&#xD;
      refers to 15-30% of FNA specimens. The indeterminate cytology included follicular or Hurthle&#xD;
      cell neoplasm as well as atypia of undetermined significance (AUS). Based on the revised&#xD;
      American Thyroid Association Management Guidelines for Patients with Thyroid Nodules, people&#xD;
      would be referred to visit surgeons for surgical intervention if their reports of FNA&#xD;
      demonstrated either Hurthle cell neoplasm or follicular neoplasm without autonomously&#xD;
      functioning nodules; instead, population with AUS goiter only received observation for a&#xD;
      period of time for following. Otherwise, they would be arranged to undergo surgical&#xD;
      manipulations if any evidence of malignancy was suspected. There has been lack of sufficient&#xD;
      studies to offer therapeutic options for the patient with AUS goiter around the world up to&#xD;
      the present, especially in Taiwan. Therefore, in order to avoid unnecessary operation&#xD;
      performed upon the patient with AUS goiter and provide another effective treatment for them,&#xD;
      a well-designed, prospective clinical trial will be warranted on the patient with AUS goiter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve the goal, the pathophysiology of goiter required to be understood at first.&#xD;
      Although the actual etiology of goiter was uncertain, TSH (thyrotropin) has been regarded as&#xD;
      a major factor to induce its formation up to now. To attenuate the growth-tropic effects of&#xD;
      TSH, levothyroxine suppression therapy had been administered in the past to treat goiter,&#xD;
      particularly about the goiter with colloid nodules. Successful reduction of goiter volume was&#xD;
      found in some published papers while others did not verify the therapeutic effects of&#xD;
      levothyroxine. However, the fact that goiter with size under thyroid sonogram more than 1cm&#xD;
      required to be further examined indicated reduced volume of goiter may offer benefits&#xD;
      including amelioration of previous malignant tendency especially in AUS goiter through TSH&#xD;
      suppression therapy though some studies indicated routine suppression therapy of benign&#xD;
      thyroid nodules in iodine sufficient populations is not recommended At first, patients who&#xD;
      aged 20 to 70 with thyroid dysfunction related manifestations as goiter, palpitation or hand&#xD;
      tremors would be recruited while they visited MET OPD (Out-Patient Department) and then they&#xD;
      would be arranged to undergo thyroid sono as well as receive thyroid functional tests during&#xD;
      screening periods before the study. The patients would be eligible for the interventional&#xD;
      trial if their thyroid sonography demonstrated goiter and their thyroidal function revealed&#xD;
      euthyroid status. After careful investigations of subjects' associated histories as family&#xD;
      histories, drug histories and diet habits, the patients would be actually recruited for the&#xD;
      clinical trial with the signed informed consent. Initially, the enrolled subjects would be&#xD;
      classified into two major groups as solitary nodular goiter and multiple nodular goiter.&#xD;
      Subsequently, two subgroups would be identified from each major group by presence of&#xD;
      autoantibody of thyroglobulin or not. Thereafter, the patients would be asked to comply with&#xD;
      the guidelines of ATA (American Thyroid Association) for advanced evaluation , fine needle&#xD;
      aspiration and following if they indeed present with either goiter with more than 1 cm in&#xD;
      size or less than 1 cm with regard to typical malignant characteristics under thyroid&#xD;
      sonography, such as heterogeneous, hypoechoic, increased peri-vascularization, tall than&#xD;
      wide. Furthermore, patients with history of family MTC (Medullary Thyroid Cancer) or contact&#xD;
      of radiation or radiation therapy would be arranged to under FNA, too. The patients with&#xD;
      first FNA disclosing AUS (atypia of undetermined significance) would be arranged to receive&#xD;
      FNA again for confirmatory examination one month later and soon later those patients with&#xD;
      positive findings of AUS twice would be allowed to take eltroxin for TSH suppression therapy.&#xD;
      On the contrary, the patients would be assigned to the groups who will receive traditional&#xD;
      observation and following of thyroid sonography as well as thyroid functional tests. These&#xD;
      observed patients would receive surgical interventions if their FNA showed malignant&#xD;
      potentials as NUCLEAR GROOVING， MICROFOLLICULAR FOCI，Hurthle cell, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As to the studied patients with consecutive FNA reports indicating AUS twice would be&#xD;
      arranged to take levothyroxine (eltroxin, 0.1 mg) for therapy and its dosage would be&#xD;
      adjusted carefully after 2 weeks per each OPD visiting. Optimal therapeutic goals would be&#xD;
      regarded as subclinical hyperthyroidism and constant concentrations or dosages of eltroxin&#xD;
      would be achieved in 2 months. Thereafter, the studied subjects would be arranged to receive&#xD;
      thyroid sonography and FNA 3 months later and other necessary blood biochemistry studies for&#xD;
      following. All following information would be recorded well and completely. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint means: reduced goiter volume under sono &gt;15% or cytology: benign*2 times; operation&#xD;
      for thyroidectomy; CAD attack; refractory arrhythmia; newly DM. The pathology of all FNA&#xD;
      during the clinical trial would be judged by the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid&#xD;
      Cytopathology.&#xD;
