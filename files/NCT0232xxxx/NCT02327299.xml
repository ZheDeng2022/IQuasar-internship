  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency is a highly prevalent nutrient deficiency which is a public health problem,&#xD;
      especially in developing countries. There are several strategies to correct iron deficiency&#xD;
      in populations: besides supplementation with tablets, one of the most sustainable and&#xD;
      effective strategies on medium term has been iron fortification, the addition of iron to&#xD;
      regularly consumed foods. In fortification, the chemical nature of the compound to be added&#xD;
      plays an important role: depending on the compound sensory qualities of the fortified foods&#xD;
      can vary as well as the iron absorption. Iron pyrophosphate (FePP) and ferrous sulfate&#xD;
      (FeSO4) are two commonly used iron fortification compounds in foods such as rice, breakfast&#xD;
      cereals, pasta, flour and others. We want to test the effect of addition a food stabilizer on&#xD;
      the absorption of ferric pyrophosphate (FePP) and ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) when added to&#xD;
      bouillon, as was recently suggested by in vitro experiments in the laboratory.&#xD;
