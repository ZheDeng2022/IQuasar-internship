  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is considered as the most frequent and the most severe chronic psychotic&#xD;
      disorder. Its evolutionary modes and its clinical symptomatology remain particularly&#xD;
      heterogeneous. Moreover, the brain processes involved in schizophrenia are still far from&#xD;
      being clearly understood. Current empirical studies provide a mean duration comprised between&#xD;
      1 and 3 years without any specific diagnosis or treatment. These diagnosis issues are partly&#xD;
      based on difficulties in the early distinction between schizophrenia and bipolar affective&#xD;
      disorders (BD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results emphasize the necessity of new early indices (or endophenotypes). Such markers&#xD;
      are intended to be more specific than classical clinical manifestations. In other words, they&#xD;
      have to be absent among patients with differential diagnosis, such as BD. Among other&#xD;
      possible early indices, several electrophysiological disturbances have been explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is designed to mainly describe the N400 component among patients with schizophrenia&#xD;
      or BD. This component is classically interpreted as indexing the integration the meaning of a&#xD;
      linguistic stimulus in its preceding context. Our main hypothesis aims to show a specific&#xD;
      alteration of N400 component among patients with schizophrenia when compared to participants&#xD;
      with BD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim of this study concerns the exploration of four other event related potentials&#xD;
      (ERPs) among patients with schizophrenia or BD:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the P50 component, involved in early sensory gating processes,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the P300 component, thought to reflect attentional resource allocation and working&#xD;
           memory updating of stimulus context,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the P600 component, elicited during same paradigms than N400, and reflecting their&#xD;
           syntactic congruity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the CNV (Contingent Negative Variation), reflecting processes of motor anticipation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding to their potential 'endophenotypes' status, our aim consists in comparing the N400&#xD;
      and three other ERPs among patients with schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder. Since&#xD;
      the schizophrenic specificity of such ERPs alterations still remains rarely studied, we also&#xD;
      propose to describe the possible relations between these ERPs results and clinical scores&#xD;
      observed among patients.&#xD;

For each subject, the average of the amplitude of the nine electrodes is calculated and represents the synthetic parameter for amplitude N400.This is a quantitative parameter. Values will be compared between the two groups of subjects (G1-SCZ and G2-TAB).</description>
