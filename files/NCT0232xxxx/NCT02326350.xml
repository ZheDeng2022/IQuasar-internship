  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) causes the lungs to fail due to the collection of&#xD;
      fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema). ARDS is common in severely ill patients in Intensive&#xD;
      Care Units and is associated with a high mortality and a high morbidity in those who survive.&#xD;
      There is a large economic burden with direct healthcare costs, but also indirectly due to the&#xD;
      impact on the carer and patient through their inability to return to full time employment.&#xD;
      There is little evidence for effective drug (pharmacological) treatment for ARDS. Blood cells&#xD;
      called platelets have increasingly been recognized to play a key role in the development of&#xD;
      ARDS. There is increasing information that aspirin, a drug which is widely used to treat&#xD;
      heart disease, might be important in treating ARDS. We plan to test if aspirin will help in&#xD;
      the treatment of ARDS. To do this we will divide patients suffering from ARDS into two&#xD;
      groups, one of which will get aspirin and the other a harmless dummy (or placebo) tablet who&#xD;
      will then be followed up to determine if lung function improves. If effective this may lead&#xD;
      to further research to determine if aspirin is effective in patients with ARDS. This project&#xD;
      will also provide new information about mechanisms in the development of ARDS leading,&#xD;
      potentially, to other new treatments.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The role of aspirin as a novel therapy for ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspirin inhibits cyclo-oxygenase enzymes, therefore preventing the formation of lipid&#xD;
      mediators including thromboxane A2 (TxA2) and pro-inflammatory prostaglandins from&#xD;
      arachidonic acid. TxA2 is required for platelet degranulation and aggregation. Production of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory prostaglandins from arachidonic acid is mediated by cyclo-oxygenase-2&#xD;
      (COX-2), an enzyme induced in inflammatory and endothelial cells by cytokines, growth factors&#xD;
      and bacterial products including lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a key&#xD;
      downstream pro-inflammatory product of COX-2 activation. It can act in an auto and paracrine&#xD;
      fashion on local inflammatory and parenchymal cells to increase intracellular cyclic&#xD;
      adenosine mono-phosphate (cAMP), drive nuclear translocation of NFκB and thus the production&#xD;
      of many pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNFα and IL-8. Aspirin can also induce the&#xD;
      production of a lipoxin (aspirin-triggered 15-epi-lipoxin A4, also known as ATL). Lipoxins&#xD;
      are a group of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid which act via the&#xD;
      lipoxin A4 receptor (LXA4R) on leucocytes to inhibit free-radical formation, and reduce&#xD;
      activation of the proinflammatory transcription factors AP-1 and NFκB, all of which are&#xD;
      implicated in the development of ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with aspirin is safe and improves important surrogate clinical outcomes in adult&#xD;
      patients with ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To conduct a randomised, double-blind, allocation concealed, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial&#xD;
      of aspirin as a treatment for ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the biological effects of aspirin on pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses,&#xD;
      epithelial and endothelial function and injury and lipid inflammatory mediators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be prospectively screened daily. All patients with ARDS will be entered into a&#xD;
      screening log. If the patient is not recruited the reason will be recorded, this will ensure&#xD;
      the study can be reported in keeping with CONSORT guidelines (www.consort-statement.org).&#xD;
      Routinely collected patient demographics will also be collected on these patients. This will&#xD;
      allow comparison to identify that the study population is representative of the overall&#xD;
      cohort of patients. We have an established and effective system in place to screen and&#xD;
      identify patients with ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin&#xD;
      in the Declaration of Helsinki. The chief investigator (CI) is responsible for ensuring that&#xD;
      informed consent for trial participation is given by each patient or a legal representative.&#xD;
      An appropriately trained doctor or nurse may take consent. Appropriate signatures and dates&#xD;
      must be obtained on the informed consent documentation prior to collection of trial data and&#xD;
      administration of the trial drug. If no consent is given a patient cannot be randomised into&#xD;
      the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incapacitating nature of the condition precludes obtaining prospective informed consent&#xD;
      from participants. In this situation informed consent will be sought from a Personal Legal&#xD;
      Representative or Professional Legal representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal legal representative consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be sought from the patient's personal legal representative (Per LR) who&#xD;
      may be a relative, partner or close friend. The Per LR will be informed about the trial by&#xD;
      the responsible clinician or a member of the research team and provided with a copy of the&#xD;
      covering statement for the Per LR with an attached participant information sheet (PIS) and&#xD;
      asked to give an opinion as to whether the patient would object to taking part in such&#xD;
      medical research. If the Per LR decides that the patient would have no objection to&#xD;
      participating in the trial they will be asked to sign two copies of the Per LR consent form&#xD;
      which will then be countersigned by the person taking consent. The Per LR will retain one&#xD;
      copy of the signed consent form. The second copy will be photocopied and the photocopy placed&#xD;
      in the patients' medical records whilst the original will be retained in the trial site file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Professional legal representative consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the patient is unable to give informed consent and no Per LR is available, a doctor who is&#xD;
      not connected with the conduct of the trial may act as a professional legal representative&#xD;
      (Prof LR). The doctor will be informed about the trial by the responsible clinician or a&#xD;
      member of the research team and given a copy of the PIS. If the doctor decides that the&#xD;
      patient is suitable for entry into the trial they will be asked to sign two copies of the&#xD;
      professional legal representative consent form. The doctor will retain one copy of the signed&#xD;
      consent form. The second copy will be photocopied and the photocopy placed in the patient's&#xD;
      medical records; the original will be retained in the trial site file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective patient consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be informed of their participation in the trial by the responsible clinician or&#xD;
      a member of the research team once they regain capacity to understand the details of the&#xD;
      trial. The responsible clinician or a member of the research team will discuss the study with&#xD;
      the patient and the patient will be given a copy of the PIS to keep. The patient will be&#xD;
      asked for consent to participate in the trial and to sign two copies of the consent to&#xD;
      continue form which will then be countersigned by the person taking consent. The patient will&#xD;
      retain one copy of the signed consent form. The second copy will be photocopied and the&#xD;
      photocopy placed in the patient's medical records whilst the original will be retained in the&#xD;
      trial site file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where consent to continue is not obtained, consent from the legal representative will remain&#xD;
      valid. If the patient refuses consent, permission to use data collected to that point and to&#xD;
      access medical records for trial data will be requested from the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may withdraw or be withdrawn (by Per LR or Prof LR) from the trial at any time&#xD;
      without prejudice and consent will be requested to use the data collected to that point. If a&#xD;
      patient or Per LR requests termination of the trial drug during the treatment period, the&#xD;
      drug will be stopped but the patient will continue to be followed-up as part of the trial. If&#xD;
      a patient or a Per LR withdraws consent during trial treatment, the trial drug will be&#xD;
      stopped but permission will be sought to access medical records for data related to the&#xD;
      trial. If a patient or Per LR wishes to withdraw from the trial after completion of trial&#xD;
      treatment, permission to access medical records for trial data will be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the STAR study are eligible for co-enrolment in other non-CTIMP studies, this&#xD;
      will be decided on a case by case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trials pharmacist will be provided with a randomisation schedule which has been&#xD;
      generated by the CTU. After informed consent, the researcher will contact the clinical trials&#xD;
      pharmacist who will allocate the next sequential number as per the randomisation schedule.&#xD;
      Randomisation will be stratified by vasopressor use. The clinical trials pharmacist will&#xD;
      dispense the trial drugs. Study drug will be dispensed as per local pharmacy guidelines.&#xD;
      Aspirin and placebo study drug will have an identical appearance. The researcher will then&#xD;
      register the recruited patient with the CTU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures for unblinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator or treating physician may unblind a participant's treatment assignment in&#xD;
      the case of an emergency, when knowledge of the study treatment is essential for the&#xD;
      appropriate clinical management or welfare of the subject. Should a treating clinician&#xD;
      require emergency unblinding, they should contact the clinical trials pharmacist at the Royal&#xD;
      Victoria Hospital during working hours or if out of working hours the on call pharmacist for&#xD;
      the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust for emergency unblinding. Following this and once&#xD;
      the patient is stable, all reasonable efforts should then be made to contact the CI or&#xD;
      co-Investigators who will be contactable via an emergency contact telephone number The date&#xD;
      and reason for the unblinding must be recorded in the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomised to receive aspirin 75mg capsule or a placebo capsule enterally&#xD;
      for up to 14 days. Subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio using blocks of variable size.&#xD;
      The first dose of the study drug will ideally be administered within 4 hours of randomisation&#xD;
      and subsequent doses will be as close to 10 am as possible starting on the following calendar&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any omission of the study drug will be recorded in the CRF to monitor compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug accountability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trials pharmacist will be responsible for maintaining records of the study drug&#xD;
      dispensed to patients in ICU including dates, quantity, lot number and expiry date. Drug&#xD;
      administration will be recorded on the patient's prescription chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug return and destruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the treatment period any remaining unused drug will be returned to the hospital&#xD;
      pharmacy. Destruction of trial medication will be in accordance with pharmacy department's&#xD;
      standard operating procedures (SOPs) and hospital waste management policy. A record of&#xD;
      destruction will be maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardised management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive standardised management with regards to nutrition, antibiotic&#xD;
      policy, fluid management and weaning. Patients will be managed using a standardised&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation protocol aiming for tidal volumes of 6 ml/kg ideal body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influence of other treatments provided to critically ill patients will be minimised as&#xD;
      the study will be undertaken in a single centre where standardised care is delivered based on&#xD;
      evidence based local guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data for an individual patient will be collected by the CI or their delegated nominees&#xD;
      and recorded in the CRF. CRFs are to be submitted to the CTU as per the CRF Submission&#xD;
      Schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient identification in the CRF will be through their unique Subject Number allocated at&#xD;
      the time of randomisation and initials. Data will be collected from the time the patient is&#xD;
      considered for entry into the trial through to their discharge from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Submitted data will be reviewed for completeness and entered onto a secure, backed-up custom&#xD;
      database. Due care will be taken to ensure data safety and integrity, and compliance with the&#xD;
      Data Protection Act 1998.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data censorship will occur after 90 days post randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training Issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure accurate, complete and reliable data, the CTU will do the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be available for consultation with the trial personnel by mail, telephone and/or fax.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review and evaluate CRF data, detect errors in data collection and request data&#xD;
           verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the submission of CRFs to the CTU, the data will be processed as per the CTU SOPs.&#xD;
      Data queries will be generated for site staff as required to clarify data or request missing&#xD;
      information. The designated site staff will be required to respond to these queries within 2&#xD;
      weeks and send them back to the CTU after they have been reviewed and signed by the&#xD;
      CI/delegated staff member. Any amended information will then be entered in the study&#xD;
      database. A copy of the signed data query form should be retained with the CRF at the&#xD;
      investigator site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All essential documentation and trial records will be stored by the CI in conformance with&#xD;
      the applicable regulatory requirements and access to stored information will be restricted to&#xD;
      authorised personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the difference in OI between the aspirin and placebo&#xD;
      treated groups at day 7. Based on our data from a recently completed clinical trial in ARDS,&#xD;
      the mean (standard deviation; SD) OI at day 7 in patients with ARDS is 62 (51) cmH2O/kPa. A&#xD;
      sample size of 56 subjects (28 in each group) will have 80% power at a two-tailed&#xD;
      significance level of 0.05 to detect a clinically significant difference of 39 cmH2O/kPa in&#xD;
      OI between groups. In a previous phase 2 study of similar size, we have found that an&#xD;
      intervention can demonstrate a change in OI of a similar magnitude confirming a treatment&#xD;
      effect of this size can be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although we anticipate few withdrawals or loss to follow-up we have allowed for this in the&#xD;
      sample size calculation. In our previous single centre study of simvastatin in ARDS there&#xD;
      were no withdrawals. In a multi-centre UK study of pulmonary artery catheters in ICU patients&#xD;
      (PAC-Man), no patients were lost to follow up, and only 3% withdrew consent after recovering&#xD;
      competency. This is in keeping with our local data. Therefore a drop-out rate of 5% has been&#xD;
      estimated and the study will require a total of 60 patients (30 in each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For continuously distributed outcomes, differences between groups will be tested using&#xD;
      independent samples t-tests and analysis of covariance with transformations of variables to&#xD;
      normality if appropriate, or non-parametric equivalents. Chi-square tests (or Fisher's Exact&#xD;
      tests) will be used for categorical variables. A secondary analysis excluding patients&#xD;
      identified to have aspirin resistance will also be undertaken. The study will be analysed&#xD;
      with an intention to treat so all randomised patients will be included in the analysis. A p&#xD;
      value of 0.05 will be considered as significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlations between changes in the biological markers measured and physiological and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes will be assessed by appropriate graphical and statistical methods including&#xD;
      Pearson's (or Spearmans) correlation coefficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single final analysis is planned at the end of the trial.&#xD;
