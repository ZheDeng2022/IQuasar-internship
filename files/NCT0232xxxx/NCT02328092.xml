    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of daily sacral root magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      for 10 sessions in patients with nocturnal enuresis.Eligible patients were randomized to&#xD;
      receive either real or sham repetitive sacral root magnetic stimulation (rSMS; 15 Hz with a&#xD;
      total of 1500 pulses/session) for 10 sessions. Evaluation was performed before starting&#xD;
      treatment, immediately after the 5th and 10th treatment session, and 1 month later, using&#xD;
      frequency of enuresis/week, visual analogue scale (VAS) and Quality of life. Cortical&#xD;
      excitability of upper and lower limbs were done before and after the end of sessions.&#xD;

    <description>The real group received biphasic rSMS using a Magstim Super Rapid (Magstim, Whitland, UK) stimulator connected to a 120-mm outer diameter figure-of-8 air film cooling coil positioned in the midline over the sacral vertebrae (approximately 5 cm above the natal cleft, which approximates to the level of S2). Stimulation was delivered at 15 Hz at 50% of maximum stimulator output (10 seconds on and 30 seconds off) with a total of 1500 pulses and the hand of the coil upward. The stimulation was repeated for 10 sessions, 5 sessions per week and 2 days off.</description>
