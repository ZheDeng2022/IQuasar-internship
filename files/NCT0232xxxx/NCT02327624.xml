  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal hypothesis of this study is that two different maintenance regimens of&#xD;
      ticagrelor are safe, tolerable and associated with significant inhibition of erythrocyte&#xD;
      adenosine reuptake compared to clopidogrel in patients undergoing elective Percutaneous&#xD;
      Coronary Intervention (PCI) for stable Coronary artery disease (CAD).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is caused by fatty deposits building up over time in the&#xD;
      arteries that supply the heart with blood, causing the arteries to narrow and reducing the&#xD;
      amount of blood that can get to the heart. One of the treatment options for CAD is&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in which a balloon is inserted into the artery&#xD;
      supplying the heart to open up the artery where it has narrowed. A stent is then left in the&#xD;
      artery once the balloon is removed to hold the artery open and allow more blood to flow to&#xD;
      the heart. One of the risks of this procedure, as in CAD itself, is the formation of blood&#xD;
      clots that then block the arteries, stopping or reducing blood flow and causing a heart&#xD;
      attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelets are small blood cells involved in the formation of blood clots that cause heart&#xD;
      attacks. Antiplatelet drugs (e.g. aspirin) are given to patients with CAD to reduce the risk&#xD;
      of a clot forming in the future and causing a heart attack. In a recent large clinical trial&#xD;
      (PLATO study), it was shown that heart attack patients treated with a new antiplatelet&#xD;
      medication (ticagrelor) had fewer later heart attacks compared to the current standard&#xD;
      treatment (clopidogrel). The STEELPCI study is comparing three different strategies for&#xD;
      prescribing antiplatelet medication to patients with stable CAD who have a PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients on waiting list for PCI who meet the study inclusion/exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      invited to participate. Patients will have their PCI as normal but be randomised to take one&#xD;
      of three different medication strategies, either clopidogrel or one of two doses of&#xD;
      ticagrelor. Patient will take the medication for 30 days and have blood tests and meet with&#xD;
      the research team during that time to assess the effects of each medication strategy.&#xD;
