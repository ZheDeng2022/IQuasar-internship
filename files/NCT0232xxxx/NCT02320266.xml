    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an FDA approved, and widely used method for treating the&#xD;
      motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), Essential Tremor (ET), Dystonia and Obsessive&#xD;
      Compulsive disorder (OCD). Over 100,000 patients worldwide have now been implanted with DBS&#xD;
      devices. Current approved methods to locate the DBS target regions in the brain use a&#xD;
      combination of stereotactic imaging techniques and measurements of the electrical activity of&#xD;
      brain cells. As part of the standard clinical technique, electrical data are collected from&#xD;
      individual nerve cells. The target brain region emits unique electrical signals. At certain&#xD;
      brain locations, during DBS surgery, additional electrical data that are generated in&#xD;
      response to sound will be collected. Regions of the brain that have a decreased response to&#xD;
      repeated sound (auditory gating) may be important DBS targets for improving thinking. The&#xD;
      aims are (i) during DBS surgery, in addition to EEG, use microelectrodes in the brain to find&#xD;
      brain regions, along the normal path to the DBS target, where auditory gating occurs and then&#xD;
      (ii) determine if stimulation of the identified region(s) alters auditory gating measured by&#xD;
      EEG. Also an additional aim (iii) is to measure electrical activity at the scalp with EEG to&#xD;
      characterize auditory gating in patients before and after DBS surgery and also a healthy&#xD;
      control population.&#xD;

      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an FDA approved, and widely used method for treating the&#xD;
      motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), Essential Tremor (ET), Dystonia and Obsessive&#xD;
      Compulsive disorder (OCD). Over 100,000 patients worldwide have now been implanted with DBS&#xD;
      devices. Current approved methods to locate the DBS target regions in the brain (subthalamic&#xD;
      nucleus (STN) for PD) use a combination of stereotactic imaging techniques and measurements&#xD;
      of the electrical activity of brain cells. As part of the standard clinical technique,&#xD;
      electrical data are collected from individual nerve cells --in a procedure called&#xD;
      microelectrode recording (MER). The target brain region emits unique electrical signals that&#xD;
      are detected by MER during the standard DBS surgery. MER is done at stops along the way to&#xD;
      the target. At the stops during DBS surgery, additional electrical data that are generated in&#xD;
      response to sound will be collected. Regions of the brain that have a decreased response&#xD;
      after repeated sound (auditory gating) may be important DBS targets for improving thinking.&#xD;
      The aims are to:(Aim 1A) during DBS surgery, in addition to EEG, use microelectrodes in the&#xD;
      brain to measure electrical activity with single unit activity (SUA) and local field&#xD;
      potentials (LFP) to find brain regions along the path to the DBS target where auditory gating&#xD;
      occurs (Aim 1A) and then determine if stimulation of the identified region(s) alters auditory&#xD;
      gating measured by EEG(Aim 1B); and (Aim 2) measure electrical activity at the scalp with&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG) to characterize auditory gating in patients before and after DBS&#xD;
      surgery and also a healthy control population.&#xD;
