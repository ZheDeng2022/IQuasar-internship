      We propose to test the effectiveness of the combination of CF pancreatic enzyme replacement&#xD;
      therapy (PERT) on absorption of Ravicti® and subsequent restoration of nasal epithelial&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-mediated chloride transport during&#xD;
      the nasal potential difference (NPD) test. Funding source FDA Office of Orphan Products&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We were the first to test 4-phenylbutyrate (Buphenyl) as a systemic corrector of these&#xD;
      defects in F508del under an investigator-initiated Investigational New Drug (IND)application&#xD;
      held by P. Zeitlin. In a series of Phase 1 and 2 trials we established the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose as 20 gm daily divided t.i.d. and the maximum induction of cyclic AMP (cAMP)-mediated&#xD;
      nasal epithelial chloride transport with 30 gm daily as a median of -10 millivolt (mV) on&#xD;
      days 4 and 7 of treatment.1;2 Under those conditions there was no significant decrease in&#xD;
      sweat chloride values or in amiloride-inhibited nasal potential difference (NPD). We&#xD;
      interpreted these results as a proof of concept of corrector therapy, but corrector therapy&#xD;
      alone was likely an insufficient therapy for this mutation in CF, and therefore closed the&#xD;
      IND for 4-phenylbutyrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the ensuing years, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has had success with the development of&#xD;
      ivacaftor3;3;4 (VX-770) as a potentiator of G551D CFTR and has studied the drug alone and in&#xD;
      combination with their corrector lumacaftor5 (VX-809) and VX-661. We at Johns Hopkins&#xD;
      University (JHU), University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and Childrens' Hospital of&#xD;
      Philadelphia/University of Pennsylvania (CHOP/Penn) have participated in many of the clinical&#xD;
      trials and are pleased and encouraged by the success of VX-770. It is not yet certain that&#xD;
      future combinations of corrector(s) and potentiator(s) will be safe and effective, and it is&#xD;
      prudent to explore alternative correctors and potentiators. Furthermore, recent structural&#xD;
      investigations in a number of laboratories support the idea that more than one corrector may&#xD;
      be necessary to fully restore F508del to the trafficking pathway 6. Precedent for combination&#xD;
      of 4PBA with other CFTR modulators has been established in vitro 7;8 4-Phenylbutyrate tablets&#xD;
      are formulated for oral delivery, and we showed that the pharmacokinetics were similar in CF&#xD;
      to that in patients with urea cycle disorders. However the large number of tablets that had&#xD;
      to be ingested at each meal were somewhat daunting at the 30 gm daily dose. A new pro-drug of&#xD;
      4-phenylbutyrate, glycerol phenylbutyrate or Ravicti®(owned by Hyperion Pharmaceuticals,&#xD;
      Inc.) was approved in February 2013 by the US FDA. This new formulation is a significant&#xD;
      advance for patients with urea cycle disorders because it is an oral, odorless, tasteless&#xD;
      liquid, that contains 3 molecules of 4-phenylbutyrate for every molecule of the triglyceride.&#xD;
      Simple arithmetic would suggest that one mole equivalent of the pro-drug provides three moles&#xD;
      of active drug. However, pancreatic lipase enzymes are required to break the covalent bonds&#xD;
      and release the active drug in the intestines. Because most CF patients homozygous for&#xD;
      F508del are pancreatic-insufficient and already on enzyme therapy, we propose to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the combination of CF pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) on&#xD;
      absorption of Ravicti® and subsequent restoration of nasal epithelial CFTR-mediated chloride&#xD;
      transport during the nasal potential difference (NPD) test.&#xD;
