    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the diagnosis accuracy of FNA and FNB biopsy on&#xD;
      pancreatic, retroperitoneal, mediastinum and pelvic cavity solid occupying lesions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study subjects are divided into two groups: the EUS-FNA(22G EchoTip Ultra needles) Group&#xD;
      and EUS-FNB group(22G EchoTip ProCore needles).Take the malignant occupying lesion diagnosis&#xD;
      accuracy as the research major indicator to compare the EUS-FNB group and EUS-FNA group as&#xD;
      optimal efficiency test. Take the class I error a=0.05, class II error β=0.15, power=0.85.&#xD;
      Suppose the malignancy diagnosis accuracy is 80%, while that of FNB is 93%. The two trial&#xD;
      groups be randomly allocated in 1:1, suppose the malignancy cases take 70% of the whole case,&#xD;
      and considering the shedding factors , extra 20% cases should be included. So the estimated&#xD;
      cases numbers is 204 cases for EUS-FNB group and 204 cases for EUS-FNA group, totally 408&#xD;
      cases in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Done by professional statistical people with randomized block grouping method and SAS 9.2&#xD;
      statistical software to generate randomized serial number（001-408）for the two groups in 1:1&#xD;
      manner. The serial numbers are the randomized grouping numbers for the trial patients, block&#xD;
      capacity is 8, totally 51 randomized block. The randomized grouping will be generated in&#xD;
      duplicate copies and sealed. One copy send to trial centers for patient allocating, and the&#xD;
      another copy be saved by the trial applicant unit. Every trail centers will be responsible&#xD;
      for the screening of qualified patients, rank them in visit time to get the randomized&#xD;
      grouping number so as to determine them goes to the EUS-FNA or EUS-FNB.The research people&#xD;
      and patients in all trial centers should not know the the randomized grouping number and&#xD;
      relevant groups. The group name will be sealed under scratch card. Every trial patients will&#xD;
      get a unique randomized number, and it will not change through out the whole trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use the inclusion and exclusion criteria to observe the patients and do relative inspections,&#xD;
      and confirm if the patients qualified or not to the trial. Record the result of last time&#xD;
      test before the treatment. Although it is better to get the informed consent before doing all&#xD;
      kinds of observation and tests, if for some reason, the medical imaging examination has&#xD;
      completed, as long as the imaging examination was done within 3 weeks before the needle&#xD;
      biopsy, it can still be collect as baseline data (imaging examination can be done at other&#xD;
      hospitals, but the trial center should issue a new evaluation report 1 week before the&#xD;
      patient join the trial group); other lab test items done at 2 weeks before the needle biopsy&#xD;
      can still be collect as baseline data for pre-research use, but these tests should be done at&#xD;
      the trail center hospital so as to guarantee the data trace ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will do the needle passes for 4 times for all of them:the 1-2 needle passes&#xD;
      with Slow-Pull and the 3-4 needle passes with Vacuum suction.If no core tissues obtained or&#xD;
      the operator/onsite pathologist determine insufficient specimen after the operations above,&#xD;
      then remedy procedures will be done, the operator use proper puncture method to continue the&#xD;
      remedy biopsy.After the first round of needle biopsy, if the trial patient cannot be&#xD;
      diagnosed, by getting the agreement of the patient, the patient will be cross-over to another&#xD;
      trial group and do needle biopsy again on the same lesion 1 week later with the method&#xD;
      mentioned above.Without knowing the needle biopsy type, the cytologist and pathologist&#xD;
      evaluate the specimen quality and make diagnosis. Every specimen will be independently&#xD;
      evaluated and diagnosed by 2 experts. If the 2 experts have different judgments, then these&#xD;
      two experts discuss together and make the final diagnose discussion. If the same sample has 2&#xD;
      or more cytology smear slides, than take the highest score slide as the result.Follow up&#xD;
      (outpatient follow up or telephone follow up) the patients at 1 week, 12 weeks and 36 weeks&#xD;
      after the needle biopsy and collect the patients clinical data and confirm their final&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the trial, if severe adverse event occurs, the trialed center must take immediate&#xD;
      actions necessary to guarantee the trialed patients' safety. Once severe adverse event&#xD;
      occurs, the researchers should inform the trial applicant and the trail center's ethics&#xD;
      committee within 24 hours after the researchers gets to know the adverse event. And the&#xD;
      researchers should also fax the report to State Food and Drug Administration of China and the&#xD;
      local provincial food and drug administration. After receiving the report, the applicant&#xD;
      should inform other clinical trial centers within 24 hours. All the severe adverse events&#xD;
      should be filed at group leader medical center and other trial centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRF(Case Report Form ) will be filled by the researchers, every involved patient must have&#xD;
      the CRF(Case Report Form ) filled. This will be audited by clinical monitor and handed over&#xD;
      to data administrator to input and manage data, the first copy will be kept by the applicant,&#xD;
      the second copy will go to the trial center, and the third copy will be kept by the trail&#xD;
      researchers.The data input and management will be taken care by specially assigned person. In&#xD;
      order to guarantee the data accuracy, data input will be done twice by two independent data&#xD;
      administrators, by computerized and manual verifying, hand over the data to statistical&#xD;
      experts to do blind check and statistic analyzing.For the questions and doubts within the&#xD;
      case report form, the data administrator make DRQ and via the clinical monitor asking the&#xD;
      researchers. The researchers will answer and feed back as soon as possible. According to the&#xD;
      researchers answer, data administrator will do the data modifying, confirming or inputting,&#xD;
      and when necessary send out DRQ again.After blind audition and confirming that the&#xD;
      established data base is correct, major researchers, applicant and the statistic analyzing&#xD;
      people lock the data. The locked data will not be changed, and the data base will be handed&#xD;
      over to statistical analyzer to do the statistic analyze according to the statistic analyzing&#xD;
      plan. Problems found after data locking can be modified during the statistic analyzing&#xD;
      procedure.This will be done by specialized statistic analyzing people according to the&#xD;
      predetermined statistic analyzing plan. The statistic analyze will be carried out according&#xD;
      to intention principle confirmed full analysis set and per-protocol set principle. After&#xD;
      completing the statistic analyzing, the statistic analyzer issue the statistic analysis&#xD;
      report and send this to major researchers to write the study report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic analyzing plan:⑴ General principle:① all the statistic tests are use the&#xD;
      two-tailed-test method, P&lt;0.05 will be thought as the tested difference is statistical&#xD;
      significance. ② the quantitative indicator description will calculate the Mean and Standard&#xD;
      deviation. The classification indicator description will describe the cases and percentage of&#xD;
      all types of cases. ⑵ Statistic analyzing method:① for the measurement data, compare it with&#xD;
      the baseline value at selection period, use paired t-test or symbol rank sum test to compare&#xD;
      with the before-after-difference within the group.② for the counting data, use x2 test to&#xD;
      compare the groups. ⑶ Shedding analysis:Comparison of groups'total shedding rates and the&#xD;
      shedding rates caused by adverse events will use x2 test or Fisher's exact test method. ⑷ The&#xD;
      baseline value's equilibrium analysis: Use group t test or x2 test to compare the demography&#xD;
      info and vital signs, disease history, and basic treatment and other indicators of baseline&#xD;
      value, so as to measure the balance of the groups. The baseline evaluation will be done on&#xD;
      FAS（full analysis set) and PPs(per-protocol set). ⑸ Effectiveness analysis:The major&#xD;
      indicator of effectiveness analysis is the diagnostic accuracy on malignant disease, and the&#xD;
      indicators of second effectiveness include the percentage of Grade A specimen and&#xD;
      complications rate etc. while the two groups rate and the Youden index comparison will use&#xD;
      approximate normal Z test or use central effect x2 test.(6) Safety analysis:Use x2 test or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test to compare the adverse event/adverse reaction (include biopsy&#xD;
      complications) rates between the groups. And use table to describe the adverse events during&#xD;
      this trial project; the lab test results before and after the trial, the normal/abnormal&#xD;
      changing condition and the relationship with this trial research when abnormal changes&#xD;
      happened.&#xD;
