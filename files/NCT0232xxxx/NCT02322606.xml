  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multiple ascending&#xD;
      dose study in Japanese healthy male participants to assess the safety, tolerability and PK&#xD;
      following single and multiple oral doses of TAK-137.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is composed of 2 parts, a Single Dose part (Cohorts 1 to 3) and a Multiple Dose&#xD;
      part (Cohorts 4 to 6). Up to 48 participants will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single dose part (Cohorts 1-3): Single Dose, 3 dose levels, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized,&#xD;
      Double-Blind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cohort will include 8 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      TAK-137 or placebo treatment group within each cohort with an allocation ratio of 6:2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned dose levels to be studied are 5, 10 and 20 mg. The principal investigator will&#xD;
      consult with the sponsor and the medical specialist as needed and will determine go/no-go for&#xD;
      the next cohort.. The dose in Cohorts 3 may be reduced to 2 mg/day instead of 20 mg/day if&#xD;
      the principal investigator, in consultation with the sponsor, considers it appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple dose Part (Cohorts 4-6): Multiple Dose, 3 dose levels, Placebo-Controlled,&#xD;
      Randomized, Double-Blind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cohort will include 8 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      TAK-137 or placebo treatment group within each cohort with an allocation ratio of 6:2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned dose levels to be studied are 5, 10,and 15 mg, however for Cohort 5 and 6, the&#xD;
      dose level may be amended based on the safety and tolerability data obtained from either&#xD;
      Cohorts 1-4 from this study or emerging data from the multiple rising dose study conducted,&#xD;
      in parallel in the United Sates (TAK-137_102). The principle investigator, in consultation&#xD;
      with the sponsor, will determine the dose levels for cohorts 5 and 6 (Not exceeding 20mg).&#xD;
