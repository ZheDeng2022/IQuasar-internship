      This is a phase 0/phase I feasibility trial to test the hypothesis that flaxseed&#xD;
      supplementation is an effective maintenance therapy for patients with ovarian cancer who are&#xD;
      in clinical remission following platinum-based regimens. The investigators further&#xD;
      hypothesize levels of estrogen metabolites and prostaglandin E2 in this patient population&#xD;
      will correlate with recurrence of disease, extent of tumor burden, invasion and metastasis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the year 2014, it is projected there will be 21,980 women diagnosed and 14,270 deaths&#xD;
      from ovarian cancer (OC) in the US. OC is the leading cause of death from gynecologic&#xD;
      malignancies and ranks second among newly diagnosed gynecological cancers in the United&#xD;
      States. More than 70% of patients present with advanced disease (stages II-IV). Although most&#xD;
      patients (70-80%) initially respond to cytoreductive surgery and adjuvant paclitaxel and&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy, approximately 80% of these women will experience disease&#xD;
      recurrence. For stages III and IV, the risk of recurrence is very high, with 5-year survival&#xD;
      rates ranging from just 13% to 44%. Furthermore, OC represents a high potential for&#xD;
      metastases even in the setting of complete response to initial therapy. Efforts to devise new&#xD;
      treatment strategies are therefore essential in order to improve survival. In this grant&#xD;
      application, the investigators postulate that utilizing dietary supplementation of flaxseed&#xD;
      for maintenance therapy in patients with OC in clinical remission following treatment with&#xD;
      platinum-based regimens will be tolerable and prolong their progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is based on the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data from the investigators laboratory revealed that flaxseed effectively decreased&#xD;
           severity and progression of OC in the only spontaneous preclinical egg-laying hen model&#xD;
           that fully recapitulates human OC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In a phase II study, flaxseed supplementation reduced proliferation rates of prostate&#xD;
           cancer after just 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flaxseed has been shown to inhibit solid tumor growth and metastases in several other&#xD;
           preclinical cancer models (breast, prostate, colon).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flaxseed is a safe dietary supplement for cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flaxseed supplementation increased survival in our investigators' animal model and these&#xD;
           flaxseed-fed hens exhibited lower inflammatory markers and maintained a healthy weight,&#xD;
           inferring a better quality of life (QOL).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a diagnosis of OC including epithelial ovarian carcinoma, primary&#xD;
             peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer who are currently in clinical remission as&#xD;
             determined by the PI or co-I and are within 4 months of completion of cancer&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients at risk of clinical relapse: patients of any stage who are in remission who&#xD;
             have undergone surgical debulking and adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;

          -  Patients with a history of other invasive malignancies, with the exception of&#xD;
             non-melanoma skin cancer, are excluded if there is any evidence of other malignancy&#xD;
             being present within the last five years. Patients are also excluded if their previous&#xD;
             cancer treatment contraindicates this protocol therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with serious medical or psychiatric illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, problems with chronic diarrhea&#xD;
             or history of bowel obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has received other investigational drugs within 28 days before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to tolerate and/or allergies to flaxseed or flaxseed preparations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) performance status &gt; 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of uncontrolled diabetes (as flaxseed can lower blood glucose&#xD;
             levels and might have additive effects when used with anti-diabetic drugs).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients concurrently using anticoagulants/antiplatelets on a DAILY BASIS, including&#xD;
             aspirin, Clopidogrel (Plavix), Ticlopidine (Ticlid), and Coumadin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a diagnosis of/problems with von Willebrand's disease or other bleeding&#xD;
             disorders (as flaxseed may slow blood clotting; the risk of bruising or bleeding in&#xD;
             people on anticoagulants or with bleeding disorders may be a concern).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Flaxseed supplementation may be contraindicated in patients with acute abdomen,&#xD;
             esophageal stricture or perforation, dysphagia, GI obstruction or ileus, acute&#xD;
             intestinal inflammation or unexplained abdominal pain. Patients with any of these&#xD;
             conditions will be excluded from this trial as the high fiber content of flaxseed may&#xD;
             make these conditions worse&#xD;
