  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to determine if this new technique will detect and identify bacteria in&#xD;
      the blood sooner than standard blood cultures or identify patients who may be septic without&#xD;
      growing bacteria in their cultures. These will be correlated with the data collected from&#xD;
      medical records on presumed sepsis. These results will be linked to data concerning infection&#xD;
      that will be available as part of routine care including blood counts and other laboratory&#xD;
      values that would be part of the routine medical care such as a white blood cell count. The&#xD;
      earlier the bacteria are identified and the appropriate antimicrobials are administered the&#xD;
      better the patient outcome.&#xD;

      This study will involve additional blood samples to be taken during the routine clinical&#xD;
      blood draw, while the subject is being treated for their burn/wounds. The additional research&#xD;
      samples will be examined for bacteria. A second blood draw will be performed at approximately&#xD;
      24 hours of initial blood collection. The blood is being collected and then correlate with&#xD;
      results of routine medical care blood cultures and clinical status of the subject (diagnosis&#xD;
      of sepsis, hemodynamic instability). Data that will be abstracted from the current electronic&#xD;
      medical record includes whether there is any type of catheter indwelling (brand name and&#xD;
      type), insertion methods including place of insertion (Intensive Care Unit, Operating Room,&#xD;
      Emergency Department), adherence to bundle, complications during insertion, colonization of&#xD;
      the subject with bacteria (MRSA), and culture results obtained as part of clinical care.&#xD;
      Demographics (subject's age) and diagnoses will also be captured as some studies have shown a&#xD;
      higher risk of infection with certain processes (burns) and percentage of burn.&#xD;
