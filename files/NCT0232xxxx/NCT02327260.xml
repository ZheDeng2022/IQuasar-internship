      This project will pilot test an intervention to increase participation rates in cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation and medication adherence among patients following a cardiovascular event. The&#xD;
      intervention will use an educational video shown during referral to cardiac rehabilitation&#xD;
      (before hospital discharge), along with a brief, telephone-delivered counseling session to&#xD;
      increase motivation to participate in cardiac rehabilitation and take all cardiac medications&#xD;
      as prescribed (following hospital discharge). One hundred twenty patients who have&#xD;
      experienced a cardiovascular event, and who are eligible for cardiac rehabilitation, will be&#xD;
      recruited to participate in the study. Three groups of participants (40 each) will be formed:&#xD;
      a control group that receives standard care, a first experimental group that sees the&#xD;
      educational video and receives motivational counseling to attend cardiac rehabilitation, and&#xD;
      a second experimental group that receives motivational counseling to adhere to their&#xD;
      medications as prescribed. It is expected that the experimental group participants will&#xD;
      differ from the control group participants in rates of participation in cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation (experimental group #1) and medication adherence (experimental group #2). If&#xD;
      successful, this intervention could be used in hospital settings to increase patients'&#xD;
      adherence behaviors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of a pilot intervention to increase&#xD;
      adherence behaviors among patients eligible for cardiac rehabilitation (CR). The intervention&#xD;
      will include two components. The first component is an educational video shown pre-discharge,&#xD;
      at the time referral to CR is made. The video, based on social-cognitive principles, will&#xD;
      educate patients about what they can expect during CR using actual CR patients. The second&#xD;
      component of the intervention will be a brief, telephone-delivered counseling session to&#xD;
      increase motivation to adhere to prescribed CR participation or cardiac medications. The&#xD;
      counseling session will use well-established motivational interviewing techniques. Three&#xD;
      groups will be formed, with 40 participants each: a control group that receives standard&#xD;
      care, experimental group #1 that receives the educational video plus a counseling session&#xD;
      that focuses on participating in CR, and experimental group #2 that receives a counseling&#xD;
      session that focuses on taking cardiac medications as prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that this is a pilot study and the sample size is relatively small, statistically&#xD;
      significant differences are not expected. However, the following hypotheses will be explored:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental group #1 will differ from the control group in rates of participation in&#xD;
           CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental group #2 will differ from the control group and experimental group #1 in&#xD;
           adherence to prescribed medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from patients at Truman Medical Center (TMC) who are eligible&#xD;
      for CR. Information is received daily about new patients at TMC who are eligible for CR and&#xD;
      who need to be referred. Investigators will provide research team members information about&#xD;
      eligible patients who can be approached about study participation. A member of the research&#xD;
      team will visit patients in their TMC hospital rooms pre-discharge and ask if they are&#xD;
      interested in learning about the study. If they indicate an interest in learning more, a&#xD;
      brief summary of the study will be provided (e.g., &quot;The investigators are interested in&#xD;
      learning about how health care providers can best talk to patients about treatment&#xD;
      recommendations.&quot;). Then, the team member will administer a brief cognitive assessment to&#xD;
      determine whether the patient is able to complete the study to determine if inclusion&#xD;
      criteria are met. If they decline participation, or if they do not correctly answer the first&#xD;
      two screening questions, patients will be asked to answer five brief demographic questions&#xD;
      and thanked for their time. These five demographic questions will be asked so that&#xD;
      investigators may compare the final sample to patients who declined participation to explore&#xD;
      for differences that could limit generalizability of findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient correctly answers the two screening questions, and continues to be interested in&#xD;
      learning more about the study, the research team member will provide the patient with a&#xD;
      consent form and TMC's PHI authorization form. Upon completion of the consent form, patients&#xD;
      also will be asked to review the pharmacy release form and complete and sign it if they&#xD;
      consent to sharing their prescription refill data with investigators. Afterward, the Time 1&#xD;
      (baseline) questionnaire will be administered via interview by the research team member. The&#xD;
      interview will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. Upon completion, the research team&#xD;
      member will provide the participant with an appointment reminder card and a $10 cash voucher&#xD;
      than can be used at the TMC Cash Office. At that time, the team member will schedule the next&#xD;
      two interviews to be completed by telephone (i.e., Times 2 and 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the Time 1 questionnaire, the team member will complete a form with the&#xD;
      participant's basic information and provide it to the CR nurse. In turn, the CR nurse will&#xD;
      assign the participant to one of the three study groups. Before recruitment begins, a&#xD;
      statistician will create a random number table with group assignments stratified by race and&#xD;
      heart failure diagnosis. The random number table will be used to create sealed envelopes with&#xD;
      randomization information for each study participant. The envelopes will be sequentially&#xD;
      numbered and provided to the CR nurse before recruitment. Upon receiving a form from a team&#xD;
      member, she will open the next sealed envelope to reveal into which group the participant is&#xD;
      assigned. She will note the envelope number and group assignment on the form. Then, the form&#xD;
      will be provided to the research team for secure storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A control group that receives standard care. Standard care includes a visit by the CR nurse&#xD;
      pre-discharge to refer the patient to CR. This referral session includes a discussion of&#xD;
      heart health, CR benefits and outcomes, and literature about prescribed medications. If&#xD;
      possible, the CR orientation appointment is scheduled with patients. If it is not possible to&#xD;
      schedule the orientation session at the referral, CR staff members call the patient a few&#xD;
      days after discharge to schedule an appointment. Reminder calls are made by CR staff members&#xD;
      a few days before scheduled appointments. The pharmacist also visits all patients after the&#xD;
      CR referral is made to review prescribed medications. Follow-up phone calls are made 2-3 days&#xD;
      after discharge by the pharmacy team to answer any medication questions and trouble-shoot any&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group #1: This group will receive standard care (detailed above), and it will be&#xD;
      shown the educational video on an iPad by the CR nurse during referral. The educational video&#xD;
      will be based on social-cognitive principles, with the goal of educating prospective CR&#xD;
      patients about what happens during CR. The video will be approximately nine minutes long, and&#xD;
      will feature testimonials by real CR patients. In addition, this group will be called by a&#xD;
      trained counselor approximately one week after discharge. During this call, the counselor&#xD;
      will conduct a brief counseling session, using motivational interviewing (MI) techniques,&#xD;
      that focuses on increasing motivation to participate in CR. During this session, the&#xD;
      counselor will help the participant identify barriers and benefits to participating in CR,&#xD;
      thereby increasing internal motivation to participate. The counseling session will take&#xD;
      approximately 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group #2: This group will receive standard care (detailed above), plus a&#xD;
      counseling session that focuses on medical adherence. Specifically, the counselor will&#xD;
      conduct a session on improving internal motivation to adhere to the cardiac medications&#xD;
      prescribed by the pharmacist. The session will take approximately 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As stated above, the CR nurse will note the participant's randomization on the information&#xD;
      sheet, and this information will be shared with the other research team members after the&#xD;
      participant is discharged from the hospital. This information will be shared with team&#xD;
      members prior to the Time 2 phone call (because group membership needs to be determined&#xD;
      before the call is made to plan for which, if any, counseling session will be completed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will take part in the Time 1 interview (see above), as well as telephone&#xD;
      interviews at Time 2 (approximately one week post-discharge; immediately prior to the&#xD;
      counseling session provided to the experimental groups) and Time 3 (approximately five weeks&#xD;
      post-discharge). The Time 2 interview will take approximately 20 minutes and the Time 3&#xD;
      interview will take approximately 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the control group will take part in a 15-minute Time 1 in-person interview, a&#xD;
      20-minute Time 2 telephone interview, and a 30-minute Time 3 telephone interview.&#xD;
      Experimental group #1 will take part in a 15-minute Time 1 in-person interview, a 20-minute&#xD;
      Time 2 telephone interview, a 10 minute counseling session immediately following the Time 2&#xD;
      interview, and a 30-minute Time 3 telephone interview. Experimental group #3 will take part&#xD;
      in a 15-minute Time 1 in-person interview, a 20-minute Time 2 telephone interview, a&#xD;
      10-minute counseling session immediately following the Time 2 interview, and a 30-minute Time&#xD;
      3 telephone interview.&#xD;
&#xD;

        <title>Number of Participants With Self-reported Medication Adherence: Angiotensin System Blocker</title>
        <description>Participants were asked how many times they filled Angiotensin System Blockers since their discharge from TMC. Participants were coded as &quot;adherent&quot; if they reported an increased number of medication fills at 5 weeks compared to 1 week post-discharge. Participants with evidence of obtaining a medication fill greater than 30 days were also classified as &quot;adherent.&quot; Participants who did not indicate an increase in number of fills or provide evidence of extended coverage from initial fill were determined to be &quot;non-adherent.&quot; Dichotomized adherence categorization was utilized in data analyses: 1 = adherent; 0 = non-adherent. Data presented are % adherent.</description>
