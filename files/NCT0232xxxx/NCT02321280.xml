    <textblock>
      Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to RANKL was approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      postmenopausal osteoporosis in June 2010. It is administered subcutaneously once every 6&#xD;
      months and is highly effective in reducing the risk of vertebral, non-vertebral, and hip&#xD;
      fracture risk. There are 3 main concepts underpinning the rationale for using Denosumab to&#xD;
      treat CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CD is associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis and the biology of osteoporosis&#xD;
           and T cell mediated inflammation, thought to be integral in CD, involve the RANKL&#xD;
           paradigm&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Animal models of bone loss and colitis treated with RANKL inhibitors improve both bone&#xD;
           mass and colitis. A dinitrofluorobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS) model of colitis in our&#xD;
           lab showed significant improvement with Denosumab treatment compared to vehicle (saline)&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. CD is associated with an increase in mutations at the locus that encodes for RANKL The&#xD;
           investigators are conducting an open label pilot study of single dose Denosumab 120 mg&#xD;
           s.c. to patients with active Crohn's disease, with assessment of clinical response and&#xD;
           remission at 12 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1.0 Hypothesis Moderate to severely active Crohn's disease (CD) will respond to treatment&#xD;
      with Denosumab, (a monoclonal antibody to Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor-Kappa B ligand&#xD;
      (RANKL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal research questions to be addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine if a single dose of Denosumab can induce a clinical response by 12 weeks in&#xD;
           persons with active CD 2. Determine if a single dose of Denosumab can induce a clinical&#xD;
           remission by 12 weeks in persons with active CD 3. Determine if a single dose of&#xD;
           Denosumab can reduce markers of systemic (C-reactive protein, CRP) and intestinal (fecal&#xD;
           calprotectin, FCAL) inflammation in persons with active CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background Current treatment paradigms of CD involve a step-up approach, where persons&#xD;
           with mild disease are treated with 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA), budesonide or even no&#xD;
           therapy. Persons who fail to respond to these relatively inexpensive and well tolerated&#xD;
           medications, will often require more intensive therapies including systemic&#xD;
           corticosteroids, immunomodulatory agents such as azathioprine or methotrexate, or&#xD;
           biologic agents. While the latter have proven efficacy in the treatment of CD, they are&#xD;
           quite costly, and their use may result in significant side effects. Currently, the&#xD;
           biologic agents infliximab and adalimumab, which specifically antagonize tumor necrosis&#xD;
           factor alpha (TNF) are the ultimate step in the medical management of CD. However,&#xD;
           nearly one-third of subjects will not respond to a standard anti-TNF based induction&#xD;
           regimen, and response can be lost in about one-half of all subjects who responded to the&#xD;
           initial induction over the course of one year. Of those who start an anti-TNF and&#xD;
           respond, continuous therapy is recommended, the costs of which may exceed $25000-$40000&#xD;
           per year. Furthermore, the combination of an immunomodulator with an anti-TNF agent&#xD;
           enhances clinical response, but may increase the risk of infectious complications, and&#xD;
           their use is also associated with hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma, which is rare but&#xD;
           almost uniformly fatal. In a population based costing study from Manitoba infliximab&#xD;
           patients represented a very small proportion of all inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)&#xD;
           patients, yet they accounted for a total of approximately $2 million in drug costs in&#xD;
           2005/06, which represented approximately half of all prescription drug costs for IBD&#xD;
           patients in Manitoba. Hence, it would be desirable to have a medication that is as&#xD;
           effective at inducing and maintaining remission with an improved side effect profile and&#xD;
           with a lower cost of provision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 What is Denosumab: Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to RANKL was approved for&#xD;
      the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in June 2010. It is administered subcutaneously&#xD;
      once every 6 months and is highly effective in reducing the risk of vertebral, non-vertebral,&#xD;
      and hip fracture risk. A mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis showed Denosumab to be more&#xD;
      effective than strontium ranelate, raloxifene, alendronate, and risedronate in preventing new&#xD;
      vertebral fractures. It is an agent that works in men as well as women. According to the 2010&#xD;
      Osteoporosis Canada Clinical Practice Guidelines, Denosumab is a first-line option for the&#xD;
      pharmacological management of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO). &quot;Owing to its efficacy,&#xD;
      safety, and potential to improve adherence rates, Denosumab is considered an appropriate&#xD;
      first-line pharmacologic option for PMO management.&quot; The registration of Denosumab was the&#xD;
      culmination of the discovery and clarification of the internal bone microenvironment&#xD;
      regulation of bone remodeling: the osteoblast-produced competitors: RANKL and osteoprotegerin&#xD;
      (OPG); and the osteoclast receptor: RANK. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of normal&#xD;
      bone homeostasis and the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and its integration with the immune&#xD;
      response has been greatly advanced by the discovery of RANKL-RANK ligation on osteoblast and&#xD;
      osteoclast precursors. Osteoblasts express RANKL which can bind to osteoclast precursors&#xD;
      (RANK) or an osteoblast derived soluble decoy receptor -OPG. The binding of RANK to RANKL&#xD;
      induces a signaling and gene expression cascade that results in differentiation and&#xD;
      maturation of osteoclasts which can ultimately lead to osteoporosis. OPG blocks this&#xD;
      interaction, thereby inhibiting osteoclast formation and hence decreases bone resorption. It&#xD;
      has been shown that agents that enhance RANKL production are associated with the development&#xD;
      of osteoporosis whereas agents that block RANKL reduce bone mineral loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When RANKL is upregulated in the estrogen-deficient state and exceeds the amount of OPG,&#xD;
      there is an increase in osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption, and this is the major&#xD;
      mechanism for bone mass loss and osteoporotic fractures in the postmenopausal state. The&#xD;
      human monoclonal antibody to RANKL (Denosumab) was the first product developed to reduce bone&#xD;
      resorption by inhibiting RANKL binding to RANK. Denosumab does not accumulate in bone.&#xD;
      Extension of the registration trial ('FREEDOM') 5-year data indicates continued safety and&#xD;
      efficacy, and this will be extended to 10 years to generate even longer-term data. The&#xD;
      profound but reversible suppression of bone turnover that is seen with Denosumab partly&#xD;
      explains the continuous increase in bone mineral density seen through 8 years of the phase II&#xD;
      clinical trials. As noted above, Denosumab is effective in both men and women and it is&#xD;
      potentially effective in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Rationale for Denosumab in CD There are 3 main concepts underpinning the rationale for&#xD;
      using Denosumab to treat CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CD is associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis and the biology of osteoporosis&#xD;
           and T cell mediated inflammation, thought to be integral in CD, involve the RANKL&#xD;
           paradigm&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Animal models of bone loss and colitis treated with RANKL inhibitors improve both bone&#xD;
           mass and colitis. A dinitrofluorobenzene sulfonic acid model of colitis in our lab&#xD;
           showed significant improvement with Denosumab treatment compared to vehicle (saline)&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. CD is associated with an increase in mutations at the locus that encodes for RANKL&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.1 Osteoporosis and IBD: The prevalence of osteoporosis as defined by bone mineral density&#xD;
      testing in patients with IBD has been estimated at 15%. Population-based studies show only a&#xD;
      modest excess fracture risk in IBD subjects (approximately 20-40% greater than matched&#xD;
      controls) and a rate of approximately 1 fracture per 100 patient years. Steroid use is a&#xD;
      specific concern in IBD patients-a recent meta-analysis found that current corticosteroid use&#xD;
      approximately doubled the risk of fracture independent of risk determined from age and bone&#xD;
      mineral density alone. Modulating RANKL in IBD may be effective in managing IBD-associated&#xD;
      osteoporosis. RANKL is also a regulator of T cell-dendritic cell interaction in the immune&#xD;
      system and is a crucial factor in early lymphocyte development and lymph node organogenesis.&#xD;
      The central importance of this system in bone and lymph node homeostasis is seen in RANKL&#xD;
      gene-deficient mice which are unable to support osteoclast differentiation, display severe&#xD;
      osteopetrosis (even in the presence of bone resorbing factors such as vitamin D3,&#xD;
      dexamethasone, and PGE2), show no evidence of bone remodeling, and simultaneously lack all&#xD;
      lymph nodes. Activated T cells can directly trigger osteoclastogenesis through RANKL leading&#xD;
      to bone loss, an effect that is blocked by OPG. Hence, this system may be critical in linking&#xD;
      systemic or mucosal inflammation with altered bone metabolism and, ultimately, osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Denosumab potently removes RANKL from circulation. Denosumab inhibits this pathway by&#xD;
      preventing RANKL from binding to its receptor. Denosumab is therefore an antagonist of&#xD;
      RANKL's action. Since pharmacologic inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB)&#xD;
      pathway with infliximab is efficacious for CD, then a repositioning opportunity arises. For&#xD;
      safety, cost and compliance reasons Denosumab is an attractive alternative to anti-TNF&#xD;
      therapy. The genetic data not only provides additional rationale for the study but focusing&#xD;
      on individuals harboring the allele that increases RANKL expression, might provide a cohort&#xD;
      that would achieve the greatest gain in being treated with a RANKL inhibitor. Hence we will&#xD;
      enroll only patients carrying this G allele, since we hypothesize a slightly larger response&#xD;
      to treatment in this subgroup. The risk allele is also relatively common (G-allele frequency&#xD;
      = 0.487 in haplotype map (HapMap) CEU), and therefore we expect approximately 75% of patients&#xD;
      to be carriers. No clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of Denosumab in the treatment&#xD;
      of CD have been undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Denosumab safety: Denosumab has been tested in phase III clinical trials in over 10,000&#xD;
      people and has post-marketing surveillance data since 2010. Although nuisance side effects&#xD;
      have been reported with denosumab (headache, fatigue, arthralgia), these have not led to&#xD;
      clinical sequelae. Hypocalcemia: Anticipated frequency ~2-15% (25-27 ). Reported events of&#xD;
      hypocalcemia have been mild, transient and not associated with clinical sequelae. All&#xD;
      patients will be recommended to take daily supplemental calcium (≥500mg) and vitamin D (≥400&#xD;
      IU) per day. Serum calcium (corrected for albumin) will be measured 3 days post dose and&#xD;
      every 4 weeks. Patients experiencing hypocalcemia will be treated as per the discretion of&#xD;
      the treating physician using standard protocols. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw: Anticipated&#xD;
      frequency &lt; 1%. The planned dose has been associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw. The&#xD;
      concomitant risk factors include cancer, recent or planned invasive dental procedures and&#xD;
      current use of anti-angiogenic medications. Individuals with any of these risk factors will&#xD;
      be excluded from our trial. Even in trials including only high risk patients (those with&#xD;
      cancer), the incidence rates were &lt;2%. All participants will receive written documentation&#xD;
      advising them to avoid invasive dental procedures for the duration of the trial, further&#xD;
      decreasing the occurrence of this adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. The Proposed Trial: An open label multicentred trial. Active therapy arm: Denosumab 120 mg&#xD;
      subcutaneously for one dose. This dose of Denosumab has been chosen since it is sufficient to&#xD;
      maintain elevated Denosumab levels and depressed RANKL activity as measured by suppression of&#xD;
      bone-turnover markers at 3 months post dosing. Further, this dose is the maximal dose&#xD;
      clinically used, has a tolerable side-effect profile and adequate pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CDAI is a calculated score&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fecal calprotectin will be measured by ELISA in the lab of the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. RANKL will be measured by ELISA in the lab of the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. CRP will be measured as part of routine clinical care in each site's hospital lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Ileocolonoscopy or abdominal MRI will be undertaken as standard of care in each&#xD;
      institution. Each endoscopist will record a CDEIS. Each site will make a disc of each MRI and&#xD;
      send to Winnipeg to be read at baseline and study conclusion by a central reader (Dr H&#xD;
      Greenberg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.6 Sample size: N=30 assuming a 50% response rate has a 95% confidence interval from 33.1 to&#xD;
      66.7%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.7 Planned recruitment rate and procedure: Recruitment will occur over a 1 year period. This&#xD;
      trial will include 3 Canadian academic sites. We expect to screen 50 subjects and enroll 30&#xD;
      that means screening of 16-18 subjects per site and enrollment of 10 subjects per site. All&#xD;
      sites are experienced IBD clinical trial centers and considering the relative ease of the&#xD;
      study (single dose) with 16 weeks of follow up we do not anticipate enrollment issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit: Individuals will be recruited directly from clinical centers specializing in&#xD;
      CD care. One gastroenterologist per site will be responsible for clinical care of the patient&#xD;
      for the duration of the clinical trial. Clinical study nurses will assess individuals&#xD;
      experiencing a CD exacerbation for possible recruitment using a checklist. Potentially&#xD;
      eligible patients will have a blood sample drawn and sent to the Innovation Centre (Montreal)&#xD;
      for rapid genotyping, which will be completed in 5 business days. If they are carriers of the&#xD;
      risk allele, they will undergo an informed consent in person with the study nurse and will&#xD;
      then be randomized. Fecal calprotectin and RANKL will be measured centrally at the U of&#xD;
      Manitoba.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.8 Anticipated compliance issues? Since the treatment is a single dose there are no issues&#xD;
      with compliance with therapy. In terms of compliance with follow up visits, the visits only&#xD;
      require diary review, physical examination and blood draws and occur at 4 weekly intervals&#xD;
      after enrollment (except for initial blood draw for serum calcium at day +3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.9 Anticipated rate of loss to follow up: We anticipate a loss to follow up of 20% which is&#xD;
      a liberal estimate considering the relative ease and duration of the study follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.10 Proposed type of analyses: Intention to treat. Time to achievement of the primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be assessed by Cox proportional hazards and median time to event will be&#xD;
      calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method with 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.11 Proposed frequency of analyses: Single analysis at study conclusion. 3.12 Planned&#xD;
      subgroup analyses: We will assess persons with ileal or ileocolonic disease and also&#xD;
      separately assess persons with ileocolonic or colonic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. 13 Follow-up Visits. Serum phosphate, calcium, complete blood count, CRP, electrolytes,&#xD;
      fecal calprotectin and RANKL will be measured and all patients will undergo a CDAI. A serum&#xD;
      aliquot from each visit will be frozen at -80 degree Celsius for future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.14 Study Completion Visit: At the 12 week visit, individuals will undergo all assessments&#xD;
      done at the 4-weekly visits.&#xD;
