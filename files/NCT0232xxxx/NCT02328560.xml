  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims primarily to measure the expected paramedic consultation announcement&#xD;
      benefits for the patient, at different levels. It will measure improvements in the management&#xD;
      of patients treated with chemotherapy. Indeed, paramedical consultation ad aims to provide a&#xD;
      better understanding of the disease and treatment incurred, which should lead to the&#xD;
      implementation of joint strategies between the healthcare team and the patient to prevent the&#xD;
      effects of and treatment of the disease by the patient and caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This improvement is to promote the fair treatment by reducing patient anxiety and / or carers&#xD;
      and involving them in the management of their disease. In this context, it is shown a profit&#xD;
      of paramedical consultation for the patient, it will work, based on the recommendations of&#xD;
      the Cancer Plan, strengthen the need to routinely offer paramedic Ad consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work should also help measure the impact of ad paramedical consultation on optimizing&#xD;
      care consumption off-line therapy and to assess the associated costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who received paramedic ad or not consultation, it will therefore be of&#xD;
      particular compare intercurrent hospitalizations, commuting structure of care, the number of&#xD;
      consultations with the doctor, the reports of cure, additional biological monitoring or other&#xD;
      health care consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the participation of several centers in the fight against cancer, this study will&#xD;
      provide valuable information on the practice of paramedical consultation ad in several tumor&#xD;
      sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will objectify the benefit provided by the Medical device announcement for both patients&#xD;
      and the organization and use of care prerequisite to encourage better integration of this&#xD;
      device in the course of patient care, the consultation paramedical ad remaining poorly&#xD;
      understood by many health professionals.&#xD;
