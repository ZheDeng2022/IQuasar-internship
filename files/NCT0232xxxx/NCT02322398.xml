    <textblock>
      The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess the outcome of In Vitro Fertilization&#xD;
      (IVF) according to the type of medication used for controlled ovarian stimulation (COS). The&#xD;
      study compared the pregnancy rate obtained by 398 patients who had received COS with&#xD;
      recombinant Follicle Stimulating Hormone (rFSH) plus recombinant Luteinising Hormone (rLH) in&#xD;
      2:1 ratio vs. the one observed in 450 patients who had been treated with human Menopausal&#xD;
      Gonadotropin (hMG), stratifying results according to the number of retrieved oocytes.&#xD;

      Data were retrospectively collected from the clinical charts of our In Vitro Fertilization&#xD;
      (IVF) Unit database. Among 3,416 cases recorded in the database, patients classified as&#xD;
      expected poor responders and/or expected normal responders, requiring an average daily&#xD;
      gonadotropin dose of 150-300 IU, were selected. A total of 848 patients matched this&#xD;
      criterion and were included in the final analysis; of these, 398 (Group A) had been&#xD;
      stimulated with rFSH+rLH, whereas 450 (Group B) had been treated with hMG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Group A (n=398) had been stimulated either with a starting dose of 150-300&#xD;
      International Units per day (IU/d) recombinant Follicle Stimulating Hormone (rFSH) plus&#xD;
      75-150 IU/d recombinant Luteinising Hormone (rLH) in 2:1 ratio. On day 6-7 of ovarian&#xD;
      stimulation, the gonadotropin dose had been adapted according to the ovarian response, always&#xD;
      maintaining the same rFSH:rLH ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Group B (n=450) had received 150-300 IU/d human Menopausal Gonadotropin,&#xD;
      eventually adjusting the dose on day 6-7 of ovarian stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Either medication had been administered within a &quot;long&quot; protocol with Gonadotropin-releasing&#xD;
      Hormone (GnRH)-agonist or a &quot;short&quot; protocol with GnRH-antagonist. The COS regimen (type of&#xD;
      protocol and type of medication) had been prescribed in the absence of any pre-fixed criteria&#xD;
      at the time of prescription by different physicians of the Unit, basing the choice of&#xD;
      appropriate dosages on the clinical experience, considering parameters such as age, small&#xD;
      antrall follicle count and basal day 3 FSH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The classical &quot;long&quot; protocol had been performed administering the GnRH-agonist buserelin&#xD;
      (900 mcg/d intranasally) from day 21 of the preceding cycle. In the &quot;short&quot; protocol, the&#xD;
      GnRH-antagonist cetrorelix had been started at a subcutaneous dose of 0.25 mg/d according to&#xD;
      a flexible schedule, when at least one follicle â‰¥14 mm diameter was observed at ultrasound&#xD;
      (US).&#xD;
&#xD;
      COS had been monitored by transvaginal US plus serum estradiol (E2) measurement performed&#xD;
      every second day from stimulation day 6-7. From stimulation day 6-7 onward, checkpoints had&#xD;
      been performed until at least one dominant follicle had reached 18 mm diameter, with&#xD;
      appropriate E2 levels. At this point, ovulation had been triggered by injecting&#xD;
      subcutaneously 10,000 IU of human Chorionic Gonadotropin, and transvaginal US-guided oocyte&#xD;
      aspiration (OPU) had been performed approximately 36-37 hours after hCG injection under local&#xD;
      anesthesia (paracervical block).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classical IVF or ICSI had followed, according to the clinical indication. After two days of&#xD;
      in vitro culture, embryos had been scored and 1-3 of them had been transferred in uteri using&#xD;
      a soft catheter under US guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The luteal phase had been supported administering 180 mg/d natural progesterone for 15 days.&#xD;
      Pregnancy had been assessed by serum hCG assay after 15 days from embryo transfer and then&#xD;
      confirmed if at least one gestational sac was visualized at transvaginal US after two further&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
