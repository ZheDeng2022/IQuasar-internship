    <textblock>
      The investigators wants to determine if 11β-HSD1 activity will be positively associated, and&#xD;
      5α-reductase activity negatively associated, with (a) degree of insulin resistance defined by&#xD;
      the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) and (b) worsening&#xD;
      glycemic control defined by higher HbA1c and impaired fasting glucose in a group of obese&#xD;
      children and young adults with or without type 2 diabetes compared to lean children and young&#xD;
      adults without diabetes. The investigators also want to identify key metabolic signatures&#xD;
      associated with diabetes using metabolomic profiling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching hypothesis is that increases in whole body 11β-HSD1 activity precede and&#xD;
      presage the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in high-risk obese adolescents, serving as a&#xD;
      critical determinant of insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. The increase in 11β-HSD1&#xD;
      activity, in combination with decreases in 5α-reductase activity, will increase tissue&#xD;
      cortisol production, promoting the development of insulin resistance and the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome and predisposing to T2D. The investigators predict that increases in 11β-HSD1&#xD;
      activity will be detected in obese children prior to the development of insulin resistance&#xD;
      and glucose intolerance and that the progressive increases in 11β-HSD1 will correlate with&#xD;
      progressive decreases in insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Given preliminary&#xD;
      findings, the investigators also predict that increases in 11β-HSD1 will be greater and occur&#xD;
      earlier in development in males than females. This could establish 11β-HSD1 activity as a&#xD;
      novel, non-invasive biomarker for progression to, or for development of, glucose intolerance&#xD;
      and T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification of 11β-HSD1 as a biomarker that predicts T2D would have critical clinical&#xD;
      import, allowing us to identify obese children and adults at highest risk of metabolic&#xD;
      decompensation. Studies of 11β-HSD1 in obese subjects with varying degrees of IR and glucose&#xD;
      intolerance will also narrow critical gaps in the understanding of the pathogenesis of T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to also validate if urine metabolomic profiling can be used for&#xD;
      identifying key metabolomic signatures associated with insulin resistance. To that end the&#xD;
      investigators would like to examine detailed metabolomic profiles in 24 hour and spot urine&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include 50 obese adolescents with T2D, 50 obese adolescents without&#xD;
      T2D and 50 age, gender, race and pubertal status-matched normal weight controls. The subjects&#xD;
      will be recruited at the Healthy Lifestyle Program at Duke, Diabetes Clinics at Lenox Baker&#xD;
      Children's Hospital and Roxboro Clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study activities include physical exam and medical history, vitals, laboratory tests (only&#xD;
      for obese adolescents), urine testing for sugar (only for normal weight adolescents), 24 hour&#xD;
      urine collection, spot urine collection, body fat content measurement, and food and activity&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
