    <textblock>
      The study was conducted as an open-label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period,&#xD;
      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover, bioequivalence study comparing Felodipine extended&#xD;
      release tablets USP 10 mg (containing felodipine 10 mg) manufactured by OHM Laboratories,&#xD;
      Inc., NJ, 08901 with PLENDIL速 extended release tablets 10 mg (containing felodipine 10 mg)&#xD;
      manufactured by Merck &amp; Co. Inc. Whitehouse Station, NJ 08889 USA for AstraZeneca LP&#xD;
      Wilmington, DE 19850 in healthy, adult, male, human subjects under fasting condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the subjects were subjected to breath test for alcohol and test for drugs of abuse&#xD;
      (opioids and cannabinoids) prior to admission in each period. Only subjects with negative&#xD;
      results in these tests were preceded for further activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hour, a single oral dose of felodipine extended&#xD;
      release tablet (containing felodipine 10 mg) of either test or reference formulation was&#xD;
      administered during each period of the study, along with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient&#xD;
      temperature under low light condition .&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the study, safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical&#xD;
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical&#xD;
      parameters, serology and urine analysis) at baseline. Adverse event monitoring was done&#xD;
      throughout the study. Laboratory parameters of hematology and biochemistry (except blood&#xD;
      glucose and cholesterol) were repeated at the end of the study.&#xD;
