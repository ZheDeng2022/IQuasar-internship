    <textblock>
      Undernutrition among dialysis patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conversely, in hemodialysis (HD) patients a high BMI in the range of obesity has long been&#xD;
      known protective against death and cardiovascular disease, a phenomenon called reverse&#xD;
      epidemiology. Hence, what is good for the background population might differ from what is&#xD;
      good for HD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients this association is less clear. The majority of studies&#xD;
      find reverse epidemiology, however some studies find no survival advantage of obesity or even&#xD;
      indicate a higher risk of death in obese patients. Some authors claim that reverse&#xD;
      epidemiology is a misconception and that although in the short run a high BMI is protective a&#xD;
      follow up period of more than five years show increased mortality. Considering this Mutsert&#xD;
      et al. claim that HD patients have the same mortality risk patterns associated with BMI as&#xD;
      the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, it has been shown that the protective effect of a high BMI or weight gain is&#xD;
      limited to those with normal or high muscle mass. Patients with high BMI and malnutrition&#xD;
      have a high risk of death. Concordantly, recent studies show that abdominal obesity is&#xD;
      associated with mortality among dialysis patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of under-nutrition, often known as protein energy wasting (PEW), among&#xD;
      dialysis patients varies from 31% to 51% and the prevalence of obesity varies from 10-56%&#xD;
      presumably depending on the diagnostic criteria and the method used. These inconsistent&#xD;
      results make comparison of the prevalence of undernutrition and obesity among dialysis&#xD;
      populations somewhat problematic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to standardize the diagnosis of PEW in dialysis patients International Society of&#xD;
      Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM) suggest diagnostic criteria. As goes for obesity,&#xD;
      there are no standardized methods for diagnosing this among dialysis patients. However,&#xD;
      reviews recommend using multiple different methods concurrently including BMI, fat percentage&#xD;
      (FM%), and measures of abdominal fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on the nutritional status among dialysis patients in Northern Europe are primary derived&#xD;
      from a single research center (Karolinska institute, Sweden) and there is no recent published&#xD;
      data on the prevalence of PEW among dialysis patients. A single study examines the prevalence&#xD;
      of obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have compared the nutritional status of HD and PD patients. Hardly any studies&#xD;
      examine the prevalence of undernutrition and obesity in the same population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowing the nutritional status of a dialysis population and identifying already malnourished&#xD;
      patients, can contribute the quality of the care provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the aim of this study is, for the first time in Northern Europe to assess the&#xD;
      prevalence of both PEW and obesity in the same population using the ISRNM criteria as well as&#xD;
      different obesity markers. Additionally, we compare the nutritional status of HD and PD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design The study was designed as a cross-sectional study, investigating the nutritional&#xD;
      status of hemodialysis (HD) patients and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients attending the&#xD;
      dialysis centre at Roskilde Hospital, Denmark in February to June 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects All PD, HD and home-HD patients (n = 105) were invited to participate. Patients who&#xD;
      refused to participate were invited to complete a partial nutritional examination. The&#xD;
      participating eligible patients all gave their written consent. Patient data (age, gender,&#xD;
      dialysis vintage, primary kidney disease and co morbid conditions were taken from the patient&#xD;
      records. The local ethical committee approved the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements Anthropometric measurements were performed immediately after a&#xD;
      dialysis session (HD) as recommended by the HEMO study or after the monthly ambulatory&#xD;
      control (PD, home-HD). All measurements were done on the non-access side of the body for&#xD;
      HD-patients and on the right side for PD-patients. Skin folds (SF) were measured with a&#xD;
      Harpenden caliper and all circumferences were done using a non-stretchable fiberglass&#xD;
      insertion tape (seca 201). All measurements were made by to well-trained research assistants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Height (h) and bodyweight (BW) was measured in light clothing using standard instrument in&#xD;
      the dialysis centre. For PD the weighing was preferably done with empty abdominal cavity, for&#xD;
      those (n=8) who refused to empty the abdominal cavity the bodyweight was calculated as BW&#xD;
      with dialysate minus the volume of dialysate that was last drained into the abdomen. For&#xD;
      patients with lower leg amputations (n=2) 6.2% of total bodyweight per amputated leg was&#xD;
      added to the measured weight&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fat mass was assessed according to a formula described by Durnin and Womersley based on four&#xD;
      skinfold thicknesses (biceps, triceps, subscapular and suprailiac). Mid-arm circumference&#xD;
      (MAC) was measured midway between acromion and olecranon. All measurements were done in&#xD;
      duplicate. If the two measurements were more than four mm apart, two additional measurements&#xD;
      were done and the mean of all four was calculated. This approach is recommended by &quot;CLINICAL&#xD;
      PRACTICE GUIDELINES For Nutrition of Chronic Renal Failure&quot;. Triceps skinfold (TSF) and MAC&#xD;
      was used to calculate corrected mid-arm muscle area (cMAMA) as described by Heymsfield SB et&#xD;
      al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Waist circumference (WC) was measured as recommended by WHO. Patients unable to stand had&#xD;
      their waist and hip circumference measurement done in supine position. The waist and hip&#xD;
      measurements were skipped if empty abdominal cavity was not feasible for PD patients. All&#xD;
      measurements were done in duplicate if the difference between the two measurements exceeded 1&#xD;
      cm, two more measurements were done, and the mean of all four calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lean body mass index (LBMI) and fat mass index (FMI) was calculated as lean body mass&#xD;
      (LBM)/h2 and fat mass (FM)/h2 respectively as described by Kyle et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling and biochemical measurements For assessment of s-transferrin and albumin blood&#xD;
      samples were from all patients was analyzed at the laboratory at Roskilde Sygehus, Denmark.&#xD;
      Kt/V was measured as described by F.A.Gotch(Gotch 1998). For HD-patients normalized protein&#xD;
      catabolic rate (nPCR) was determined by measuring the interdialytic rise of blood urea&#xD;
      nitrogen after a midweek dialysis session. For patients with residual urine output &gt;&#xD;
      300ml/day urinary nitrogen excretion was also taken into account. To account for day-to-day&#xD;
      variations we calculated a mean of three nPCR measurements, which were made over a 2 months&#xD;
      period after the anthropometric measurements, we only made one urine sample. For PD-patients&#xD;
      nPCR was measured using the Bergstroms' formula. Only one nPCR measurement was done for PD&#xD;
      patients&#xD;

    <description>Classification of undernutrition Undernutrition was assessed 3 different methods: 1) WHO cut-off of BMI &lt; 18,5kg/m2, 2) the criteria for protein-energy wasting (PEW) defined by the International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM) and 3) our own criteria for PEW based on fat mass index (FMI) and a lean body mass index (LBMI).&#xD;
According to ISRNM, PEW is present if at least one abnormal measure is recorded is in at least three of the four categories. We measured the four markers: albumin, BMI, corrected mid-arm muscle area (cMAMA) and normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) (a measure of daily protein intake (DPI)).&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>As recommended by Zoccali et al obesity was assessed using different criteria based on either BMI, fat percentage (FM%), waist circumference (WC) and waist hip ratio (WHR). Cut off values for BMI, WC and WHR were based on WHO criteria. Cut off values for FM% were based on earlier published recommendations. In addition we calculated FMI, and defined obesity as a FMI &gt;90th percentile of the reference population.&#xD;
Classification of obesity BMI&gt;30kg/m2 FMI &gt; 90th percentile Fat percentage &gt; 25% (men) or 35% (women) WC &gt; 102cm (men) or 88cm (women) WHR &gt; 0,90 (men) or 0,85 (women)</description>
