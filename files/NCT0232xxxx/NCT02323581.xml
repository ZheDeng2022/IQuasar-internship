    <description>Either the TAAA device or the Physician-Specified TAAA Device will be implanted.&#xD;
The TAAA Device is a standard configuration branched stent graft with a combination of two branches for the mesenteric arteries and two fenestrations for the renal arteries.&#xD;
The Physician-Specified TAAA Devices are designed on a per patient basis and may include a combination of up to 4 fenestrations and branches for mesenteric and renal arteries. An additional 5th branch or fenestration may be included if there is a large accessory renal artery. Branches will be used for downward-oriented mesenteric and renal arteries and fenestrations for renal arteries that project laterally or upwards.</description>

    <intervention_name>Endovascular treatment of Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysm</intervention_name>
    <description>A TAAA is an abnormal enlargement (ballooning out) of the main artery (the aorta) and involves all or part of the aorta in your chest as well as all or part of the aorta in the abdomen. It also involves the part of the aorta where the arteries that bring blood to the liver, stomach and intestines and kidneys are attached.&#xD;
This investigational procedure that is being studied uses stent-grafts (cylindrical fabric tubes (grafts), with metal springs (stents) attached). The stent-grafts are placed inside the aneurysmal (weakened) area of the aorta to re-line it. These customized stent-grafts have special branches attached to them or openings (called &quot;fenestrations&quot;) that are used to keep blood flowing to the arteries that supply the liver, stomach, intestines and kidneys. The investigational stent graft will be designed and custom-made specifically for your aneurysm.</description>

    <intervention_name>Endovascular treatment of Aortic Arch Aneurysms</intervention_name>
    <description>An aortic arch aneurysm is an abnormal enlargement (ballooning out) of the main artery (the aorta). The ascending aorta and aortic arch is the first part of the vessel as it exits the heart and makes a turn around the area of the collar bone. This part of the aorta gives branches that supply the head, brain and arms.&#xD;
The arch branch endovascular graft includes the main aortic arch portion and one to three cuffs (side branches) that allow the graft to be located in the aortic arch. The number of cuffs is decided based on the anatomy of your aneurysm. The arteries in the aortic arch are the innominate artery (Zone 0), left common carotid artery (Zone 1) and the left subclavian artery (Zone 2). These arteries supply the right arm and right side of the brain, the left side of the brain and the left arm, respectively.</description>
