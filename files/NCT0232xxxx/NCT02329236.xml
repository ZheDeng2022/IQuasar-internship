      The aim of the our study is to investigate whether there is an increased incidence of ADHD (&#xD;
      based on self reports and questionnaires) among children with short stature due to&#xD;
      constitutional growth delay (CGD) in comparison with children with Familial short stature.&#xD;

      Filling out the study questionnaire by ADHD diagnosed and suspected children (have a positive&#xD;
      DBDRS (Disruptive Behavior Disorders Rating Scale Questionnaire) result) who were referred to&#xD;
      the pediatric endocrine clinic of our hospital for short statue evaluation. The study&#xD;
      questionnaire will be filled by child's guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study and the DBDRS questionnaires will be filled only after obtaining an informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The required data including growth statistics, age at puberty, bone age and other relevant&#xD;
      data will be collected from the child's medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data on patients will be processed anonymously.&#xD;
