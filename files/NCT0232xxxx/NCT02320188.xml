  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine in a randomized controlled trial (RCT), the efficacy&#xD;
      of eccentric exercise training in restoring muscle mass and function in patients with&#xD;
      rheumatoid cachexia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by severe disability and metabolic changes leading&#xD;
      to an increase in cardiovascular mortality compared with the general population. RA is an&#xD;
      independent cardiovascular risk factor. In contrast to the general population, RA patients&#xD;
      with low body mass index (BMI) had a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular death. Low&#xD;
      BMI may indicate rheumatoid cachexia and may explain the excess cardiovascular risk and&#xD;
      mortality. Cachexia is defined by is a loss of body cell mass, predominantly in skeletal&#xD;
      muscle, associated with increased fat mass and often stable weight. Rheumatoid cachexia, not&#xD;
      well recognized, is frequent, affecting two third of patients. Pathogenesis may include&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokine production, physical inactivity, higher catabolism and reduced&#xD;
      peripheral insulin action. Therapeutic strategy includes increasing physical activity and the&#xD;
      treatment of disease itself. Studies have shown that regular progressive resistance strength&#xD;
      training improves strength and pain in patients with well-controlled RA without exacerbating&#xD;
      disease activity or joint pain. At comparable mechanical power output, eccentric (ECC )&#xD;
      exercises are characterised by lower metabolic demand than concentric (CON) exercises. ECC&#xD;
      exercise is characterised not only by its low energy cost, but also by specific&#xD;
      cardiocirculatory specificity. In patients with Parkinson's disease, compared to a&#xD;
      conventional rehabilitation programme, ECC training better improved quadriceps muscle volume.&#xD;
      In overweight and diabetic patients, ECC training improved resting energy expenditure and fat&#xD;
      oxidation, blood lipid profile and insulin resistance compared to CON training. As in&#xD;
      cancers, ECC training appears to be particularly suitable for patients with rheumatoid&#xD;
      cachexia as it can maximize the functional and structural muscle responses with low energy&#xD;
      cost populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to determine the muscle effects of ECC training, with the primary outcome&#xD;
      being the knee extensor strength gain at 3 months. Secondary outcomes are the improvement in&#xD;
      muscle mass, functional status and cardiovascular risk. From patients who consented in ECC&#xD;
      training group, muscle biopsy specimens from vastus lateralis will be obtained at baseline&#xD;
      prior to the training period. Primary and secondary outcome criteria will be assessed at&#xD;
      inclusion, at 3 months, and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, 48 patients will need to be recruited. These patients will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of the 3 groups, with each group comprising 16 patients: group 1 with ECC training, group&#xD;
      2 with CONC training, group 3 with no training (control). The training program will consist&#xD;
      in 30 sessions over 12 weeks.&#xD;
