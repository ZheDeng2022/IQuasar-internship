  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to translate the Look AHEAD intensive lifestyle intervention for&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes and obesity into usual care at community health centers, comparing an&#xD;
      in-person group program (IP), a telephone conference call (TCC) group program, and referral&#xD;
      to medical nutrition therapy (MNT), the current standard of care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three arms: MNT, IP, or TCC. Participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study for a total of three years. During those three years,&#xD;
      participants will have 5 research visits, at baseline, where randomization occurs, 6 months,&#xD;
      12 months, 24 months, and 36 months. At each research visit, participants will have a lipid&#xD;
      panel and HbA1c sample drawn, their blood pressure, weight, and height, baseline only, taken.&#xD;
      Participants will also answer questionnaires that will address health behaviors,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, measures of self-determination, depression, literacy and numeracy, food&#xD;
      insecurity, health-related quality-of-life and patient satisfaction with quality of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the group-based interventions, dietitians will deliver the adapted Look AHEAD lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention. The first 14 sessions will be delivered weekly and the next 5 sessions&#xD;
      biweekly. In the subsequent 18 months, group sessions will be delivered monthly from 6-24&#xD;
      months. In addition, participants will be offered up to 5 individual MNT sessions over the 2&#xD;
      year intervention period. At these individual visits, dietitians will address&#xD;
      diabetes-related issues and discuss tailored goals and behaviors, based on the Look AHEAD&#xD;
      model. Dietitians will provide ongoing feedback to participants' own PCPs about patient&#xD;
      progress toward goals and will encourage PCPs to reinforce weight loss strategies with their&#xD;
      patients. Each group will contain up to 12 participants with type 2 diabetes and will last&#xD;
      1-1.5 hours. The program curriculum focuses on nutrition, activity, and behavioral topics and&#xD;
      incorporates the use of meal replacements for the first 4-16 weeks to enhance weight loss&#xD;
      success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the teaching component, participants who are taking insulin or medications&#xD;
      that can cause hypoglycemia will self-monitor blood glucose levels at least 2 times per day&#xD;
      and submit self-monitoring records for review each week, either by delivering them at the&#xD;
      in-person sessions or by mailing, faxing, or emailing them to the study team. Patients on&#xD;
      oral hypoglycemics who are not adjusting medications based on blood sugar will be instructed&#xD;
      to do targeted monitoring to determine the effects of exercise and meals on blood glucose.&#xD;
      The study provider at each health center will review BG records and make any needed&#xD;
      adjustments to insulin or medication doses according to an algorithm to maintain glycemic&#xD;
      control and prevent hypoglycemia as participants lose weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trained member of the study staff will provide MNT referral participants with an&#xD;
      educational handout emphasizing that modest weight loss (5 - 10%) via caloric restriction and&#xD;
      gradual adoption of moderate increases in daily physical activity (equivalent to brisk&#xD;
      walking for 30 minutes daily) is safe and effective in managing diabetes and schedule them&#xD;
      for an appointment with a dietitian from Nutrition Services for follow up.&#xD;

          <title>Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT)</title>
          <description>Participants in this arm will meet with a dietitian at their respective Health Center, not with a study dietitian. The participant and dietitian will decide how frequently to meet and create an individualized treatment plan. The participant's health insurance will be billed for these dietitian visit(s) and the participant is responsible for any copay(s) or deductible(s) associated with the visit(s).&#xD;
Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT): Participants are referred to meet with a registered dietitian for individual medical nutrition therapy sessions up to 3-4 times per year.</description>

        <group group_id="B2">
          <title>In Person Group (IP)</title>
          <description>Participants enrolled to the IP arm will meet weekly for 14 weeks, biweekly for 10 weeks, and then monthly for the next 18 months. Each session will be led by a study dietitian that has been assigned to that specific health center and will last 1.5 hours. Participants will be allowed to have one-on-one sessions with their dietitian throughout the first two years, twice in the first year and three times in the second year.&#xD;
In Person Group (IP): The goals of the diabetes lifestyle intervention program are weight loss of 5-10% of initial body weight and increased activity levels to 175 minutes/week of moderate intensity physical activity. Dietitians will deliver the adapted Look AHEAD lifestyle intervention via in-person groups combined with 2-3 individual sessions per year. The program curriculum focuses on nutrition, activity, and behavioral topics and incorporates the use of meal replacements for the first 4-16 weeks to enhance weight loss success.</description>

In Person Group (IP): The goals of the diabetes lifestyle intervention program are weight loss of 5-10% of initial body weight and increased activity levels to 175 minutes/week of moderate intensity physical activity. Dietitians will deliver the adapted Look AHEAD lifestyle intervention via in-person groups combined with 2-3 individual sessions per year. The program curriculum focuses on nutrition, activity, and behavioral topics and incorporates the use of meal replacements for the first 4-16 weeks to enhance weight loss success.</description>
