    <textblock>
      This trial will compare two methods of increasing engagement in care and success in diabetes&#xD;
      management, among patients with diabetes with high-risk features, who also have family&#xD;
      members involved in their care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Veterans with diabetes must control cardiovascular risk factors in order to prevent disabling&#xD;
      and life-threatening complications. However, despite system wide advances in diabetes quality&#xD;
      of care, over 30% of VHA patients with diabetes continue to have uncontrolled blood pressure,&#xD;
      hyperglycemia, or hyperlipidemia. The nationwide VA PACT (Patient-Aligned Care Teams)&#xD;
      initiative seeks to provide patients comprehensive, team-based support for following diabetes&#xD;
      care regimens. PACT's success, however, hinges on its ability to effectively engage patients&#xD;
      in care. One relatively untapped resource for supporting engagement in PACT is patients'&#xD;
      family and friends. Three out of four adults with diabetes reach out to an unpaid family&#xD;
      member or friend (a 'Care Partner') for ongoing help with diabetes management. These&#xD;
      supporters help patients with medication adherence, tracking home glucose measurements,&#xD;
      maintaining a healthy eating plan, and often accompany patients to their medical visits.&#xD;
      However, while PACT emphasizes the importance of family members as part of the care team,&#xD;
      PACT does not have formal mechanisms to involve health supporters in PACT care. Health&#xD;
      supporters report that, in order to be more effective, they need more information on&#xD;
      patient's medical care plans, clear channels for communicating with PACT team members, and&#xD;
      information on navigating PACT resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this randomized trial is to test a strategy to strengthen the&#xD;
      capacity of supporters to help patients with high-risk diabetes engage in PACT care and&#xD;
      successfully enact care plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis is that providing health care engagement tools to both Care Partners&#xD;
      and patients will increase patient activation and improve management of diabetes complication&#xD;
      risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled trial evaluating an intervention (Caring Others Increasing&#xD;
      EngageMent in PACT, or CO-IMPACT) designed to structure and facilitate health supporter&#xD;
      involvement in PACT so that patients can become more actively engaged in PACT care. 240&#xD;
      patients with diabetes receiving PACT primary care who: 1) are at high risk for diabetes&#xD;
      complications due to hyperglycemia OR high blood pressure and 2) have a health supporter&#xD;
      involved in their care will be recruited along with their health supporter. Patient-supporter&#xD;
      dyads are randomized to the CO-IMPACT intervention or usual PACT care for high-risk diabetes,&#xD;
      for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention provides patient-supporter dyads: one coaching session on action planning,&#xD;
      communicating with providers, navigation skills and support skills; preparation by phone&#xD;
      before patients' primary care visits; after-visit summaries by mail; and biweekly automated&#xD;
      phone calls to prompt action on new patient health concerns. CO-IMPACT builds on medical&#xD;
      record-integrated patient activation tools in the PACT toolkit and is designed to be&#xD;
      implementable within existing PACT nurse encounters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes for this study include a validated measure of patient activation (Patient&#xD;
      Activation Measure-13) and a cardiac event 5-year risk score designed for patients with&#xD;
      diabetes (UKPDS Risk Engine). Secondary outcomes include patients' self-efficacy for diabetes&#xD;
      self-care; diabetes self-management behaviors including medication adherence; diabetes&#xD;
      distress; and glycemic and blood pressure control. Measures among supporters include&#xD;
      supporter activation, use of effective support techniques, distress about patient's diabetes&#xD;
      care, and caregiver burden. We are also measuring patient-supporter and patient-provider&#xD;
      relationship quality, patient safety (e.g. hypoglycemia), utilization, potential moderators&#xD;
      of intervention effect such as patient health literacy level, and facilitators and barriers&#xD;
      to wider implementation.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited from 11/16/16 to 5/22/18. Eligible patient participants were identified from one of two participating VHA sites. Once identified, they received an introductory letter about the study and indicated interest by phone or mail.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>None. All patient-supporter dyads who enrolled in the study were randomized to one of two study arms.</pre_assignment_details>
