  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no specific treatment for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). Current EVD care are&#xD;
      supportive, and includes intravenous or oral rehydration, nutrition, pain killers, treatment&#xD;
      of coinfections with antibacterial and antimalarial drugs, and blood transfusion when&#xD;
      appropriate. Despite these interventions, mortality remains high since the ongoing Ebola&#xD;
      outbreak in West Africa was declared in April.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential anti-Ebola specific interventions include convalescent plasma, monoclonal and&#xD;
      polyclonal antibodies, small inhibitory RNA (siRNA), synthetic adenosine analogues or RNA&#xD;
      polymerase inhibitors. All these interventions are considered investigational due to lack of&#xD;
      data in humans with EVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators chose to study the efficacy of favipiravir because this&#xD;
      drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  showed anti-Ebola efficacy in immunodeficient murine models;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  has been studied in thousands of adult humans participating in anti-influenza trials,&#xD;
           with good tolerance; it has been approved for treating novel or resistant influenza&#xD;
           infections in Japan;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is immediately available;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  can be used orally, and can be easily given in both adults and children because pills&#xD;
           can be crushed and mixed in food or liquids;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  has recently been used in Europe for treating several patients with EVD; the French drug&#xD;
           safety agency (ANSM) has reviewed published data as well as data provided by the firm&#xD;
           (Toyama Chemical Co., Ltd), and approved its compassionate use in EVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here the investigators propose to assess the efficacy of high-dosed favipiravir in reducing&#xD;
      mortality in humans with EVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present trial &quot;JIKI&quot; (means &quot;Hope&quot; in &quot;Kissi&quot; language), investigators, sponsor,&#xD;
      scientific advisory board and safety monitoring board will be coordinated in a very reactive&#xD;
      way, so that any new fact can be discussed rapidly and the research plan can be adapted&#xD;
      accordingly (change in drug dosage; use of drug combination; combination with another&#xD;
      strategy such as passive immunization with convalescent plasma, etc.).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The efficacy of antivirals in patients with EVD should correlate negatively with time&#xD;
           since first symptoms. Thus, in this proof of concept trial, the main analysis will be&#xD;
           done in adult patients with early symptoms in whom the efficacy is expected to be the&#xD;
           highest;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Favipiravir for EVD should be given at higher doses than that previously tested in&#xD;
           studies in human with influenza. For this trial, the dose was calculated based on&#xD;
           pharmacokinetics simulations, to rapidly reach plasma concentrations associated with&#xD;
           anti-EBOV activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A third assumption was made, given recent pre-trial data showing first a strong link&#xD;
           between baseline viral load and mortality and second a higher mortality in children&#xD;
           below 6 years: the efficacy of antivirals in patients with EVD should correlate&#xD;
           negatively with viral load at start of treatment and with young age. Thus a secondary&#xD;
           objective is the efficacy of favipiravir in adult patients and children &gt;6 years with&#xD;
           moderate baseline viral load (i.e. cycle threshold [Ct] ≥20 measured by RT-PCR) in whom&#xD;
           the efficacy is expected to be the highest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparative trial of favipiravir against a standard package of care (with or without&#xD;
      placebo) has been deemed not appropriate because of: i) the highly sensitive social and&#xD;
      political context; ii) the need to collect rapidly basic phase II evidence on the efficacy of&#xD;
      high dosed favipiravir on EVD before choosing the best intervention(s) to be tested in phase&#xD;
      III (favipiravir alone or in combination with other drugs; other therapeutic options&#xD;
      including convalescent plasma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators propose a non-comparative, proof-of-concept, phase II trial in&#xD;
      patients with EVD, which will allow concluding within a few weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  that mortality in patients starting favipiravir within 72 hours after the onset of first&#xD;
           symptoms is inferior to mortality without treatment prior to the trial initiation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  or that there is no trend that favipiravir brings significant benefit in terms of&#xD;
           survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Primary objective: to assess the efficacy of high-dosed favipiravir in reducing&#xD;
      mortality in humans with EVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: to assess the evolution of EBOV plasma RNA and infectious loads under&#xD;
      treatment; the tolerance of favipiravir; the viral micro-diversity of EBOV, the trough&#xD;
      concentrations of favipiravir and factors associated with mortality and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups In this protocol, the investigators will refer to the following groups according to&#xD;
      age and duration of symptoms*: Group A1: adults with time between first symptoms and first&#xD;
      dose of favipiravir ≤72h; Group A2: adults with time between first symptoms and first dose of&#xD;
      favipiravir &gt;72h and Group C: all children &gt;1 year and weighting ≥10kg. Time of first symptom&#xD;
      refers to the time of the beginning of any symptom considered to be related to EVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Symptoms to be considered will be: acute onset of fever, severe headache, myalgia, extreme&#xD;
      fatigue, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, or unexplained hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given recent pre-trial data, a second definition of groups was also used: group AC1: adults&#xD;
      and children &gt;6 years with baseline Ct ≥20; group AC2: adults and children &gt;6 years with&#xD;
      baseline Ct values &lt;20; group YC: young children ≤6 years and &gt;1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: recruitment in the trial will be kept opened in all groups until group A1&#xD;
      reaches 60 participants, unless early termination is recommended by the DSMB. Because we&#xD;
      expect the efficacy of the treatment to be the maximum in patients with early symptoms, the&#xD;
      sample size calculation was based on the analysis of mortality in group A1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observed pre-trial mortality was estimated using the three months data (from 15/08/2014&#xD;
      to 15/11/2014) of the MSF database in the Gueckedou EVD centre. Given those estimations, and&#xD;
      to remain pragmatic and conservative, we set the pre-trial mortality to 55% for groups A1,&#xD;
      A2, C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With 60 participants in group A1, the power to conclude that mortality in the trial will be&#xD;
      -20% inferior to pre-trial mortality will be equal to 89%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis for primary outcome: mortality by Day-14 with 95% CI will be reported&#xD;
      overall and in each group separately. Day-0 is the day of the first dose of favipiravir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group A1, if the number of deaths is &lt;24 (40%) out of 60 participants, the upper bound of&#xD;
      the 95%CI will be &lt;55%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group A2, if the number of deaths is &lt;54 (45%) out of 120 participants, the upper bound of&#xD;
      the 95%CI will be &lt;55%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group C, if the number of deaths is &lt;17 (38%) out of 45 participants, the upper bound of&#xD;
      the 95%CI will be &lt;55% In each group (A1, A2, C), the investigator will conclude that&#xD;
      favipiravir decreases mortality if the upper bound of the 95% CI does not include the&#xD;
      observed pre-trial mortality (55%) in untreated patients with same duration of symptoms prior&#xD;
      to trial initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis for secondary outcomes: mortality by Day-14 with exact 95%CI will be&#xD;
      reported according to the second group definition (AC1, AC2, YC). In each group, we will&#xD;
      conclude that favipiravir decreases mortality if the upper bound of the 95% CI does not&#xD;
      include the observed pre-trial mortality (30%, 85% and 70%, respectively) in untreated&#xD;
      patients with same characteristics prior to trial initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the following outcomes will be analysed overall and separately by the two group&#xD;
      definitions (A1, A2, C or AC1, AC2, YC): the evolution of EBOV plasma RNA and infectious&#xD;
      loads between Day-0 and the end of follow up will be described in each patient. The numbers,&#xD;
      proportions and exact 95% CI will be described for grade 3-4 adverse events; resistance&#xD;
      mutations; and patients reaching criteria for cure at Day-30. The distribution (median, IQR,&#xD;
      min-max) of initial and maximal viral load, time to maximal viral load and to&#xD;
      undetectability, and rate of increase/decrease will be reported. The distribution of trough&#xD;
      concentrations of favipiravir at each point and the inter- and intra-patient variability of&#xD;
      concentrations will be described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factors associated with mortality by Day-14, cure at Day-30 and grade 3-4 clinical or&#xD;
      biological adverse events (including time between first symptoms and treatment initiation,&#xD;
      evolution of EBOV viral load, trough concentrations of favipiravir) will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping rules for futility: there will be intermediate analyses of mortality for futility&#xD;
      only, performed every 20 adults in each group and every 10 children:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults: recruitment in the two groups A1 and A2 will be prematurely stopped if the&#xD;
           results show that the trial is unlikely to prove that mortality with favipiravir is&#xD;
           &lt;55%;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children: recruitment in the group C will be prematurely stopped if the results show&#xD;
           that the trial is unlikely to prove that mortality with favipiravir is &lt;55%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity: deaths will be reported to the sponsor and to the DSMB on a daily basis; SAE other&#xD;
      than death will be reported to the sponsor and to the DSMB on a weekly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sponsor and coordination The trial sponsor is the INSERM. The international coordinating,&#xD;
      monitoring and data management centre will be the &quot;Mereva&quot; clinical trial unit (CTU), an&#xD;
      international team with members affiliated to the Inserm 897 Unit, University of Bordeaux and&#xD;
      to the &quot;Pacci/ANRS&quot; research site in Abidjan. Trial coordinating, monitoring and data&#xD;
      management activities will be coordinated by an International Clinical Project Manager (CPM).&#xD;
      In Guinea, where the trial will be conducted, a trial country coordination center (CCC) will&#xD;
      be put in place, lead by a country CPM who will work in close collaboration with the&#xD;
      international CPM and with the participating clinical centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted and monitored according to a Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)&#xD;
      manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to ensure the clinical trial is conducted properly, the CTU and CCC will coordinate&#xD;
      all study activities of the Project Team. This includes in particular to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Set up and monitor workflows, timelines, milestones and tracking tools;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct regular team meetings to discuss project status, activities, and address issues;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintain daily contact with principal investigators, sponsor and clinical sites;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide status reports to principal investigator, DSMB, and SAB;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Support the study sites with study related questions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ensure that study drug is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to&#xD;
           specifications;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy of entries in the database, the&#xD;
           adherence to the protocol, SOPs and to Good Clinical Practice. Monitoring standards&#xD;
           require full verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the&#xD;
           inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of serious adverse events (SAEs), and the&#xD;
           recording of data that will be used for all primary and safety variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator must give the CCC access to all relevant source documents to confirm their&#xD;
      consistency with the CRF and database entries. For this particular trial, some documents&#xD;
      filed in within the isolation ward will have to be destroyed in order to avoid contamination.&#xD;
      Data recorded on a document that will have to be destroyed will be defined before study&#xD;
      start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators put particular focus on structured communication, and, together with the&#xD;
      principal investigators and the partners, will define the communication plan which includes&#xD;
      the key communication areas such as meetings, trainings, telephone conferences, internal&#xD;
      project meetings, monitoring plan meetings and report updates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators at each clinical site will keep a hard copy of the Trial Master File (TMF),&#xD;
      containing all essential technical (protocol, SOPs, etc.), and regulatory (insurance, IRB&#xD;
      approvals, task delegation descriptions, bio-sketches, agreements, etc.) trial documents. The&#xD;
      country CPM will be responsible for checking that the files containing the hard copy of the&#xD;
      TMF documents at each trial clinic and at the CCC are up-to-date. All TMF documents will also&#xD;
      be made available online to investigators on a private website (&quot;eTMF&quot;). The international&#xD;
      CPM will be responsible for routinely updating the documentation on the trial website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CTU will develop by December 1st, 2014:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A case report form (CRF): data will be collected on hard copy CRF. The medical investigator&#xD;
      or his/her designated representative will be responsible for filling out the forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A database: Data will be entered online in a system that will ensure data encryption,&#xD;
      restricted access to the database, daily back-up, and tracking of edits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Data Management Plan (DMP) and Data Validation Plan (DVP), including the quality control&#xD;
      process to ensure completeness, validity, consistency, timeliness and accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training will be provided to all members of the study team involved in data collection data&#xD;
      entry, data check and monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CTU data managing team will conduct data review and handle queries on a weekly basis, and&#xD;
      reconcile the safety database with the clinical database.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  age &gt;1 year and weighting ≥10kg,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EVD confirmed by a positive qualitative PCR test,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  signed informed consent (signed by the parents/adults guardians in case of minor&#xD;
             patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non inclusion-criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  pregnancy*,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  inability to take the drug (encephalopathy, severe vomiting). * Emergency use of&#xD;
             favipiravir in pregnant women outside of the trial is envisaged and under evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In this protocol, the investigators will refer to the following groups according to age and&#xD;
        duration of symptoms**:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Group A1: adults with time between first symptoms and first dose of favipiravir ≤72h;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Group A2: adults with time between first symptoms and first dose of favipiravir &gt;72h;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Group C: all children &gt;1 year and weighting ≥10kg. Time of first symptom refers to the&#xD;
             time of the beginning of any symptom considered to be related to EVD. **Symptoms to be&#xD;
             considered will be: acute onset of fever, severe headache, myalgia, extreme fatigue,&#xD;
             vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, or unexplained hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The division in groups is a matter of analysis, and will not be perceptible by the patients&#xD;
        during the trial process. Patients in the three groups will receive the same treatment and&#xD;
        will be followed under the same procedures, with only two exceptions: the number of&#xD;
        additional blood sample collections will be lower in group A2 and C (n=2) than in group A1&#xD;
        (n=3) and daily dosages will be adapted to the body weight in group C.&#xD;
