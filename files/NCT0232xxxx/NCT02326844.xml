  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The new drug BMN 673 (talazoparib) has been shown to fight tumor cells in animals and some&#xD;
      people. It is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. It works on tumor cell&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage repair process. Researchers want to see if BMN 673 shrinks&#xD;
      cancer again in women with ovarian cancer and whose cancer initially got shrunk but grew back&#xD;
      on the first PARP inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study BMN 673 (talazoparib) in people with ovarian cancer born with a breast cancer&#xD;
      (BRCA) mutation and whose cancer got shrunk but became worse after they took a similar drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women at least 18 years old:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  with recurrent and/or metastatic germline breast cancer mutation (gBRCAm)-associated&#xD;
           ovarian cancer AND&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  whose disease is growing after already being treated with PARP inhibitors AND&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  with no other treatment(s) in between the first PARP inhibitors and a screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and heart and blood&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take the study drug by mouth once daily. They will take the drug in&#xD;
           28-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will keep a diary of doses and any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 4 study visits in cycle 1, then 1 visit every cycle. Visits may&#xD;
           include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Participants will&#xD;
           lie in a machine that takes pictures of their body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a biopsy before starting the study drug. A small piece of tumor&#xD;
           tissue will be removed by needle, guided by a scan. They may have two more biopsies&#xD;
           later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be followed for 30 days after taking the last dose of study drug. A&#xD;
           physical exam, blood tests, and CT or other scans will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have follow-up calls to ask about any side effects.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations (gBRCAm) demonstrate repeated therapeutic&#xD;
           susceptibility to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damaging agents, especially platinums,&#xD;
           even if they have previously progressed on a similar (platinum-based) regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) have clinical activity in&#xD;
           gBRCAm-associated malignancies, although patients eventually develop progressive&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMN 673 (talazoparib) is a novel PARPi, with excellent oral bioavailability and greater&#xD;
           anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo at lower concentrations than first generation&#xD;
           PARPi.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is unknown whether secondary BRCA mutations or other potential mechanisms of clinical&#xD;
           resistance portend cross-resistance to a highly potent PARPi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the objective response rate (complete response (CR)+partial response (PR)) of&#xD;
      single agent BMN 673 (talazoparib) in ovarian cancer patients with gBRCAm who have progressed&#xD;
      on prior PARPi therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women with recurrent and/or metastatic gBRCAm-associated ovarian cancer, with&#xD;
           progression on PARPi monotherapy within the immediate prior 2 months of the time of&#xD;
           screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients should have responded to their prior PARPi therapy (CR, PR or stable disease&#xD;
           (SD)&gt;4months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients cannot have received another therapy between stopping their first PARPi&#xD;
           therapy\ and initiating therapy on this trial, but must be off the prior PARPi for at&#xD;
           least 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2 and adequate organ and&#xD;
           marrow function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is an open label, single arm phase II trial to examine activity of BMN 673&#xD;
           (talazoparib).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive BMN 673 (talazoparib) at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
           1mg p.o. once daily on 28 day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research samples including whole blood, plasma, circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and&#xD;
           tumor biopsies will be obtained for progressive disease (PD) endpoints at baseline,&#xD;
           cycle 1 day 29 (prior to cycle 2 day 1), and/or at progression in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be evaluated every two cycles for response using Response Evaluation&#xD;
           Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)v1.1 criteria and every cycle for safety using Common&#xD;
           Terminology Criteria in Adverse Events (CTCAE)v4.0.&#xD;

    <description>Objective response (complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)) was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria. CR is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases diagnosed within 1 year will be excluded from&#xD;
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic&#xD;
             and other adverse events. Exception: patients with brain metastases diagnosed greater&#xD;
             than 1 year prior to study entry may be considered if they received sterilizing&#xD;

             significant gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding or hemoptysis within 28 days prior to the&#xD;
             start of the study, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active infection will not be eligible, but may become eligible once&#xD;
             infection has resolved and they are at least 7 days from completion of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Another previous or current invasive malignancy within the last 2 years, with the&#xD;
             exception of curatively treated stage Ia cervical carcinoma, or resected stage Ia&#xD;
             endometrial cancer, and noninvasive nonmelanoma skin cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)- positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with&#xD;
             BMN 673 (talazoparib). HIV- positive patients who are not on combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy (cART) and have cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) counts &gt; 500&#xD;
             are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to BMN 673 (talazoparib)&#xD;

        to treat the malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with gastrointestinal conditions that might predispose for drug&#xD;
             intolerability or poor drug absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of nasogastric or gastric (G)-tube administration.&#xD;

        <title>Progression Free Survival (PFS) on BMN673 (Talazoparib) to PFS From First Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitor (PARPPi) Exposure</title>
        <description>The median time to progression after receiving BMN673 will be compared informally to the time of progression for the same patients after receiving an initial PARPi exposure. Progression is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more lesions is also considered progressions).</description>
        <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
        <population>This outcome measure was not done because the study was prematurely closed by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) sponsor following the enrollment of 3 subjects. We were unable to analyze biomarker endpoints due to insufficient number of samples after premature closure of the study.</population>
