    <textblock>
      The investigators will assess the feasibility of intraoperative use of C-arm cone-beam CT&#xD;
      imaging for intraoperative dosimetric evaluation in prostate low-dose-rate (LDR)&#xD;
      brachytherapy. Patients recruited are those who will receive standard LDR brachytherapy for&#xD;
      prostate cancer treatment. Consenting patients will undergo additional 3D C-arm cone-beam CT&#xD;
      imaging (3D C-arm) and motorized trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS). Volumetric and dosimetric&#xD;
      measures will be compared to those using the standard Day-0 CT images. The investigators hope&#xD;
      that the intraoperative 3D C-arm provides quality assurance measures sufficient to eliminate&#xD;
      the need for Day-0 CT LDR brachytherapy and provide the opportunity for intraoperative&#xD;
      modification of seed delivery plan.&#xD;

      1. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The primary objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of replacing&#xD;
                Day-0 CT with intra-operative 3D C-arm imaging. The main benefit of this change is&#xD;
                to receive immediate feedback on the quality of treatment. This can lead to the&#xD;
                possibility of performing &quot;live&quot; adjustments to the treatment plan based on&#xD;
                feedback of actual seed positions achieved after implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Secondly, by replacing Day-0 CT, a separate scan performed in a different site will&#xD;
                be eliminated from the treatment procedure, freeing up the CT scanner for other&#xD;
                clinical uses&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Primary hypothesis: Intraoperative use of 3D C-arm cone-beam CT can eliminate the&#xD;
                need for Day-0 CT for post-implant dosimetry in prostate LDR brachytherapy by&#xD;
                providing similar or improved dosimetric accuracy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Secondary hypothesis 1: Dosimetric values obtained with the TRUS probe inside the&#xD;
                rectum are not significantly different from those measured when the probe is&#xD;
                outside the rectum&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Secondary hypothesis 2: Sagittal TRUS imaging provides better seed and boudnary&#xD;
                detection for dosimetric purposes compared to transverse imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Justification&#xD;
&#xD;
           Standard post-implant quality assessment at the BC Cancer Agency involves a pelvic CT&#xD;
           2-3 hours after treatment. This scan is performed outside the operating room, in a&#xD;
           different location. As a result, it is not possible to receive immediate feedback on the&#xD;
           quality of treatment. Furthermore, soft tissue visualization is poor in CT imaging and&#xD;
           contouring variability is large. The use of other imaging modalities such as ultrasound&#xD;
           would be beneficial. However, since the scan is performed at a different time, and with&#xD;
           the patient in a different position, registering the images would be challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intra-operative C-arm CT imaging would provide immediate feedback on the quality of&#xD;
           treatment, provide the opportunity of using information from intra-operative ultrasound&#xD;
           imaging for soft tissue visualization, and eliminate the need for a separate scan in a&#xD;
           different location.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Research method&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients who are receiving low-dose-rate brachytherapy and consent to participate will&#xD;
           undergo the additional imaging interventions described in section 5.7 of the&#xD;
           application.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will also undergo a pelvic CT as the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To limit patient exposure to additional radiation dose, the investigators will divide&#xD;
           the participants into 3 groups, each of which will receive a portion of the&#xD;
           abovementioned scans. Details are described in the attached protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Seed locations will be identified on the 3D C-arm volume. The prostate volume on the&#xD;
           TRUS images will be delineated and the contours will be mapped onto the 3D C-arm volume&#xD;
           to compute standard dosimetric parameters (V100, D90). Seeds and contours will be&#xD;
           outlined on the corresponding Day-0 CT and standard dosimetric parameters will be&#xD;
           computed. Day-0 CT will be contoured by multiple observers to compute variability in the&#xD;
           resulting dosimetric parameters. Dosimetric values from the 3D C-arm will be compared to&#xD;
           those of Day-0 CT and their intra-observer variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The seeds will be identified on 3D C-arm volumes with the TRUS probe inserted and&#xD;
           retracted to create two seed clouds. Corresponding seeds will be matched. The difference&#xD;
           between the seed locations in the two seed clouds will be used to model the prostate&#xD;
           deformation due to the presence and absence of the TRUS probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Statistical analysis This is mainly a descriptive one-arm study. No comparative&#xD;
           statistical tests will be applied&#xD;
