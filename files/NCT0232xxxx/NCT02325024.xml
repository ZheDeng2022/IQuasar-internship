  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of a single oromucosal dose of&#xD;
      Sativex® (i.e. how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolises and excretes the drug) when&#xD;
      subjects have severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease (ESRD), compared with&#xD;
      subjects who have normal renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary clinical hypothesis is that there will be an effect from severe renal impairment&#xD;
      on the PK of Sativex® when administered as a single oromucosal dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study additionally aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the same single&#xD;
      oromucosal dose of Sativex® in subjects with severe renal impairment or ESRD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open label, single-dose study to evaluate the effect of renal impairment&#xD;
      on the PK of an oromucosal dose (four sprays) of Sativex® (containing 10.8 mg Δ9&#xD;
      tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] and 10 mg cannabidiol [CBD]) in subjects with severe renal&#xD;
      impairment or ESRD (with a creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min and not requiring dialysis)&#xD;
      compared to matched subjects with normal renal function (with a creatinine clearance &gt; 80&#xD;
      mL/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be given a single oromucosal dose (four sprays) of Sativex® on Dosing&#xD;
      Day 1. Serial blood and urine samples for determination of concentrations of THC, 11-hydroxy-&#xD;
      Δ9 - tetrahydrocannabinol (11-OH-THC), CBD, and 7-hydroxy-cannabidiol (7- OH-CBD) will be&#xD;
      collected from subjects with severe renal impairment or ESRD, not requiring dialysis, and&#xD;
      matched subjects with normal renal function before and up to 48 hours after dosing at&#xD;
      selected time points. Pre-dose blood samples will also be collected for protein binding&#xD;
      measurement. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated from Day -2 through to the post-study&#xD;
      follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Follow-up Safety visit will be performed 7 days after Sativex® dosing (+ 2 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected maximum duration for study participation (including Screening, Inpatient Period,&#xD;
      and Follow-up) for each individual subject is a maximum of 24 days.&#xD;
