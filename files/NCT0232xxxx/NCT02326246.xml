    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the hypothesis, that mMRI provides a more&#xD;
      accurate and secure interpretation of the aggressiveness of prostate cancer initially/before&#xD;
      mMRI defined as low risk. In doing so we will investigate and assess the affect of mMRI on&#xD;
      gleason score upgrade, risk classification upgrade and changes in treatment strategy (active&#xD;
      surveillance vs. operation).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the urological department K, Aarhus University Hospital (AUH), approx. 500 TRUS biopsies&#xD;
      are performed each year and about 125 intermediate/high risk patients undergo radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy (RP). At any time approx. 50 men with low-risk PC is in active surveillance&#xD;
      (AS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRIs will all be performed with a 3 Tesla MRI system with a phased-array coil including&#xD;
      standard T1 and T2-weighted sequences, diffusion-weighted sequences with different b-values&#xD;
      and a dynamic contrast sequence of the prostate gland. In patients in whom a previous mMRI&#xD;
      has shown tumor, the MRGBs will be performed with the commercially available&#xD;
      DynaCAD-equipment designed for in-bore MR-guided prostate biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Design: a prospective study of 60* patients enrolled in an AS program. From late&#xD;
      2014 and approximately one year forward, all patients put in active surveillance after the&#xD;
      diagnosis of low risk PC, will after that decision be offered an additional mMRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the mMRI gives rise to suspicion of significant cancer, MRGB will be taken. Results of&#xD;
      these biopsies will be assessed, and in some cases gleason score will be up-grated, risk&#xD;
      classification will be up-grated and the decision to keep the patient in AS will have to be&#xD;
      changed, and active treatment will be recommended. If the scan finds no reason to change&#xD;
      strategy, the patient will have the usual follow-ups in the clinic, which in an AS program&#xD;
      usually consists of control PSA value every 3 months, and new TRUS guided biopsies after 12&#xD;
      months or if PSA rises. Parallel to the usual control program we will perform a new mMRI once&#xD;
      a year to assess if there is any progression in the disease, and again do MRGB if this is the&#xD;
      case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will require access to the patient journals. We will look at patient demographics,&#xD;
      specification on the PC found, histology and blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study we will consult a statistician as the work progresses, to ensure the quality of&#xD;
      our data work and conclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of participants and obtaining informed consent At the department's weekly&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary conference (MDT), the tissue samples, taken by ultrasound, are presented.&#xD;
      On this conference future treatment strategy for each patient is planned. At this conference&#xD;
      it will be possible to identify possible candidates for the project. Afterwards, when the&#xD;
      patient receives the answer in the out patient clinic, by a hospital doctor, he will be&#xD;
      offered an interview with the study responsible Ph.D. student. The patient is offered to&#xD;
      bring a companion to the conversation, that can occur on the same day or later, depending on&#xD;
      the patient's preference and the opportunity to be escorted. At this conversation, oral and&#xD;
      written information is given in a suitable consultation room in the outpatient clinic, and it&#xD;
      will be evaluated if the patient is suitable for inclusion. The patient is offered 24 hours&#xD;
      to think. The written consent is obtained when the patient indicates not having a need for&#xD;
      further information and reflection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion is expected to commence in late year2014, when permission is granted from the&#xD;
      Ethics Committee. Expectedly the inclusion of patients will be completed within 12 months and&#xD;
      thus expected to end late of year 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects, risks and drawbacks The same precautions on MRI safety will be taken as with&#xD;
      other clinical patients using the existing metal table, and therefore there are no known&#xD;
      risks associated with the actual scan. While completing the scan intravenous&#xD;
      gadolinium-containing contrast is used. This is excreted through the kidneys and is safe for&#xD;
      patients with normal renal function (see exclusion criteria). The most common side effects of&#xD;
      the proposed contrast agent Dotarem® include: a feeling of heat, cold and / or pain at the&#xD;
      injection site and transient headache and tingling sensations in the skin (more than 1 out of&#xD;
      10 individuals). The patient may develop an allergic reaction to the contrast, and in the&#xD;
      most serious cases the is a risk of heart failure, slow heartbeat, irregular heartbeat,&#xD;
      respiratory, mucosal swelling in the throat and pleuritis in the lungs, constriction of the&#xD;
      airways, breathlessness and sneezing. This is very rare (less than 1 in 10 000 individuals).&#xD;
      An allergic reaction will be immediately treated according to current guidelines in the&#xD;
      department. The patient will be questioned to known allergy to MRI contrast agent both be&#xD;
      inclusion, and immediately before the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases where we find a basis for further tissue samples from the MRI, there will be a risk&#xD;
      of sepsis and bleeding in the rectum. This risk is assessed to be far lower than by the usual&#xD;
      use TRUS samples, as there usually will only be 2-4 tissue samples as compared to 12 by the&#xD;
      usual method. Patients will receive preventive antibiotics as usually given with TRUS&#xD;
      (ciprofloxacin). In addition, the selection can be associated with discomfort / pain. This is&#xD;
      expected to be less than with the usual procedure, as there usually will be fewer biopsies&#xD;
      taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with prostate cancer are currently not routinely examined with MR imaging before&#xD;
      surgery. Patients who agree to participate in the trial will thus have a scan they would not&#xD;
      otherwise have received. Participation in the study, therefore, means that the patient must&#xD;
      visit the hospital a second time. If MRI guided tissue samples must be taken it will also&#xD;
      mean one or two extra trips to the hospital (depending on the histology).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practical and economical aspects The study is planned to be performed at Department of&#xD;
      Urology K and the department of MRI, Aarhus University Hospital - Skejby, to commence&#xD;
      September 1th 2014 and continue for three years forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is partly financed by the Danish cancer research foundation. Patients will not&#xD;
      receive remuneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * (The no. of patients is estimated by a power analysis based on numbers found from two other&#xD;
      relevant studies on AS and mMRI in PC. Having an α-value = 0.05 and a β-value of 0.8 gives a&#xD;
      minimum of 47 patients in the group. Expecting there will be some variations this is adjusted&#xD;
      by including 60 patients in the group.)&#xD;

    <description>men newly diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer and put in an active surveillance (AS) program. Eight weeks post TRUS-guided biopsies they are scanned with a multi-parametric magnetic resonans imaging (mMRI). If the scans shows a PIRADS 4 or 5 lesion, MRI-guided biopsies are performed. Otherwise the patients will continue in the AS program as usual. The mMRI will in these cases be repeated after 1 year.</description>
