  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elvitegravir is an HIV-1 integrase inhibitor which is marketed in a fixed dose combination&#xD;
      tablet with cobicistat, tenofovir and emtricitabine (StribildÂ®, referred to as STB). For&#xD;
      patients with swallowing difficulties, administration of whole tablets can be problematic and&#xD;
      tablets are cut or crushed to ease administration. In addition if HIV patients develop&#xD;
      opportunistic infections, patients can become severely ill and may end up on the intensive&#xD;
      care. Patients at the intensive care might not be able to swallow medication. Therefore it is&#xD;
      useful to know if it is possible to administer STB through a different route, like a feeding&#xD;
      tube. If STB can be crushed or dissolved and given through a catheter it is also useful to&#xD;
      know if it can be given with drip feed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is no information about crushing STB tablets. &quot;Crushing STB tablets into a&#xD;
      liquid medium has not been studied and is not recommended&quot; according to the SPC text.&#xD;
      Depending on the biopharmaceutical characteristics of a drug formulation, crushing tablets&#xD;
      can lead to altered pharmacokinetics of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to know whether pharmacokinetics are influenced by crushing of tablets as low&#xD;
      concentrations are associated with virologic failure. Therefore higher doses might be needed.&#xD;
      In addition, higher Cmax and/or exposure can lead to toxicity. As a result therapeutic drug&#xD;
      monitoring is advised, or crushing the drug is a contra-indication based on the available&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that simultaneous oral ingestion of antacids and elvitegravir gives a&#xD;
      decrease in Cmax and AUC of elvitegravir. This interaction is not shown for co-ingestion with&#xD;
      omeprazole. Which makes it unlikely that this interaction is caused by a pH-lowering effect&#xD;
      influencing the absorption of elvitegravir. It is probably a local gastrointestinal&#xD;
      complexation phenomenon, similar to what has been observed with other HIV integrase&#xD;
      inhibitors. A possible pharmacokinetic interaction between elvitegravir and complexation&#xD;
      formers may be expected. Especially considering the active binding sites of elvitegravir&#xD;
      which bind magnesium metal ion cofactors. Although there is data that STB can be ingested&#xD;
      with a protein rich drink, it is unclear if foods or liquids containing high amounts of&#xD;
      magnesium or other cations can cause this same interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore this study will be conducted to investigate whether crushed and suspended STB and&#xD;
      crushed and suspended STB with drip feed are bioe-quivalent to taking STB as a whole.&#xD;
