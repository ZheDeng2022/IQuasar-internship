      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ultrasonic Cardiac Output Monitor (USCOM) is a non-invasive, quantitative method for&#xD;
      measuring and monitoring cardiovascular haemodynamic parameters in patients. The aims of this&#xD;
      study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate whether there is any correlation between haemodynamic parameters and COPD&#xD;
           severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate whether USCOM-derived haemodynamic variables may be used as prognostic&#xD;
           indicators of 6-month, 1-year, 3-year and 5-year readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate whether USCOM-derived haemodynamic variables may be used as prognostic&#xD;
           indicators of 6-month, 1-year, 3-year and 5-year all-cause mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design, Setting and Subjects This prospective observational study will be conducted in the&#xD;
      Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions Haemodynamic measurements made using the USCOM, and spirometry, will be&#xD;
      performed as appropriate on subjects in respiratory clinic, the emergency department, medical&#xD;
      wards and on ICU. In order to assess inter-observer variability, a second, blinded operator&#xD;
      will repeated 15% of scans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the&#xD;
      world, a lung disorder which is characterized by a partially reversible airflow limitation,&#xD;
      which is usually progressive, and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response to&#xD;
      noxious particles or gases. In 2005, among elderly Hong Kong Chinese (age ≥60 years) in Hong&#xD;
      Kong with COPD defined as an FEV1/FVC &lt;70%, 19.6% males and 11.9% females suffered from&#xD;
      moderate levels of severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From an initial stable condition, an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) is characterized by&#xD;
      a sudden onset of breathlessness, purulent sputum, and increases in sputum volume. Other&#xD;
      symptoms include increasing cough, wheeze, chest tightness or fatigue. The major cause of&#xD;
      AECOPD is infection, although other stimulating factors include air pollution, withdrawal of&#xD;
      medication, and low temperature. After the first admission of an exacerbation, the&#xD;
      readmission rate for patients with AECOPD is high. The mean number of annual readmissions is&#xD;
      2.2 episodes, with a one-year mortality rate of 14%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry can help to diagnose COPD patients, and a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC&lt;0.7&#xD;
      confirms the presence of airflow limitation. The classification of severity of airflow&#xD;
      limitation in COPD is based on GOLD category. The lower the post-bronchodilator FEV1, the&#xD;
      higher is the severity. This method is useful for assessing patients with stable COPD only.&#xD;
      For those with AECOPD, this method may not be easy to conduct and assess patients immediately&#xD;
      due to patients' difficulty in breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A common dilemma facing clinicians is whether patients presenting with breathlessness, cough&#xD;
      and wheeze have an acute exacerbation of COPD, an acute exacerbation of left ventricular&#xD;
      failure (LVF), or some degree of both. Making an accurate diagnosis is important as the&#xD;
      treatment in each case is different, and a quick recovery depends upon appropriate and timely&#xD;
      intervention and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike acute exacerbations of asthma, there are no objective guidelines on how to assess the&#xD;
      severity and prognosis of patients presenting to hospital with acute exacerbations of COPD.&#xD;
      However, the CURB65, originally intended for assessing patients with pneumonia, has been&#xD;
      evaluated in this context. High CURB65 scores in patients presenting with acute exacerbations&#xD;
      of COPD do predict increasing risk of hospital and one month mortality from 2 to 21% but do&#xD;
      not predict patients with very high risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In healthy subjects, the presence or absence of carbon dioxide retention influences the&#xD;
      body's haemodynamic response. Hypercapnia has been shown to increase mean pulmonary artery&#xD;
      pressure (PAP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV),&#xD;
      cardiac output (CO), and mean arterial BP (MAP). However, hypercapnia does not appear to&#xD;
      affect indices of systolic function, such as peak aortic velocity and aortic mean and peak&#xD;
      acceleration, or plasma renin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In stable patients with compensated COPD, elevations in CO2 trigger central and peripheral&#xD;
      chemoreceptors resulting in an increased depth and rate of respiration, bradycardia (via&#xD;
      vagal stimulation), and systemic vasoconstriction (via sympathetic stimulation). Therefore,&#xD;
      cardiovascular parameters may be either normal or, if there is a degree of carbon dioxide&#xD;
      retention resulting in catecholamine release and autonomic stimulation, then moderately&#xD;
      hyperdynamic. Patients with COPD should have a cardiac Index (CI), which is elevated either&#xD;
      towards the upper half or above the normal range, and may be as high as 5L/min/m2, an&#xD;
      elevated SI, an elevated SVR and elevated DO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Smith-Madigan Index II (SMII) is a novel measure of inotropy, which in stable COPD&#xD;
      patients should either be normal or, if there are adrenergic effects, then may be elevated to&#xD;
      as much as 1.6. The effects of hypercapnia in patients with COPD on potential to kinetic&#xD;
      energy ratio (PE/KE, PKR), flow time (FT), peak velocity (Vpk) and mean pressure gradient&#xD;
      (Pmn) are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These changes contrast with patients with acute LVF, where CI is low and the SMII is usually&#xD;
      less than 1.0, and commonly around 0.7 - 0.8. PE/KE and SVR are generally much higher, and FT&#xD;
      (as a function of SV) is longer. Vpk and Pmn are also lower in LVF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have conducted a preliminary study to evaluate the correlation between severity of COPD&#xD;
      and haemodynamic parameters. 86 stable COPD patients, 43 AECOPD patients and 36 healthy, age&#xD;
      and gender matched subjects were recruited. It was found that the severity of COPD correlated&#xD;
      positively with mean heart rate, cardiac index (CI), ejection time percentage (ET%) oxygen&#xD;
      delivery index (DO2I) and inotropy. When compared with healthy controls, stable GOLD IV&#xD;
      patients had a significantly higher CI (3.98 vs 3.15 l/min/m2, p&lt;0.005), inotropy (2.14 vs&#xD;
      1.72 W/m2, p&lt;0.01) and DO2I (679.8 vs 530.7 ml/min/m2, p&lt;0.01), and a significantly lower&#xD;
      potential to kinetic energy ratio (PKR) (43.0 vs 56.6, p&lt;0.05). Moreover, the 30-day&#xD;
      readmission rate was the highest in GOPD IV patients. Based on the existing findings, it&#xD;
      would be interesting to study the long-term prognostic effect of haemodynamic parameters in&#xD;
      COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the present study for patients visited respiratory clinic or admitted to the&#xD;
      Emergency Department (ED), including those admitted to resuscitation room or emergency high&#xD;
      dependency unit, are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate whether there is any correlation between haemodynamic parameters and COPD&#xD;
           severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate whether USCOM-derived haemodynamic variables may be used as prognostic&#xD;
           indicators of 6-month, 1-year, 3-year and 5-year readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate whether USCOM-derived haemodynamic variables may be used as prognostic&#xD;
           indicators of 6-month, 1-year, 3-year and 5-year all-cause mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Haemodynamic measurements using an Ultrasonic Cardiac Output Monitor (USCOM®; USCOM Pty&#xD;
           Ltd, NSW, Australia)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung function assessment using Spirometry (MICROLAB 3300 spirometer; Micro Medical,&#xD;
           Kent, UK)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6-minute walk test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Borg dyspnoea scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End-tidal CO2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of haemodynamic parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Velocity time integral (vti) is the integral of the flow profile, i.e. the distance the&#xD;
           blood travels in one beat. The unit of vti is m/s.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac output (CO) is the volume of blood pumped by the heart in one minute: CO = SV x&#xD;
           HR. The unit is l/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac index (CI) is equal to CO divided by BSA. The unit is l/min/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stroke volume (SV) is the volume of blood ejected from the heart during one systolic&#xD;
           stroke. SV = vti x πr2,where πr2 = flow cross sectional area. The unit of SV is ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stroke volume index (SVI) is SV divided by BSA and the unit is ml/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stroke volume variation (SVV) is the percentage change in SV between a group of beats.&#xD;
           SVV = (SVmax - SVmin x 100) / [(SVmax + SVmin)/2].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) is the pressure against which the heart pumps. SVR =&#xD;
           MAP/CO. The unit is d.s.cm-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) SVRI = SVR x BSA d.s.cm-5m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxygen delivery (DO2) is calculated by the equation: DO2 = 1.34 x Hb x SpO2/100 x CO,&#xD;
           where Hb = hemoglobin in grams of hemoglobin per litre of blood (g/l); SpO2 = the&#xD;
           peripheral oxygen saturation as a percentage (%). The unit of DO2 is ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxygen delivery index (DO2I) is equal to DO2 divided by BSA. The unit of DO2I is&#xD;
           ml/min/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inotropy index refers to (Potential energy + Kinetic energy) divided by body surface&#xD;
           area. The unit of inotropy is W/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potential to kinetic energy ratio (PKR) is the energy used to produce blood pressure&#xD;
           divided by the energy used to produce blood flow.&#xD;

    <description>An Ultrasonic Cardiac Output Monitor (USCOM; USCOM Pty Ltd, NSW, Australia) is a non-invasive Doppler ultrasonography. It is capable of measuring haemodynamic parameters non-invasively and appears to be simple and rapid to use, portable, relatively inexpensive and has less potential complications compared with the standard technique, pulmonary artery thermodilution (PATD).&#xD;
USCOM scans will be performed on patients to measure direct and derived haemodynamic variables, which will be performed in the supine position wherever possible. A transducer will be placed on the chest in either the suprasternal position to measure trans-aortic blood flow, or the left parasternal position to measure transpulmonary blood flow.</description>
