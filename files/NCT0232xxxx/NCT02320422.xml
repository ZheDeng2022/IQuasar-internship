  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to pilot-test a tailored telemetric intervention to improve&#xD;
      adherence to medications in adults who had a liver transplant and are presently non-adherent&#xD;
      (as measured by tacrolimus levels).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients who received a liver transplant and for whom there are at least 3 tacrolimus&#xD;
      blood levels within the last year are eligible for the study. Patients will be recruited from&#xD;
      amongst the roster of liver transplant recipients treated at the Recanati-Miller Transplant&#xD;
      Institute at Mount Sinai. The intervention will be pilot-tested on up to 15 non-adherent&#xD;
      patients. Patients will be identified using an innovative biomarker for non-adherence-by&#xD;
      calculating the degree of fluctuation between individual medication blood levels. The&#xD;
      telemetric intervention (administered via telephone, or interactive video chat applications&#xD;
      such as FaceTime ® or Skype ®) will enable the intervention team (IT) to address&#xD;
      non-adherence from a remote location, using a structured, tailored approach that accommodates&#xD;
      specific patient needs. The approach includes a focus on psychological avoidance.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient received a liver transplant at least 2 years prior to initiation of the&#xD;
             research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is able to provide consent (i.e. is not encephalopathic or does not have&#xD;
             significant cognitive impairment). Consent may be obtained either by phone or in&#xD;
             person (following a script) and is documented by the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is prescribed tacrolimus (either brand or generic formulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is not receiving Hepatitis C treatment during the intervention (given this&#xD;
             can affect levels of tacrolimus and adherence behaviors)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Thee patient has been seen in the liver transplant clinic at least once in the last&#xD;
             two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient's MLVI value was ≥ 2, with at least 3 levels present to make this&#xD;
             determination. Only tacrolimus levels drawn in the outpatient setting will be included&#xD;
             in SD calculations. Tacrolimus levels in the inpatient setting (i.e. during a&#xD;
             hospitalization) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient speaks English or Spanish at a level that allows him/her to understand the&#xD;
             study procedures and consent to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient received a liver transplant less than 2 years prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient received a dual transplant (i.e. liver and kidney).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The treating physician has instructed the patient not to obtain tacrolimus levels for&#xD;
             at least one year in the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient does not understand the study procedures. This will be verified by asking&#xD;
             the patient to repeat the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is actively psychotic or severely disoriented due to any cause, including&#xD;
             hepatic encephalopathy (temporary exclusion) or severe cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is not medically stable or is hospitalized (temporary exclusion until&#xD;
             stabilized).&#xD;
