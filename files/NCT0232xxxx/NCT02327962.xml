    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) accelerates vascular stiffening related to age. Arterial&#xD;
      stiffness may be evaluated measuring the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) or more&#xD;
      simply, as recommend by KDOQI, monitoring pulse pressure (PP). Both correlate to survival and&#xD;
      incidence of cardiovascular disease. PWV can also be estimated on the brachial artery using a&#xD;
      Mobil-O-Graph; a non-operator dependent automatic device. The aim was to analyse whether, in&#xD;
      a dialysis population, PWV obtained by Mobil-O-Graph (MogPWV) is more sensitive for vascular&#xD;
      aging than PP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cohort of 143 patients from 4 dialysis units has been followed measuring MogPWV and PP&#xD;
      every 3 to 6 months and compared to a control group of non-CKD patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic hemodialysis patients should have arterial stiffness evaluated monthly using Pulse&#xD;
      Pressure as suggested by KDOQI guidelines [1]. This recommendation pursues a dual goal since&#xD;
      it outlines the importance of monitoring vascular stiffness in hemodialysis patients [2-4]&#xD;
      and, at the same time, emphasizes the fact that Pulse Pressure provides valuable information&#xD;
      on tissue perfusion characteristics [5]. Arterial stiffening in dialysis patients is the&#xD;
      result of aging, non-specific and End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) related risk factors, such&#xD;
      as medial calcification, volume overload, uraemia-related endothelial dysfunction, increased&#xD;
      extracellular matrix and intimal fibroelastic thickening [6]. Arterial stiffness of the aorta&#xD;
      and its major branches can be evaluated by measuring Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) - e.g.&#xD;
      carotid-femoral Pulse Wave Velocity (&quot;gold standard&quot;) [7] - or, alternatively, it can be&#xD;
      estimated by Pulse Wave Analysis (PWA) at a peripheral site, usually the brachial artery&#xD;
      [8-11]. In the first case, a doppler ultrasound detector is used together with a software&#xD;
      tool for data analysis. The second approach requires the use of a sphygmomanometer, such as&#xD;
      the Mobil-O-Graph, capable of analysing the pulse wave morphology and of calculating PWV&#xD;
      [9-14]. The first methodology is complex, operator-dependent and not routinely applicable,&#xD;
      whereas the second one is potentially usable in clinical practice [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increase in PWV related to the above-mentioned risk factors also accelerates with age&#xD;
      [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both PWV and PP correlate to mortality in the dialysis population [15-17]: for each PWV&#xD;
      increase of 1 m/s Blacher et al. found an all-cause mortality-adjusted OR of 1.39 (95% CI,&#xD;
      1.19 to 1.62) [16] while for each 10 mmHg increase in PP, Tozawa et al. found an increase in&#xD;
      all-cause mortality relative risk of 8% [17].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors such as age, hypertension, previous history of heart diseases and diabetes&#xD;
      influence the evolution of Pulse Wave Velocity before dialysis initiation whereas their&#xD;
      impact during the course of dialysis has not yet been demonstrated [18]. In this regard, a&#xD;
      study published in 2013 by Utescu et al. indicated that the only risk factor significantly&#xD;
      associated with PWV progression was the level of an advanced glycation end-product known as&#xD;
      pentosidine [18]. The results of this study confirmed that specific uraemia-related risk&#xD;
      factors can be identified and possibly quantified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the above-mentioned study, the rate of PWV progression (+0.84 m/s per year) was&#xD;
      surprisingly high, especially when projected over time as a function of the average life span&#xD;
      of ESRD patients on dialysis. Another critical data point outlined in the study was the&#xD;
      discrepancy in the annual rate of change in carotid-femoral compared to carotid-radial Pulse&#xD;
      Wave Velocity, which was +0.84 m/s per year and -0.66 m/s per year, respectively. The authors&#xD;
      of the study postulate that this discrepancy may be due to anatomical differences between&#xD;
      central (elastic) and peripheral (muscular) arteries and that the latter could deploy an&#xD;
      adaptive response to central aortic stiffening. Although interesting, these data raise some&#xD;
      concerns about the promising possibility of using the brachial artery as a site for PWV&#xD;
      estimation, even if based on a non-operator dependent method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, another limitation identified in the literature currently available on&#xD;
      prospective longitudinal studies analysing the PWV behaviour on dialysis patients, is the&#xD;
      lack of a control group made up of patients with similar characteristics and co-morbidities&#xD;
      but without kidney failure [2,16,18].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the light of this, we decided to test a Mobil-O-Graph, a simple device estimating PWV&#xD;
      (MogPWV) through a modified sphygmomanometer on the brachial artery and to analyse the&#xD;
      baseline and follow-up MogPWV values in a cohort of dialysis patients and in a control group&#xD;
      with the same risk factors but without kidney failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was answering the following 4 questions, which also reflect both the&#xD;
      primary and the secondary endpoints of the trial: 1. Does PWV estimated by Mobil-O-Graph on&#xD;
      the brachial artery, be more sensitive for vascular aging and better discriminate the&#xD;
      dialysis population from the control group than pulse pressure? (primary endpoint); 2. Is&#xD;
      MogPWV progression faster during dialysis than in the pre-dialysis setting? (secondary&#xD;
      endpoint); 3. Are there specific risk factors that correlate to MogPWV progression?&#xD;
      (secondary endpoint); 4. Does mortality correlate to MogPWV? (secondary endpoint).&#xD;
