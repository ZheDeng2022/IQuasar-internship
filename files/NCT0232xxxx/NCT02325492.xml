      This is a one center, Phase IIa, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study designed&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two Aramchol doses in subjects 18 to 75 years of age,&#xD;
      with newly formed cholesterol gallstones in their gallbladder following bariatric surgery&#xD;
      confirmed by gallbladder ultrasound performed in a period of 3 &amp; 6 months following surgery&#xD;
      before entering the study. All patients have ultrasonography evidence of clear gallbladder&#xD;
      before the bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be enrolled into three treatments arms: Aramchol 400 mg and 600 mg&#xD;
      tablets and placebo tablets in ratio 1:1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be evaluated at study sites for 6 scheduled visits: at weeks -4 - 0&#xD;
      screening visit, Day 0 - baseline, weeks 2, 4, 8&amp; 12 (Termination/early termination visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening period the presence and number of cholesterol gallstones will be&#xD;
      evaluated by gallbladder Ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study the following assessments will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs will be measured at each study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A physical examination will be performed at the screening visit, and termination/early&#xD;
           termination visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following safety blood tests will be performed: complete blood count (CBC), serum&#xD;
           chemistry (including electrolytes, liver enzymes, direct and total bilirubin, glucose,&#xD;
           HbA1C, lipid profile which include cholesterol, HDL, LDL and VLDL, CPK, creatinine,&#xD;
           urea, albumin, alkaline phosphatase), coagulation (fibrinogen, PT/INR, aPTT), ESR and&#xD;
           urinalysis during the screening visit, baseline, week 2, 4, 8 and 12 (termination/early&#xD;
           termination) visits. Serology (HBV, HCV and HIV) will be performed during the screening&#xD;
           visit. β-hCG in women of child bearing potential will be performed during the screening&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body weight will be measured in screening, baseline and end of treatment visits. Height&#xD;
           will be measured during the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG will be performed during the screening and end of treatment visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood for Metabolomics will be collected at baseline and end of treatment visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound will be performed at screening visit, baseline, week 4, 8 and&#xD;
           termination/early termination visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concomitant Medications will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
