    <textblock>
      Echocardiographic assessment of right ventricular function is an important diagnostic tool,&#xD;
      and is a challenge due to the unique structure and anatomy of the right ventricle. Lately a&#xD;
      new technique has been developed and used for evaluating both the left and the right&#xD;
      ventricle function. This technique, called two dimensional (2D) speckle tracking, is based on&#xD;
      detecting speckles in the myocardial tissue and using them as acoustic markers. The movement&#xD;
      of these speckles represents the movement of the tissue, and allows us to evaluate its&#xD;
      function, contraction and relaxation, this by calculating the strain rate, which is the speed&#xD;
      of the speckles, and the strain, which is the distance between them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last few years this technique has been used to evaluate the systolic function of the&#xD;
      right ventricle in several pathological conditions, such as pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism and amyloidosis. Nonetheless, so far there has been little data on the normal RV&#xD;
      strain and strain rate values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators aim to validate two dimensional (2D) speckle tracking&#xD;
      measurements of the RV function by comparing them to strain measurements by cardiac MRI. Each&#xD;
      patient performing cardiac MRI for any indication will perform an echocardiography&#xD;
      examination in addition, and strain analysis performed on the cardiac MRI will be compared&#xD;
      with two dimensional speckle tracking analysis performed on the echocardiography.&#xD;
