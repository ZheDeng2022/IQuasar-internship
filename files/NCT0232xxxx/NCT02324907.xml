      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical efficacy of a novel dynamic&#xD;
      compression intramedullary nail for tibiotalocalcaneal (TTC) arthrodesis.&#xD;

      This proposal is a collaborative effort of MedShape. This is a prospective investigation to&#xD;
      assess the clinical outcomes of patients with a tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis with the&#xD;
      Dynamic Compression Intramedullary Nail (DynaNail). We are planning on enrolling 30 patients.&#xD;
      The assignment of the device is at the discretion of the standard of care provider, not the&#xD;
      study investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with end-stage tibiotalar (ankle) and talocalcaneal (subtalar) joint arthritis from&#xD;
      any etiology will be asked to enroll in the study. After informed consent, the patients will&#xD;
      be asked to complete the following patient reported outcomes questionnaires (standard of care&#xD;
      for all patients in the Foot and Ankle section): 100mm VAS for pain, Short form-36 (SF-36),&#xD;
      and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM). After informed consent, they will then be&#xD;
      scheduled for surgery in a routine fashion. REDCap database will be used to allow on-line&#xD;
      data entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following surgical procedure steps and follow-ups are standard of care at Duke&#xD;
      University. The surgical procedure will involve both tibiotalar and talocalcaneal joint&#xD;
      preparation through any approach (lateral, posterior, anterior with sinus tarsi). The use of&#xD;
      supplemental bone graft is at the discretion of the treating surgeon but must be documented.&#xD;
      The MedShape DynaNail will then be inserted according to the manufacturer's technique. The&#xD;
      patient will be placed in a short leg splint and kept non-weight bearing. The patient will be&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital when medically ready and follow-up in two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At two weeks, the patient will return to clinic for a standard of care visit and their splint&#xD;
      will be removed. A non-weight bearing lateral radiograph of the hind foot will be taken to&#xD;
      assess the amount of travel of the compressive element. This radiograph is not standard of&#xD;
      care. The patient will be placed in a non-weight bearing cast. The patient will then be asked&#xD;
      to return in two weeks (4 weeks post-operatively). This visit is not standard of care. At&#xD;
      this time another non-weight bearing lateral radiograph will be taken to assess the amount of&#xD;
      travel of the compressive element. The patient will be asked to return at 6 weeks, 3 months,&#xD;
      6 months, 12 months, and 24 months after surgery as is standard of care for this surgery. At&#xD;
      3 months, a CT scan will be obtained to assess healing. This is standard of care at Duke&#xD;
      University. At each of these time-points, the same patient specific outcome questionnaires&#xD;
      will be administered. For any non- standard of care radiographs patients will be asked to&#xD;
      take a urine pregnancy test prior to any radiographs being taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified in the clinic by an attending orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeon&#xD;
      or his physician assistant based on clinical exam and radiographic findings. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria include anyone over age 18 who has ankle and subtalar arthritis and has failed&#xD;
      nonoperative management. Typically, these patients have multiple medical comorbidities and&#xD;
      therefore the only exclusion criteria will be patients who are not healthy enough to undergo&#xD;
      surgery. Patients of all racial, religious, and cultural backgrounds will be included in this&#xD;
      study. Approximately 30 patients will be recruited for the study.&#xD;
