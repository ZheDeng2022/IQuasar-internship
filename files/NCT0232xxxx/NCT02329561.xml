  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the enantiomers of tramadol&#xD;
      and O-desmethyltramadol (ODM) in generally healthy young and elderly adults. Using a&#xD;
      randomised, double-blind, crossover design, participants were administered a single 200mg&#xD;
      tramadol extended-release tablet and placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacokinetics of the enantiomers of tramadol and O-desmethyltramadol (ODM) have not&#xD;
      been extensively studied in elderly patients. Given the importance of hepatic function in the&#xD;
      metabolism of tramadol into the more potent ODM metabolite and the fact that tramadol is&#xD;
      primarily renally excreted, age-related changes in hepatic and renal function may affect the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of tramadol. Data on the pharmacokinetics of tramadol,&#xD;
      the ODM metabolite and their enantiomers will provide important information as to the source&#xD;
      of any differences in the metabolism or elimination of Tramadol Contramid® OAD in the elderly&#xD;
      as compared to younger subjects. Differences in the PK of tramadol and O-desmethyltramadol&#xD;
      could result in differences in Pharmacodynamics of tramadol, specifically in analgesic&#xD;
      effect. An Electrically Stimulated Pain Model was used to evaluate any differences in current&#xD;
      perception and pain tolerance between the age groups.&#xD;
