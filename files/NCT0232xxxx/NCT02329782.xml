      Multi-site, randomized controlled trial of the Adherence Readiness Program (ARP) adherence&#xD;
      intervention for HIV clients starting or restarting antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the&#xD;
      purpose of achieving and sustaining optimal levels of ART adherence and virologic&#xD;
      suppression. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive either the ARP intervention&#xD;
      or usual care (no intervention) and followed for 24 months.&#xD;

      This study will evaluate the effects of the Adherence Readiness Program (ARP) intervention on&#xD;
      the primary outcomes of dose-taking HIV antiretroviral (ART) adherence and undetectable HIV&#xD;
      viral load in a multi-site randomized controlled trial. The ARP is based on the Information&#xD;
      Motivation Behavioral skills (IMB) model of behavior change and includes (1) brief pill&#xD;
      taking practice trials for enhancing pre-treatment adherence counseling and providing a&#xD;
      behavioral criterion for determining adherence readiness and the start of treatment, and (2)&#xD;
      a performance driven dose regulation mechanism to tailor the amount of counseling (from&#xD;
      pre-treatment through the full course of treatment) to the individual needs of the patient&#xD;
      and conserve limited resources. Participants will be randomized to receive either the ARP&#xD;
      (adherence counseling sessions) or usual care. Primary assessments will be administered at&#xD;
      screening and every 6 months after ART initiation over a 24-month follow-up, making it one of&#xD;
      the few studies to examine intervention effects longer than one year. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      include dose-timing adherence and CD4 count. If effective, the ARP will provide clinicians&#xD;
      with an intervention that (1) informs providers and patients when the patient is ready to&#xD;
      adhere well and start treatment, (2) enhances adherence readiness from the outset of&#xD;
      treatment through the full course of therapy, and (3) tailors the amount of adherence support&#xD;
      based on individual patient need and performance, thus more efficiently using clinic&#xD;
      resources, fostering better acceptance from providers and patients, and increasing the&#xD;
      likelihood of successful program adoption and dissemination. This emphasis on efficient use&#xD;
      of resources will be complemented by a cost-effectiveness analysis to further inform policy&#xD;
      decisions regarding the transportability of the intervention and its potential for more wide&#xD;
      scale use and sustainability if effective.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient's provider views the patient as medically appropriate to begin (ART naïve)&#xD;
             or restart ART (has been off ART for at least 2 months), and either&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  plans to start the patient on ART&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  would like to start the patient on ART but the provider or patient is uncertain&#xD;
                  about the patient's readiness to adhere well.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients who are currently on ART are also eligible if they meet the following&#xD;
             criteria, which are specific only to this type of patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i) the patient has 2 or more HIV viral load tests in the past year &gt; 1000 copies/ml&#xD;
             ii) the patient has had no HIV viral load tests that were undetectable in the past&#xD;
             year iii) the patient has a genotype in the past year that does not show resistance as&#xD;
             a reason for virologic failure (detectable viral load) iv) primary care provider views&#xD;
             the patient as a good candidate for the study, with the understanding that the patient&#xD;
             will interrupt ART if assigned to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Criteria i to iii are intended to define a subgroup of nonadherent patients who are&#xD;
             taking very little of their ART medications, as evidenced by the combination of&#xD;
             consistently high viral load and no drug resistance. If the patient was taking at&#xD;
             least a moderate level of drug and still had consistently high viral load, than they&#xD;
             would have evidence of drug resistance. Providers are generally comfortable with this&#xD;
             type of patient stopping their medication in order to facilitate the pre-treatment,&#xD;
             adherence readiness assessment and training phase of the intervention prior to&#xD;
             restarting the patient on treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient's health status is stable. There is no current acute OI or medical&#xD;
             condition that calls for immediate ART, as determined by the patient's provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Most recent HIV viral load is detectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. If CD4 &lt; 200, the patient is on or will be prescribed prophylactic medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient is 18 or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient is able and willing to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. English speaking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient just tested HIV+ and their provider suspects the patient may be acutely or&#xD;
        recently infected (within past 6 months).&#xD;
