  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare Tc99m sestamibi molecular breast&#xD;
      imaging (MBI) scans to mammograms and ultrasounds (the current standard of care) to learn if&#xD;
      MBI scans can measure if the disease is responding to chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study and you agree, you will have a&#xD;
      total of 3 MBI scans: before you start your already scheduled chemotherapy treatment, after 2&#xD;
      cycles of chemotherapy, and after you complete your chemotherapy treatment but before&#xD;
      surgery. You will also receive your standard of care scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each MBI scan, you will receive an injection of Tc99m sestamibi (a type of drug that&#xD;
      gives off energy that is seen with special cameras, like the MBI scan, which creates images&#xD;
      of the breast). You will have an MBI scan about 5 minutes after you receive Tc99m sestamibi.&#xD;
      During the scan, your breast will be positioned between 2 detectors and lightly compressed.&#xD;
      The detectors are 2 square cameras, which look very similar to mammography cameras. The scan&#xD;
      should take about 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information, such as images from previous scans and your medical history, will also be&#xD;
      collected from your medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from the MBI scans will not affect or change your treatment, including the type&#xD;
      of surgery you may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your active participation on this study will be over after the last MBI scan is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. MBI scans on this study are performed using FDA-approved&#xD;
      and commercially available methods. Tc99m sestamibi is FDA-approved and commercially&#xD;
      available. The use of MBI scans to measure how much cancer is in the breast during&#xD;
      chemotherapy is considered investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;
