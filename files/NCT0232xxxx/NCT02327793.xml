      The purpose of this study is to provide a description of blood flow changes in the brain&#xD;
      after blood pressure lowering drugs are given. This information will be used by physicians to&#xD;
      guide blood pressure lowering therapy in stroke patients in the future.&#xD;

      Objective: To elucidate the inter-relationships between blood pressure (BP), cerebral blood&#xD;
      flow (CBF) and oxygen metabolism in acute ischemic stroke in order to establish rational&#xD;
      acute hypertension treatment thresholds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Management of acute hypertension in the first 48 hours after stroke is&#xD;
      controversial and lends itself to competing rationales. Early reduction of BP may improve&#xD;
      outcome by reducing the rate of hemorrhagic transformation and edema formation in early&#xD;
      infarcts. Conversely, early BP reduction might reduce CBF and extend the infarct. Natural&#xD;
      history studies have demonstrated that patients with higher BP at presentation have elevated&#xD;
      early mortality rates, but causality has not been established. Consensus-based guidelines for&#xD;
      acute BP management are not based on physiological data or sound evidence. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to start addressing this clinical dilemma with a non-randomized controlled study of&#xD;
      serial measurements of CBF and oxygen metabolism in acute stroke patients with 3 different&#xD;
      levels of acute blood pressure representing 3 different potential treatment thresholds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that the volume and severity of oligemia in at risk&#xD;
      tissue will not increase with BP reduction in acute stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the effect of mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreases on CBF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the relationship between infarct volume change over time and MAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the frequency of hemorrhagic transformation and its relationship to MAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A 3 group non-randomized controlled study. After informed consent, all patients&#xD;
      will undergo MRI scanning including diffusion and perfusion-weighted imaging (DWI and PWI).&#xD;
      Patients with MAP &lt;100 mmHg will not receive hypertension treatment. Patients with moderate&#xD;
      hypertension (MAP 100-120 mmHg) will be treated with transdermal nitroglycerin (0.2 mg/h) for&#xD;
      48 hours. Patients with severe hypertension (MAP &gt;120 mmHg) will also be treated with&#xD;
      intravenous labetalol, to a target of &lt;120 mmHg. Two hours after the baseline scan, MRI will&#xD;
      be repeated. Any clinical or radiographic evidence of exacerbated oligemia associated with BP&#xD;
      reduction will result in immediate discontinuation of all anti-hypertensive therapy. The&#xD;
      effectiveness of BP control will be evaluated using a weighted mean average of MAP over 72&#xD;
      hours. All patients will be re-imaged with MRI on day 3 to assess for hemorrhagic&#xD;
      transformation. The primary endpoint is the change in objectively measured hypoperfused&#xD;
      tissue volume between the baseline and 2 hour scans. Hypoperfused tissue will be determined&#xD;
      as the volume of voxels with CBF ≤18 ml/100g/min, a previously validated measurement&#xD;
      independent of observer variability. Sample size is based on power calculations required to&#xD;
      detect a 10% change in oligemic tissue volume (which would be sufficient to result in&#xD;
      exacerbation of ischemic injury) following MAP reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Work: First, the investigators surveyed Canadian stroke neurologists about their&#xD;
      current BP management practices. Indications for acute BP therapy in acute stroke varied from&#xD;
      180 to 240 mmHg systolic, and few clinicians even considered diastolic or MAP treatment&#xD;
      thresholds. Physicians based a generally conservative approach on the absence of evidence.&#xD;
      Second, the investigators assessed the feasibility of serial MRI and MAP treatment protocols.&#xD;
      To date, 9 patients have been imaged with repeat MRI, within 2 hours of the initial exam,&#xD;
      confirming that the CBF≤18 ml/100g/min measures of at risk tissue volume can be used to&#xD;
      monitor cerebral perfusion. Four patients were treated with our BP management protocol and&#xD;
      imaged serially. MAP decreased in all 4 patients 2 hours after treatment. Increases in&#xD;
      hypoperfused tissue volume (CBF≤18 ml/100g/min) following MAP reduction were generally mild&#xD;
      (&lt;10%). Of note, after BP reduction, the patient with the lowest initial MAP (96 mmHg) had a&#xD;
      marked decline in CBF and large increase in volume of at risk tissue. Third, the&#xD;
      investigators determined that decreases in CBF were always associated with increases in&#xD;
      oxygen extraction, which appeared to protect tissue from infarct expansion because DWI lesion&#xD;
      volumes remained stable. The variations in current practice and demonstration that reductions&#xD;
      in MAP can lead to decreases CBF, potentially increasing the risk of adverse stroke-related&#xD;
      outcomes justifies studies to determine appropriate treatment thresholds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The precise relationship between CBF and MAP in acute stroke must be elucidated&#xD;
      prior to developing treatment thresholds for testing in a large randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
      A serial perfusion study, with careful monitoring of MAP is a critical step in developing a&#xD;
      rational BP management protocol. These findings will also help elucidate the mechanisms for&#xD;
      poor outcome in patients with both high and low MAP at onset.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute ischemic stroke within 72 hours of symptom onset. In cases where onset time can&#xD;
             not be established, it will be considered to be the time when the patient was last&#xD;
             known to be well.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with Partial Anterior Circulation Infarcts (PACI; Oxfordshire Stroke&#xD;
             Classification Project; OSCP) will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with Posterior Circulation Infarcts (POCI) will be included only if there is&#xD;
             evidence of cortical infarction in the territory of the posterior cerebral artery or&#xD;
             its branches, including the occipital and mesial temporal lobes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a contraindication to the BP lowering protocol (i.e. known&#xD;
             extracranial/intracranial arterial stenosis, high-grade stenotic valvular heart&#xD;
             disease, or severe renal failure) will be ineligible, as will those with a definite&#xD;
             indication for BP reduction (i.e. hypertensive encephalopathy, or aortic dissection).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with contraindications to MRI will be excluded, including metallic implants&#xD;
             and any past sensitivity to gadolinium contrast media.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Due to recent reports of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis associated with gadolinium&#xD;
             exposure in individuals with pre-existing renal failure, patients with Creatinine &gt;&#xD;
             160 μmol/l or Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) &lt;60 ml/min will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with renal artery stenosis will be excluded from this study, irrespective of&#xD;
             renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Due to the possibility that oxygen therapy may confound CBF measurements, patients&#xD;
             requiring &gt;4 lpm to keep Sp02 ≥92% by nasal cannulae will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a suspected hemodynamic stroke mechanism will be ineligible. This will&#xD;
             include patients with known or suspected hypotensive periods and/or a watershed&#xD;
             territory of cerebral infarction seen on CT or MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Due to the possibility of increased susceptibility to BP reduction in patients with&#xD;
             raised intracerebral pressure (ICP), those with evidence of significant mass effect&#xD;
             secondary to acute infarction, including any degree of midline shift and/or&#xD;
             ventricular compression will be ineligible. For the same reason, patients with head&#xD;
             and eye deviation or other clinical evidence of a Total Anterior Circulation Infarct&#xD;
             (TACI; OSCP) will also be ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Due to technical difficulties associated with PWI in the posterior fossa, patients&#xD;
             with brainstem and cerebellar strokes will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known sensitivity to nitroglycerin/labetalol/adhesives in nitroglycerin&#xD;
             patches/ACE inhibitors/Angiotensin Receptor Blockers will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Amplification of the vasodilatory effects of topical nitroglycerin by&#xD;
             phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as sildenafil or tadalafil can result in severe&#xD;
             hypotension. Patients who have used either of these drugs within 12 h of initial&#xD;
             assessment will therefore be excluded.&#xD;
