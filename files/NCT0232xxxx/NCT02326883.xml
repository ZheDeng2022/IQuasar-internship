  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pragmatic clinical trial will evaluate the effectiveness of two population-based&#xD;
      outreach programs for preventing suicide attempts among patients identified as at-risk. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted at Kaiser Permanente (KP) Washington (the lead site) and at&#xD;
      HealthPartners, KP Colorado and KP Northwest. Electronic health records will be used to&#xD;
      identify outpatients aged 18 or older who respond to a routinely administered PHQ depression&#xD;
      questionnaire by reporting thoughts of death or self-harm &quot;most of the days&quot; or &quot;nearly every&#xD;
      day&quot;. This trial will be limited to patients receiving care from one of the four&#xD;
      participating health systems. Eligible patients will be automatically assigned to continue in&#xD;
      usual care (1/3) or to either of the two intervention programs (1/3 each). Those assigned to&#xD;
      usual care will not be contacted at all by study staff and will continue to receive usual&#xD;
      care from treating primary care and mental health providers. Both intervention programs&#xD;
      involve outreach by Epic secure messaging (with optional telephone outreach for those not&#xD;
      reading messages). The Care Management intervention includes routine outreach to assess&#xD;
      ongoing risk of suicide attempt and care management to monitor and facilitate ongoing&#xD;
      engagement in outpatient follow-up. The Care Manager will coordinate care with treatment by&#xD;
      primary and behavioral health care providers using Epic Staff Messaging (or telephone&#xD;
      contacts if necessary). The Skills Training intervention uses an online skills training&#xD;
      program to support patients in developing and using self-management skills for emotion&#xD;
      regulation and crisis management. A Coach will monitor each participant's use of the program&#xD;
      and send periodic messages (using Epic secure messaging) to encourage and support use of the&#xD;
      program and practice of program skills. Each intervention continues for up to one year. In&#xD;
      all three groups (Usual Care, Care Management, and Skills Training) virtual data warehouse&#xD;
      data will be used to identify likely suicide attempts over 18 months following randomization.&#xD;
      Analyses will compare risk of suicide attempt among all those randomized, regardless of&#xD;
      response to the initial invitation or level of participation in the intervention programs.&#xD;
      Comparison of all those randomized is the only scientifically valid method for assessing the&#xD;
      overall impact of either program on population-level risk of suicide attempt.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each week, a programmer will use Epic/Clarity data to identify adult outpatients who&#xD;
      completed a PHQ depression questionnaire in the previous week and reported thoughts of death&#xD;
      or self-harm &quot;most of the days&quot; or &quot;nearly every day&quot;. This trial will be limited to patients&#xD;
      receiving care from one of the three participating health systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those identified will be automatically assigned to continued Usual Care or to one of two&#xD;
      intervention programs (Care Management or Skills Training).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Care Management intervention includes periodic outreach to assess ongoing risk of suicide&#xD;
      attempt and as-needed care management to facilitate engagement in ongoing outpatient&#xD;
      follow-up. Contacts will occur by secure messaging (with the option of telephone outreach for&#xD;
      those who do not read messages). Each contact will include a request to complete a new risk&#xD;
      assessment questionnaire (the abbreviated Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale used at each&#xD;
      site) unless a risk assessment was recently documented in the medical record. Using an&#xD;
      algorithm tested in pilot studies, the Care Manager will determine appropriate timing of&#xD;
      follow-up and (if not already scheduled) communicate with the participant to facilitate&#xD;
      appropriate follow-up care. Time between outreach contacts will vary from 2 weeks to 2&#xD;
      months, depending on the most recent risk assessment. Outreach contacts will continue up to&#xD;
      12 months. All outreach contacts will be documented in the Epic electronic health record in&#xD;
      the same manner as any other mental health clinical contacts. The Care Manager(s) will be&#xD;
      licensed mental health clinician(s) with experience in suicide risk assessment, supervised by&#xD;
      site specific clinician investigators. A detailed protocol for the Care Management program&#xD;
      (including sample messages) is included with this application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Skills Training intervention is an online program intended to teach specific skills for&#xD;
      emotion regulation and crisis management. The content of the program is derived from&#xD;
      Dialectical Behavior Therapy, an evidence-based psychotherapy designed for people at risk for&#xD;
      suicide attempts. The program includes four modules or chapters, each focused on a specific&#xD;
      skill. Each chapter includes written and video didactic instruction, video examples, in-vivo&#xD;
      practice, and written homework exercises. The program will be supported by a Coach who will&#xD;
      send periodic messages (via Epic secure messaging) encouraging use of the program and&#xD;
      practice of specific skills. Coaching messages will be scheduled every 1-3 weeks during the&#xD;
      first 3 months of the program and every 1-3 months over the following 9 months (varying&#xD;
      according to each participant's level of participation and progress in the program). All&#xD;
      coaching messages will be documented in the Epic electronic health record in the same manner&#xD;
      as any other mental health clinical contacts. The Coach(es) will be licensed mental health&#xD;
      clinician(s) supervised by site specific clinician investigators. The online program will be&#xD;
      delivered by a secure website (KP Washington Health Research Institute's DatStat server), and&#xD;
      participants will reach the program using encrypted personalized links sent to them via Epic&#xD;
      secure messaging. This trial does not have open enrollment, please see the public facing&#xD;
      website at www.NowMattersNow.org&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those assigned to Usual Care will not be contacted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients in all three intervention groups, a site programmer will extract data from&#xD;
      the Virtual Data Warehouse to identify probable suicide attempts over 18 months following&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
