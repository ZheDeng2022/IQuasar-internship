      This is an open-label sequential pharmacokinetic study in 16 healthy glucose-6-phosphate&#xD;
      dehydrogenase (G6PD) normal Thai subjects at Faculty of Tropical medicine, Mahidol&#xD;
      university.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 16 subjects have already participated in a healthy volunteer studies in the past either&#xD;
      i) Open-Label Study to Evaluate Potential Pharmacokinetic Interaction of Orally Administered&#xD;
      primaquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQP) in Healthy Adult Subjects or ii)&#xD;
      Comparison of the electrocardiographic effects in relation to Pharmacokinetic profile of&#xD;
      chloroquine and piperaquine in healthy Thai subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every subject was administered a single dose of three tablets of DHA-PQP from previous&#xD;
      studies. To avoid unnecessary exposure of DHA-PQP again, we propose to include the results of&#xD;
      DHA-PQP arm from these previous studies and ask the healthy subjects to participate this&#xD;
      study for receiving only single dose of three tablet of DHA-PQP (40mg/320mg) and two tablet&#xD;
      of Mefloquine (250mg) on first admission and single dose of two tablet of Mefloquine on&#xD;
      second admission.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Artemisinin resistance poses the greatest threat to current global initiatives to control and&#xD;
      eliminate malaria. The World Health Organisation recommends the use of the artemisinin&#xD;
      combination therapy (one partner drug combine with artemisinin as the back bone) (ACTs)&#xD;
      instead of the single drug. The reduction in artemisinin sensitivity has left partner drugs&#xD;
      within ACTs exposed too much larger number of parasites and unsurprisingly cure rates with&#xD;
      ACTs have begun to fall substantially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (MORU) has applied for and&#xD;
      received funding for an extension of the TRAC project. The proposed extension project, named&#xD;
      TRACII, will further map artemisinin and partner drug resistance in the South-East Asian&#xD;
      region. Also, TRACII aims to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetic characteristics and&#xD;
      efficacy of a novel combination of an artemisinin-derivative and two long acting partner&#xD;
      drugs, piperaquine and mefloquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is necessary that the potential drug-drug interactions of mefloquine and&#xD;
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQP) are characterized. Piperaquine and Mefloquine are&#xD;
      both metabolized by Cytochrome P450 3A4 (abbreviated CYP3A4) enzyme which potentially results&#xD;
      in clinically significant drug-drug interactions that can cause unanticipated adverse&#xD;
      reactions or therapeutic failures because of the suboptimal drug exposures to the parasite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic interaction and safety profile focusing on the&#xD;
      cardiogenic effect (QTc prolongation) of this triple combinations of DHA-PQP and mefloquine.&#xD;
      Piperaquine and Mefloquine are both metabolized by Cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme which&#xD;
      potentially results in clinically significant drug-drug interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These safety and pharmacokinetic data will be translated to support the intervention in the&#xD;
      Tracking Resistance to Artemisinin Collaboration II (TRACII) project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label sequential pharmacokinetic study in 16 healthy G6PD normal Thai&#xD;
      subjects. The 16 subjects have participated in a healthy volunteer studies in the past either&#xD;
      i) Open-Label Study to Evaluate Potential Pharmacokinetic Interaction of Orally Administered&#xD;
      primaquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in Healthy Adult Subjects or ii) Comparison of&#xD;
      the electrocardiographic effects in relation to Pharmacokinetic profile of chloroquine and&#xD;
      piperaquine in healthy Thai subjects in which they were administered a single dose of three&#xD;
      tablets of DHA-PQP. To avoid unnecessary exposure of other healthy subjects to this study, we&#xD;
      propose to include the result of these previous studies and ask the healthy subjects to&#xD;
      participate from regimen 1 and onward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted in the inpatient ward to receive 2 drug regimens: regimen 1&#xD;
      (Mefloquine with DHA-PQP) and regimen 2 (Mefloquine). Every subject will have 1 screening and&#xD;
      2 admissions in the hospital&#xD;

&#xD;
             Creatinine clearance (CLcr (mL/min)) = (140 - age) * Wt / (72 * Scr) (multiply answer&#xD;
             by 0.85 for females) Where age is in years, weight (wt) is in kg, and serum creatinine&#xD;

             the drug half-life (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication&#xD;
             until the completion of the follow-up procedure, unless in the opinion of&#xD;
             investigator, the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or&#xD;
             compromise subject safety; the investigator will take advice from the manufacturer&#xD;

             chemical entity within 30 days or 5 half-life, or twice the duration of the biological&#xD;
             effect of any drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The subject is unwilling to abstain from ingesting alcohol within 48 hours prior to&#xD;
             the first dose of study medication until collection of the final pharmacokinetic&#xD;
             sample during each regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects who have donated blood to the extent that participation in the study would&#xD;

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             contraindicates participation in the trial. In addition, if heparin is used during&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to heparin or&#xD;
             heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Lack of suitability for participation in this study, including but not limited to,&#xD;
             unstable medical conditions, systemic disease manifested by tendency to&#xD;
             granulocytopenia e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus that in the opinion&#xD;
             of the investigator would compromise their participation in the trial.&#xD;
