    <textblock>
      This study is designed to estimate the bioavailability of montelukast from the 5 milligrams&#xD;
      (mg) montelukast sodium (GW483100) test formulations relative to 5 mg montelukast sodium&#xD;
      reference chewable tablets (innovator product). It is an open-label, randomized, single dose,&#xD;
      three-way cross over, six sequence study in 18 healthy human subjects. Each subject will&#xD;
      participate in all three treatment periods. Subjects will be randomized to one of six&#xD;
      sequences and administered one of the three treatments A, B or C in each treatment period,&#xD;
      where Treatment A is 5mg chewable tablet of reference 5 mg montelukast sodium reference&#xD;
      chewable tablets (innovator product), Treatment B is test formulation 1: 5mg montelukast&#xD;
      sodium (GW483100) chewable tablet and Treatment C is test formulation 2: 5mg montelukast&#xD;
      sodium (GW483100) chewable tablet. The treatment periods will be separated by a washout&#xD;
      period of 7 to 14 days. Total duration in the study for each subject will be approximately 8&#xD;
      weeks from screening to the follow-up visit.&#xD;
