      Phase I, randomized, parallel group, placebo control, unicentric, interventional study.&#xD;
      Thirty two healthy male volunteers aged between 18-35 years will be randomized into the eASCs&#xD;
      or placebo group if they meet all the inclusion criteria at a 3:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment administration will be infused intravenously to the following groups after&#xD;
      randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First arm: 250,000 cells/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second arm: 1 million cells/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Third arm: 4 million cells/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fourth arm: placebo according to their weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An hour after the end of the eASCs administration, all subjects will be given an intravenous&#xD;
      dose of LPS. Subjects will be allowed to leave in the evening once deemed clinically stable&#xD;
      by the investigator.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following&#xD;
        criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy, as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation&#xD;
             including medical history, physical examination and laboratory tests carried out&#xD;
             within 28 days prior to administration of eASCs (if applicable) and LPS. A subject&#xD;
             with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter outside the reference range may be&#xD;
             included only if the investigator judges that the finding is unlikely to introduce&#xD;
             additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male aged between 18 and 35 years, inclusive at the time of signing the informed&#xD;
             consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male subjects (including those who have had a vasectomy) must agree to use barrier&#xD;
             contraception (latex condoms) when engaging in activity in which conception is&#xD;
             possible while on study medication and for at least 28 days after taking the last dose&#xD;
             of study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Must understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form prior to the conduct of&#xD;
             any study related assessment/procedures. Capable of giving written informed consent&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Subjects with a history of malignancy&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. The subject has received an investigational product within three months prior to day 1&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Transfusion of blood or blood products within 6 months prior to the inclusion in the&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Subject has donated more than 350 mL of blood in last 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Body mass index &gt;28 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Presence of a severe bleeding or thrombotic disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. History of known pulmonary embolism or known secondary anti-phospholipid syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subjects known or suspected of not being able to comply with a study protocol (e.g.&#xD;
             due to alcoholism, drug dependency or psychological disorder)&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Known allergies or hypersensitivity to antibiotics, HSA, DMEM, materials of bovine&#xD;
             origin, and Ringer's Lactate Solution&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Any other issue that, in the opinion of the investigator, could be harmful to the&#xD;
             subject or compromise interpretation of the data.&#xD;
