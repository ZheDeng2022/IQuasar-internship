      This is a single center Phase I safety and efficacy study of MK-3475 therapy used in&#xD;
      combination with bladder infused BCG treatment for patients, 18 years or older, with high&#xD;
      risk superficial bladder cancer (cancer not yet involving the muscle of the bladder wall) who&#xD;
      have had removal of their bladder tumor. Patients will be enrolled to a single treatment&#xD;
      group of a fixed dose of MK 3475 and BCG.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States. This is a single center&#xD;
      Phase I safety and efficacy study of MK-3475 therapy used in combination with bladder infused&#xD;
      BCG treatment. The study will determine the safety of administering MK-3475 at a fixed dose&#xD;
      every three weeks in conjunction with intravesicular BCG treatment in non-muscle invasive&#xD;
      bladder cancer patients who had recurrence after two courses of induction (6 doses)&#xD;
      intravesical therapy (two BCG courses, or one BCG course and one other approved intravesical&#xD;
      therapies) administered within 12 months, or after one induction (6 doses) and one&#xD;
      maintenance (3 doses) intravesical therapy (BCG). Subjects will have confirmation of bladder&#xD;
      cancer non-invasive to the muscle. Approximately 20 subjects will be screened to treat 15&#xD;
      eligible subjects with high risk superficial bladder cancer who have had transurethral&#xD;
      resection of their bladder tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for the use of the indicated dose of TICE® BCG is based upon FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially provided package insert/ instructions for use of the product. BCG installation&#xD;
      has been used to treat non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer for more than 30 years. It is one&#xD;
      of the most successful biotherapies for cancer in use. Despite long clinical experience with&#xD;
      BCG, the mechanism of its therapeutic effect is still under investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 3 subjects will be treated at a dose of 100 mg MK-3475 to ensure safety for the&#xD;
      combination. If no safety or efficacy issues are present, dosing will be escalated to 200 mg&#xD;
      MK-3475 every 3 weeks.&#xD;
