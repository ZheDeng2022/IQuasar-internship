  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a monocentric, open label, Phase I-IIa study. Eligible patients who signed the ICF&#xD;
      received two single intravenous (IV) bolus of the imaging agent 99mTc-rhAnnexin V-128. The&#xD;
      first dose was administered on Day 1, and the second dose on Day 42 (±2 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were to start a new disease modifying treatment for RA or AS on Day 2. This&#xD;
      disease modifying treatment was at the discretion of the investigator and was not chosen by&#xD;
      the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety was monitored at every visit. Whole body scintigraphic imaging was performed at Day 1&#xD;
      and Day 42 after 99mTc-rhAnnexin V-128 dosing. Clinical disease assessments were performed at&#xD;
      screening, Day 42 and Day 90 to assess response to RA or AS treatment. Blood was drawn to&#xD;
      test for 99mTc-rhAnnexin V-128 immunogenicity at screening and on Days 30, 56 and 90.&#xD;
      Patients participating in the pharmacokinetic (PK)/dosimetric sub-study had additional&#xD;
      assessments in the 24 hours following the Day 1 dose of 99mTc-rhAnnexin V-128.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was terminated early after the inclusion of 16 of the 20 planned patients. The&#xD;
      sponsor decided to terminate the study earlier than planned due to slow accrual. Novartis&#xD;
      acquired Advanced Accelerator Applications SA.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study medication. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the use of a study medication, whether or not causally related to the study medication. TEAEs are defined as all AEs reported after the first dose. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in congenital anomaly or birth defect, requires in-patient hospitalization or leads to prolongation of hospitalization.</description>

      <recruitment_details>It was planned that 20 evaluable patients with either RA or AS (enrolled in a 1:1 ratio) would be included and would complete the assessments on Day 56, however recruitment was terminated after inclusion of 16 patients.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 16 enrolled participants, 10 participants would take part in a PK/dosimetric sub-study, after providing written approval (only 5 participants were enrolled to the sub-study). Of the first 6 enrolled participants overall, at least 3 had to take part in the sub-study to optimise the PK time points for subsequent participants .</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and Death</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study medication. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the use of a study medication, whether or not causally related to the study medication. TEAEs are defined as all AEs reported after the first dose. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in congenital anomaly or birth defect, requires in-patient hospitalization or leads to prolongation of hospitalization.</description>
