      The investigators aim at investigating whether 24-week high intensity interval training might&#xD;
      exert beneficial effects by modulating neurohormonal axis in patients with chronic heart&#xD;
      failure (CHF). Furthermore, the effect of detraining on neurohormonal axis in CHF patients&#xD;
      will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to European Society of Cardiology the prevalence of Heart Failure (HF) is between 2&#xD;
      and 3% in general population and increases with age, so the prevalence in 70- to 80-years-old&#xD;
      people is between 10 and 20%. HF is the cause of 5% of acute hospital admissions, is present&#xD;
      in 10% of patients in hospital beds, and accounts for high national expenditure on health,&#xD;
      mostly due to the cost of hospital admissions. Although some patients can live for many years&#xD;
      and the great improvement of medical therapy during last decades, overall 50% of patients are&#xD;
      dead at 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite different hypothesis that explain the underlying physiopathology of heart failure&#xD;
      have been proposed over time, no single paradigm for heart failure was established&#xD;
      definitively. One logical explanation of the inability to define the syndrome of heart&#xD;
      failure in precise mechanistic model is that the clinical syndrome of heart failure almost&#xD;
      certainly represents the summation of multiple anatomic, functional, and biological&#xD;
      alterations that interact together in a complex way. Thus, it is not surprising that&#xD;
      investigators have used a variety of complex model in an attempt to describe the syndrome of&#xD;
      heart failure. Nowadays, the most accepted hypothesis explaining HF physiopathology and its&#xD;
      progression is the &quot;neurohormonal model&quot;. According to this paradigm, heart failure&#xD;
      progresses as a result of the overexpression of biologically active molecules that exert&#xD;
      toxic effects on the heart and circulation. A variety of molecules including norepinephrine,&#xD;
      angiotensin II, endothelin, aldosterone, and tumor necrosis factor have been implicated as&#xD;
      some of the factors that contribute to disease progression in the failing heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the effectiveness of the neurohormonal model to explain disease progression and the&#xD;
      many insights that it provided for the development of new therapies, there is increasing&#xD;
      clinical evidence that suggests that our current models fail to completely explain disease&#xD;
      progression. Thus, neurohormonal models may be necessary but not sufficient to explain all&#xD;
      aspects of disease progression in the failing heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the prognosis of HF patients is still unsatisfactory despite optimal therapies, other&#xD;
      mechanisms that contribute to HF progression need to be elucidated. Mounting evidence suggest&#xD;
      that in heart failure there is a metabolic imbalance characterized by a predominance of the&#xD;
      catabolic status over anabolic drive. The most impressive example is seen in end-stage HF&#xD;
      known as &quot;cardiac cachexia&quot; characterized by strong weight loss, particularly lean mass and&#xD;
      rapid deterioration of clinical conditions, attributed to a prevalence of catabolic pathways.&#xD;
      If the hormonal imbalance is an epiphenomenon or an important pathophysiological mechanism in&#xD;
      the HF progression is still matter of debate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular deficit of each anabolic axis (adrenal, gonadal and somatotropic axes) is an&#xD;
      independent marker of poor prognosis in HF patients and the coexistence of more than one&#xD;
      deficiency identifies a subgroup of patients with a higher mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most involved hormonal axes include growth hormone (GH), its tissue effector insulin-like&#xD;
      growth factor-1 (IGF-1), thyroid hormone, and anabolic steroids. Taken together, these&#xD;
      alterations could be recognized as a multiple hormonal and metabolic deficiency syndrome&#xD;
      (MHD) in HF patients. MHD has a significant impact on cardiac performance and HF progression.&#xD;

      (MHD) in HF patients. MHD has a significant impact on cardiac performance and HF progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, a pattern of Insulin-resistance (IR) is quite common in diabetic as well as&#xD;
      non-diabetic CHF patients. IR has been found in about 30% of non-diabetic CHF patients and&#xD;
      was related to underlying disease severity. Few studies have considered reduction of IR as a&#xD;
      new therapeutic target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In brief, it could be argued that CHF patients showed an anabolic/catabolic imbalance due to&#xD;
      multiple neurohormonal axis disequilibrium. Anabolic hormonal deficiency is usually described&#xD;
      in men with chronic heart failure (CHF) contributing to the anabolic/catabolic imbalance&#xD;
      ultimately resulting in skeletal muscle waist and cardiac cachexia. Counteracting the&#xD;
      anabolic deficit seems to play beneficial clinical effects in CHF patients. In fact, the&#xD;
      increase of serum levels of testosterone and growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor 1&#xD;
      (IGF-1) axis obtained by hexogen administration, improves key symptoms of CHF such as&#xD;
      exercise intolerance and muscle fatigue and positively impact quality of life. Besides the&#xD;
      hexogen administration, an increase of the levels of anabolic hormones can be obtained&#xD;
      through physical exercise. In healthy subjects, testosterone may increase remarkably as an&#xD;
      acute response to both endurance and heavy resistance exercise. Similarly, GH concentrations&#xD;
      generally increase in response to both strength and endurance exercise thereby stimulating&#xD;
      IGF-1 production. Although this hormonal modulation could be one of the mechanisms by which&#xD;
      exercise training exerts its beneficial effects on CHF patients, there are few data on&#xD;
      endogenous exercise-induced increase of anabolic hormones in such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aside from the nature of the training activity, the effects of training may vary with&#xD;
      different dose parameters, specifically program length, session duration and frequency and&#xD;
      workload or intensity. In the most severely impaired patients, with initial exercise&#xD;
      intolerance, sessions may initially be limited to 3-5 minutes duration with 3 or 4 sessions&#xD;
      completed during the course of the day; however, recent work has suggested that if total&#xD;
      exercise energy expenditure is standardized then intermittent exercise training programs may&#xD;
      elicit superior benefits to heart failure patients compared to continuous exercise training&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High intensity, repeated intermittent work periods separated by recovery periods have been&#xD;
      shown to be efficacious in heart failure patients, and interval stress has been shown to be&#xD;
      as effective as continuous workloads in older, healthy and post coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      surgery populations. In a systematic review of 81 heart failure ExT studies only two of these&#xD;
      reported peak VO2 changes of 10% and 20% respectively compared with 16.5% overall change in&#xD;
      continuous exercise training and similar improvements with strength training. The underlying&#xD;
      theory is that higher intensity, intermittent stress is more likely to promote peripheral&#xD;
      adaptations and produce concurrent improvements in functional capacity. Recent work has shown&#xD;
      that reductions of brain natriuretic peptide, a marker of myocardial stretch, may be greater&#xD;
      in high intensity (90% peak VO2), rather than moderate intensity (70% peak VO2) exercise&#xD;
      training in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction. A recent meta-analysis showed&#xD;
      that intermittent exercise elicits superior improvements in peak VO2 and VE/VCO2 slope&#xD;
      compared to continuous exercise training in heart failure patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies evaluated the hormonal response to interval training in CHF. However, the&#xD;
      relatively small sample size, the lack of control group or the relatively short time exercise&#xD;
      intervention limits the conclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims at investigating whether 24-week high intensity interval training&#xD;
      might exert beneficial effects by modulating neurohormonal axis in CHF patients. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the effect of detraining on neurohormonal axis in CHF patients will be evaluated.&#xD;
