      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Researchers are studying a topical (skin) cream that reduces pain. This is called an&#xD;
      analgesic cream. They want to try a new test to better measure how well it works. Heat will&#xD;
      be applied to the participants arms and they will judge the intensity of the temperatures.&#xD;
      Researchers will compare the pain reduction from this cream to other pain relief treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To better measure the effects of a pain-relieving (analgesic) cream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers ages 18 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be 2 study sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Session 1 will be about 1.5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will be screened with physical exam and urine drug test. They will&#xD;
                answer medical and psychological questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will have sensory testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A moisturizer will be put on their arms. A heating device will be placed on their arms.&#xD;
           It gives heat pulses of about 2 seconds each. Some are warm and some are very hot.&#xD;
           Participants will say how strong each pulse is. They can move away if it gets painful.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then the pain-relieving cream will be put on one arm. The moisturizer will be put on the&#xD;
           other. Participants will get more pulses and rate them. They will also get pairs of&#xD;
           pulses and compare them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants will return for session 2 for 1 hour. They will receive similar&#xD;
           sensory testing as in session 1.&#xD;

      This study uses a new testing design to evaluate pain reduction from a pain-relieving cream.&#xD;
      Sequences of heat stimuli will be applied to the participants arms and participants will be&#xD;
      asked to judge the intensity of the temperatures they perceive. There are two study sessions.&#xD;
      Session 1 involves eligibility screening and baseline sensory testing with and without the&#xD;
      analgesic (pain-relieving) cream. Session 2 involves more sensory testing with the analgesic&#xD;
      cream. The study population is 40 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 50.&#xD;
