  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of DPX-Survivac plus low&#xD;
      dose cyclophosphamide in up to 24 subjects with recurrent diffuse large B-cell lymphoma&#xD;
      (DLBCL) who are not eligible for transplant. However, with the evolving field of&#xD;
      immunotherapy Immunovaccine has begun to focus on combination therapies, combining&#xD;
      DPX-Survivac treatment with checkpoint inhibitors and other immune modulators. This phase 2&#xD;
      study was therefore terminated with fewer subjects than planned to allow the progress of&#xD;
      other studies, such as NCT03349450.&#xD;

      A multi-center treatment study assessing the efficacy and safety of an immunotherapeutic&#xD;
      vaccine (DPX-Survivac) combined with low dose cyclophosphamide. Subjects with measurable,&#xD;
      histologically proven DLBCL expressing survivin will be treated in this open-label, single&#xD;
      arm study. Survivin is a protein commonly over-expressed in many types of cancer, including&#xD;
      DLBCL.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Main Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with histologically proven recurrent DLBCL. Subjects may have recurrence&#xD;
             after primary or second treatment regimens for DLBCL. Subjects with recurrence at&#xD;
             least 90 days post-autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) are eligible. Patients&#xD;
             with partial response or measurable disease after first line therapy (who are not&#xD;
             candidates for ASCT) or after second line therapy without disease progression may also&#xD;
             be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous localized surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy more than 21 days prior to&#xD;
             SD0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may have received previous courses of an investigational biologic therapy&#xD;
             including active or passive immunotherapy (e.g. rituximab), other B cell depleting&#xD;
             antibody therapy, or radioimmunotherapy (e.g. tositumomab or ibritumomab) if last&#xD;
             administration is greater than 77 days prior to SD0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have at least one measurable site of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to undergo a pre-treatment and post-treatment tumor biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have evidence of survivin expression in pre-treatment tumor sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A screening Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG) of 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A life expectancy &gt; 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Main Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients eligible for possible curative therapies such as ASCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients undergoing concurrent chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy or&#xD;
             who are currently on an investigational product/trial are excluded. There must be at&#xD;
             least 21 days since completion of prior chemotherapy/radiation and at least 77 days&#xD;
             since completion of immunotherapy until study treatment begins (SD0). Subjects must&#xD;
             have recovered from all acute toxicities from prior treatment; peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
             must be &lt; grade 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with refractory disease after their last treatment (i.e. progression within&#xD;
             90 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received prior survivin based vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Progressive CNS lymphoma requiring treatment within 84 days prior to SD0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of active autoimmune disease, such as but not restricted to, inflammatory&#xD;
             bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, scleroderma, or&#xD;
             multiple sclerosis requiring treatment within the last two years.&#xD;
