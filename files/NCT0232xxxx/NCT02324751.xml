    <textblock>
      Using an established model of human typhoid infection, whereby healthy adults are&#xD;
      deliberately exposed to typhoid-causing bacteria, the investigators will determine how&#xD;
      effective a new typhoid conjugate vaccine (Vi-TCV) is in preventing infection. The new&#xD;
      typhoid vaccine will be compared with a control vaccine (meningococcal ACWY). The protective&#xD;
      effect of a currently used typhoid polysaccharide vaccine (Vi-PS) will also be studied and&#xD;
      compared with the control vaccine using this model of typhoid infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second component of this study will involve vaccinating 15-20 participants with Vi-PS.&#xD;
      Serum will be obtained prior to vaccination and 4-6 weeks after vaccination. The&#xD;
      post-vaccination serum will be pooled and used to create an anti-Vi IgG serum standard.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Typhoid fever is an infection caused by a bacterium, Salmonella Typhi, that only causes&#xD;
      disease in humans. It is transmitted faecal-orally and causes more than 22 million infections&#xD;
      every year in developing countries, such as areas of Asia, Africa and South America, where&#xD;
      access to clean drinking water and sanitation facilities is limited. Although typhoid fever&#xD;
      is treatable with effective antibiotics, there are more than 200,000 deaths every year in&#xD;
      these resource-limited regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Salmonella Typhi could be eradicated but improving sanitation and living conditions in&#xD;
      endemic regions is difficult. Vaccination to prevent the transmission of Salmonella Typhi&#xD;
      could significantly reduce the burden of disease. The currently licensed typhoid vaccines are&#xD;
      only moderately effective in preventing infection in people who have been immunised and no&#xD;
      vaccines are licensed for use in young children. Novel typhoid vaccines have been developed&#xD;
      to overcome these problems, but more research and information is needed to study how well&#xD;
      these vaccines work before they can be routinely used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to investigate the protective effect of a novel typhoid vaccine (typhoid&#xD;
      Vi polysaccharide capsule - tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine) using a human challenge model&#xD;
      of typhoid infection. Healthy adults will be vaccinated with the novel typhoid vaccine, a&#xD;
      currently used typhoid vaccine (Vi polysaccharide capsule vaccine) or a control vaccine. One&#xD;
      month after vaccination, participants will be exposed to live Salmonella Typhi by drinking a&#xD;
      solution containing the bacteria. Participants will then be closely monitored to determine&#xD;
      which participants develop infection and which are protected. In addition to assessing the&#xD;
      protective effect of conjugated and unconjugated typhoid vaccines, the effect the vaccines&#xD;
      have on the immune system and on the clinical course of typhoid infection will also be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hoped that the knowledge gained from this study will contribute to the use of vaccines&#xD;
      against Salmonella Typhi to help control this preventable disease.&#xD;
