  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the combination of prazosin and naltrexone&#xD;
      will decrease alcohol cravings and drinking in individuals who have problems with alcohol and&#xD;
      have used alcohol at risky levels compare to naltrexone and placebo (Nal/Pl), prazosin and&#xD;
      placebo (Praz/Pl), and double-placebo (Pl/Pl). We hypothesize that those assigned to both&#xD;
      prazosin and naltrexone would report significantly greater decreases in percent drinking days&#xD;
      and heavy drinking days as well as significantly greater reduction in craving from pre to&#xD;
      post-treatment than those assigned to either single medication or double-placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prazosin is a medication that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to&#xD;
      treat people with high blood pressure. Some studies have shown that prazosin may also&#xD;
      decrease nightmares and improve sleep in Veterans suffering from Posttraumatic Stress&#xD;
      Disorder (PTSD). Animal studies have consistently found that prazosin is associated with&#xD;
      decreased alcohol consumption and that the combination of prazosin and naltrexone outperforms&#xD;
      either medication alone. The current study is evaluating an &quot;off-label&quot; use of prazosin to&#xD;
      determine whether it is helpful in decreasing alcohol cravings and consumption among people&#xD;
      with alcohol problems. &quot;Off-label&quot; means that the FDA has not approved the use of prazosin&#xD;
      for alcohol problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Naltrexone is a medication that is FDA approved for treating alcohol problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is sponsored by the Department of Defense and the Congressionally Directed Medical&#xD;
      Research Program (DoD/CDMRP). We expect approximately 120 participants in this study, which&#xD;
      will run over approximately 4 years. Study participants will be involved in the study for 7&#xD;
      weeks, or until they complete the Final Assessment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled study of prazosin and naltrexone, we&#xD;
      will evaluate the combination of naltrexone and the noradrenergic medication prazosin&#xD;
      (Nal/Praz) relative to naltrexone and placebo (Nal/Pl), prazosin and placebo (Praz/Pl), and&#xD;
      double-placebo (Pl/Pl). Participants will undergo two craving inductions, one oriented&#xD;
      towards relief craving and the other towards reward craving. Daily IVR (Interactive Voice&#xD;
      Recording System) data on craving and consumption and PTSD symptomatology will be collected&#xD;
      during the 7 days immediately following the initial assessment visit to establish a&#xD;
      pre-medication baseline. One hundred twenty individuals with adequate IVR compliance and&#xD;
      whose screening lab tests indicate it is safe for them to take the study medications will&#xD;
      enter the medication phase of the study within 14 days of the initial assessment initiating&#xD;
      prazosin/placebo as well as 50mg naltrexone/placebo treatment. Randomization will be blocked&#xD;
      by gender, PTSD status, and desire to abstain vs. desire to cut down. Prazosin will be&#xD;
      titrated to three times daily dosing (9 am: 4mg; 3pm: 4 mg; 9pm: 8mg) at the end of two&#xD;
      weeks. Naltrexone will be taken once daily 50 mg/day with no titration schedule. The stable&#xD;
      dose of both medications will continue for four more weeks and medication compliance will be&#xD;
      evaluated through pill counts, the IVR daily monitoring, and riboflavin trace in urine&#xD;
      analysis. On approximately day 42 participants will come into the lab for the craving&#xD;
      inductions (there will be a two week window after day 42 in which participants may still be&#xD;
      seen if scheduling issues arise). The order of the craving inductions will be&#xD;
      counterbalanced, and their administration will be separated in time by 30 minutes to minimize&#xD;
      carry over between them. Subjective responses to the craving inductions will be obtained via&#xD;
      relief oriented craving items and reward oriented craving items from the Desire for Alcohol&#xD;
      Questionnaire. Participants will then be assisted in returning their craving levels to&#xD;
      baseline prior to debriefing. They will all be offered treatment referrals within the&#xD;
      Veterans Affairs (VA) or in the community. Both prazosin and naltrexone can be safely&#xD;
      discontinued without tapering.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Percent Drinking Days (PDD) (Visit 8 PDD - Visit 2 PDD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 2 (baseline) and visit 8 (last visit). Per the protocol, visit 8 is scheduled to occur 42 days (± 7days) after visit 2. In reality, visit 8 occurred 35 to 76 days after visit 2 with the average of 45 days due to scheduling difficulties.</time_frame>
    <description>PDD was calculated based on self-reported drinking history collected via Form-90. Drinking days were defined as days when participants consumed alcohol. Form-90 was completed by participants in visit 2 (baseline) and visit 8 (last visit). Form-90 collected in the baseline visit recorded participants' alcohol consumption from 90 days prior to their baseline visit until the day before their baseline visit. Form-90 collected in the last visit recorded participants' alcohol consumption from baseline until the day before their last visit. This outcome measures changes in PDD between visit 8 and visit 2. Per the protocol, visit 8 is scheduled to occur 42 days (± 7days) after visit 2. In reality, visit 8 occurred 35 to 76 days after visit 2 with the average of 45 days. The outliers were due to scheduling difficulties.</description>

    <description>PHDD was calculated based on self-reported drinking history collected via Form-90. Heavy drinking days were defined as days when participants consumed 4 or more drinks for females and 5 or more drinks for males. Form-90 was completed by participants in the baseline and last visit. Form-90 collected in the baseline visit recorded participants' alcohol consumption 90 days prior to their baseline visit. Form-90 collected in the last visit recorded participants' alcohol consumption from baseline until the day before their last visit. This outcome measures changes in PHDD between visit 8 and visit 2. Per the protocol, visit 8 is scheduled to occur 42 days (± 7days) after visit 2. In reality, visit 8 occurred 35 to 76 days after visit 2 with the average of 45 days.

    <measure>Change in Alcohol Craving (Visit 8 PACS - Visit 2 PACS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 2 (baseline) and visit 8 (last visit). Per the protocol, visit 8 is scheduled to occur 42 days (± 7days) after visit 2. In reality, visit 8 occurred 35 to 76 days after visit 2 with the average of 45 days due to scheduling difficulties.</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol craving was assessed in visit 2 (baseline) and the last visit (visit 8) using the Pennsylvania Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS). The PACS had 5 questions, where each question had six options presented in Likert Scales from 0 to 6, with 0 being the least and 6 being the highest possible option, thus the possible minimum and maximum values are 0 and 30, respectively. Higher scores mean higher craving. This outcome measures the change in PACS scores between visits 2 and 8 (visit 8 PACS score - visit 2 PACS score). Per the protocol, visit 8 is scheduled to occur 42 days (± 7days) after visit 2. In reality, visit 8 occurred 35 to 76 days after visit 2 with the average of 45 days. The outliers were due to scheduling difficulties.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Recruitment was done from 03/03/2015 to 09/18/2018; however the last participant was recruited on 08/30/2018 because the rest of the interested individuals were not eligible. Participants were recruited primarily through letters that were sent to those whose medical records indicated they likely had an active Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and had not been prescribed the study medications. Other recruitment methods: flyers, VA TV monitors, and advertising in the local media.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Interested individuals called study staff and were screened for eligibility. Out of 200 phone screens, 97 individuals were eligible and invited to the screening visit. Of these, 21 did not show or were lost to follow up, 7 canceled their visit, and 8 declined the visit. Out of 61 individuals who came to screening, 31 were eligible and randomized.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change in Percent Drinking Days (PDD) (Visit 8 PDD - Visit 2 PDD)</title>
        <description>PDD was calculated based on self-reported drinking history collected via Form-90. Drinking days were defined as days when participants consumed alcohol. Form-90 was completed by participants in visit 2 (baseline) and visit 8 (last visit). Form-90 collected in the baseline visit recorded participants' alcohol consumption from 90 days prior to their baseline visit until the day before their baseline visit. Form-90 collected in the last visit recorded participants' alcohol consumption from baseline until the day before their last visit. This outcome measures changes in PDD between visit 8 and visit 2. Per the protocol, visit 8 is scheduled to occur 42 days (± 7days) after visit 2. In reality, visit 8 occurred 35 to 76 days after visit 2 with the average of 45 days. The outliers were due to scheduling difficulties.</description>

          <title>Change in Percent Drinking Days (PDD) (Visit 8 PDD - Visit 2 PDD)</title>
          <description>PDD was calculated based on self-reported drinking history collected via Form-90. Drinking days were defined as days when participants consumed alcohol. Form-90 was completed by participants in visit 2 (baseline) and visit 8 (last visit). Form-90 collected in the baseline visit recorded participants' alcohol consumption from 90 days prior to their baseline visit until the day before their baseline visit. Form-90 collected in the last visit recorded participants' alcohol consumption from baseline until the day before their last visit. This outcome measures changes in PDD between visit 8 and visit 2. Per the protocol, visit 8 is scheduled to occur 42 days (± 7days) after visit 2. In reality, visit 8 occurred 35 to 76 days after visit 2 with the average of 45 days. The outliers were due to scheduling difficulties.</description>

        <title>Change in Mean Drinks Per Day of Drinking (Visit 8 - Visit 2)</title>
        <description>Average drinks per day of drinking was calculated based on self-reported drinking history collected via Form-90. Drinking days were defined as days when participants consumed alcohol. Form-90 was completed by participants in visit 2 (baseline) and visit 8 (last visit). Form-90 collected in the baseline visit recorded participants' alcohol consumption 90 days prior to their baseline visit. Form-90 collected in the last visit recorded participants' alcohol consumption from baseline until the day before their last visit. This outcome reports the change in the mean drinks between visit 8 and visit 2. Per the protocol, visit 8 is scheduled to occur 42 days (± 7days) after visit 2. In reality, visit 8 occurred 35 to 76 days after visit 2 with the average of 45 days. The outliers were due to scheduling difficulties.</description>
