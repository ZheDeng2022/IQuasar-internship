  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Patients with obstructive sleep apnea run an increased risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease including hypertension. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first line&#xD;
      of treatment. However, many patients skip CPAP for some nights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The primary aim was to investigate the cardiovascular effects of short-term CPAP&#xD;
      withdrawal for five nights because of obstructive sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized, parallel controlled trial Inclusion criteria: 100 patients with&#xD;
      successful CPAP treatment for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Dementia, heart infarction within 3 months, apnea hypopnea index &gt; 10&#xD;
      with CPAP treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: 50 patients are randomized to sleep 5 days without CPAP and 50 patients to&#xD;
      continue with CPAP treatment during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes: Arterial stiffness, 24-hour blood pressure. Secondary outcomes: Effects of&#xD;
      gender on outcome. Effects on brain natriuretic peptide, apnea-hypopnea index, oxygen&#xD;
      desaturation-index, urine-catecholamines, blood lipids, C-reactive protein, glucose&#xD;
      metabolism (S-glc, HBA1c), insulin resistance, serum creatinine, hemoglobin, daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness (ESS, KSS), lung function (FVC, FEV1), airway inflammation (exhaled NO)&#xD;
      Procedures: Sleep apnea investigation while patients are treated with CPAP for one night.&#xD;
      Urinary samplings during the same night. They are also investigated with 24 h blood pressure&#xD;
      measurements. Blood samples are taking fasting in the morning followed by measuring the&#xD;
      arterial stiffness (Vicorder, Skidmore Medical UK) including pulse wave analysis using&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer (Omron Japan). The same investigations are done at follow-up 5 days later&#xD;
      where half of the patients have continued using CPAP treatment and half of them has slept&#xD;
      without CPAP.&#xD;

      Patients fulfilling inclusion criteria are invited to the trial after informed consent for&#xD;
      baseline and follow-up investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline investigations Day 1 Patients are given a questionnaire. They are given blood&#xD;
      pressure monitoring, (ABPM Medical 90217 ambulatory blood pressure monitor, Spacelab) for 24&#xD;
      hours a starting at 8-9 AM. They are also given sleep apnea recorder (Embletta, X 10 system,&#xD;
      Embla systems, ResMed) for ambulatory use during the following night, and a container for&#xD;
      urinary sampling during the night (urine norepinephrine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2 Fasting on arrival. Return of the 24-h blood pressure recorder, the sleep apnea&#xD;
      recorder and the urine sampling container.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples at 08.15 am after resting for 15 minutes. Arterial stiffness is measured using&#xD;
      arterial pulse wave velocity, radial artery applanation tonometry and office blood pressure.&#xD;
      After resting, the measurements starts at 8.30 AM in a room with a temperature of 24째C. Pulse&#xD;
      wave velocity (Vicorder, Skidmore Medical, Bristol, UK) is measured in the supine position.&#xD;
      The augmentation index is derived from pulse wave analysis obtained from radial artery&#xD;
      applanation tonometry on the right arm (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung function and exhaled NO measurements, ECG. Breakfast at around 10.00 am. CPAP time&#xD;
      counter check Patients are then randomized with a ration of 1:1 to continue with CPAP or not&#xD;
      for the following 5 nights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up measurements Day 6 They are given blood pressure monitoring, (ABPM Medical 90217&#xD;
      ambulatory blood pressure monitor, Spacelab) for 24 hours a starting at 8-9 AM. They are also&#xD;
      given sleep apnea recorder (Embletta, X 10 system, Embla systems, ResMed) for ambulatory use&#xD;
      during the following night, and a container for urinary sampling during the night (urine&#xD;
      norepinephrine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 7 Fasting on arrival. CPAP time counter check Return of the 24-h blood pressure recorder,&#xD;
      the sleep apnea recorder and the urine sampling container.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples at 08.15 am after resting for 15 minutes. Arterial stiffness is measured using&#xD;
      arterial pulse wave velocity, radial artery applanation tonometry and office blood pressure.&#xD;
      After resting, the measurements starts at 8.30 AM in a room with a temperature of 24째C. Pulse&#xD;
      wave velocity (Vicorder, Skidmore Medical, Bristol, UK) is measured in the supine position.&#xD;
      The augmentation index is derived from pulse wave analysis obtained from radial artery&#xD;
      applanation tonometry on the right arm (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung function and exhaled NO measurements, ECG. Breakfast at around 10.00 am. Trials ends and&#xD;
      patients are told to continue with CPAP as usual.&#xD;
