      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of antiviral medicine (acyclovir) in&#xD;
      recovery of complete facial Palsy. Fifty patients (Males and females) with acute Facial Palsy&#xD;
      within the first 3 days of onset with age ranged from 15-60 years old. Each patient was&#xD;
      submitted to the following clinical evaluation using House and Brackmann 6 facial function&#xD;
      scoring system and Synnybrook grading system. Neurophysiological assessment of facial nerve&#xD;
      and muscles was done before and after the end of treatment, then after the end of first and&#xD;
      second month of treatment. EMG was done for facial muscles of both sides beside measuring&#xD;
      facial nerve excitability to determine the excitation threshold by recording the minimum&#xD;
      electrical stimulus required to produce visible muscle contraction. A difference greater than&#xD;
      3.5 mA between the affected and unaffected side is considered significant in terms of poor&#xD;
      prognosis. Nerve conduction study of facial nerves of both sides using concentric needle&#xD;
      electrode. Trigeminal Blink reflex for both sides of the face. Facial functional recovery was&#xD;
      defined as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;complete&quot; using the same criteria used in the 2001 practice guideline.&#xD;
      An outcome of grade I or II was considered a good recovery using the House and Brackmann 6&#xD;
      facial function scoring system&#xD;
