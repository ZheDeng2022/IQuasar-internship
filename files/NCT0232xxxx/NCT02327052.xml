  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most challenging issues of chronic Chagas disease is to provide earlier detection&#xD;
      of heart involvement. Two-dimensional speckle tracking (2-D ST) echocardiography, a new&#xD;
      imaging modality with useful applications in several cardiac diseases, has been validated for&#xD;
      subjects with myocardial infarction against cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Here the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the longitudinal global strain (LGS) has an incremental value&#xD;
      to ejection fraction for predicting myocardial fibrosis in subjects with Chagas disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We conducted a cross-sectional study, in which adult subjects with Chagas disease were&#xD;
      invited to participate. From January 2011 to December 2013, we included 58 subjects from a&#xD;
      convenience sample, in the Chagas disease outpatient clinics at our institution. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria were disease established based on microbiological confirmation by two positive&#xD;
      serologic tests (indirect hemagglutination and indirect immunofluorescence), and age between&#xD;
      18 and 70 years. Exclusion criteria were: previous myocardial infarction or history of&#xD;
      coronary artery disease; primary valve disease; dialysis treatment of terminal renal failure,&#xD;
      liver disease in activity; hematologic, neoplastic or bone diseases; and MRI&#xD;
      contraindications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee&#xD;
      of the Hospital São Rafael. All subjects gave written informed consent before their inclusion&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We obtained a structured medical history, and all subjects underwent physical examination,&#xD;
      blood analysis, 12-lead ECG, chest X-Ray, 24-h Holter monitoring, conventional Doppler&#xD;
      echocardiogram plus speckle tracking strain, and cardiac magnetic resonance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doppler echocardiogram Standard transthoracic echocardiographic examinations were recorded in&#xD;
      all subjects using the Vivid 7 digital ultrasound system (GE Vingmed Ultrasound AS, Horten,&#xD;
      Norway). Three cardiac cycles were stored in cine loop format for online analysis. LV and&#xD;
      left atrial dimensions were measured according to the American Society of Echocardiography's&#xD;
      recommendations [13]. The LV EF was measured using the biplane Simpson's method. S0 systolic&#xD;
      velocity at the lateral mitral annulus was assessed using pulsed-wave DTI. Diastolic function&#xD;
      was evaluated by the analysis of the mitral Doppler inflow, pulsed- wave DTI at the lateral&#xD;
      mitral annulus, and mitral propagation velocity using color M-mode echocardiography. Mitral&#xD;
      regurgitation (MR) was obtained using the proximal isovelocity surface area method. Right&#xD;
      ventricular function was assessed with the S0 systolic velocity in the lateral wall. Systolic&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial pressure was obtained from the tricuspid regurgitation flow. In subjects&#xD;
      with adequate Doppler MR signals, dP/dt was determined noninvasively from the rate of change&#xD;
      of MR velocity, according to American Society of Echocardiography guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strain Measurements Two-dimensional gray-scale images were acquired in the standard apical&#xD;
      four-chamber, three-chamber, and two-chamber views at a frame rate of 80 frames/sec. The&#xD;
      dimensions of the computation area were an angle of 80o and at a depth of 13 cm. The left&#xD;
      ventricle was divided into 17 segments, and each segment was analyzed individually. GLS and&#xD;
      segmental longitudinal strain were obtained as previously described [14]. Average&#xD;
      longitudinal strains were calculated automatically by the software. Two-dimensional strain is&#xD;
      a non-Doppler-based method for the evaluation of systolic strain using standard 2D&#xD;
      acquisitions. After placing three endocardial markers in an end-diastolic frame, the software&#xD;
      automatically tracks the contour on subsequent frames. Adequate tracking can be verified in&#xD;
      real time and corrected by adjusting the region of interest or by manually correcting the&#xD;
      contour to ensure optimal tracking. Two-dimensional longitudinal strain was assessed in&#xD;
      apical views. Average longitudinal strains were calculated for the 17 segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging Cardiac magnetic resonance exams were performed on all subjects&#xD;
      using the General Electric Sigma HDx 1.5-T system (Fairfield, CT, USA). Images were acquired&#xD;
      and gated to the ECG during breath-hold, four-chamber, short axis and long axis of the left&#xD;
      ventricle, in the exact same location in different sequences. This allows a precise&#xD;
      comparison between cardiac function and regional myocardial structure. The parameters used in&#xD;
      the dynamic sequences were repetition time (RT) of 3.5 ms, echo time (ET) of 1.5 ms, flip&#xD;
      angle 60°, bandwidth of receipt of ± 125 kHz, field of view (FOV) of 35 x 35 cm, 256x148&#xD;
      matrix, temporal resolution (TR) 35 ms, 8.0 mm slice thickness, without a space between the&#xD;
      slices. Following this acquisition, a dose of gadolinium-based contrast (0.1 mmol / kg) was&#xD;
      injected. The myocardial delayed enhancement (MDE) technique was used to investigate&#xD;
      myocardial fibrosis, an inversion-recovery pre-pared gradient-echo acquired 10 to 20 min&#xD;
      after contrast application, with the following parameters: Repetition time (RT) 7.1 ms, echo&#xD;
      time (ET) 3.1 ms, flip angle 20°, cardiac phases 1, views per segment 16 to 32, matrix 256 X&#xD;
      192, slice thickness 8 mm, gap between slices 2 mm and field of view 32 to 38 cm, inversion&#xD;
      time 150 to 300 ms, receiver bandwidth 31.25 kHz, number of excitations 2, acquisition every&#xD;
      heart beat. The mass of fibrosis was estimated by a quantitative visual method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Categorical data were presented as numbers (percentages), and continuous&#xD;
      data were expressed as mean (SD) or median (interquartile range). Comparisons of continuous&#xD;
      variables among groups were performed with analysis of variance (ANOVA) test or&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis, depending on normality assessed by Shapiro-Wilk test. Chi-Square or Fisher&#xD;
      tests were applied for proportions comparisons. Correlations between continuous variables&#xD;
      were evaluated by Pearson or Spearman coefficients, depending on normality.&#xD;
      Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate if the&#xD;
      longitudinal global strain would add accuracy to the ejection fraction in the predicted&#xD;
      fibrosis. C-Statistic (area under the curve) was presented as a unified estimate of&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity. To determine the ability to predict myocardial fibrosis,&#xD;
      multiple linear regression was performed, adjusting longitudinal global strain to left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction. Analyses in subgroups with normal and low ejection fraction&#xD;
      were also accomplished. Cases with missing data were not included in the analysis. Analyses&#xD;
      were performed using SPSS version 20.0 (IBM), and p &lt; 0.05 (two-tailed) was considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
