    <textblock>
      Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) is a rare genetic disorder associated with a vast array of&#xD;
      symptoms. The features of BBS are highly variable, even between siblings, making long-term&#xD;
      follow-up and centralization of information vital to better understanding this complex&#xD;
      disease and designing effective treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Marshfield Clinic has developed the Clinical Registry Investigating Bardet-Biedl Syndrome&#xD;
      (CRIBBS) to gather comprehensive health information from patients diagnosed with BBS in a&#xD;
      single repository. This information will be used to inform patients, families, and physicians&#xD;
      about the complex features of BBS and will serve as a platform for researchers to develop&#xD;
      effective and targeted treatment strategies for patients with BBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRIBBS is a web-based, confidential database and the privacy of patients enrolled in the&#xD;
      registry will always be respected. Information maintained in the database will be&#xD;
      identifiable only by an assigned study identification number, not by name. The registry&#xD;
      strictly complies with HIPAA regulations. CRIBBS participants may be contacted periodically&#xD;
      with information regarding clinical trials or research studies, but participation is entirely&#xD;
      voluntary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRIBBS will bring together complex genetic and clinical information from BBS patients to&#xD;
      accelerate research into effective treatments, attract additional researchers, and make it&#xD;
      easier for researchers to identify patients and find funding for innovative studies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Clinical Registry Investigating Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (CRIBBS) is an international&#xD;
      registry for individuals with a rare genetic disorder called Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). The&#xD;
      registry is sustained by private philanthropic funding sources. The primary objective of&#xD;
      establishing and sustaining CRIBBS is to enable clinical natural history studies and&#xD;
      therapeutic trials in individuals with BBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in CRIBBS is open to individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for BBS and/or&#xD;
      genetic confirmation of the condition. Identification and recruitment of members will be&#xD;
      accomplished in two approaches. First, family support organizations will share information&#xD;
      regarding CRIBBS and encourage enrollment in the registry. Second, a website will be&#xD;
      developed for participants, families and health care providers. This website provides a&#xD;
      portal for registration as well as medical and new information impacting health care for&#xD;
      individuals with BBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection and Enrollment of Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A website portal at www.bbs-registry.org facilitates voluntary registration of interested&#xD;
      individuals. A CRIBBS coordinator will contact the individual and/or family to establish that&#xD;
      participants meet published diagnostic criteria and/or genetic criteria for BBS. Individuals&#xD;
      meeting criteria will be consented and assigned a unique identifier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consented participants and/or their parent/guardian will be interviewed by a CRIBBS&#xD;
      coordinator to collect demographic information as well as completion of a health&#xD;
      questionnaire. Because CRIBBS is an international study and participants are geographically&#xD;
      dispersed most individuals will be interviewed using secured telephone or Internet services.&#xD;
      Participants will also be asked to complete behavioral health surveys. Health information&#xD;
      from providers and treatment facilities will be obtained with appropriate authorization. The&#xD;
      CRIBBS coordinator will conduct an annual update of health information and the behavioral&#xD;
      health surveys will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant confidentiality: Participation in CRIBBS is voluntary and every effort will&#xD;
           be made to ensure participant privacy. Interviews with participants will be carried out&#xD;
           by a CRIBBS coordinator in closed room. Personal Health Information obtained for health&#xD;
           information abstraction will be stored securely in a double locked environment and&#xD;
           destroyed following data abstraction. CRIBBS makes use primarily of an electronic&#xD;
           database which is password protected and only accessible to CRIBBS staff members.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data use: Participant information will be used to inform researchers of the natural&#xD;
           history of BBS, refine research initiatives and facilitate new therapies for individuals&#xD;
           with BBS. De-identified data will be shared with the Global Rare Diseases Registry Data&#xD;
           Repository (GRDR) maintained by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences&#xD;
           at the National Institutes of Health and with other researchers and organizations&#xD;
           approved by the CRIBBS board of directors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Registry Oversight: The Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation Institutional Review Board&#xD;
           provides oversight of the CRIBBS registry while the CRIBBS board of directors determine&#xD;
           the direction and focus of the registry.&#xD;
