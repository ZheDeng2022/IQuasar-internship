    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the success rate of bougie-guided endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation compared to blind intubation through the Air-Q intubating laryngeal mask&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After ethical committee approval and written informed consent, 140 patients of either sex, &gt;&#xD;
      18 years old, ASA physical status I and II scheduled to receive general anesthesia with&#xD;
      tracheal intubation for an elective surgical procedure will be enrolled in the study. They&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated to one of two groups according to a computer generated list of 70&#xD;
      patients each. Blind endotracheal intubation will be performed through the air-Q with bougie&#xD;
      assisted (Group B) or without assistance (Group Q). Patients ASA physical status &gt;III, mouth&#xD;
      opening &lt;2 cm, increased risk of aspiration, those with poor lung compliance, with lesions of&#xD;
      the oropharynx or epiglottis and known or anticipated difficult tracheal intubation or&#xD;
      facemask ventilation will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room, the following monitors will be attached to the patients: five leads&#xD;
      ECG, noninvasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry, ETCO2, anesthetic gas analyzer and&#xD;
      neuromuscular monitoring (Infinity Kappa, Dräger, Lübeck, Germany). After adequate&#xD;
      oxygenation, general anesthesia will be induced with 2 mg kg-1 propofol, 1-2 µg kg-1 fentanyl&#xD;
      and 0.6 mg kg-1 rocuronium. Mask-ventilation with a mixture of oxygen and sevoflurane for an&#xD;
      end-tidal concentration of 2% will be followed. The air-Q/ILA will be inserted once ulnar&#xD;
      nerve train-of-four stimulation produced no visually detectable response while the patient's&#xD;
      head in a neutral position. All airway manipulations (device insertion and tracheal&#xD;
      intubation) will be performed by a senior anesthesiology staff member. The size of the air-Q&#xD;
      will be selected on the basis of the patient's weight, in accordance with the corresponding&#xD;
      manufacturer's recommendations. If ventilation with the device is unsatisfactory, the &quot;Klein&#xD;
      maneuver&quot; corrects downfolding of the epiglottis by using a jaw thrust and an up-down&#xD;
      maneuver of the ILA. During tracheal intubation through the air-Q/ILA, the tracheal tube is&#xD;
      advanced to a depth of 12 to 15 cm so that the tip of the tube is close to the air-Q/ILA&#xD;
      opening. Intubation through these supraglottic devices will be facilitated using a&#xD;
      water-based lubricant. Then removal of the ILA immediately after tracheal intubation can be&#xD;
      assisted by a stylet produced by the manufacturer. Tracheal intubation will be successful if&#xD;
      ventilation through the tracheal tube produced an adequate chest expansion and a capnographic&#xD;
      curve is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group B, the operator gently inserts the bougie through the air-Q/ILA while looking at any&#xD;
      bulges in the neck to judge the approximate positioning of the bougie. As soon as the bougie&#xD;
      enters the trachea, a characteristic click is felt by the assistant and the operator feels&#xD;
      the bougie entering in a hallow space. Another sign for intra tracheal bougie insertion when&#xD;
      the bougie reaches the small bronchus between 30 and 40 cm marks (distal hold up sign). The&#xD;
      air-Q/ILA is then removed and a tracheal tube is railroaded over the bougie.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional single-use polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tracheal tubes (Mallinckrodt Company,&#xD;
      Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico) will be used for blind tracheal intubation in both groups: size&#xD;
      7.0 mm ID tracheal tubes for patients weighing ≥50 kg and 6.0 mm ID tubes for patients &lt;50&#xD;
      kg. In both study groups, 3 attempts at device insertion and intubation will be allowed.&#xD;
      Intubation will be only attempted if appropriate ventilation is obtained. Lung ventilation&#xD;
      through the supraglottic device is permitted between intubation attempts. If tracheal&#xD;
      intubation through the device is unsuccessful, it is performed by direct laryngoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mallampati score, mouth opening (cm), thyromental distance (cm), neck circumference (cm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Air-Q™ /ILA insertion: insertion time (seconds), ease of insertion (easy, difficult),&#xD;
           number of attempts, 1st attempt success rate and grade of ventilation (adequate,&#xD;
           possible or impossible).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tracheal intubation: number of attempts, intubation time (seconds), 1st attempt success&#xD;
           rate and overall success rate, ,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Air-Q insertion time: is the time from introducing the device in mouth till attachment&#xD;
           to the circuit and capnographic trace is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bougie insertion time: is the time from removal of the breathing circuit from air-Q to&#xD;
           the feeling of hold up sign.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ETT insertion time: is the time from insertion of the tracheal tube in the device until&#xD;
           confirmation by capnographic trace.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total intubation time in group Q (air-Q™ /ILA insertion time plus intubation time) and&#xD;
           the total intubation time in group B (air-Q™ /ILA insertion time plus bougie insertion&#xD;
           time plus bougie guided intubation time) were calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We also recorded the types of and number of adjusting maneuvers for each attempt,&#xD;
           frequency of esophageal intubation, and any incidence of hypoxia (SpO2&lt;95%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of airway complications at insertion of air-Q™ /ILA, gum elastic bougie and&#xD;
           ETT as trauma to mouth, lips or tongue and visible or occult blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of Airway Morbidity at 18-24 h postoperatively in both groups as sore throat,&#xD;
           dysphagia, dysphonia and its degree (mild/moderate/severe)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemodynamic data heart rate (HR) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) were also&#xD;
           recorded at the following time intervals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T0, baseline before induction T1, before air-Q™ insertion T2, after air-Q™ insertion T3,&#xD;
      before bougie insertion T4, after bougie insertion T5, before ETT insertion through the&#xD;
      device T6, after ETT intubation T7, 1 min after intubation T8, 5 min after intubation T9, 10&#xD;
      min after intubation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      As no previous study researching bougie guided endotracheal intubation through air-Q™, we&#xD;
      consider this research as a pilot study and 70 patients in each group is suitable. Results&#xD;
      are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or number (%). Categorical data was compared&#xD;
      using Chi square test. Variables in both groups were compared using either unpaired t test or&#xD;
      Mann Whitney test whenever it was appropriate. Intra-group comparison (within group&#xD;
      comparison) between mean values of variables measured at baseline and different times was&#xD;
      performed using repeated measures ANOVA followed by Bonferroni test if significant results&#xD;
      was recorded. Data analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences&#xD;
      (SPSS) version 19 computer program. Significance was considered when P-value ≤ 0.05.&#xD;
