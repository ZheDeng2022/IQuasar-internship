    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to evaluate the effects of different concentrations of preincisional&#xD;
      peritonsillar levobupivacaine (0.25% ve 0.5%) on postoperative pain and bleeding&#xD;

      72 ASA I-II patients between 3 and 12 years of age who scheduled to undergo tonsillectomy&#xD;
      were enrolled in this randomized, prospective and placebo-controlled study. The indications&#xD;
      for tonsillectomy were recurrent infections and tonsillar hypertrophy leading to obstructive&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included to the study were randomly assigned to one of the 3 groups to receive&#xD;
      different concentrations of levobupivacaine or saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rates (HR) of all patients were recorded during&#xD;
      the whole anesthesia and surgical procedures. The duration of anesthesia and surgery were&#xD;
      also recorded. Additional remifentanil 1 µgr kg-1 IV was administered to the patients if HR&#xD;
      was increased by 25 % of the basal value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During postoperative period, symptoms such as pain, fever and dysphagia, adverse affects such&#xD;
      as nausea and vomiting and hemorrhage were evaluated. Pain was evaluated by FLACC (Faces,&#xD;
      leg, activity, cry, consolability), FPRS (Faces pain rating scale) ve Wong-Baker facies&#xD;
      scales at postoperative 0, 30 and 60 minutes and 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours. Total analgesic&#xD;
      consumption during the postoperative period were recorded. If the patients had no&#xD;
      complication, they were discharged at the postoperative 24th hour.&#xD;
