    <textblock>
      CC-122-HCC-001 is a Phase 1b dose escalation and expansion clinical study of CC-122 in&#xD;
      combination with sorafenib for subjects with unresectable HCC who have received no prior&#xD;
      systemic therapy for HCC. The dose escalation phase of the study will explore several dose&#xD;
      levels of CC-122 in combination with sorafenib, followed by an expansion part of the study&#xD;
      using the optimal combination dose regimen.&#xD;

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of CC-122&#xD;
      administered orally in combination with sorafenib, and to define the non-tolerated dose&#xD;
      (NTD), the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study is to determine the preliminary efficacy of CC-122 in&#xD;
      combination with sorafenib, based on response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST&#xD;
      1.1)&#xD;
