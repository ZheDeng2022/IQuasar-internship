    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 3-year, multi-site, non-randomized, prospective, observational study is&#xD;
      to characterize the natural history of Pearson Syndrome. The Syndrome is a rare mitochondrial&#xD;
      disorder due to a large-scale mtDNA deletion. Children typically present in their 1st two&#xD;
      years of life (most in infancy) with anemia and/or pancreatitis. Most individuals with&#xD;
      Pearson Syndrome die in childhood. Those who survive evolve to Kearns-Sayre Syndrome/Chronic&#xD;
      Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (KSS/CPEO) although accurate survival estimates are not&#xD;
      yet known.&#xD;

      All patients with confirmed Pearson Syndrome who satisfy the inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be offered enrollment into this study. Patients followed at participating NAMDC clinical&#xD;
      sites will be enrolled at those sites. Patients who are not followed at participating NAMDC&#xD;
      clinical sites and wish to participate may contact one of the member sites directly or their&#xD;
      local doctor may direct them to one of the member sites. Both male and female patients from&#xD;
      all racial and ethnic backgrounds who satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      encouraged to participate. Children and adults will be eligible to be enrolled, but we expect&#xD;
      the patient population to be mostly children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient with Pearson Syndrome who enrolls in the NAMDC Clinical Registry will be&#xD;
      encouraged to participate in this study. Each patient enrolling in this study will be&#xD;
      required to enroll in the NAMDC Clinical Registry either prior to or upon enrolling in this&#xD;
      study. Demographic, medical history, biochemical, histological, genetic, and other clinical&#xD;
      data from the registry will be incorporated into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every effort will be made to minimize the inconvenience to patients of participating in this&#xD;
      study. The study-related activities at each patient visit will be kept to a maximum of one&#xD;
      hour, and will, whenever possible, be scheduled to coincide with the patient's regular&#xD;
      follow-up with his or her treating physician. This study is observational and has no&#xD;
      associated medical procedures.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. All individuals of any age with confirmed Pearson Syndrome are eligible to&#xD;
             participate. Pearson Syndrome requires the presence of a large-scale mtDNA deletion&#xD;
             along with sideroblastic anemia with or without pancreatic insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. All patients must agree to participate in the NAMDC Clinical Registry&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient does not fulfill criteria for Pearson Syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Not willing to participate in the NAMDC clinical Registry&#xD;
