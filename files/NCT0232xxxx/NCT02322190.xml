  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Some allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients get acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).&#xD;
      They always get steroids as the first treatment, but this may not work. Those people where&#xD;
      steroids are not enough may benefit from a treatment called extracorporeal photopheresis&#xD;
      (ECP). ECP exposes white blood cells to ultraviolet light outside the body. Researchers want&#xD;
      to study how certain markers in the blood predict the severity and outcome of acute GVHD and&#xD;
      how ECP treatments work for people with acute GVHD. They will also study how these markers in&#xD;
      the blood may help predict who should get ECP and its effects on the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn more about treatments for acute GVHD after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults with acute GVHD enrolled in an National Cancer Institute (NCI) allogeneic&#xD;
      transplantation protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transplant physicians will confirm participant eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive treatment with steroids for their acute GVHD as prescribed by&#xD;
           their transplant physician. This will continue while they are enrolled on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If steroids work in treating their acute GVHD, then every 28 days for 6 months,&#xD;
           participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If steroids do not work, participants will get additional treatments as prescribed by&#xD;
           their transplant physician who may choose to use ECP as a part of this additional&#xD;
           treatment. For ECP, blood is removed through an intravenous (IV) catheter. A machine&#xD;
           separates the white blood cells from the other blood parts. Those cells are treated with&#xD;
           methoxsalen and exposed to ultraviolet light. Then they are returned to the participant&#xD;
           through their IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who get ECP will over at least 6 months have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  veins researched. They may have a catheter placed in a larger vein in the chest or&#xD;
           groin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  multiple blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  multiple pregnancy tests (if needed).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  multiple ECP procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of ECP treatment and 6 months after ECP, participants will have additional&#xD;
           physical exams and blood tests.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) remains a difficult to manage complication of&#xD;
           allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation causing significant morbidity and&#xD;
           mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biomarkers have recently been described in acute GVHD that have the potential to better&#xD;
           predict onset, severity, steroid failure, and non-relapse mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First line treatment of acute GVHD with high dose corticosteroids will fail in&#xD;
           approximately 30% of patients and is associated with significant steroid related&#xD;
           complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No second line treatment of acute GVHD after a failure of steroids has been established&#xD;
           as a standard approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Choice of second line therapy for acute GVHD is currently based primarily on physician&#xD;
           familiarity, existing toxicities, and patient's ability to tolerate new potential&#xD;
           toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is an attractive therapy to combine with other&#xD;
           therapies for steroid refractory disease due to a unique mechanism of action involving&#xD;
           immunomodulation as well as an extremely low rate of reported side effects and&#xD;
           complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biomarkers may also prove useful in predicting the success or failure of specific&#xD;
           treatments for steroid refractory disease, including those combined with ECP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will allow for collection of biomarker data in patients undergoing allogeneic&#xD;
           transplantation on National Cancer Institute (NCI) protocols, including those who&#xD;
           develop acute GVHD and investigate their role in predicting outcomes in initial&#xD;
           corticosteroid therapy as well as in currently used treatments in the management of&#xD;
           patients with steroid refractory acute GVHD with or without the addition of ECP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To study biomarkers in patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation, with acute GVHD&#xD;
      including their ability to predict steroid refractoriness and predict outcome of investigator&#xD;
      chosen second line therapies with and without Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adult patients on an NCI allogeneic transplantation protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-randomized, single institution study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research blood for biomarkers will be collected on all patients enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECP will be offered as an addition to investigator chosen treatments in patients who&#xD;
           develop steroid refractory acute GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will enroll a total of up to 450 patients.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must be also enrolled on an National Cancer Institute (NCI) allogeneic&#xD;
             transplant protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must agree to practice effective contraception (both male and female&#xD;
             subjects, if the risk of conception exists)The effects of Extracorporeal Photopheresis&#xD;
             (ECP) on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and as well as other&#xD;
             Methoxsalen used in this trial is in a class of agents that is known to be&#xD;
             teratogenic, men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method&#xD;
             of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and for 4 months after the completion of study treatment. Should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while her partner is participating in&#xD;
             this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any physical or mental condition that, in the opinion of the principal Investigator&#xD;
             (PI), would cause the risk/benefit ratio of participation to be unacceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inclusion of ECP in the treatment of any patient is contraindicated by any of the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unstable hemodynamics requiring vasopressors or other support measures not amenable to&#xD;
             or medically appropriate for continuation during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to maintain acceptable venous access.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled or uncorrectable coagulopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from ECP because methoxsalen, an agent utilized for the&#xD;
             study procedure, may cause fetal harm. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             methoxsalen, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             methoxsalen. Pregnancy will be evaluated prior to initiation of ECP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic or idiosyncratic/hypersensitivity reactions to 8-&#xD;
             methoxypsoralen/psoralen compounds.&#xD;
