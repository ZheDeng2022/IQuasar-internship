    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is devastating both to individuals and society. In an aging population, surgery&#xD;
      is an increasing cause of chronic pain, with rates of persistent post-operative pain ranging&#xD;
      from 10-65%.In particular, Persistent Post-Mastectomy Pain (PPMP) occurs in roughly one third&#xD;
      of women who have had mastectomy. The occurrence of PPMP does not seem to be strongly&#xD;
      determined by the type of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation treatment, suggesting that&#xD;
      individual person-specific factors may play a more important role. In fact, recent studies&#xD;
      indicate that individual differences in pain sensitivity (psychophysics) are more closely&#xD;
      associated with PPMP than surgical/medical variables. Specifically, sensory testing revealed&#xD;
      that women who developed PPMP had lower pressure pain thresholds and greater temporal&#xD;
      summation of pain stimuli than women who did not develop this chronic pain condition.&#xD;
      Moreover, psychosocial factors such as anxiety, depression, catastrophizing, and somatization&#xD;
      were more prominent in women with PPMP. These preliminary, retrospective studies suggest that&#xD;
      individual psychophysical and psychosocial characteristics could be important risk factors&#xD;
      for PPMP. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to comprehensively and prospectively study&#xD;
      women having mastectomy surgery, to determine the relationship between pre-operative&#xD;
      psychophysical and psychosocial factors and the development of PPMP. Using these data, a&#xD;
      prediction model for PPMP will be developed, thus allowing a preoperative calculation of a&#xD;
      &quot;PPMP risk score&quot; for any patient facing mastectomy.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective observational study which phenotypes individuals' baseline pain,&#xD;
      psychosocial and psychophysical characteristics, then measures perioperative and long-term&#xD;
      changes to examine the relationship of psychophysical and psychosocial processing to&#xD;
      persistent post-mastectomy pain development .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative Psychophysical assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure pain testing methods: After giving informed consent, the PI or a fully trained&#xD;
      member of the research staff will administer a brief QST session. Pressure pain threshold and&#xD;
      tolerance will be assessed using a digital pressure algometer (Wagner FDX, Greenwich, CT,&#xD;
      USA) with a flat round transducer, probe area 0.785 cm2. Testing sites will be bilateral on&#xD;
      the dorsal aspect of the proximal forearm (extremity site) and over the trapezius muscle at&#xD;
      the upper back (truncal site). For pressure threshold determination, pressure is increased at&#xD;
      a steady rate of approximately 1 kg/second until subject indicates that the pressure is first&#xD;
      perceived as painful. Pressure pain tolerance will be determined by instructing patients to&#xD;
      indicate the pressure at which the pain was no longer tolerable. Two trials will be performed&#xD;
      at each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temporal Summation testing methods: Mechanical pinprick pain will be assessed using&#xD;
      standardized weighted pinprick applicators similar to those described by Rolke et al99 of two&#xD;
      designated forces (256mN and 512mN) which result in a painful sensation in most&#xD;
      subjects.1-2,100 First, a single stimulation of the lower force pinprick will be applied to&#xD;
      the dorsal aspect of the index finger between the first and second interphalangeal joints of&#xD;
      the each hand while resting palm down on the armrest, and then rated by the subject on a&#xD;
      scale of 0-10. Next, after a break of at least 10 seconds, a train of 10 stimuli will be&#xD;
      applied at the same premarked spot, at a rate of 1 stimulation/second. The subject will rate&#xD;
      pain on a scale of 0-10 after the first, fifth and tenth stimulus, then rate any ongoing pain&#xD;
      15 and 30 seconds after cessation of the last stimulus. The same procedure will be repeated&#xD;
      using the higher force pinprick on the third finger of the each hand. Subjects will undergo&#xD;
      two trials at each force, with a break of at least one minute between trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychosocial Assessment: Preoperative demographic, medical, psychosocial and pain&#xD;
      questionnaires will be completed by the patient during their preoperative office visit.&#xD;
      Questionnaires assessing psychosocial factors are chosen based upon previous association with&#xD;
      PPMP, strong psychometric validation characteristics, and brevity. The Pain Catastrophizing&#xD;
      Scale (PCS), which has been validated in pain patients and controls, will be used to measure&#xD;
      catastrophic thinking associated with pain. Depressive symptoms, anxiety and sleep&#xD;
      disturbance will be assessed using short-form instruments from the NIH roadmap initiative,&#xD;
      Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS), which have been extensively&#xD;
      validated in studies comparing results with established scales, and have been calibrated on&#xD;
      over 20,000 persons. The Brief Symptom Index 18-Somatization Scale, also previously validated&#xD;
      in chronic pain patients,107 will be used to measure somatization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain assessment: The primary pain outcome measure will be Pain Burden Index as measured by&#xD;
      the Breast Cancer Pain Questionnaire (BCPQ), which was originally developed by Gartner et al&#xD;
      and used in over 600 patients in our previous studies. The BCPQ includes assessment of&#xD;
      average pain, pain frequency (how many days/week), and pain location (breast, arm, side,&#xD;
      axilla), from which an Pain Burden Index (PBI) can be calculated. The BCPQ also includes&#xD;
      questions about other body pain, seeking medical help for pain, and painkiller use. We will&#xD;
      also use the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), a well-validated general measure of pain and&#xD;
      disability worst pain, least pain, and interference. We will supplement this with questions&#xD;
      assessing pain with and without movement. We will assess for neuropathic character of pain&#xD;
      using the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (S-LANSS).1 The Pain Coping&#xD;
      Questionnaire will be administered to prospectively assay for effective coping strategies&#xD;
      used by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical, Anesthetic and Surgical Assessment: Medical variables, including patient's&#xD;
      functional status, will be assessed at the preoperative visit. Using the Weiner preoperative&#xD;
      evaluation center email alert system, the hands-on anesthetist and/or anesthesiologist will&#xD;
      be contacted to inform them on the patient's participation in the study. In order to assess&#xD;
      and adjust for potential impact of anesthetic technique or pharmacological agents on PPMP,&#xD;
      the following data will be collected on the day of surgery: Primary anesthetic method&#xD;
      (volatile agent vs. IV propofol vs. regional/paravertebral), amount and type of local&#xD;
      anesthetic administered, and amount of opioids used (the latter expressed as morphine&#xD;
      equivalent units/hr). In addition, information about other relevant analgesic preoperative or&#xD;
      intraoperative medications will be gathered. Other potentially confounding intraoperative&#xD;
      factors such as vasopressor use/amount, fluids or blood administered, total anesthesia time,&#xD;
      etc. will be recorded. Among this group of breast surgeons, there is relative homogeneity in&#xD;
      anatomical technique and tissue disturbance, although there is some variation in dissection&#xD;
      technique. Detailed assessment of surgical technique will include primary surgeon, duration&#xD;
      of surgery, presence of bilateral surgery, type of surgery (total mastectomy, segmental&#xD;
      mastectomy), performance of nodal dissection (axillary or sentinel node), mass of breast&#xD;
      tissue excised, length of incision, predominant mode of dissection, nerve handling, and&#xD;
      presence and type of reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative acute pain assessment: Initial pain score upon arrival will be assessed by PACU&#xD;
      nursing staff and/or anesthetist. One hour after PACU arrival, patient will be assessed by&#xD;
      research study personnel, being asked to rate pain at rest, with arm movement, and with&#xD;
      maximal deep inspiration using the pain verbal rating scale (VRS). The Perioperative Pain&#xD;
      Service, which is comprised of acute pain specialists, anesthesia residents, and a nurse&#xD;
      practitioner, rounds on postoperative patients on Post-op Day (POD) 0 and 1. Accordingly,&#xD;
      pain scores at rest, with arm movement and with deep inspiration at these two timepoints will&#xD;
      be assessed. In addition, opioid consumption and adjuvant analgesic use will be assessed.&#xD;
      Upon discharge, which is typically on POD1 or 2, total postoperative opioid use/hours of&#xD;
      postoperative time as inpatient will be calculated and expressed in morphine equivalent&#xD;
      units/hr. On postoperative day 1, patients will undergo brief bedside QST (as at preoperative&#xD;
      evaluation, described above), PCS, and Coping Strategies Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative follow-up and assessment of subacute and persistent pain, changes in&#xD;
      psychosocial and psychophysical functioning: Follow up assessments will be made at 2 weeks, 3&#xD;
      mo, 6 mo, and 1 year. Patients are seen by the primary surgeon or nurse practitioner, as well&#xD;
      as by collaborator Ann Partridge and other oncologists at these times. In collaboration with&#xD;
      these practitioners, we will assess patients' degree of persistent pain using the BCPQ, BPI&#xD;
      and VRS. Additionally, the brief QST and psychosocial questionnaires will be re-administered&#xD;
      at 6 months and 1 year postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of sample for future genetic testing: In order to obtain genetic information about&#xD;
      particular sites of variability that may impact post-surgical pain, we will collect saliva&#xD;
      samples from using the Oragene Self-Collection kit. This procedure is non-invasive, safe,&#xD;
      effective, and widely used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The primary outcome measure will be the calculated Pain Burden Index&#xD;
      (PBI) at 1 year post-mastectomy. The PBI at one year post-mastectomy will be tested for&#xD;
      significant associations with potentially predictive preoperatively assessed variables&#xD;
      (psychophysical (QST), psychosocial, demographic, functional, medical and surgical variables)&#xD;
      using t-tests for categorical predictors and linear regression for continuous predictors.&#xD;
      Results of all tests will be summarized with descriptive statistics and both unadjusted&#xD;
      p-values and p-values adjusted using Holm's procedure to control the family-wise error rate.&#xD;
      In terms of data management and analysis, attention will be paid to identification of&#xD;
      multi-colinearity among covariates, and redundant factors may be eliminated from further&#xD;
      multivariable analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis: Using our cross sectional data, in which roughly 35% of patients experienced&#xD;
      persistent post-mastectomy pain beyond 1 year after mastectomy, a calculated effect size&#xD;
      between pain and no pain groups for each of the psychosocial and psychophysical variables was&#xD;
      determined. Effect sizes, which we assume will be similar in the proposed study, ranged from&#xD;
      0.06 to 0.70. With 200 patients we will have 80% power at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 to&#xD;
      detect effect sizes of 0.40 or greater, which were observed in 7 of the variables considered.&#xD;
      Further corroborating the feasibility of adequate power with a sample size of 200, several&#xD;
      smaller studies have also detected differences in QST between patients with and without&#xD;
      chronic postsurgical pain after thoracotomy, shoulder surgery, and surgery to correct chest&#xD;
      wall deformation.&#xD;
