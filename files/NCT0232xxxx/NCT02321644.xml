  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, phase 1 study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of&#xD;
      multiple doses of CC-90001 and the effects of food and formulation on the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      single dose CC-90001 in healthy subjects. Part 1 involves the exposure of subjects to the&#xD;
      minimum amount of UV-B light that causes minimally perceptible skin reddening. This will take&#xD;
      place before dosing (baseline) and 3 times more while on increasing doses of CC-90001. Punch&#xD;
      biopsies of the exposed areas will be taken and assessed for c-Jun terminal kinase activity.&#xD;
      Part 2 involves evaluation of changes in pharmacokinetics of 2 formulations of CC-90001 when&#xD;
      administered in the fasted state and after a high-fat meal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 is an open-label, multiple-dose, 3-period, fixed-sequence study, to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of CC-90001 on JNK activity following UV irradiation. On the first day prior to dosing&#xD;
      (baseline), and on the 6th day of each dosing period (Days 6, 12, and 18), twice the MED&#xD;
      intensity of UV light will be administered to delineated sites on the subjects' buttocks. The&#xD;
      irradiation at baseline (Day -1) should be administered at approximately the same time that&#xD;
      irradiation is scheduled on Days 6, 12, and 18, which is at 2 hours post dose. Eight hours&#xD;
      after UV irradiation, a skin punch biopsy will be taken from the UV exposure site. The end of&#xD;
      confinement will be Day 19. The follow-up visit will occur 7-10 days (ie, Day 25 to Day 28)&#xD;
      following the last dose in Period 3. An early termination (ET) visit will occur within 10&#xD;
      days of the day of discontinuation. The MED will be determined within 10 days of dosing in&#xD;
      Period 1. All subjects will receive the following doses of CC-90001 in the fixed sequence&#xD;
      below: Treatment A: 60 mg CC-90001 as AIC, QD x 6 days; Treatment B: 160 mg CC-90001 as AIC,&#xD;
      QD x 6 days; and Treatment C: 400 mg of CC-90001 as AIC, QD x 6 days. Subjects will be&#xD;
      confined at the unit from Day -1 until discharge on Day 19 after all safety assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2 subjects will be assigned randomly to one of three dosing sequences during which&#xD;
      they will receive one of the following dosing regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment D: 2 x 100 mg CC-90001 as AIC, single oral dose administered under fasted&#xD;
           conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment E: 1 x 200 mg CC-90001 [formulated tablet(s)] single oral dose administered&#xD;
           under fasted conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment F: 1 x 200 mg CC-90001 [formulated tablet(s)] single oral dose administered&#xD;
           under fed conditions (standard high fat breakfast).&#xD;
