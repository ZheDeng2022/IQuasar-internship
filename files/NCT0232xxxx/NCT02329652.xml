      The goal of this project is to restore these multiple functions to these individuals through&#xD;
      a comprehensive neuroprosthetic approach that addresses the overall needs of the individual.&#xD;
      This approach involves all aspects of the implementation, including the implanted technology,&#xD;
      the surgical installation, and the outcomes assessment through a coordinated team approach in&#xD;
      order to maximize the functional independence gained by the individual. With this system, we&#xD;
      propose that individuals who have a mid-cervical-level spinal cord injury will regain control&#xD;
      over multiple functions, including grasp, reach, bed mobility, seated posture, restoration of&#xD;
      an effective cough and bladder function. This ambitious and exciting goal is made possible by&#xD;
      the culmination of our research and clinical deployment of neuroprosthetic systems for spinal&#xD;
      cord injured subjects over the past 30 years. We anticipate that this system will not only&#xD;
      provide increased independence in each of the targeted body functions, but will provide&#xD;
      enough of an overall benefit to demonstrate significant improvements in quality of life and&#xD;
      health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical feasibility studies with spinal cord injured subjects, our clinical research&#xD;
      teams have demonstrated the control of bilateral hand function, bed mobility, postural&#xD;
      control, restoration of an effective cough, and bladder control using chronically implanted&#xD;
      neuroprostheses. Outcomes from each clinical study demonstrate that each system provides&#xD;
      increased functional independence to the individual. Initially, only a single type of&#xD;
      implanted system was implemented in any one individual, resulting in restoration of a single&#xD;
      bodily function. Thus, it has been necessary for subjects to choose between available&#xD;
      functions and select only one, despite the fact that each subject had multiple disabilities.&#xD;
      In the past few years, we have progressed to implementing a few subjects with more than one&#xD;
      system, such as providing both hand function and trunk stability. However, the fundamental&#xD;
      limitation of the current approach has been technological; i.e. each implanted system is&#xD;
      completely independent (both technically and programmatically), requiring separate technology&#xD;
      to be developed for each function, and these systems are implemented by separate teams in&#xD;
      separate surgical procedures. Thus, to this point, it has not been possible to address each&#xD;
      individual's comprehensive needs and tailor an overall approach that maximizes their&#xD;
      functional gains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed approach depends on the availability of a foundational platform technology that&#xD;
      is capable of meeting our broad specifications. We have now achieved this milestone under&#xD;
      separate funding, creating a revolutionary new implantable neuroprosthetic technology that is&#xD;
      fully capable of providing the necessary technological base for our proposed research. This&#xD;
      system, the Networked Neuroprosthetic System (NNPS), is a modular, scalable, and configurable&#xD;
      network of fully implanted, networked modules capable of meeting or exceeding the needs of&#xD;
      all of these neuroprosthetic applications. The NNPS provides a foundation which enables&#xD;
      efficient technical refinements that optimize implementation of the system for each targeted&#xD;
      application. The NNPS technology is currently operational and is undergoing fabrication and&#xD;
      testing in preparation for final pre-clinical studies and human implantation.&#xD;
