  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Niacin is a vitamin in many foods, including meats, fish, fruits, and vegetables. It is&#xD;
      often used as a dietary supplement that causes many improvements in the body. Researchers&#xD;
      think it can affect heart health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To better understand the good effects of niacin supplementation on cholesterol, fat&#xD;
      metabolism, and vascular health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults 18 years of age and older with fasting good cholesterol (HDL-C) below 60 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will come to the clinic 4 times during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will complete a 7-day food journal before visits 1 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At visit 1, participants will be screened with questions about their diet and exercise,&#xD;
           medical history, and any drugs and vitamins they take. Vital signs and body mass index&#xD;
           will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will have a Cardio-Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI) test of the arteries. Blood pressure&#xD;
           will be taken in the arms and legs and the heart will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood will be drawn. Participants will fast for 8 12 hours before this.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women will have a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will get a 2-week supply of niacin. They will take 2 tablets daily&#xD;
           for one week, then 4 daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2 will be 2 weeks after visit 1 and the niacin dose will be increased. Visit 3&#xD;
           will be 16 weeks after visit 1, and participants will stop taking niacin. Visit 4 will&#xD;
           be 4 6 weeks after stopping niacin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During study visits, participants will repeat visit 1 tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single center clinical pilot study will investigate the effects of niacin on blood&#xD;
      lipids and lipoprotein composition in human subjects who are healthy. Niacin (vitamin B3 or&#xD;
      nicotinic acid) is a common nutrient found in many foods and is currently sold over the&#xD;
      counter as a nutritional supplement. Extended-release versions of niacin are available over&#xD;
      the counter (e.g., Slo-Niacin) or by prescription (Niaspan) and help to alleviate symptoms of&#xD;
      flushing associated with larger doses of the vitamin. Studies of the effects of niacin&#xD;
      therapy on clinical lipid measures consistently indicate a shift toward a healthier&#xD;
      lipoprotein profile with increased HDL-C and decreases in both triglyceride and LDL-C.&#xD;
      Despite this favorable shift in lipid profile, cardiovascular outcome studies on patients&#xD;
      receiving niacin alone or in combination with statin therapy have resulted in mixed results&#xD;
      creating uncertainty of the value of niacin therapy. The proposed study will examine in&#xD;
      detail the effects of niacin therapy on lipoprotein composition and function, while also&#xD;
      tracking measures of vascular health.&#xD;
