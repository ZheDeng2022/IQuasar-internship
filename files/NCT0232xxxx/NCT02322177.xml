      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People with inborn errors of metabolism can t turn food into energy the right way. This can&#xD;
      affect a person s growth and health. Researchers want to know how this condition affects a&#xD;
      pregnant woman and her baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect data from the medical records of women with an inborn error of metabolism. Also,&#xD;
      to create a pregnancy registry of inborn errors of metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women with an inborn error of metabolism who either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have been pregnant in the past,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  are currently pregnant, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have recently talked with their doctor about becoming pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will collect data only. No extra tests will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be in the study for the length of their pregnancy and for 1 year after&#xD;
           delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will answer questions about their family s health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant s doctor will send their medical records to researchers. These may&#xD;
           include data about:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Last health care visit before pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, urine, ultrasound, or lab results during pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Delivery and recovery after delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will ask for the test(s) used to confirm pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the participant has her baby, researchers will ask for data about how the baby is&#xD;
           doing. This may include when the baby is sitting, walking, talking, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The data will be placed into a database. The database will not include the participant s&#xD;
           name or identifying data.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Women with inherited metabolic disorders are reaching child bearing age more often due to&#xD;
      advances in early diagnosis and improved pediatric care. For many of these disorders, there&#xD;
      is very little information in the literature to guide the counseling and treatment of these&#xD;
      patients and their pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most information for the effects of an underlying inborn error of metabolism in pregnancy&#xD;
      derives from the study of phenylketonuria (PKU). From the knowledge gained through the&#xD;
      collection of information from multiple cases of pregnancy affected by PKU, important&#xD;
      management issues were identified. For example, children born to mothers with an unrestricted&#xD;
      diet were substantially more likely to have intellectual disability, microcephaly, and low&#xD;
      birth weights than women who maintained a phenylalanine restricted diet. The excess&#xD;
      phenylalanine poses long-term health risks to the developing fetus and now a vigilant&#xD;
      metabolic approach is recognized as mandatory in women with PKU desiring pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to PKU, most or all other intermediary metabolic disorders have been understudied.&#xD;
      For example, there are nine published cases of methylmalonic academia (MMA) in pregnancy and&#xD;
      one case of cobalamin C deficiency in pregnancy, and review articles have reported the same&#xD;
      cases. For other inborn errors of metabolism there is even less published or known. The&#xD;
      paucity of publication of pregnancy in IEMs other than PKU may be due to the lack of&#xD;
      organized research to address pregnancy management in metabolic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to establish a pregnancy registry of women with inborn errors&#xD;
      of metabolism other than PKU. We will collect management plans, baseline laboratory values,&#xD;
      prenatal and postpartum course including metabolic and obstetrical issues, and fetal/neonatal&#xD;
      outcomes. This study will also investigate reproductive issues including infertility and use&#xD;
      of artificial reproductive technologies. A registry of this type will allow physicians and&#xD;
      patients to report varying management and outcomes, both positive and negative, with the&#xD;
      broader goal of delineating optimal maternal and fetal outcomes for these unique patient&#xD;
      populations. Our registry data would also serve as a vehicle to disseminate management&#xD;
      experience for all providers, recognizing that individual centers may not have sufficient&#xD;
      experience to make accurate management decisions on their own.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients clinically diagnosed with methylmalonic acidemia or another inborn error of&#xD;
             metabolism are eligible to participate; mutational and enzymatic status is preferred&#xD;
             but not required. Biochemical testing is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women with inborn errors of metabolism who have had a clinically documented prior&#xD;
             pregnancy, currently are pregnant or planning a pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with phenylketonuria or hyperphenylalaninemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anyone unwilling to provide informed consent (for themselves as adults, or on behalf&#xD;
             of their children as minors) or assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical condition(s) or mental retardation are not in themselves reason for exclusion&#xD;
             if in the judgment of the referring physician this would involve no more than minimal&#xD;
             risk. We will make every effort to explain the study for the purpose of assent in a&#xD;
             manner that the family feels is both age and developmentally appropriate for that&#xD;
             individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will review a clinical description from the referring physician about a potential&#xD;
             research subject to determine that the subject is appropriate to enter into the study.&#xD;
             We reserve the right to exclude cases that are not definitively diagnosed by&#xD;
             metabolites and/or molecular genetics or related to our direct research interests. We&#xD;
             expect this to be a rare minority.&#xD;
