&#xD;
          2. Patient with histologically-confirmed Stage IV malignant metastatic adenocarcinoma of&#xD;
             the pancreas; (a) who has relapsed from or is refractory to standard therapy and for&#xD;
             whom no therapy exists that would be curative or might provide significant benefit or&#xD;
             (b) who are intolerant to or refuse standard chemotherapy and, therefore, for whom&#xD;
             experimental therapy is a reasonable option.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has measurable disease, as determined by the Investigator using RECIST,&#xD;
             version 1.1, as determined within 28 days before baseline (C1D1).&#xD;

             pre-disease activities without restriction) or 1 (unable to perform physically&#xD;
             strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary&#xD;
             nature), as assessed on C1D1, before the first dose of PBI 05204.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has a predicted life-expectancy of ≥3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient has adequate bone marrow function defined as:&#xD;

          7. Patient has adequate hepatic function defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin within normal limits (WNL) for the institution, unless the&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤2.0 x the&#xD;
                  institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), or, in patients with known liver&#xD;

                  and compliant with a medically-approved contraceptive regimen during and for 3&#xD;
                  months after the treatment period or documented to be surgically sterile&#xD;
                  (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or&#xD;
                  postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea for ≥12 consecutive months; or receiving&#xD;

                  3 months after the treatment period or documented to be surgically sterile. Men&#xD;
                  whose sexual partners are of child-bearing potential must agree to use a&#xD;
                  medically-approved contraceptive regimen during the study and for 3 months after&#xD;
                  the treatment period.&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Patient is willing and able to participate in the study and comply with all study&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient has uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Myocardial infarction within 6 months before C1D1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uncontrolled angina within 3 months before C1D1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Congestive heart failure, defined as New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II,&#xD;
                  within 3 months before C1D1 (see Appendix 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diagnosed or suspected congenital long QT syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any history of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (such as&#xD;
                  ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, Wolff-Parkinson-White [WPW]&#xD;
                  syndrome, or torsade de pointes), or prolonged QTc interval on pre-entry ECG&#xD;
                  (&gt;450 msec). If the automated reading is prolonged (i.e., &gt;450 msec), the ECG&#xD;
                  should be manually over-read.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any history of second- or third-degree heart block. (Patients with pacemakers may&#xD;
                  be eligible.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Heart rate &lt;50 bpm during screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg systolic and &gt;100 mmHg&#xD;
                  diastolic).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient requires the use of concomitant medications that are contraindicated with&#xD;
             cardiac glycosides and/or are known to prolong the QT/QTc interval during study&#xD;
             participation (see Appendix 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has evidence of uncontrolled malabsorptive diarrhea that would prevent&#xD;
             adequate absorption of PBI 05204.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit the understanding or&#xD;
             rendering of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has uncontrolled or severe intercurrent medical condition (including&#xD;
             uncontrolled brain metastases). Patients with stable brain metastases either treated&#xD;
             or being treated with a stable dose of steroids/anticonvulsants are allowed provided&#xD;
             there is no dose change within 4 weeks before the first dose of PBI 05204, and no&#xD;
             anticipated dose change during study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient underwent major surgery within 4 weeks before the first dose of PBI 05204 or&#xD;
             received cancer-directed therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy,&#xD;
             biologic or immunotherapy, etc.) or an investigational drug or device within 4 weeks&#xD;
             (6 weeks for mitomycin C, nitrosoureas, and liposomal doxorubicin) or 5 half-lives of&#xD;
             that agent (whichever is shorter) before the first dose of PBI 05204. (For agents in&#xD;
             which the total of 5 half-lives is &lt;10 days, there must be a minimum of 10 days&#xD;
             between termination of the investigational drug and administration of PBI 05204). Note&#xD;
             that prior liver-directed therapies will be permitted (i.e., chemoembolization,&#xD;
             radioembolization), as long as target lesions in the liver have demonstrated growth&#xD;
             after the liver-directed treatment. Any drug-related toxicity, with the exception of&#xD;
             alopecia, should have recovered to ≤ Grade 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. If female, patient is pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient has evidence of a serious active infection (e.g., infection requiring&#xD;
             treatment with intravenous antibiotics).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient has known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B or C infection, as&#xD;
             such patients may be at increased risk for toxicity due to concomitant treatment, and&#xD;
             disease-related symptoms may preclude accurate assessment of the safety of PBI 05204.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient has an important medical illness or abnormal laboratory finding that, in the&#xD;
             Investigator's opinion, would increase the risk of participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patient has a history of other malignancy treated with curative intent within the&#xD;
             previous 5 years with the exception of adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Patients with previous invasive cancers are eligible&#xD;
             if the treatment was completed more than 5 years prior to initiating current study&#xD;
             treatment, and there is no evidence of recurrent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patient was previously exposed to PBI 05204.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patient has a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar&#xD;
             chemical or biologic composition to PBI-05204 (i.e., cardiac glycoside compounds).&#xD;
