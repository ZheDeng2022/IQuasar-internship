      The development of tools for assessment and management of pain in newborns and children is a&#xD;
      high priority and represents a significant unmet need. The inadequate treatment of pain and&#xD;
      the overuse of analgesics can cause harmful consequences for neonates, infants, and children.&#xD;
      To accomplish successful pain management in children one must first objectively assess pain.&#xD;
      Thus, to address these critical issues with pain management, the Human Algometer and methods&#xD;
      are under development by Drs. Julia Finkel and Zena Quezado, Pain Medicine Program (SZI) at&#xD;
      Children's National Medical Center.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is generally recognized that pain assessment and management in newborns and children is an&#xD;
      unmet need. According to the American Medical Association, &quot;The pediatric population is at&#xD;
      risk of inadequate pain management, with age-related factors affecting pain management in&#xD;
      children. Children are often given minimal or no analgesia for procedures that would&#xD;
      routinely be treated aggressively in adults. Although much is now known about pain management&#xD;
      in children, it has not been widely or effectively translated into routine clinical&#xD;
      practice.&quot;1 Although some clinically validated methods exist (e.g. CRIES, PPIP, Faces, etc.),&#xD;
      no &quot;gold standard&quot; of pain assessment has been adopted in clinical practice. All are hindered&#xD;
      by ambiguous behavioral correlates to the pain stimuli standards as well as the subjective&#xD;
      variability inherent in both clinical and parent evaluators 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other apparatus/methods for pain assessment suffer from similar shortcomings. For example,&#xD;
      pain tolerance threshold (PTT) and current perception threshold (CPT) determinations both&#xD;
      rely on verbal response from a patient. Those determinations are subjective and&#xD;
      semi-quantitative and use electrical stimulation to directly excite both large and small&#xD;
      diameter sensory nerve fibers. The CPT determination represents the minimum amount of a&#xD;
      potentially noxious electrical stimulus that can be perceived, while the PTT determination&#xD;
      represents the maximum amount of noxious electrical stimulation that can be tolerated when&#xD;
      used as a clinical diagnostic tool. Thus, PTT depends on a subject's verbal response and&#xD;
      requires patient exposure to aversive electrical stimulation, which causes both undesirable&#xD;
      discomfort but also elicits the affective component of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the development of tools for assessment and management of pain in newborns and&#xD;
      children is a high priority and represents a significant unmet medical need. Both&#xD;
      inadequately treated pain or over administration of analgesics can have deleterious&#xD;
      physiologic consequences for neonates, infants and children. While a number of methods are in&#xD;
      use, no &quot;gold standard&quot; for pain assessment exists. (Anand 2007) To accomplish meaningful&#xD;
      pain management in children one must first be able to objectively assess pain, particularly&#xD;
      in patients who are (1) non-verbal (e.g. neonates, infants), (2) lacking understanding and&#xD;
      adequate verbalization skills (e.g. young children, developmentally disabled individuals) and&#xD;
      (3) patients with compromising neuropathic clinical presentations. To address these critical&#xD;
      issues with pain management, the Human Algometer and method are under development by Drs.&#xD;
      Finkel and Quezado from the Pain Medicine Program at the Sheikh Zayed Institute. In brief,&#xD;
      this device integrates a neurospecific neurostimulation of sensory nerve fibers involved in&#xD;
      pain response and near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS) signal acquisition derived from pain&#xD;
      related hemodynamic changes in the somatosensory cortex. The device has the ability to&#xD;
      collect data on the NIRS response in the cerebral cortex to noxious stimulation provided by&#xD;
      the neurostimulation component. Signal processing of data from this trial and subsequent&#xD;
      trials will result in (1) the detection and optimization of a NIRS signal specific to&#xD;
      increased neuronal blood flow over the somatosensory cortex (nociceptive response) and the&#xD;
      frontal cortex (affective component). The individual neurostimulatory and NIRS signal&#xD;
      acquisition components integrated into this novel device are based in part or whole on&#xD;
      previously FDA approved devices from Neurotron, Inc. and Covidien plc (former Somanetics&#xD;
      INVOS ™) respectively.&#xD;
