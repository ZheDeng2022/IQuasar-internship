      The proposed study is a randomized, double-blinded clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      a course of laser therapy on peripheral neuropathic pain in persons with diabetes.&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-months followup, and the&#xD;
      study will consist of two treatment arms, including: (a) twice-per-week laser treatment for 4&#xD;
      weeks and once-per-week laser treatment for 8 weeks or (b) same treatment schedule sham (or&#xD;
      placebo) for 12 weeks. Additionally, the study will examine inflammatory markers, functional&#xD;
      status, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. Change from baseline in self-reported pain in a sample of adults with&#xD;
      diabetes at their last visit and at 3 months. Hypothesis 1: The laser therapy will produce&#xD;
      significant improvement at post-intervention and three-month followup on measures of&#xD;
      self-reported pain among adults with diabetes. Specific Aim 2: Decrease biochemical markers&#xD;
      of inflammation by investigating levels of cytokines. Hypothesis 2: The laser therapy will&#xD;
      produce significant improvement at post-intervention and three-month followup on levels of&#xD;
      inflammatory markers.Specific Aim 3: Improve quality of life. Hypothesis 3: The laser therapy&#xD;
      will produce significant improvement at post-intervention and three-month followup on quality&#xD;
      of life.No substantial psychological, medical, or social risks exist to the participants,&#xD;
      other than minor discomfort associated with the venipuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although all measures to protect confidentiality will be put in place, the possibility exists&#xD;
      that electronic data could be jeopardized. In the remote case that such event occurs, it will&#xD;
      be immediately reported to the IRB.The proper use of the LiteCure LightForce FX Therapy Laser&#xD;
      class IV laser therapy device should be harmless and presents no different risks than similar&#xD;
      laser therapy devices currently on the market. At the time of this submission, no serious&#xD;
      adverse events have been reported to the company or the regulatory authority by consumers.&#xD;
      All study personnel will complete detailed training in the use of the device and will follow&#xD;
      the directions of the manufacturer for operating the device; all instructions for use of the&#xD;
      device will be followed for each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As reported by LiteCure Medical the LiteCure LightForce FX therapy laser device has been&#xD;
      cleared by the FDA, tested according IEC electrical safety standards for medical devices, and&#xD;
      manufactured in an ISO13485 compliant facility. These certifications ensure that LiteCure&#xD;
      Medical devices are manufactured in state of the art facilities, under strict quality&#xD;
      control, and environmental protection standards. Participants will incur no additional&#xD;
      appreciable psychological or social risks by participating in this study. The process of&#xD;
      interviewing during the assessment may cause discomfort. Discomfort or fatigue may also be&#xD;
      experienced in completing the assessment battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information obtained in this study will help in determining the efficacy of using a class&#xD;
      IV laser therapy device for neuropathic pain, inflammation, and quality of life in persons&#xD;
      with diabetic distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy. By participating in the study, subjects&#xD;
      may feel less pain, have lower inflammation, and experience improved quality of life. The&#xD;
      minimal risk of participating in this study is reasonable because of the potential benefit&#xD;
      gained in pain status, inflammatory status, and quality of life.&#xD;
