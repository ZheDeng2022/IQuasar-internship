  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety is the most prevalent form of children's mental health problems and demand far&#xD;
      exceeds treatment availability. Even when children do have access to care, evidence-based&#xD;
      treatments such as cognitive-behavioural therapy have several limitations: they are largely&#xD;
      didactic, leaving children unmotivated and disengaged; children get little practice in using&#xD;
      the skills they are taught, creating a large gap between their knowledge and their everyday&#xD;
      behaviour and therapy is costly, often prohibitive for the children that most need it.&#xD;
      Therapeutic video games can address each of these gaps: they are engaging contexts through&#xD;
      which children practice skills (rather than memorize lessons), and they cost substantially&#xD;
      less than conventional approaches. The proposed research will test the effectiveness of&#xD;
      MindLight, an innovative video game that targets childhood anxiety problems. MindLight&#xD;
      incorporates several evidence-based strategies including relaxation and exposure techniques,&#xD;
      attention bias modification methods, and neurofeedback mechanics that together produce an&#xD;
      immersive game world through which children learn to manage and overcome anxiety symptoms.&#xD;
      Two randomized controlled studies with 8-16 year old children are proposed to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of MindLight in reducing anxiety: the first is a prevention study aimed at&#xD;
      children at risk for developing serious anxiety problems and the second is a clinical trial&#xD;
      aimed at decreasing symptoms in anxiety-disordered children. Children randomly assigned to&#xD;
      the intervention group will play MindLight for 5 hours over 2-3 weeks; control participants&#xD;
      in the prevention sample will play a commercial video game with a similar theme for the same&#xD;
      amount of time whereas control participants in the clinical sample will use an online&#xD;
      cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) program. Both studies will assess children's anxiety&#xD;
      levels before the intervention, just after, and at a 3-month follow-up. Moderators (e.g.,&#xD;
      comorbidities) and mediators (e.g., attention biases) will be assessed to identify potential&#xD;
      mechanisms of change associated with successful intervention effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the next two years, the investigators will be collecting data on two samples, henceforth&#xD;
      identified as the Clinical Sample and Prevention Sample. The laboratory protocol (pre, post,&#xD;
      and follow-up) is the same for each; however the screening and recruitment are not. In this&#xD;
      section, only those procedures and methods of the lab visit that are common to both are&#xD;
      described. Next the video game intervention procedures are described. Participant and&#xD;
      recruitment details are in subsequent sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will visit the Adolescent Dynamics Lab three times (pre, post, and&#xD;
      follow-up) with only minor differences where noted. Parents will accompany children to the&#xD;
      lab and, following the completion of consent forms (pre only), complete a set of&#xD;
      questionnaires via computer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child report:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spence Child Anxiety Scale (SCAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)- emotional symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Top Problems questionnaire (TP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coping Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (SEQ-C)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parent report:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics (including what interventions for child's mental health have been tried)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SCAS (report on child)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire - emotional symptoms (report on child)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS21, report on self)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires at Post are the same as Pre and Follow-up except for addition of Video game&#xD;
      evaluation (child report).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once questionnaires are completed, the child participant will have sensors for&#xD;
      psychophysiological recording attached by a female experimenter. First, two sensors for&#xD;
      recording electrodermal response (aka galvanic skin response or skin conductance) will be&#xD;
      attached to the tips of the second and third finger of the non-dominant hand. Children's&#xD;
      fingers will be wiped clean before applying a dab of conducting gel on the two fingers and&#xD;
      affixing the sensors with Velcro straps firmly but not uncomfortably. Next, two sticker&#xD;
      electrodes for measuring electrocardiogram signals (e.g., heart rate) are applied in a&#xD;
      Lead-II configuration: one affixed just below the right collarbone and the other on the side&#xD;
      of the torso near the lower left rib. These circular stickers (about the size of a Loonie)&#xD;
      have a metal nub to which wires are affixed via clips. Finally, a respiration belt is wrapped&#xD;
      around the torso below the breast or pectoral muscle outside of the clothing. The belt is&#xD;
      elastic and registers the expansion and contraction due to respiration. All three measurement&#xD;
      devices are attached to a Biopac TEL-100 battery pack attached to the back of the&#xD;
      participant's chair. This device is then attached to a computer in the adjacent room via the&#xD;
      Biopac MP-150 amplifier. Physiological signals are recorded using AcqKnowledge 4.2 software&#xD;
      from Biopac. The child and parent will be able to observe the signals as they will be&#xD;
      recorded via a monitor in the observation room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the sensors and physiological recording has been set up, the parent will be asked to&#xD;
      leave the room and wait in a room nearby until the child has completed the tasks. The&#xD;
      sequence of tasks is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline Physiology (3 tasks): (a) equipment baseline: watch a neutral film to allow the&#xD;
           measurements to settle(2 minutes), (b) paced breathing to get resting respiratory sinus&#xD;
           arrhythmia (RSA; a measure of parasympathetic activity) while participants breathe in&#xD;
           and out in synch with a bar that goes up and down at 9 cycles per minute displayed on a&#xD;
           monitor (2 minutes), and (c) pre-task baseline for calculating reactivity to social and&#xD;
           cognitive stress (2 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Attention bias task: dot probe task. (5 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Social Stress Task: spontaneous speech on any topic of the child's choosing (3 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quick self-report of feelings (&lt; 1 minute)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Recovery 1: participant sits alone in the observation room quietly to assess return to&#xD;
           baseline levels of arousal (3 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Cognitive Stress Task: counting backwards by 7's from 2148. Incorrect answers will&#xD;
           require the participant to start over from the beginning (2 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Recovery 2: participant sits alone in the observation room quietly to assess return to&#xD;
           baseline levels of arousal (3 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the parent will be brought back into the room as the sensors are removed. Debriefing&#xD;
      will occur only after the final follow-up lab visit. Anticipated time to complete lab visit&#xD;
      is approximately one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MINDLIGHT GAME PLAY Participants in the treatment condition will play 5 total hours of&#xD;
      MindLight, one hour at each sitting, over the course of 2-3 weeks. Game play will occur&#xD;
      either in schools or at the participant's home. For the Prevention Sample, MindLight will be&#xD;
      played in participating middle and high schools in the Limestone District School Board.&#xD;
      Participants in the Clinical Sample who attend these schools will also play the game at the&#xD;
      school. However, for children recruited through the Hotel Dieu Mood and Anxiety clinic (see&#xD;
      recruitment details) who do not attend one of the participating schools will play MindLight&#xD;
      at home. In all cases, a research assistant will be present to set up the game and monitor&#xD;
      any equipment difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To play the game, children will wear a lightweight MindWave headset that has a single&#xD;
      electrode that must touch the forehead (see attached images). There is a clip that attaches&#xD;
      comfortably to the earlobe as well. The electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in the alpha,&#xD;
      beta, and gamma frequencies are used to extract two continuous signal streams that are&#xD;
      measures of focused attention and arousal. These signals are used in the game to control the&#xD;
      character's &quot;mind light,&quot; a magical hat he wears that has a light on the end of a signal&#xD;
      antenna, by focusing a beam of light toward specific targets to solve puzzles within the game&#xD;
      and expanding the range of light inversely proportional to the degree of arousal. Thus,&#xD;
      children control key aspects of the game with their mind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control participants in the Prevention Sample will play Max and the Magic Marker, a&#xD;
      commercially available game with similar features to MindLight but without the key mechanisms&#xD;
      targeting anxiety reduction (attention bias modification and relaxation). The amount of game&#xD;
      play time and location will be the same as those in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ONLINE COGNITIVE BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY Control participants in the Clinical Sample will receive&#xD;
      an online version of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) based on the skills taught in Mind&#xD;
      over Mood by D. Greenberger and C. Padesky. The program provides general information on each&#xD;
      topic, an overview on helpful skills, and homework sheets by email that directly corresponds&#xD;
      with how a live, 8-week group therapy session would be conducted. Participants will also&#xD;
      receive feedback on homework on a specific day every week from a therapist at Hotel Dieu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of participants CLINICAL SAMPLE Children 8-16 years old who have made an&#xD;
      appointment at the Mood and Anxiety Clinic at Hotel Dieu specifically for problems with&#xD;
      anxiety. Only those with autism or significant developmental delays will be excluded. The&#xD;
      investigators will recruit 100 children, with half randomly assigned to the MindLight&#xD;
      intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREVENTION SAMPLE Children 10-16 years old attending participating schools in the Limestone&#xD;
      District School Board who have been identified as having elevated anxiety symptoms via a&#xD;
      self-report measure of anxiety. Only those with autism or significant developmental delays&#xD;
      will be excluded. The investigators will recruit 100 children, with half randomly assigned to&#xD;
      the MindLight intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment details CLINICAL SAMPLE Participants will be recruited following initial&#xD;
      assessment at the Hotel Dieu Mood and Anxiety Clinic. The typical wait period between this&#xD;
      initial diagnostic assessment and the start of either group or one-on-one therapy is 3-6&#xD;
      months. Our intervention will occur during this wait period. During the initial assessment at&#xD;
      the clinic, children aged 8-16 will be invited to participate in the study. They will be&#xD;
      provided a brief explanation of the study and will indicate to the clinician whether they&#xD;
      give permission to be contacted by the recruitment coordinator who will provide all of the&#xD;
      details of the study. The participant will be made aware that they are under no obligation to&#xD;
      participate in the study by agreeing to be contacted. Those who assent to participate will be&#xD;
      invited to the Adolescent Dynamics Lab to begin participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREVENTION SAMPLE Children in grades 6-10 who attend one of the participating schools will&#xD;
      complete one questionnaire during class time, the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS).&#xD;
      Children who score 1 standard deviation above the mean for (a) the total score or (b) two of&#xD;
      the subscales (not including the obsessive-compulsive scale) will be considered at risk for&#xD;
      developing an anxiety disorder. These children will be invited to participate in the study by&#xD;
      visiting the Adolescent Dynamics Lab. Consent for the study will be obtained from the parent&#xD;
      prior to the SCAS screening.&#xD;
