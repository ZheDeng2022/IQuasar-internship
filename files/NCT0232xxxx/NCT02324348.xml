  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that no reflow phenomenon by microvascular obstruction after revascularization in&#xD;
      STEMI increase infarct size, cardiac remodeling, and a risk of late mortality. Major&#xD;
      mechanism of microvascular obstruction is distal embolization during procedure. Some&#xD;
      investigators showed deferred stenting decreased the degree of microvascular obstruction&#xD;
      compared with immediate stenting in STEMI. The aim of current study is to compare impact of&#xD;
      immediate stent implantation versus deferred stent implantation on infarct size and&#xD;
      microvascular perfusion in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).&#xD;

      1. Patients will be enrolled if they agree to participate in the study and sign informed&#xD;
           consent among patients who are satisfied with inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
           Acceptance of the study will be taken concurrently at the situation when the patient&#xD;
           admitted via emergency department with the diagnosis of STEMI and informed consent of&#xD;
           primary coronary angiography and intervention is taken. Considering emergent situation&#xD;
           of the procedure, it is thought to be impossible to take informed consent of the study&#xD;
           before procedure and after achieving TIMI flow. Duty operator will inform to the patient&#xD;
           when taking informed consent of primary coronary angiography and intervention that the&#xD;
           patient will be randomized to immediate coronary stenting group or deferred coronary&#xD;
           stent group, and explain about theoretical background of deferred coronary stenting. To&#xD;
           all patients, aspirin 300㎎, clopidogrel 600㎎ are administered orally and heparin&#xD;
           intravenously until achieving ACT (activated clotting time) between 200 and 250 seconds.&#xD;
           Maximal total dose of unfractionated heparin of 100 unit/㎏ will be administered before&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Transradial or transfemoral approach will be determined on operator's decision. Flow of&#xD;
           the infarct related artery (IRA) will be checked as total occlusion, TIMI 0, Ⅰ or Ⅱ&#xD;
           after coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Abciximab (0.25㎎/㎏) intracoronary injection will be performed to all possible patients&#xD;
           after guidewire has passed culprit lesion. Additional manual thrombus aspiration or&#xD;
           balloon angioplasty can be performed by operator to achieve TIMI Ⅲ flow. When TIMI Ⅲ&#xD;
           flow is achieved after these procedures, patient will be randomized to immediate&#xD;
           stenting or deferred stenting group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Although stent implantation without balloon angioplasty is preferred in immediate&#xD;
           stenting group, balloon angioplasty can be performed to achieve distal flow. In deferred&#xD;
           stenting group, second stage procedure (stent implantation) will be done at 5 to 7 days&#xD;
           after TIMI Ⅲ flow has achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. On coronary intervention (stent implantation), all possible cases will be implanted with&#xD;
           Nobori Biolimus A9-eluting coronary stent (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan). (Other stents can be&#xD;
           used if the length of the lesion cannot be covered with Nobori stent.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. In both group, abciximab continuous intravenous infusion on a dose of 0.125 ㎍/㎏/min&#xD;
           (maximum dose 10 ㎍/min) will be done after initial procedure if possible. (Intracoronary&#xD;
           injection and intravenous infusion of abciximab should be done unless there is no&#xD;
           contraindication of abciximab.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. In both group, subcutaneous enoxaparin (low molecular weight heparin) injection will be&#xD;
           done twice daily until 3 days after procedure if possible. In case of stent implantation&#xD;
           in the fifth to seventh day within deferred coronary stenting group, enoxaparin&#xD;
           injection can be extended until deferred intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Transradial and transfemoral approach are all possible. If procedure is done with&#xD;
           transfemoral approach, sheath removal will be done after continuous intravenous&#xD;
           abciximal infusion of 12 hours and enoxaparin injection after hemostasis has been&#xD;
           confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. In case of residual stenosis of IRA is below 30% within deferred coronary stenting&#xD;
           group, intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) will be performed at the secondary procedure&#xD;
           and withdrawal of stenting can be done upon operator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. In case of multivessel disease, intervention of non-IRA will be deferred in both groups.&#xD;
           Therefore, PCI on IRA and non-IRA will be done concurrently in deferred coronary&#xD;
           stenting group.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Patient will maintain dual antiplatelet therapy of aspirin 100㎎ and clopidogrel 75㎎&#xD;
           after PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Among prescribed drugs after PCI, statin agent can be used upon operator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Cardiac MRI is done on the period of 30±7 days after diagnosed as STEMI in both group.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Follow-up period is 1 month ± 1 week, 6 month ± 4 week, and 12 month ± 4 week in both&#xD;
           group. Transthoracic echocardiography will be done at 6 month ± 4 week follow-up period.&#xD;
