      A Phase 1/2 multicenter, dose determining, open-label study of ADXS31-142 monotherapy and a&#xD;
      combination of ADXS31-142 with Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer. Part A will be dose-determining of ADXS31-142&#xD;
      monotherapy. Part B will be dose-determining of ADXS31-142 and Pembrolizumad (MK-3475) in&#xD;
      combination. Part B expansion will treat additional patients with the recommended dose from&#xD;
      Part B.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part A of the study will be an open-label, Phase 1, multicenter, non-randomized,&#xD;
      dose-determining trial of ADX31-142 monotherapy in subjects with metastatic&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The dose determining phase is intended to&#xD;
      select a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B of the study will be an open-label, Phase 1-2, multicenter, non-randomized&#xD;
      dose-determining trial of ADXS31-142 in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in subjects&#xD;
      with mCRPC. Part B will consist of a dose-determination phase followed by an expansion cohort&#xD;
      phase. The dose-determining phase is intended to select a RP2D for the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation/de-escalation for this study will be explored by applying the mTPI design.&#xD;
