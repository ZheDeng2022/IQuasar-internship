      Using the NIH-funded Way to Health platform, the investigators will conduct this smoking&#xD;
      cessation RCT among Vitality/Discovery beneficiaries. The investigators will be able to&#xD;
      determine the effectiveness of 4 different interventions aimed at smoking cessation, two of&#xD;
      which are incentive structures that are each grounded in behavioral economic principles. The&#xD;
      other interventions will determine the effectiveness of various cessation aids, including&#xD;
      electronic cigarettes and text messaging, on smoking cessation. This study will be conducted&#xD;
      as an opt-out procedure where participants are automatically enrolled in the program but have&#xD;
      the choice to unenroll if they so chose. This pragmatic approach will allow us to investigate&#xD;
      the effects of such programs in an employee based population that can be easily mimicked in&#xD;
      other employee based populations.&#xD;

      Overall objectives Our primary objective is to determine which of four interventions improve&#xD;
      smoking cessation rates in beneficiaries of the Vitalilty/Discovery program. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to compare the effectiveness standard intervention (control) that includes&#xD;
      text messaging aimed at encouraging cessation to four interventions: 1) choice of free&#xD;
      (traditional) cessation aids (NRT: gum or patch), 2) free e-cigarettes, 3) Choice of free&#xD;
      cessation aids (NRT or e-cigarettes) and reward based incentives for cessation, and 4) Choice&#xD;
      of free cessation aids (NRT or e-cigarettes) and a virtual deposit-based incentives for&#xD;
      cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome variable: Urine cotinine, anabasine, or blood carboxyhemoglobin testing&#xD;
      (metabolites of nicotine) at 6 months following the quit date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome variable: Urine cotinine, anabasine, or blood carboxyhemoglobin testing&#xD;
      (metabolites of nicotine) at 1 month, 3 months, and 12 months following the quit date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Tobacco use remains one of the most preventable causes of disease, disability, and&#xD;
      death worldwide (CDC, 2014). Rates of smoking in the US have decreased to 18.1% in 2012 but&#xD;
      remain far from the cessation goals set by tobacco prevention organizations (12% by 2020 in&#xD;
      the US). To achieve these cessation goals and reduce harm from tobacco, the investigators&#xD;
      need to both implement proven strategies to promote cessation and develop new approaches to&#xD;
      increasing tobacco cessation (Frieden, 2014). Vitality is the wellness program for over 25&#xD;
      companies in the US. They are charged with providing a variety of wellness programs for the&#xD;
      employees of companies they represent. These programs span a variety of health behaviors&#xD;
      including tobacco use, obesity, healthy eating, driving while texting and many more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Financial incentives have been effective in improving health in a variety of areas, including&#xD;
      smoking cessation (Heil et al., 2008; Loewenstein et al., 2012; Lynagh et al., 2013;&#xD;
      Sutherland et al., 2008; Volpp et al., 2009 ). In the largest (n = 878) and most successful&#xD;
      trial, Volpp and colleagues (2009) found that financial incentives, totaling $750, increased&#xD;
      long-term smoking cessation rates from 5.0% in the control group to 14.7% in the incentive&#xD;
      group 12 months after quitting. Following a period of 6 months where incentives were&#xD;
      discontinued this difference between groups remained intact, supporting the use of incentives&#xD;
      for sustainable cessation efforts. Strong evidence supporting the use of incentives for&#xD;
      smoking cessation and the allowance granted by the Affordable Care Act for employers to use&#xD;
      up to 30% of total premiums for outcomes-based rewards or penalties has led to an increase in&#xD;
      use of financial incentives by employers. An estimated 82% of large employers in 2013 used&#xD;
      financial incentives to promote healthy behavior (Volpp, 2014). While financial incentives&#xD;
      have been shown to improve rates of healthy behaviors, basic research in behavioral economics&#xD;
      suggests that how you pay these incentives may be critical. Behavioral economics suggests&#xD;
      that loss aversion may promote more behavior change than reward-based incentives. Whether or&#xD;
      not this holds true in large employer based populations where participants are auto-enrolled&#xD;
      has yet to be determined. The investigators propose conducting a 5- arm study examining the&#xD;
      use of different financial incentive structures and new technologies to promote smoking&#xD;
      cessation in Vitality members in the US. The relative effectiveness of how incentives are&#xD;
      paid out is unknown. To shed light on this fundamental question the investigators will&#xD;
      examine how incentives for assistance in quitting compare to incentives delivered for&#xD;
      evidence of smoking abstinence and deposit contracts. Additionally the utility of&#xD;
      e-cigarettes in promoting abstinence is not well understood. The use of e-cigarettes and&#xD;
      other smoking cessation tools will be promoted and provided across all experimental arms so&#xD;
      that the of the effectiveness of these aides can also be evaluated. The primary objective&#xD;
      will be to identify differences in long-term abstinence rates. Secondary objectives include&#xD;
      assessing sustained abstinence at follow-up. An opt-out enrollment procedure will be used for&#xD;
      this study. All participants will have previously tested positive for cotinine and reported&#xD;
      being a smoker, will be 18 years of age or older, will be a beneficiary of Vitality, and will&#xD;
      have the opportunity to terminate their participation at any time. Employing an opt-out&#xD;
      design for this trial will help to connect high-risk smokers, who are largely interested in&#xD;
      changing their behavior, to potentially helpful treatments that they may not otherwise seek&#xD;
      out. Below we describe the many reasons why an opt-out enrollment is appropriate for this&#xD;
      trial. 1) An opt-out design is essential to answer the questions we are interested in: what&#xD;
      rates of sustained smoking abstinence might an insurer expect to generate if it actually&#xD;
      rolled out the interventions to be tested among its beneficiaries, and how do these&#xD;
      interventions compare in terms of their effectiveness? Thus, in designing this trial, we&#xD;
      explicitly aimed to mimic the roll out of a health initiative in a real-world setting;&#xD;
      opt-out consent, whereby beneficiaries are engaged with the program unless they actively&#xD;
      choose otherwise, is how such programs would be rolled out in the real world. As programs&#xD;
      similar to the current trial are being developed and disseminated across the country it is&#xD;
      imperative that we examine how interventions perform under these conditions. Enrolling large&#xD;
      numbers of smokers in a study in which all will be offered some form of assistance with&#xD;
      cessation provides high expected benefits, both to enrolled participants and in terms of the&#xD;
      knowledge to be gained. While smoking rates have reduced to 18% in the United States, smoking&#xD;
      related illness still remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States.&#xD;
      More than 75% of current American smokers wish to quit; 45% do quit for at least a day each&#xD;
      year; and anti-smoking policies, new pharmaceuticals, and behavioral modification programs&#xD;
      offer promise to help them. Nevertheless, only 2-3% of smokers attain prolonged abstinence&#xD;
      annually. Given this high interest in quitting smoking, and low rates of successfully&#xD;
      sustaining quit attempts with currently available programs, opt-out consent will ensure that&#xD;
      all smokers will have the same access to potentially helpful programs without the added&#xD;
      barrier of completing a lengthy enrollment/consent process. Vitality is committed to using&#xD;
      the most effective means of reducing major risks to health in its membership and employee&#xD;
      base. In order to achieve this goal they are working with innovative researchers at the&#xD;
      University of Pennsylvania Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics (CHIBE).&#xD;
      Within the Vitality US population 13% of members tested positive for tobacco use. In the&#xD;
      South African Vitality employee population smoking prevalence is estimated at 22%. Vitality&#xD;
      is launching a study on tobacco cessation using incentives and new nicotine technologies for&#xD;
      members in the US. Findings of the study will be published and used for development of a&#xD;
      smoking cessation program offerings for Vitality. If successful this trial could serve as a&#xD;
      model for other organizations interested in implementing a similar program. This study will&#xD;
      use the National Institute on Aging supported Way to Health technology (RC2-AG036592) which&#xD;
      has been used in many previous studies of this nature. As outlined in the Appendix, this&#xD;
      web-based behavioral research infrastructure will substantially increase the efficiency of&#xD;
      patient enrollment and tracking, data management, and incentive collection and disbursement,&#xD;
      thereby enabling much larger studies than was possible previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants eligible for this trial will have been previously identified by the&#xD;
      Vitality/Discovery group during various assessments they have conducted. All who meet our&#xD;
      minimum eligibility requirements (18 years or older, smoke at least 5 cigarettes a day,&#xD;
      tested positive for cotinine at a previous health screening) will be automatically enrolled&#xD;
      into this study and randomized to one of four experimental arms and a control arm. All&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled on the same day. Furthermore, all participants will be given&#xD;
      the same quit date, a date one month from enrollment. This program will require participants&#xD;
      to indicate their smoking status and provide samples for verification of abstinence at&#xD;
      pre-determined dates after their quit date (1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post&#xD;
      quit date). Participants who report having successfully quit will be asked to undergo a urine&#xD;
      cotinine and anabasine test at 1 month, 3 months,6 months, and 12 months following their quit&#xD;
      date. Cotinine will be used to determine abstinence in participants not reporting the use of&#xD;
      NRT or ecigarettes. Anabasine will be used to determine abstinence for participants reporting&#xD;
      use of NRT or ecigarettes, as cotinine tests cannot distinguish cigarette nicotine from&#xD;
      replacement therapy nicotine. Participants who test positive for both cotinine and anabasine&#xD;
      but report using only e-cigarettes and no other tobacco products will be asked to submit to a&#xD;
      secondary test to determine abstinence. This test will be a blood carboxyhemoglobin test.&#xD;
      Control Arm: Participants randomized to this arm will receive a standardized Vitality program&#xD;
      aimed at promoting tobacco cessation. This program includes existing employee benefits for&#xD;
      quitting and the use of text/email messages to encourage tobacco cessation. No incentives&#xD;
      will be given to participants randomized to this arm. Free cessation aids will not be&#xD;
      available to participants in this arm. They will receive compensation for completing study&#xD;
      related activities (sample submissions). E-cigarette arm (Arm 2): Participants randomized to&#xD;
      this experimental arm will receive the standardized program including text/email messaging&#xD;
      and will have access to free e-cigarettes only. These products can be ordered directly, free&#xD;
      of charge, through the web-based interface. No incentives will be given to participants&#xD;
      randomized to this arm. They will receive compensation for completing study related&#xD;
      activities (sample submissions). E-cigarette/NRT/Zyban/Chantix Choice arm (Arm 3):&#xD;
      Participants randomized to this experimental arm will receive the standardized program&#xD;
      including text/email messaging and will have access to free e-cigarettes, conventional&#xD;
      Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT), Zyban, or Chantix. Each of these can be ordered directly,&#xD;
      free of charge, through the web-based interface. No incentives will be given to participants&#xD;
      randomized to this arm. They will receive compensation for completing study related&#xD;
      activities (sample submissions). Outcome Incentive arm (Arm 4): Participants randomized to&#xD;
      this experimental arm will receive the standardized program and access to free e-cigarettes,&#xD;
      NRT, Zyban, or Chantix. In addition, they will also be able to earn incentives across six&#xD;
      months for testing negative for tobacco use (see Incentive payout, below). They will also&#xD;
      receive compensation for completing study related activities (sample submissions). Loss&#xD;
      framing incentive arm (Arm 5): Participants randomized to this experimental arm will receive&#xD;
      the standardized program and access to free e-cigarettes, NRT, Zyban, or Chantix. In addition&#xD;
      they will also be able to earn incentives across six months through a pre-funded deposit or&#xD;
      precommitment account. They will be notified that an incentive has been placed into an&#xD;
      account for them. At each time point they will lose a portion of this initial funding if they&#xD;
      do not provide biochemical evidence of abstinence. They will also receive compensation for&#xD;
      completing study related activities (sample submissions).&#xD;
