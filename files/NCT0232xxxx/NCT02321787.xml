      The purpose of our study is to evaluate whether utilizing ultrasound assessment during caudal&#xD;
      epidural injection can reliably identify unrecognized and unsuccessful nerve blocks during&#xD;
      the procedure, guide proper technique, and alter pain management outcome measurements for&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to a group either undergoing caudal injection by a trainee using&#xD;
      typical techniques or by using typical techniques in addition to ultrasound for confirmation&#xD;
      of successful injection. The patients enrolled in this study will have the same&#xD;
      intraoperative care, in line with the standard of care. Data will be collected&#xD;
      intraoperatively and postoperatively on pain scores, time for performance of caudal block,&#xD;
      and perceived success of the block. There will be no direct benefit to the patients enrolled&#xD;
      in this study, but future patients may benefit from the use of ultrasound for the&#xD;
      confirmation of a successful block.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Caudal epidural injection is the most commonly performed regional anesthetic procedure in&#xD;
      infants and children and is used to provide perioperative analgesia for many lower abdominal,&#xD;
      lower extremity, and urological procedures. Utilizing sterile technique, a needle is advanced&#xD;
      through the sacral hiatus and local anesthetic is injected into the epidural space. Local&#xD;
      anesthetic spreads cranially and results in significant sensory (+/- motor) blockade,&#xD;
      depending on local anesthetic concentration and volume1. Recent studies have used ultrasound&#xD;
      to assess cranial spread during caudal blockade, specifically evaluating how speed of&#xD;
      injection and different volumes can affect cranial spread2,4. Other studies have investigated&#xD;
      redistribution and secondary spread after initial injection of local anesthetic by utilizing&#xD;
      ultrasound assessment of the epidural space3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although no current standard exists for confirming successful caudal epidural injection,&#xD;
      several findings may indicate a proper needle position and can predict successful block5.&#xD;
      Some of these findings include: tactile appreciation of the &quot;pop&quot; through the sacrococcygeal&#xD;
      ligament, negative blood or cerebrospinal fluid aspiration, negative test dose, appropriate&#xD;
      resistance during injection, no subcutaneous swelling during injection, no motor or&#xD;
      hemodynamic response to skin incision, and no need for administration of supplemental&#xD;
      analgesics. Although several studies have shown that real-time ultrasound guidance can be&#xD;
      used during needle insertion for caudal block, this does not guarantee adequate cranial&#xD;
      spread and may be technically challenging for a trainee performing the block. Furthermore,&#xD;
      many of the tactile findings that indicate successful entry into the appropriate space can&#xD;
      only be appreciated by the trainee, not the supervising anesthesiologist, which complicates&#xD;
      supervision of this technique. At present, difficulty in reliably predicting block failure&#xD;
      may lead to overuse of narcotics to prevent pain in patients with potentially failed blocks&#xD;
      or could lead to inadequate analgesia in patients too young to reliably communicate their&#xD;
      pain level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of our study is to evaluate whether utilizing ultrasound assessment during caudal&#xD;
      epidural injection can reliably identify unrecognized and unsuccessful nerve blocks during&#xD;
      the procedure, guide proper technique, and alter pain management outcome measurements for&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will not change the current practice with regard to patient selection for&#xD;
      caudal epidural injection and will not change the performance of the procedure itself. This&#xD;
      study may impact the practice of general pediatric anesthesiologists by providing evidence&#xD;
      that ultrasound is a useful tool for determining successful caudal epidural injection, may&#xD;
      help identify unrecognized failed blocks earlier and will evaluate which level(s) of&#xD;
      anesthesia training would most benefit from this assessment tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized using pre-made folders containing an assignment to either the&#xD;
      control group or study group. In the study group, ultrasound will be utilized in the caudal&#xD;
      block to confirm placement. In the control group, the caudal block will be done without&#xD;
      ultrasound to assist with caudal epidural injection. In the operating room, once the&#xD;
      anesthesia team is prepared to begin the caudal epidural injection, the patient will be&#xD;
      placed in the lateral decubitus or prone position, with knees and hips flexed. The attending&#xD;
      for the caudal block will mark the site on the patient per the site marking policy at Lurie&#xD;
      Children's; this is not necessarily the attending of record for the remainder of the case.&#xD;
      Once the sacrum is prepped, the anesthesia provider will proceed with the caudal epidural&#xD;
      injection in the usual fashion. The injected solution will be 1 mL/kg of 0.2% ropivacaine&#xD;
      with 1:200k epinephrine, rounded up to the next mL, which is consistent with the current&#xD;
      standard practice at Lurie Children's. After injection of test dose (10% of the total block&#xD;
      volume), a one-minute pause will begin to assess for a response. During this pause, prior to&#xD;
      injection of the remaining dose of local anesthetic, a 13-6 MHz, linear ultrasound probe with&#xD;
      a sterile covering and ultrasound gel will be placed over the patient's lumbar spine, cranial&#xD;
      to the point of entry for the caudal block. The caudal block needle insertion site and&#xD;
      sterile field will be observed and undisturbed. The ultrasound probe will be positioned&#xD;
      paramedian along the non-dependent side of the spine, obtaining a long axis view of the&#xD;
      epidural and intrathecal space. The cephalad end of probe will be placed at the level of the&#xD;
      iliac crest. Once the ultrasound probe is positioned properly and the one-minute pause has&#xD;
      finished, the remaining dose of local anesthetic will be administered by the anesthesia&#xD;
      provider as an ultrasound clip of epidural spread is visualized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The supervising attending anesthesiologist will be one of those listed in the personnel form.&#xD;
      In either group, the attending anesthesiologist will coach the resident to help guide them to&#xD;
      success based on the standards of care with this block. In the control group, if it is felt&#xD;
      that the trainee is unable to safely and successfully perform the block based on typically&#xD;
      utilized methods of assessment (injection pressure, needle appearance, subcutaneous swelling)&#xD;
      then the attending will take over the block, consistent with current practice at Lurie&#xD;
      Children's. In the study group, the attending will continue to use traditional methods of&#xD;
      assessment but will also utilize the ultrasound to assess block success and may either take&#xD;
      over the block at the time injection has been determined to be unsuccessful or may redirect&#xD;
      the trainee to success in their performance of the block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the research protocol, the primary anesthesia team should avoid giving the patient&#xD;
      other analgesic medications prior to the time of incision. Additionally, the anesthesia team&#xD;
      should have the patient at 1 MAC of sevoflurane and avoid using nitrous oxide, at the time of&#xD;
      incision. After incision, all anesthetic decisions will be at the discretion of the attending&#xD;
      anesthesiologist of record in the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected on the level of training of the physician performing the procedure,&#xD;
      the proceduralist's experience level, findings during the procedure, and their confidence&#xD;
      level of block success. Subsequent data will be collected on response to skin incision and&#xD;
      need for supplemental analgesia. In the recovery room, a pain score will be assessed at the&#xD;
      time of phase 1 recovery discharge. Recovery room staff will be advised to only give&#xD;
      analgesic medications, standardized to 0.05 mg/kg of morphine, if pain is rated at &gt; 4 on the&#xD;
      rFLACC scale, appropriate to the patients' age. The ultrasound probe placement, image&#xD;
      acquisition, survey administration, pre-incision anesthetic standardization, and recovery&#xD;
      room analgesic administration threshold are the only research-related procedures. All&#xD;
      elements of patient care described above, including withholding additional analgesics before&#xD;
      incision, are consistent with the current standard of care and standard practices at Lurie&#xD;
      Children's. The length of the study visit will be from the time of operation until PACU&#xD;
      discharge, with the intervention only taking place during the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caudal analgesia will be rated successful if 2 conditions are fulfilled: (1) the procedure&#xD;
      was performed without any physical assistance by the supervisor, with verbal comments and&#xD;
      suggestions allowed, and no more than 3 passes with the needle through the skin needed, and&#xD;
      (2) clinical success of the block. Clinical failure will be defined as need for opioid&#xD;
      supplementation or increased concentration of volatile anesthetic in response to clinical&#xD;
      signs of insufficient analgesia including increases in heart rate, blood pressure, movement&#xD;
      of patient, or other signs of stress at incision or during the procedure. The attending&#xD;
      anesthesiologist will predict whether the caudal block was successful based on clinical&#xD;
      indicators alone in the control group and based on ultrasound findings in the study group.&#xD;
      This assessment of confidence in the block must be made before emergence from anesthesia.&#xD;
