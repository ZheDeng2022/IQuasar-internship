      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate an exoskeleton device and mobility skills&#xD;
      in the device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the treatment of muscle and bone deterioration after SCI is very limited;&#xD;
      therefore, there is a definite need to further understand the mechanism of breakdown in the&#xD;
      musculoskeletal system after a SCI, and, more importantly, find a clinical strategy that will&#xD;
      treat muscle and bone loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot research grant will collect results that will be used for the design of a&#xD;
      multi-site randomized controlled clinical trial to determine whether a Robotic Exoskeleton&#xD;
      training [100 sessions; 1hr/session; 4-5 sessions/week] can improve musculoskeletal outcomes&#xD;
      more than other current interventions. If the overall objective is to use the progression of&#xD;
      technology to enhance functional ambulation for persons with a spinal cord injury, then the&#xD;
      investigators need to evaluate the health benefits associated with continual use of the&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a prospective, single-group, repeated measure design using a 2 -month lead&#xD;
      in to establish stability, 5-month intervention phase and 2 -month follow-up phase for&#xD;
      retention will be performed. Each participant will be used as his or her own control. This&#xD;
      project will be completed at two sites: Kessler Foundation will be the lead site that will be&#xD;
      under the direction of Dr. Gail F Forrest (Principal Investigator) and Spinal Cord Damage&#xD;
      Research Center, James J Peters VA Medical Center under the direction of Dr. Ann M. Spungen&#xD;
      (collaborator). Both sites have exoskeletal-assisted walking programs.&#xD;

    <description>To examine the effectiveness of robotic exoskeleton-assisted over ground walking (5 hrs. p/wk, 100 sessions, 20 wks = 100 hrs) to induce positive changes in muscle volume and structure of the lower limbs for non-ambulatory persons with SCI. Combined with our current training protocol where people step 1500-2000/session we predict that the 2,000 lower extremity muscle contractions will be sufficient in our proposed exoskeletal study.&#xD;
MRI's will be performed to accurately assess muscle CSA of each lower limb to determine individual's muscle thigh and shank volume.&#xD;
Muscle Biopsies for the quadricep muscle will be performed to determine changes in BMD and bone structure due to intensive exoskeleton assisted walking.</description>

    <description>Needle Biopsies for Quadricep Muscles will be performed to define changes in BMD and Bone structure with intensive exoskeleton assisted walking. This procedure includes having a trained physician make a small skin incision, after numbing the area over the muscle, and then removing a tiny sliver of muscle to study under the microscope. Three separate biopsies for one incision will be obtained. The biopsies will be performed at baseline, 7 days, and after the intervention.&#xD;
