      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease with progressive muscle weakness&#xD;
      leading to severe disability and eventually death.Since the diagnosis relies on clinical&#xD;
      features and electromyographic abnormalities, which may occur rather late in the disease&#xD;
      course, there is a need to identify diagnostic tests that can confirm or exclude the&#xD;
      diagnosis of ALS in the earlier phase of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, there are studies suggesting neuroinflammation to play a role for the&#xD;
      development of ALS. Cluster of differentiation 163 is found to be up regulated in a large&#xD;
      range of inflammatory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the investigators lab, pilot data (Kallestrup M et al, unpublished data) has shown&#xD;
      promising results. There was an increased level of cluster of differentiation 163 (sCD163) in&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid in 7 patients with ALS compared with controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the investigators study is to define the concentration of sCD163 in the&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid and serum in patients with ALS compared with controls (patients with&#xD;
      unspecified neurological symptoms). Furthermore, the investigators will define the&#xD;
      concentrations of protein, glucose, immunoglobulin G index and other factors in the spinal&#xD;
      fluid.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease with progressive muscle&#xD;
      weakness leading to severe disability and eventually death. It is the most common form of&#xD;
      motor neuron diseases and involves both the upper and lower motor neurons. The median&#xD;
      survival from debut of symptoms to dead is approximately 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the diagnosis relies on clinical features and electromyographic abnormalities, which&#xD;
      may occur rather late in the disease course, there is a need to identify diagnostic tests&#xD;
      that can confirm or exclude the diagnosis of ALS in the earlier phase of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALS is a neurodegenerative disease, however the pathogenesis is not well established. The&#xD;
      causes are probably multifactorial and a complex interaction between genetic factors and&#xD;
      dysfunction of vital molecular pathways concerning the dominantly inherited c9orf72 gene and&#xD;
      impaired glutamate uptake in astrocytes (EAAT2-receptor) from the synaptic cleft and thereby&#xD;
      glutamate excitotoxicity. This glutamate excitotoxicity may cause oxidative stress,&#xD;
      voltage-gated persistent sodium channels and activation of microglia resulting in secretion&#xD;
      of proinflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, there are studies suggesting neuroinflammation to play a role for the&#xD;
      development of ALS. A study from 2012 (a mouse model of ALS, that overexpress mutant&#xD;
      superoxide dismutase (mSOD1)), has documented that microglia can both protect and injure the&#xD;
      motor neurones depending on which phenotype of the microglia is activated. It seems like it&#xD;
      is a continuum between the protective M2 phenotypic state (disease onset) and the neurotoxic&#xD;
      M1 phenotypic state (disease end-stage). Furthermore, at disease onset the mice expressed&#xD;
      higher levels of Ym1, CD163 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (markers of M2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of other molecular mechanisms, it is worth to mention the structural and functional&#xD;
      abnormalities of mitochondria, impairment of axonal transport systems and endosomal&#xD;
      trafficking and induction of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response although they appear&#xD;
      to be secondary events in ALS. The net result is degeneration of motor neurones in cerebral&#xD;
      cortex, the cranial nerve nuclei, the anterior horn of the spinal cord and the corticospinal&#xD;
      tracts. The only present treatment available is Riluzole that has proven to extend life or&#xD;
      time to onset of serious respiratory problems in patients with ALS. The mode of action for&#xD;
      Riluzole still has to be determined, possibly the dynamic is an inhibition of glutamate&#xD;
      release from the presynaptic neuron. (1,2,3,4,5,6) Though it seems that the inflammatory&#xD;
      process is a secondary event, it seems to be critical for neuronal degeneration. In a study,&#xD;
      ALS pathology was sought to be reduced through central nervous system targeted glucocorticoid&#xD;
      and succeeded by reducing brainstem pathology in mouse models of ALS. Of different&#xD;
      biomarkers, inflammatory markers have also been tested: the interleukin-1 family cytokines.&#xD;
      Among them only total interleukin-18, its endogenous inhibitor interleukin-18BP, and the&#xD;
      active form of the cytokine (free interleukin-18) were significantly higher in the ALS&#xD;
      patients than in controls. The cytokine showed no correlation to the different clinical forms&#xD;
      of ALS or the clinical setting of the disease. Cytokines have also been tried as&#xD;
      neuroprotective agents. Erythropoietin (EPO) is known as the growth factor that maintains the&#xD;
      number of circulating erythrocytes. However, the biological role of EPO has been expanded to&#xD;
      other cells, such as neurons, microglia, and astrocytes in the brain. EPO seems to suppress&#xD;
      the proinﬂammatory cytokines during disease progression, maintain the anti-inﬂammatory&#xD;
      cytokines until the late symptomatic stage and finally seems to delay symptom onset and&#xD;
      preserve number of motor neurons. (7,8,9,10) Cluster of differentiation 163 (CD-163) - a new&#xD;
      way to monitor inflammation in ALS? CD-163 is a scavenger receptor (recognizes and uptakes&#xD;
      macromolecules) which marks the monocyte-macrophage activation. CD163 works for macrophages&#xD;
      as a receptor for hemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes. The soluble form of the receptor is&#xD;
      called sCD163 and is found in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, where it is found to be up&#xD;
      regulated in a large range of inflammatory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strongly increased values (&gt;20mg/l) is seen in diseases like macrophage activating&#xD;
      syndrome,hemophagocytic syndrome and acute hepatic failure. Furthermore, the level of sCD163&#xD;
      reflects the activity of the disease. Patients with increasing and high values are found to&#xD;
      have unfavorable prognosis. Increased values (5-20 mg/l) are seen in hepatic disease, sepsis&#xD;
      and Gaucher's disease. Septic patients with values greater than 10 mg/l have a 10 times&#xD;
      greater risk of fatal outcome. Values which is increased a little (3-5 mg/l) is often seen in&#xD;
      inflammatory of infectious conditions and in cancer. (11,12,13,14) Pilot data At the&#xD;
      investigators lab, pilot data (Kallestrup M et al, unpublished data (15)) has shown promising&#xD;
      results. There was an increased level of sCD163 in cerebrospinal fluid in 7 patients with ALS&#xD;
      compared with controls. Furthermore, both definite and probable ALS patients have an&#xD;
      increased level of sCD163. These results suggest a larger study to be performed evaluating&#xD;
      patients with ALS at early as well as later stages of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Patients with ALS have up-regulated levels of sCD-163 in their cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      and serum compared with healthy subjects and the level is related to the severity of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose To define the concentration of sCD-163 in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum in&#xD;
      patients with ALS compared with controls (patients with unspecified neurological symptoms).&#xD;
      Furthermore, we will define the concentrations of protein, glucose, immunoglobulin G index&#xD;
      and other factors in the spinal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Study population The study population will be all patients with established and&#xD;
      suspected ALS at the Department of Neurology, Aarhus University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with established ALS who participate will undergo lumbar puncture as a part of this&#xD;
      study. Subjects suspected to suffer from ALS will undergo lumbar puncture as a part of their&#xD;
      diagnostic work up and the level of sCD163 in their cerebrospinal fluid will be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Department of Neurology, Aarhus University Hospital there are approximately 80&#xD;
      patients with established ALS. We expect that 50 of these patients are willing to participate&#xD;
      and are eligible for inclusion (31-08-2015). Furthermore, we expect to include 8 patients who&#xD;
      will be diagnosed with ALS at Department of Neurology, Aarhus University Hospital during the&#xD;
      study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The controls include patients with various neurological symptoms or diseases who will undergo&#xD;
      a lumbar puncture at the Department of Neurology at Aarhus University Hospital as part of&#xD;
      their diagnostic work-up irrespective of this study. In the final analyses only controls will&#xD;
      be included who end up having either no neurological disease or a neurological disease which&#xD;
      is believed not to involve the spinal fluid. We expect to include 40-50 controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Participants will receive written and oral information about the study. The oral&#xD;
      information will take place at Department of Neurology, Aarhus University Hospital. Moreover,&#xD;
      the pamphlet &quot;Forsøgspersoners rettigheder i et sundhedsvidenskabeligt forskningsprojekt&quot;&#xD;
      will be handed out. Consultants at the department of neurology will give the information, to&#xD;
      patients with suspected ALS. Controls and patients with established ALS will receive&#xD;
      information from the doctors at the department of Neurology and research year student Anne&#xD;
      Sofie Vinther.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible to bring a companion and the participants are offered at least 24 hours to&#xD;
      consider participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to patient records will be requested, which will be provided in the written&#xD;
      information material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If new knowledge about disadvantages of participating in the study appears the participants&#xD;
      will be informed immediately. Moreover, the participant will be informed if evaluations&#xD;
      during the study bring knowledge about the general health status of the patient, unless this&#xD;
      has been clearly rejected by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By the end of the study it is possible for participants to contact the study coordinator to&#xD;
      get information about study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive information about the research project and will be asked to&#xD;
      give their content to participation. The participation implies extraction of 5-6 ml spinal&#xD;
      fluid and a blood sample (30ml), which will be used for analysis of sCD-163.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will not receive any form of payment, but can receive compensation for&#xD;
      transportation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALS Patients diagnosed with ALS and patients suspected to have ALS. Age &gt;18 Controls Age &gt;18&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria (for all groups):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute infections including neuroinfection Other disorders known to have elevated levels of&#xD;
      sCD163 Disorders or treatments that contraindicate a lumbar puncture. Other established&#xD;
      neurological disorders. At all times during the diagnostic work-up and consequently in the&#xD;
      research project we will do this with respect for the patients mental and physical condition.&#xD;
      The research project will be carried out according to the Act on Processing of Personal Data&#xD;
      and, furthermore, the project will be submitted to the common regional information system for&#xD;
      Region Midtjylland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis The spinal fluid and the serum will be analysed at the Department of Clinical&#xD;
      Biochemistry, Aarhus University Hospital. The spinal fluid and blood samples will be&#xD;
      deposited in a research biobank at Aarhus University Hospital. It is planned that all&#xD;
      biochemical analyses will be performed when all samples are collected. At the end of the&#xD;
      project, the samples will be pseudo anonymised. Due to the possibility of developing new&#xD;
      knowledge in this area, the samples will be deposited in the biobank 5 years after this&#xD;
      project has been finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concentrations of sCD-163 in spinal fluid and serum will be analyzed by already&#xD;
      established techniques at the Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Aarhus University&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination The examination consists of a medical history and a clinical examination. We use&#xD;
      the Revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R), which is at rating instrument for&#xD;
      monitoring the progression of disability in patients with ALS. Information from the medical&#xD;
      record will be included and used in this project including past medical history, actual use&#xD;
      of drugs, results of biochemical analyses and brain imaging, results from the ALSFRS-R,&#xD;
      results from the electromyography, abnormalities at the clinical examinations and the&#xD;
      conclusions from the diagnostic work-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power and Statistical analyses Since the investigators pilot data (n=7) showed a 50% increase&#xD;
      in the level of CD163 in the cerebrospinal fluid in ALS patients inclusion of 40 patients is&#xD;
      expected to enable detection of smaller difference also in serum and relations between CD163&#xD;
      and clinical findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program ANOVA will be used for statistical analyses. Parametric or non-parametric tests&#xD;
      will be used depending of the normal distribution of data. In all statistical analysis a 5%&#xD;
      level of significance will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives It is of importance to identify prognostic biomarkers in ALS. The pathology of&#xD;
      ALS is still unknown but it seems that inflammation is a crucial factor in the process. In&#xD;
      several studies, sCD163 has shown to be up regulated in a large range of inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases and together with the investigators promising pilot data sCD163 is a potential&#xD;
      marker for ALS. (4) The assessment of drug efficacy in ALS remains clinically based, relying&#xD;
      on measuring the rate of disease progression through the utilization of the ALS rating&#xD;
      scale-revised (ALSFRS-R). Such clinical scales may be insensitive, especially in the early&#xD;
      stages of the disease process. The development of reliable quantifiable biomarkers remains&#xD;
      elusive in ALS, and development of prognostic biomarkers would be crucial for effective&#xD;
      evaluation of a therapeutic agent in the early stages of development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical consideration The tests performed on the patients involved in this research project&#xD;
      are lumbar puncture and blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It involves some risks to perform a lumbar puncture, which include post lumbar puncture&#xD;
      headache with an incidence of 12 %, most common in younger patients. Most frequently, the&#xD;
      headache has a short duration and it may be cured with application of a blood-patch.&#xD;
      Moreover, lumbar puncture can cause temporary lumbar pain and an accumulation of blood&#xD;
      underneath the skin. There is a very low risk of bleeding in the epidural space with&#xD;
      compression of spinal nerves and an even lower risk of infections (meningitis or&#xD;
      meningoencephalitis). However, it is important to underscore that lumbar puncture is part of&#xD;
      routine diagnostic workup at the Department of Neurology at Aarhus University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In consideration of the low risk involved in this project, the bad prognosis for the disease&#xD;
      and the potential to improve diagnosis and treatment for future patients with ALS we consider&#xD;
      this project to be ethically acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication Positive, negative as well as inconclusive results from this study will be&#xD;
      published. The results will be written in an article for publication in an English written&#xD;
      peer reviewed journal.&#xD;
