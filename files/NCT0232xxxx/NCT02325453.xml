  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer represents a great challenge for health care providers and requires a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary context in which surgery plays a main role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimally invasive surgery has been progressively developed, first with the advent of&#xD;
      laparoscopy and more recently with the spread of robotic systems, but a number of issues are&#xD;
      currently being debated, including the limitations in performing effective extended lymph&#xD;
      node dissections and, in this context, the real advantages of using the robotic systems, the&#xD;
      possible role for the Advanced Gastric Cancer, the reproducibility of completely&#xD;
      intracorporeal techniques and the oncological results achievable during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicenter study with a large number of patients is now needed to further investigate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy as well as long-term outcomes of robotic surgery, traditional laparoscopy&#xD;
      and the open approach.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overall purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Overall purpose is to develop a multi-institutional database comprising information&#xD;
      regarding surgical, clinical and oncological features of patients undergoing surgery for&#xD;
      gastric cancer with robotic, laparoscopic or open approaches and subsequent follow-up at&#xD;
      participating centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry will be established by retrospectively identifying subjects with gastric cancer&#xD;
      treated at the participating centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information gathered will be obtained from existing data and records, diagnostic tests and&#xD;
      surgical interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information will be collected and recorded by all institutes through a specific online shared&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the surgical, clinical, and oncological outcomes in both the short and long&#xD;
           term&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare results according to the type of intervention, device used and manner of&#xD;
           execution of different surgical phases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To relate results of different surgeries with baseline characteristics of patients and&#xD;
           stage of disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies that reported results of minimally invasive surgery for gastric cancer and recent&#xD;
      meta-analysis emphasize the need for large trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further consideration in this field regards the need of numerous patients to reach a&#xD;
      statistical significance on surgical, clinical and oncological outcomes, in order to fully&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness and the differences between the different surgical approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, a multicenter registry may represent the best research tool to assess the role of&#xD;
      minimally invasive approaches by comparing the methods with traditional open surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, for this project, a large registry will be created by collecting data from the&#xD;
      different participating centers to create a working basis for analyzing outcomes of interest&#xD;
      and obtaining directions for further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected will clarify the role of laparoscopic and robotic surgery versus the open&#xD;
      approach in terms of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  safety and feasibility based on the intraoperative outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  respect of oncological principles in relation to the stage and location of the tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  recovery of gastrointestinal function considering the outcomes measured during the&#xD;
           postoperative hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence, types and severity of postoperative complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  overall survival and disease-free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The beginning of the trial is scheduled for January 2015. It is expected to end the chart&#xD;
      review within one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, the following information will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient Demographics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical Procedure details&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Operative findings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-operative clinical findings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-operative complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up details&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dichotomous variables will be expressed as numbers and percentages, while continuous&#xD;
      variables will be expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile&#xD;
      range (minimum and maximum values).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables, will be compared using one-way ANOVA with post hoc multiple comparison&#xD;
      by Tukey's procedure. Pearson's χ2 test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate, will be used&#xD;
      for analysis of categorical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each of these tests a value of alpha (α) &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential risks and safety management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the research registry involves the potential risks of a breach of&#xD;
      confidentiality of the medical record information and associated privacy of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such risks will be minimized by the use and the establishment of appropriate information&#xD;
      technology services.&#xD;
