      The investigators propose to compare the effectiveness of 3 strategies (low, medium, high&#xD;
      intensity) at supporting CHCs' implementation of the ALL Initiative (an intervention shown to&#xD;
      reduce patients' cardiovascular disease (CVD) event risk), through a cluster-randomized&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to compare the effectiveness of 3 support strategies for optimizing&#xD;
      the sustainable implementation of the evidence-based ALL intervention. To do so, the&#xD;
      investigators will randomize 30 community health centers (CHCs) to receive 1 of 3&#xD;
      implementation support strategies: Low support (toolkit only), Medium (toolkit, staff&#xD;
      training), High (toolkit, training, on-site facilitation). The study aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Compare the effectiveness of the 3 strategies (low, medium, high intensity) at&#xD;
      supporting CHCs' implementation of the ALL intervention, through a cluster-randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Clinics randomized to receive more implementation support will be more likely&#xD;
      than those randomized to receive less support (high&gt;medium&gt;low) to significantly improve the&#xD;
      percent of their patients with (i) guideline-appropriate prescriptions for ACE/ARBs and&#xD;
      statins, and (ii) last blood pressure (BP) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) under control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Assess how effectively the 3 strategies support intervention sustainability at 12, 24&#xD;
      and 36 months post-implementation, measured as maintenance of change over time (outcomes as&#xD;
      in Aim 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Clinics randomized to receive more implementation support will be more likely to&#xD;
      maintain changes in the outcomes of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Identify clinic characteristics associated with the support strategies' effectiveness&#xD;
      (e.g. decision-making structures, leadership support, team processes / characteristics,&#xD;
      readiness and capacity for change).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions: What are the characteristics of clinics that achieve sustained change&#xD;
      even with less implementation support, and of those that do not achieve change even with more&#xD;
      support?&#xD;
