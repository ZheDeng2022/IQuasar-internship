    <textblock>
      assess the activity and toxicity of second-line treatment with pazopanib after failure of&#xD;
      first-line sunitinib treatment in patients with clear cell mRCC; to investigate the potential&#xD;
      association of DLL4, Notch1, VEGFA, PDGFRB, HIF-1α and HIF-2α with clinical response to&#xD;
      pazopanib in mRCC patients.&#xD;

      The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points were overall&#xD;
      survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) and safety. We assessed the tumor response&#xD;
      according to the RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy was evaluated by computed tomography with contrast of the chest, abdomen, and&#xD;
      pelvis. We performed tumor assessments with the use of imaging studies at baseline and every&#xD;
      six weeks until the end of treatment. We also used such assessments to confirm a response (at&#xD;
      least 4 weeks after initial documentation) and whenever disease progression was suspected.&#xD;
      All imaging scans were evaluated by an independent imaging-review committee (IRC) blinded to&#xD;
      study treatment. Patients who had inadequate data for study assessment was regarded as&#xD;
      nonevaluable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
      (CTCAE) version 3.0. Safety was assessed by physical examination and laboratory tests.&#xD;
      Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were performed at baseline and every six weeks until the end of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
