  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a three-armed randomized controlled trial which will explore the utility of an&#xD;
      implementation intention intervention on aerobic and resistance exercise in older (60+)&#xD;
      prostate and breast cancer survivors and improving quality of life. It is expected that those&#xD;
      in the experimental groups will report greater increases in their physical activity,&#xD;
      resulting in greater improvements in their quality of life.&#xD;

      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be contacted by the Newfoundland and Labrador Cancer registry.&#xD;
      They will be given a brief explanation of the study will be asked to consent to a mail-out&#xD;
      questionnaire from the registry. The questionnaire will contain a cover letter explaining the&#xD;
      study in more detail along with informed consent. If the participant wishes to continue in&#xD;
      the study, they will return the questionnaire to the research team, who will contact them&#xD;
      from this point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also be recruited through presentations at local support groups as well as&#xD;
      advertisements in local papers and posters at local hospitals and recreation centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to G*Power a sample of 40 prostate and breast cancer survivors per group (n=120) is&#xD;
      needed to detect a medium effect size (d= .50) on our primary outcome (i.e., PA) with a power&#xD;
      of 0.80, at a p-level of 0.05. We expect a 20% attrition rate, based on previous research&#xD;
      (McGowan, North, &amp; Courneya, 2013; Vallance, Courneya, Plotnikoff, Yasui, &amp; Mackey, 2007)&#xD;
      therefore we will attempt to recruit a sample of 150 breast and prostate cancer survivors,&#xD;
      which would allow for 50 participants per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses of covariance will be used to examine group differences on our primary outcome&#xD;
      (i.e., PA minute/week) at month 1 and month 3, and secondary outcomes (e.g., QoL) at month 3.&#xD;
      Additional analyses of covariance will be run to explore the group differences on sedentary&#xD;
      behaviour, and light, moderate and vigorous minutes of activity/week at month 1 and month 3.&#xD;
      Medical (e.g., comorbidities, months since diagnosis) and demographic (e.g., marital status,&#xD;
      age, BMI) will be tested as possible moderators of PA behaviour change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If we experience a large proportion of missing data multiple imputation techniques in SPSS&#xD;
      will be used to replace missing values. Otherwise, a last outcome carried forward approach&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationships between self-reported PA and QoL, and objectively measured PA and QoL in&#xD;
      older breast and prostate cancer survivors will be explored. To examine this, differences in&#xD;
      QoL between participants in the two PA categories (i.e., meeting PA guidelines and not&#xD;
      meeting PA guidelines) will be tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA). These analyses will&#xD;
      be repeated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to control for the demographic and medical&#xD;
      variables that had statistically significant associations with the QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between objectively measured PA and self-reported PA will be explored using&#xD;
      a two-way mixed intraclass correlation coefficient to calculate the level of absolute&#xD;
      agreement between the two types of measurements.&#xD;
