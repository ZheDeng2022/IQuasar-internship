      This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects and how well cetuximab before surgery&#xD;
      works in treating patients with skin cancer that forms, grows, and spreads quickly and has&#xD;
      spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes. Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      cetuximab, may block tumor growth in different ways be targeting certain cells. Giving&#xD;
      cetuximab before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue&#xD;
      that needs to be removed.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the response rate of cetuximab by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (RECIST) criteria in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of skin (SCCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess whether neoadjuvant cetuximab given in this patient population is both safe and&#xD;
      feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure the progression free and overall survival of patients with advanced SCCS who&#xD;
      receive neoadjuvant cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the conversion to resectability of patients treated with neoadjuvant&#xD;
      cetuximab and capture changes in reconstructive options rendered possible by neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Analyze the relationship of known deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mutations in tumor per the&#xD;
      FoundationOneTM genomic profile, and correlate to clinical endpoints such as clinical benefit&#xD;
      and conversion to resectability to discover potential markers of response and/or resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Measure the downstream activation of signaling pathways without a known driver, including&#xD;
      the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine if tumor shrinkage with cetuximab is associated with increased apoptosis as&#xD;
      evidenced by activated caspase-3, in pre- and post- treatment tumor tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Determine whether cetuximab results in increased antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity&#xD;
      (ADCC) in post-, compared with pre-treatment tumor tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 60-120 minutes once weekly for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;
