  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CD40 Ligand (CD40L) has been identified as a key feature in systemic lupus erythematosus&#xD;
      (SLE) pathogenesis, a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by a multiorgan involvement.&#xD;
      As platelets are a major source of soluble CD40L (sCD40L), we propose to study the effect of&#xD;
      clopidogrel, a platelet inhibitor, on plasmatic sCD40L levels in SLE patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type I interferon (IFN) and CD40L have been identified as important in SLE pathogenesis (1).&#xD;
      CD40L is now considered as a biomarker of lupus activity (4). Because platelets represent a&#xD;
      major reservoir of CD40L, we previously studied the role of platelet derived CD40L in SLE&#xD;
      pathogenesis (5). We showed that platelets from SLE patients were activated in vivo by&#xD;
      circulating immune complexes composed of autoantibodies bound to self antigens through a&#xD;
      Fc-gamma Receptor IIa (CD32)-dependent mechanism. Further, platelet activation correlated&#xD;
      with severity of the disease and activated platelets formed aggregates with&#xD;
      antigen-presenting cells including monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. In addition,&#xD;
      activated platelets enhanced IFN-α secretion by immune complexes-stimulated plasmacytoid&#xD;
      dendritic cells in vitro through a CD154-CD40 interaction. In lupus prone mice, depletion of&#xD;
      platelets or administration of the clopidogrel improved all measures of disease activity and&#xD;
      overall survival. In this pilot study the treatment of the research is clopidogrel given at&#xD;
      the dose of 75mg once a day. For the features of the treatment, its contraindications, its&#xD;
      disruption in case of side effects cf to annex 1. Clopidogrel associated with the usual&#xD;
      treatment of patients will be given for 12 weeks, the follow up of patients will be 16 weeks,&#xD;
      all side effects occurring during this period will be recorded.&#xD;
