      This research project will test the feasibility and effectiveness of group acupuncture for&#xD;
      the treatment of musculoskeletal pain (back pain, shoulder pain, neck pain and/or&#xD;
      osteoarthritis). Patients 18 years of age or older, who understand English, are experiencing&#xD;
      chronic musculoskeletal pain for three months or more and have not received acupuncture&#xD;
      therapy in the past 3 months will be invited to participate. We will recruit 120 outpatients&#xD;
      with chronic pain from Mount Sinai Beth Israel's (MSBI) Family Medicine and other primary&#xD;
      care practices. Referrals will be through primary care providers or by patient self-referral.&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to develop a low-cost, effective integrative intervention for&#xD;
      chronic pain which can be replicated in underserved settings across the U.S. The physician in&#xD;
      charge of this study is Benjamin Kligler, M.D., M.P.H.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be scheduled for a face-to-face interview, at which time consent&#xD;
      will be obtained and baseline measures will be collected. Baseline measures include&#xD;
      collecting demographic data and information on depression, pain/pain free days and medication&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To follow, a 4-week run-in period where usual care is delivered will be held to establish&#xD;
      baseline pain levels. During this time, participants will be contacted at 2-week intervals to&#xD;
      complete a brief pain assessment. If a waiting list becomes necessary, delay may become&#xD;
      longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be invited to participate in an 8-week, group-based acupuncture&#xD;
      treatment intervention delivered by a licensed acupuncturist. The group will meet weekly for&#xD;
      8 consecutive weeks, each session lasting about 75 minutes held at the Center for Health and&#xD;
      Healing located at 245 Fifth Ave in Manhattan. Sessions will be held during evening and&#xD;
      weekend hours to facilitate scheduling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect information on pain, pain symptoms, mood, function and analgesic use at 1, 8,&#xD;
      12 and 24 week(s) following the beginning of the intervention. We will collect this&#xD;
      information in-person or by telephone as preferred by the participant. Participants will not&#xD;
      receive an incentive to attend group sessions but will receive incentives at enrollment and&#xD;
      for completing research interviews at 12 and 24 weeks following treatment intervention ($20&#xD;
      at each of these three time points).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While subject records are confidential, there may be loss of confidentiality due to the group&#xD;
      acupuncture setting. Intervention risks are low: Acupuncture needles are pre-sterilized and&#xD;
      inserted once only and then properly discarded. Acupuncture therapy is safe with a 'relative'&#xD;
      risk that is low. The risks associated with providing protected health information (PHI) will&#xD;
      be minimized by assigning a unique participant identification code (ID number) that will be&#xD;
      used to identify all data reported for each participant. The study staff will store all PHI&#xD;
      in a secure and protected site at the Center for Health and Healing. The study results will&#xD;
      be stored in a locked cabinet and any study information stored in a computer will be password&#xD;
      protected. Only the study staff will have access to the study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be reminded of the elements of participation.&#xD;
