  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study on patients to compare the effects of CPAP on lung volume diaphragm&#xD;
      motion, heart position and tumor motion compared to free breathing. Only patients with&#xD;
      significant tumor motion of greater than 1 cm amplitude or unfavorable chest wall geometry&#xD;
      (heart close to chest wall) identified on standard imaging and simulation will be candidates&#xD;
      for the study. Patients will be re- simulated and planned for radiation treatments with CPAP.&#xD;
      The radiation plans generated with and without CPAP will be compared to evaluate the impact&#xD;
      of CPAP on tumor motion and dose delivered to adjacent critical structures such as the heart&#xD;
      and lung.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate effectiveness of CPAP to reproducibly reduce tumor and organ motion during&#xD;
           radiation therapy treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if CPAP allows for a reduction in normal tissue receiving radiation in chest&#xD;
           and abdomen tumors and reduce heart exposure for patients receiving left breast&#xD;
           irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entry Criteria: This is a proof of concept and feasibility study. We propose to study 10&#xD;
      patients in each group for a total of thirty patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria Group1. Lung tumors and nodules with tumor motion greater than 1 cm on&#xD;
      standard imaging (n=10) Group2. Left sided breast tumors with unfavorable anatomy, viz heart&#xD;
      abutting chest wall (n=10) Group3. Upper abdominal tumors: Liver and Pancreas with tumor&#xD;
      motion greater than 1 cm. (n=10)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pretreatment evaluations/management for patients meeting eligibility criteria CPAP All&#xD;
      patients will be evaluated by a pulmonologist for their respiratory performances including&#xD;
      physical examination, oxygen saturation and pulmonary function tests including DLCO that will&#xD;
      serve for baseline measures. Then, adjustment session will be performed aiming to get&#xD;
      adjusted to a CPAP device till the maximal tolerated pressure is not more than 16 cmH20 (TBD)&#xD;
      for 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients must be able to tolerate CPAP and comply with daily treatment. 4D CT: CT&#xD;
      simulation is the basis of conformal treatment planning [24, 25]. By using a slow acquisition&#xD;
      time of 3 minutes the motion effects due to breathing can be captured and a 4D image&#xD;
      generated. The tumor position can be imaged throughout the breathing cycle and a Maximum&#xD;
      Intensity Projection (MIP) can be constructed and used in treatment planning. If there is no&#xD;
      tumor motion the size of the MIP would equal the tumor size. The MIP size will increase with&#xD;
      increasing tumor motion. The planning software allows us to calculate the MIP dimensions and&#xD;
      volume. In addition total lung volumes and change in diaphragm position can be calculated&#xD;
      (Figure 1). Radiation therapy planning parameters and volumetric analysis of tumor and normal&#xD;
      tissue motion and position are calculated using available software and transferred to the&#xD;
      Eclipse treatment planning system [17].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Planning:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Eclipse treatment planning system will be used to generate and compare plans for&#xD;
      treatment with and without CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulation All treatment planning and CPAP evaluation will be done in the radiation therapy&#xD;
      department. Patients will be simulated on the Phillips 4D big bore CT simulator. The 4D scan&#xD;
      which is done slowly over several minutes allows us to assess the full range of tumor motion&#xD;
      throughout the respiratory cycle. An ITV is calculated which includes the actual tumor size&#xD;
      with an expansion to account for the range of motion of the tumor by accounting for tumor&#xD;
      location throughout the respiratory cycle (MIP) The MIP is the basis for the ITV and is the&#xD;
      structure used for treatment planning. Patients recruited for the study will be re-simulated&#xD;
      with the patient in the same position while undergoing CPAP treatment. ITV size and volume&#xD;
      will be calculated for the tumor in in both the standard and CPAP studies and used for&#xD;
      planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RPM: Diaphragm motion and respiratory cycle information will be obtained using the RPM for&#xD;
      both the standard and the CPAP simulations. Differences in the respiratory wave cycle will be&#xD;
      recorded [17].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MIP/ITV images will be transferred to the Eclipse treatment planning system and using&#xD;
      both the standard breathing and CPAP simulations treatment plans will be generated. Standard&#xD;
      radiation plan evaluation parameters will be used and plans compared with respect to tumor&#xD;
      coverage and normal tissue and normal tissue in the radiation field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identical field arrangements will be generated for CPAP and non CPAP plans. Plans will be&#xD;
      evaluated using standard radiation therapy planning parameters including: MIP or ITV, total&#xD;
      lung volume, volume of GTV/CTV/PTV/ V20 and MLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre treatment Compare standard conformal radiation plans using Eclipse treatment planning&#xD;
      system for each patient with and without CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RPM tracings with and without CPAP will be compared for all groups pre- treatment.&#xD;
