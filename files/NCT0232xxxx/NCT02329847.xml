  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and to establish the recommended phase 2&#xD;
      dose (RP2D) for the combination of ibrutinib and nivolumab in participants with chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), follicular cell lymphoma (FL)&#xD;
      and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Once the dose is optimized, the combination will&#xD;
      be assessed for Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy, further safety&#xD;
      in participants with CLL/SLL, FL or DLBCL and in participants with Richter syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study, which consists of Part A (Dose Optimization Cohorts) and Part B&#xD;
      (Expansion Cohorts). Part A consists of two dose optimization cohorts (cohort A1 and cohort&#xD;
      A2) will determine the RP2D for the combination based on safety, pharmacokinetic, and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic assessments in participants with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL or B-cell&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). Part B consists 3 participant populations to further evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and clinical activity of ibrutinib in combination with nivolumab: Cohort B1&#xD;
      (participants with CLL/SLL with del 17p or del 11q), Cohort B2 (participants with FL), Cohort&#xD;
      B3 (participants with DLBCL) and Cohort B4 (participants with Richter syndrome). Part A and B&#xD;
      will consist of Screening Period (28 days before enrollment), Treatment Period and Follow up&#xD;
      Period (every 3 months until death or the end of study). Participants will receive nivolumab&#xD;
      intravenously (Day 1 of every cycle) and ibrutinib orally once daily on a 14-day cycle.&#xD;
      Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic&#xD;
      Leukemia (IWCLL) and International Working Group (IWG) for lymphoma guidelines. Participants'&#xD;
      safety will be monitored throughout the study. Further exploration of&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and biomarker information will be assessed throughout the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

    <description>An AE was any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>
