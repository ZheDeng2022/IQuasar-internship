      This study aims to evaluate the Zenalux IM1, an optical spectroscopy device with a pressure&#xD;
      sensor. The pressure sensor is intended to overcome the inconsistencies attributable to&#xD;
      variations in use of the device. This study will involve using the device on healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. Three tissue parameters will be used to analyze the pressure effects in two ways:&#xD;
      within- and across-subject variability. Measurements will be taken under the tongue and on&#xD;
      the inside of the cheek. The device is noninvasive and is approved for preclinical use.&#xD;

      PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There exist significant systematic and random errors in the in vivo spectroscopic&#xD;
           measurement of tissue hemoglobin concentrations, blood oxygenation, and scattering&#xD;
           coefficient due to uncontrolled probe-to-tissue interface and the lack of a real-time&#xD;
           calibration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. It is possible to design and engineer a fiber optic sensor to perform accurate and&#xD;
           reproducible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) for noninvasive quantification of&#xD;
           tissue physiology and morphology in vivo. Features such as probe pressure control and&#xD;
           instrument self-calibration will improve signal-to-noise ratios by removing user bias&#xD;
           from optical measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Evaluation of the pressure sensor in healthy volunteers to determine the minimum contact&#xD;
      pressure required for spectroscopic measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN AND PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the pressure sensor in a volunteer study (n=10)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained from all volunteers. In order to assess the pressure&#xD;
      sensor, all research procedures will be repeated twice (once with the aid of the stepper&#xD;
      motor and once without the aid of the stepper motor.) For the first five subjects,&#xD;
      measurements will be made with the stepper motor first followed by measurements without the&#xD;
      stepper motor. The remaining five-subjects will receive the measurements in the reverse order&#xD;
      (no stepper motor following by stepper motor). Before the optical measurements, all subjects&#xD;
      will be asked to rinse their mouth with a 0.9% saline solution in order to minimize the&#xD;
      influence of consumed food. The instrument is high-level disinfected prior to each use in&#xD;
      cidex or sterilized by ethylene oxide per standard clinical procedure. Furthermore, it is not&#xD;
      anticipated that this device will pose a significant risk to vulnerable populations. The&#xD;
      probe will be covered with an optically clear protective sterile sheath and placed in contact&#xD;
      with the soft tissue. Reflectance measurements will be taken from each volunteer at up to 5&#xD;
      pressure levels (25, 50, 75, 100, 150 mmHg). At each pressure level 10 spectra will be&#xD;
      acquired sequentially. The first measurement will start immediately after the desired probe&#xD;
      pressure is reached. This will generate a total of 100 sample and calibration spectra pairs&#xD;
      from each subject. This will be repeated on other sites including the tongue, cheek and gums.&#xD;
      The sample spectrum will be calibrated using the calibration spectrum collected concurrently.&#xD;
      Three tissue parameters will be used to analyze the pressure effects which is described here&#xD;
      with [THb] as an example: First, the mean [THb] and its standard deviation will be calculated&#xD;
      from the 10 repeat measurements at each pressure for each subject for measurements with and&#xD;
      without the stepper motor and plotted against the probe pressure (refer to as THb-P curve).&#xD;
      Second, at each pressure level, the [THb] will be plotted against time for each subject and&#xD;
      the curve will indicate the temporal response of the tissue under that probe pressure. A&#xD;
      series of paired t-tests will be used to identify the contact pressure at which minimal [THb]&#xD;
      variance occurs over time (when stepper motor is used). Next, the variance at that contact&#xD;
      pressure will be compared to the case without the stepper motor to demonstrate a significant&#xD;
      reduction in pressure variance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators do not anticipate any risks to participants, however, there are a few&#xD;
      potential minimal risks such as loss of confidentiality; slight risk of infection; discomfort&#xD;
      at the pressure sites; and jaw discomfort as a result of the mouth being opened for several&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
