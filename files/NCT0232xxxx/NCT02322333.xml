    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-center study. Subjects agreeing&#xD;
      to participate in the study and meet the entry criteria assessed at the screening visit, will&#xD;
      begin a 28 day baseline period to confirm their diagnosis, as well as establish baseline&#xD;
      migraine characteristics. During this baseline period, subjects will continue treating their&#xD;
      migraines as usual, simply recording the information in a daily headache diary. Subjects who,&#xD;
      after completing the baseline, continue to meet entrance criteria will be eligible to enter&#xD;
      into the treatment phase and be randomized according to the Clinvest generated randomization&#xD;
      schedule. Approximately 142 subjects (71 subjects per arm) will be randomized and enter the&#xD;
      treatment phase receiving MLD10 or placebo in a 1:1 design at 6 United States sites. Diary&#xD;
      assessments will collect study medication adherence, pain severity, headache symptoms, acute&#xD;
      medication usage, and unusual symptoms. Serum samples will be collected and analyzed for&#xD;
      ionized magnesium, electrolytes, and creatinine.&#xD;

      This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study of MLD10&#xD;
      for the prevention of migraine headache. The study population will consist of approximately&#xD;
      142 male and female subjects between 18 and 65 years of age with frequent episodic migraine&#xD;
      as defined by International Classification of Headache Disorders-3beta criteria. Two MLD10&#xD;
      (243 mg (milligrams) of elemental magnesium) or placebo caplets will be taken twice daily for&#xD;
      a total daily dose of 486 mg.&#xD;

The MIDAS test determines how severely migraines affect daily functioning. The responses of a variety of questions will be scored according to the questionnaire's scoring guide. A total score will be calculated ranging from 0-93. A score of 0-5 indicates little or no disability, 6-10 mild disability, 11-20, moderate disability, 21+ severe disability.</description>
