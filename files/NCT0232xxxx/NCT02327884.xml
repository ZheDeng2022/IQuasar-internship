      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Salivary glands in and around the mouth and throat make saliva. Salivary gland disorders&#xD;
      can affect a person s quality of life. Studying people who have a disease that affects their&#xD;
      salivary gland(s) may teach researchers about the disorders and their genetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study salivary gland diseases and disorders. To collect data and samples from people&#xD;
      with salivary gland problems and their relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People more than 4 years old who have or are suspected to have a disease involving&#xD;
           salivary glands.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their relatives more than 4 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General oral and dental history and exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Saliva collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye exam and test for dry eyes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health questionnaires (adults)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsy of some minor salivary glands. A small incision will be made on the inside of the&#xD;
           lower lip and several tiny salivary glands will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 2 3 visits. These may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeats of some screening tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasounds of some glands. Researchers will put some gel on the face, then press on it&#xD;
           with a smooth wand.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults may have other biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A small catheter inserted into the opening of the parotid gland duct on the inside of&#xD;
           the cheek. A saline solution (in a syringe) will fill the duct.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Swishing a saltwater solution in the mouth for 10 seconds and then spitting into a cup&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scrapings collected from teeth, tongue, and cheeks&#xD;

      This protocol is intended to allow disease-specific investigations in subjects with&#xD;
      presentations of diseases with salivary gland involvement and will enable the collection of&#xD;
      data, biological fluids and tissue samples from those subjects, their family members and&#xD;
      normal controls, in order to assist our studies of understanding salivary gland disease&#xD;
      pathophysiology. The exocrine salivary glands, by secreting saliva, play a critical role in&#xD;
      the homeostasis of the oral cavity, which is the initial part of the gastrointestinal track.&#xD;
      Several diseases including Parkinson s and systemic amyloidosis can be diagnosed through&#xD;
      biopsies of easily accessible salivary glands. Moreover, several drugs and systemic diseases&#xD;
      cause salivary gland hypofunction through unknown mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We may evaluate participants with complaints of dry mouth to determine the cause and severity&#xD;
      of their salivary gland dysfunction and their possible eligibility for other NIDCR protocols.&#xD;
      Salivary secretions have antibacterial, lubricating, remineralizing, digestive, buffering and&#xD;
      cleansing properties. Impaired function of these glands can cause an increase in tooth decay;&#xD;
      a variety of oral hard and soft tissue changes, with painful, burning or ulcerated or oral&#xD;
      mucosa; problems chewing, swallowing and speaking; and diminished taste and smell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will provide us with the opportunity to learn from a variety of pathologies&#xD;
      that involve directly or indirectly the salivary glands, expand our knowledge about these&#xD;
      disorders and provide access to patients of interest for research, teaching, and clinical&#xD;
      experience. Information obtained through this protocol may lead to potential innovative&#xD;
      therapeutic studies. In addition to its role in investigating individuals who are of interest&#xD;
      to the Sjogren s syndrome (SS) and Salivary Gland Dysfunction Unit of the MPTB of NIDCR, this&#xD;
      protocol can provide a possible avenue for enrolling subjects from other NIH programs or&#xD;
      other NIH protocols that exhibit signs or symptoms associated with the salivary glands&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
