  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dapagliflozin has been effective at lowering glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) in subjects&#xD;
      with tpye 2 diabetes (T2DM), when studied as monotherapy as well as in combination with&#xD;
      insulin or oral anti-diabetic medications.This lead to investigations if this therapy would&#xD;
      also be of benefit in type 1 diabetes as intensive insulin therapy is associated with glucose&#xD;
      fluctuations, hypoglycemia, weight gain, and subsequent insulin resistance, all of which may&#xD;
      reduce efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the pilot study is to collect clinical data on the HbA1c-dependent effect of a&#xD;
      single-dose of 10mg dapagliflozin on the insulin dose administered intravenously during a&#xD;
      glucose-infusion and an oral mixed-meal for the ensuing 24 hours with blood glucose kept&#xD;
      between 160 - 220 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective is to investigate the degree of insulin dose reduction 24 hours after a&#xD;
      single dose of 10mg dapagliflozin in patients with type 1 diabetes Further objectives are to&#xD;
      investigate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the effect on urinary glucose excretion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if this effect is influenced by baseline glycemic control&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if dapagliflozin influences postprandial insulin need&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if dapagliflozin is associated with elevated ß-hydroxybutyrate levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PK after oral administration of 10mg dapagliflozin&#xD;

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety profile and tolerability, particularly&#xD;
      with regard to hypoglycemia and ketone development, following once daily oral dose of 10 mg&#xD;
      of dapagliflozin administered in subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) as a single dose as&#xD;
      well as pharmacokinetics (PK) for 18 hours of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aimed to patients who have different degrees of inadequate glycemic control despite&#xD;
      insulin use. Approximately 36 subjects will be screened in order to randomize 10 patients in&#xD;
      each different HbA1C category.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will consist of six visits: a screening visit (Visit 1), two dosing visits (Visit 2&#xD;
      and Visit 4), two phone visits (Visit 3 and Visit 5) and a follow-up visit (Visit 6).&#xD;
      Furthermore, an information visit will take place prior to the screening visit in order to&#xD;
      obtain patient's informed consent. Screening will take place 2-21 days prior to Visit 2 and&#xD;
      the follow-up visit will take place 5-21 days after the end of Visit 4. The dosing visits&#xD;
      will be separated by a wash-out period (5-30 days between the end of Visit 2 and begin of&#xD;
      Visit 4) during which the subjects will resume their normal insulin treatment. Each phone&#xD;
      visit (Visit 3 and Visit 5) will take place 3-5 days after the end of dosing Visits 2 and 4.&#xD;
      The planned total duration of the trial is 18-78 days per subject (rescheduled visits&#xD;
      excluded). Each subject will be randomised to a treatment sequence consisting of two&#xD;
      treatment periods in which the subjects will receive dapagliflozin and placebo on two&#xD;
      separate dosing visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects metabolic control will be achieved by a variable i.v. infusion of human insulin by&#xD;
      an infusion pump. The procedure will be used in order to aim and maintain blood glucose&#xD;
      levels between 160 and 220 mg/dl thereby being in the range of the urinary threshold of&#xD;
      glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fluid infusion and insulin dosing scheme will depend on body weight (BW) and blood&#xD;
      glucose (BG) levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two standardized mixed-meals will be given 6 hours and 12 hours after dosing. Blood glucose&#xD;
      measurements will be performed every 15min for 120min after the mixed-meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for determination of dapagliflozin concentration in serum will be taken 18times&#xD;
      in 24hours as well as every urine sample will be collected for 24 hours after dosing for the&#xD;
      determination of 24hour urinary glucose and creatinine for efficacy measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After conclusion of the trial the documented insulin doses over time will be summed up for&#xD;
      calculation of the total insulin dose and the insulin dose per kg body weight per 24 hours.&#xD;
      Separate calculations will be done for the overnight period pre-dosing, six hours after&#xD;
      dosing, two hours prior and after the first and second Standard Meal and until the end of the&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
