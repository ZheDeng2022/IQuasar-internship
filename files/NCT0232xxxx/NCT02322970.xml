      Investigators aim to assess sensitivity and specificity of transcranial doppler in ruling out&#xD;
      intracranial hypertension in all patients admitted to intensive care unit for brain injury&#xD;
      and needing Intracranial Pressure (ICP) monitoring (according to international guidelines).&#xD;
      Non invasive ICP measurement through the use of transcranial doppler will be carried out&#xD;
      before and after standard invasive ICP monitoring placement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of intensive treatment of brain injury, intracranial pressure (ICP) should be&#xD;
      controlled when the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) falls below 60-70 millimeters of&#xD;
      mercury (mmHg) (depending on the cause of injury) and/or the ICP is greater than 20 mmHg.&#xD;
      Intracranial hypertension (ICHP) occurs in approximately 30-40% of all patients with severe&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury and it is not infrequent in patients with non traumatic brain injury,&#xD;
      such as subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH), and&#xD;
      ischemic stroke (IS), and the presence of ICHP and inadequate CPP has been correlated to poor&#xD;
      outcome. Therefore, measures to monitor ICP and CPP should be instituted as soon as possible&#xD;
      in patients with severe brain injury. Currently, available methods for ICP monitoring include&#xD;
      epidural, subdural, subarachnoid, parenchymal, and ventricular locations. Historically,&#xD;
      ventricular ICP catheter has been used as the reference standard and the preferred technique&#xD;
      when possible. It is the most accurate, and reliable method of monitoring ICP. Subarachnoid,&#xD;
      subdural, and epidural monitors are less accurate. Unfortunately, all of the described&#xD;
      methods are invasive, associated with a complication rate and are not inexpensive. For this&#xD;
      reason, new methods have been developed in order to measure ICP non invasively. Transcranial&#xD;
      Doppler (TCD) allows insonation of the basal cerebral arteries and the measurement of blood&#xD;
      flow velocities in such vessels in by using a low-frequency-pulsed Doppler of 2 Mega Hertz&#xD;
      (MHz) over the acoustic window regions. Many authors have analysed the doppler wave shape and&#xD;
      the relation among diastolic, systolic and mean velocities in order to find a correlation&#xD;
      with ICP and CPP. Few formulas have been described, in our study, the method introduced and&#xD;
      tested by Schmidt et Al. in 2000 was adopted. Those authors observed a relationship among&#xD;
      mean arterial blood pressure (ABP) diastolic flow velocity (FVd) and mean flow velocity (FVm)&#xD;
      in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) that led them to find a formula able to yield CPP&#xD;
      (estimated CPP: ABP x FVd / FVm + 14); once CPP is estimated, ICPtcd is easily calculated&#xD;
      (ICP= ABP- CPP). The first aim of our study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of&#xD;
      ICPtcd, compared to invasive ICP measurement, in order to exclude elevated ICP in patients&#xD;
      with acute brain injury such as epidural hematomas (EDH), subdural hematomas (SDH),&#xD;
      subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH), ischaemic strokes (IS),&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury (TBI). Inclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  acute brain injury requiring invasive ICP monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &gt; 18 yrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  inaccessible or poor acoustic ultrasound window;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a cardiovascular disease causing hemodynamic variations affecting the TCD reading&#xD;
           (severe arrhythmia, severe cardiac valvular stenosis, moderate or severe vasospasm);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients receiving craniotomy or had craniectomy before first time frame 1°,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  any treatment for intracranial hypertension or manipulation of arterial blood pressure&#xD;
           between the non-invasive ICPtcd measurements and the invasive ICP (ICPi) measurement.&#xD;
           (This is most likely to happen during time frame 1°).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients included will have evaluation of non-invasive ICP monitoring through use of TCD&#xD;
      (ICPtcd), and at least three TCD Measurements will be performed and correlated with&#xD;
      non-invasive ICP. The timing for the TCD measurements and correlations will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1° measurement: will be performed before, and as close as possible, to ICP monitoring&#xD;
           probe placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2° measurement. Immediately following ICP monitoring probe placement;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3° measurement: after ICP management optimization (2-3 hours after the second&#xD;
           measurement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first brain CT will be performed before invasive ICP placement (this CT scan is normally&#xD;
      performed for diagnostic purposes) and whenever it is appropriate to perform the second scan,&#xD;
      either for a change in clinical status, or according to guidelines and clinical judgment. If&#xD;
      possible from 8 - 12 hrs following the first scan.&#xD;
