      A Prospective, Multicenter, Randomized Phase-Ii Trial Comparing Efficacy And Safety Of&#xD;
      Fludarabine + Cyclophosphamide + Ga101 (Fcg) And Bendamustine + Ga101 (Bg) In Patients With&#xD;
      Relapsed Or Refractory Cll Followed By Maintenance Therapy With Ga101 For Responding Patients&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The type II anti-CD20 antibody GA101 has demonstrated a high efficacy as single agent (ORR&#xD;
      62%) and was well tolerated in previously treated patients with CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, there is evidence that immunochemotherapy consisting of fludarabine,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) is active in patients with refractory and relapsed CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides FCR, the combination of bendamustine with rituximab (BR) has shown to be active in&#xD;
      both relapsed and previously untreated patients with CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preclinical studies GA101, a glycoengineered, humanized type II anti-CD20 antibody, has&#xD;
      shown superior activity compared with type I antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a combination therapy with FC + GA101 (FCG) or B + GA101 (BG) might further&#xD;
      improve the therapeutic outcome in relapsed or refractory CLL. The CLLR3 trial was designed&#xD;
      to investigate and to compare the efficacy and safety of induction with both&#xD;
      immunochemotherapies followed additionally by a maintenance therapy with GA101 for responding&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
