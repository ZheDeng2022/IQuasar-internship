    <textblock>
      Skeletal muscle burns a significant amount of the fat and sugar that circulates in the blood&#xD;
      stream. Ideally, when sugar is elevated in the blood stream, the muscle will either use it to&#xD;
      make new energy or store it for later use. Likewise, for fatty acids. Skeletal muscle of&#xD;
      obese and diabetic humans has been shown to inadequately use either sugar or fatty acids when&#xD;
      they increase in the blood stream, and this has been termed metabolic inflexibility. The&#xD;
      cause of metabolic inflexibility is not known, but it is believed that eating more fat than&#xD;
      the body needs for energy may be a contributing factor. Metabolic inflexibility in skeletal&#xD;
      muscle is bad because if the muscle does not use the sugar or fat, it will be stored&#xD;
      elsewhere in the body and potentially lead to obesity and the resistance to insulin. The&#xD;
      investigators have performed a research study with nonobese, healthy humans during which we&#xD;
      fed them a high fat diet for 5 days. Interesting, only 5 days of a high fat diet is&#xD;
      sufficient to cause the skeletal muscle to become metabolically inflexible just like that&#xD;
      observed in obese and diabetic humans. The investigators are proposing addition studies to&#xD;
      feed healthy humans a high fat diet for 5 days in effort to better understand what causes&#xD;
      metabolic flexibility. The investigators are speculating that a high fat diet causes the&#xD;
      intestines to release a substance called endotoxin that causes muscle to become metabolically&#xD;
      inflexible. The investigators will test this notion in our proposed studies.&#xD;

      Objective: To discern the potential mechanism(s) by which high saturated fat feeding disrupts&#xD;
      normal skeletal muscle metabolism. Our working hypothesis is that high saturated fat feeding&#xD;
      increases gut permeability and blood endotoxin, which elicits pro-inflammatory signaling in&#xD;
      skeletal muscle and alters the normal adaptive response to a meal. Preliminary evidence using&#xD;
      a model of acute (5 days), high saturated fat feeding, isocaloric to habitual intake, in&#xD;
      healthy, non-obese humans is presented herein to support this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: The inability for skeletal muscle to adapt fuel oxidation to fuel availability is&#xD;
      termed metabolic inflexibility, a well characterized feature of disease states such as&#xD;
      obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The mechanism(s) responsible for&#xD;
      skeletal muscle metabolic inflexibility are not known. Recently, there has been growing&#xD;
      interest in the role of gut permeability and blood endotoxin in the pathology of metabolic&#xD;
      derangements associated with obesity and T2D. Rodent studies have revealed direct links&#xD;
      between the gut microbiome and metabolic disease, as well as associations between elevated&#xD;
      blood endotoxin and metabolic dysregulation, both at the whole body and tissue level. High&#xD;
      fat feeding in rodents is known to elicit elevated levels of blood endotoxin, a phenomenon&#xD;
      that is termed metabolic endotoxemia. In humans, obesity and T2D are associated with&#xD;
      increased blood endotoxin and single meals have been shown to elevate blood endotoxin, but to&#xD;
      date, there is no evidence in humans that high fat feeding results in metabolic endotoxemia.&#xD;
      Moreover, there are no established links between gut permeability, metabolic endotoxemia, and&#xD;
      skeletal muscle metabolic function in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach. We are proposing to utilize a model of acute high fat feeding in healthy humans to&#xD;
      study the interplay between gut function, blood endotoxin, and skeletal muscle&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory signaling and metabolic adaptability. We will employ a two-week lead-in&#xD;
      period, during which research participants will be fed prepared meals that are isocaloric to&#xD;
      their habitual diet, followed by five days of high saturated fat feeding. The high saturated&#xD;
      fat feeding period will consist of prepared meals that are isocaloric to habitual diet with a&#xD;
      macronutrient composition of 50% fat (45% of which will be saturated fat), 35% carbohydrate,&#xD;
      and 15% protein. Studying healthy, nonobese humans in this context is an innovative approach&#xD;
      on two levels: 1) any confounding influences associated with metabolic disease (obesity,&#xD;
      diabetes, or metabolic syndrome) are eliminated, e.g., insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia,&#xD;
      impaired gut function, pre-existing metabolic dysfunction and inflammatory tone; and 2) the&#xD;
      isocaloric feeding design negates the confounding influence of a positive energy balance and&#xD;
      allows us to specifically examine the effects of acutely increasing dietary saturated fat.&#xD;
