      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Researchers want to learn more about breast cancer in Latin American women. They also want&#xD;
      to learn how and why women respond differently to standard treatment. Tissue and blood&#xD;
      samples from women with breast cancer are needed to study this disease in order to find new&#xD;
      ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn more about the biology and genetics of breast cancer in Latin American women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Latin American women age 18 and older of all ethnic backgrounds who have clinical stage II&#xD;
      or III breast cancer. They must still be active and able to self-care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants are only agreeing to have extra tissue or blood samples collected. They are&#xD;
           also letting tissue left over from surgery be used for research. No procedures outside&#xD;
           of standard care will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests. They may have a&#xD;
           pregnancy test. They may have an ultrasound, mammogram, and other scans. They may have&#xD;
           an intravenous needle placed in an arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have a core biopsy. For this, a needle is inserted into the breast. A&#xD;
           piece of tissue is extracted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who have chemotherapy may have blood taken after treatment/before surgery.&#xD;
           Tissue may also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete a questionnaire. It will ask about their social and economic&#xD;
           background. It will ask about their family history of cancer. It will also ask about&#xD;
           access to diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may be followed for up to 5 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to characterize the distribution of molecular profiles&#xD;
      in Latin American women with AJCC 7 clinical stage II or III breast cancer. The molecular&#xD;
      profiles will be correlated with epidemiological, histological, and clinical characteristics,&#xD;
      including pathologic response to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Moreover, this study&#xD;
      intends to define a molecular signature that will predict response to neoadjuvant therapy in&#xD;
      breast cancer. This is a prospective cohort study in which no investigational drugs will be&#xD;
      administered to participants. The study will be conducted at participating institutions in&#xD;
      Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Uruguay.&#xD;

        The primary objective of the study is to characterize the distribution of invasive breast&#xD;
        cancer stage II or III by immunohistochemistry and gene expression profiles in Latin&#xD;
        American women. The study has two parts: Part A is a descriptive, observational part to&#xD;
        characterize the molecular profile of breast cancer in Latin American women; Part B, the&#xD;
        standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment part of the study, seeks to identify any&#xD;
        associations between response to neoadjuvant therapy and the molecular profiles.&#xD;
        Participants will be followed for a period of 5 years to determine any associations between&#xD;
        the molecular profiles and disease evolution following standard treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AJCC 7 clinical stage II or III breast cancer. Clarification: Participants with&#xD;
             clinical stage II breast cancer who are later classified as histologically-confirmed&#xD;
             stage I will remain on study; participants who are later classified as&#xD;
             histologically-confirmed stage IV breast cancer will be taken off study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Biopsy-accessible breast tumor or participant candidates for primary surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history of non-breast malignancy (excluding in situ cancers treated only by&#xD;
             local excision and basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin) within 5 years&#xD;
             prior to enrollment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilateral invasive or in-situ breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inflammatory breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical or radiological evidence of distant metastases by computed tomography (CT),&#xD;
             chest X-ray, abdominal/thoracic ultrasound, bone scan, and/or liver function tests&#xD;
             including total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase&#xD;
             (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), within ranges defined in eligibility criteria&#xD;
             for Part B of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior hormone therapy, chemotherapy, biologic, targeted therapies, or radiation&#xD;
             therapy for this malignancy. Prior bisphosphonate therapy is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and lactating women: Effects on a developing human fetus of chemotherapeutic&#xD;
             agents at the recommended therapeutic dose remain incompletely defined. For this&#xD;
             reason and because these agents may be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential&#xD;
             must agree to use adequate contraception (double barrier methods of birth control or&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study treatment phase. Should&#xD;
             a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,&#xD;
             she should inform her study physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with chemotherapeutic agents, women who are&#xD;
             breastfeeding will be excluded. If a participant is of child-bearing potential (women&#xD;
             are not considered of childbearing potential if they are at least 2 years&#xD;
             postmenopausal and/or surgically sterile), she must have documented negative serum or&#xD;
             negative urine pregnancy tests within 14 days of entry to the study (i.e., within 14&#xD;
             days of signing the informed consent document).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with psychiatric illness and/or other specific situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements and compromise participant follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lack of ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
             document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Subjects who were enrolled prior to this amendment will be considered eligible even&#xD;
        if the HIV/Hep C and pregnancy test were not preformed due to each country standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR PART B OF THE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants, who successfully enrolled into the first part of the study and who, according&#xD;
        to local institutional guidelines, are candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy will&#xD;
