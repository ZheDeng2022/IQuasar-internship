  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the most frequent opportunistic viral infection after&#xD;
      transplantation. It is associated with an increased incidence of acute rejection and lower&#xD;
      graft and patient survivals. The goal of this study is to demonstrate that an&#xD;
      immunosuppressive regimen associating everolimus and reduced dose of cyclosporine A can&#xD;
      prevent acute rejection episodes as efficiently as standard regimen but also efficiently&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of CMV infection at 6 months post-transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the most frequent opportunistic viral infection after&#xD;
      kidney transplantation. Therefore most of the patients receive an universal prophylaxis. On&#xD;
      the contrary to CMV naïve patients, seropositive recipients (R+) have already mounted a&#xD;
      specific immunologic response directed against the virus, which is not completely abrogated&#xD;
      by immunosuppressive drugs. Although CMV infection management guidelines offer little&#xD;
      guidance on immunosuppressive therapy for preventing CMV infection and disease, recent data&#xD;
      plead for reappraising the place of mTOR inhibitors in this situation. The potential anti-CMV&#xD;
      action of these molecules could be added to their potential antitumor effect and their&#xD;
      equivalent immunosuppressive efficacy in kidney transplant recipients at low immunological&#xD;
      risk. By the way, it could represent an alternative of a systematic universal prophylaxis in&#xD;
      R+ kidney transplant recipients. However, the proof of this anti-CMV action must be confirmed&#xD;
      in vivo in a study, which could have a close monitoring of CMV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore designed a prospective multicentric randomized controlled trial comparing an&#xD;
      immunosuppressive regimen based on everolimus and reduced dose of cyclosporine A to a regimen&#xD;
      based on mycophenolic acid and standard dose of cyclosporine A, in order to demonstrate the&#xD;
      superiority of the first one in the prevention of CMV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms and will be followed for a&#xD;
      period of 12 months. Whole blood CMV real time PCR will be performed every week during the&#xD;
      first three months, then every two weeks from Month 3 to Month 6, then at Months 8, 10 and&#xD;
      12. Incidence of CMV infection will be compared between the two arms at 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      post-transplantation.&#xD;
