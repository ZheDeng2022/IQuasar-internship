    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Asthma is a serious clinical and public health problem. Researchers want to collect data to&#xD;
      better understand how bacteria and other things in the environment can affect people's&#xD;
      asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Nonsmoking adults age 18 - 60 who have moderate to severe asthma and are not pregnant or&#xD;
      breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Partaicipants will complete a medical history form before the first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study visits will include collecting medical history, and conducting physical exam, lung&#xD;
           and smoking tests. Participants will give blood, urine, stool, dust, saliva, and sputum&#xD;
           samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take tests that measure their breathing abilities. They will give&#xD;
           saliva samples for DNA study. They will get kits to collect stool and dust samples at&#xD;
           home. They will fill out surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have visits every 6 months for 5 years. They can schedule sick visits,&#xD;
           if needed, at no cost to the participant. For all visits, they will have asthma&#xD;
           check-ups and get treatment, at no cost to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants may take part in a sub-study that includes one 4-hour visit. They will&#xD;
           have medical history, physical exam, and lung tests. They will have urine tests to check&#xD;
           for pregnancy and tobacco exposure. Then they will have bronchoscopy. For this, an&#xD;
           intravenous line will be placed in an arm vein. The nose and throat will be numbed. A&#xD;
           flexible fiber-optic tube will be inserted into their airways through the nose. Their&#xD;
           airways will be examined and areas of their lung will be washed. A small sample of cells&#xD;
           will be taken.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective, longitudinal, observational, single-center, exploratory,&#xD;
      natural history study to collect samples and data that will enable prospective explorations&#xD;
      of the interaction between environmental exposures and disease progression over time in&#xD;
      moderate-severe atopic asthmatics with persistent disease, and facilitate the formation of&#xD;
      mechanistic hypotheses. Environmental and body microbiome samples will be collected and&#xD;
      stored from participants for future correlation to effects on asthma symptoms and control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples of blood, urine, DNA, saliva, sputum, stool, and household dust will be collected&#xD;
      from approximately 200 participants, as well as quality of life information using asthma&#xD;
      symptom questionnaires and, if consented, through the use of home devices. Additionally,&#xD;
      samples will be collected from the airways of participants enrolled in the bronchoscopy&#xD;
      visit. The samples and survey information collected may be used to explore the&#xD;
      microbiological and genetic influences of atopic asthma. Data from the analyses of these&#xD;
      samples and survey responses may be evaluated in the context of the environmental exposures,&#xD;
      clinical outcomes (symptoms, exacerbations, and quality of life), and response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and female participants aged 18 to 60 years old with moderate-severe, symptomatic atopic&#xD;
      asthma will be enrolled. Participants will be excluded from enrollment if they have a history&#xD;
      of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, non-cystic fibrosis&#xD;
      bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, emphysema, sarcoidosis, or&#xD;
      unstable angina. Additionally, participants will be excluded if they have DVT, pulmonary&#xD;
&#xD;
      embolism, class III - IV congestive heart failure, or a malignancy under treatment. Current&#xD;
      smokers, and individuals who are allergic to methacholine will not be eligible to enroll.&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled for five years and will receive standard of care asthma therapy&#xD;
      as indicated. After the initial screening and baseline visits, participants will return for&#xD;
      visits semi-annually and for sick visits as needed. Volunteers participating in the&#xD;
      bronchoscopy visit will have an additional single visit after completing the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cohort of 200 participants will form the basis for future asthma study recruitment, and&#xD;
      analysis of collected samples and data. Further expansion of the study beyond five years and&#xD;
      200 participants will be desirable if logistically possible.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Participants will be recruited from the population at large, including asthmatic&#xD;
        participants who visit the CRU for on-going studies. Participants who have successfully&#xD;
        completed other CRU studies may be recruited directly for this study. The study will be&#xD;
        registered on clinicaltrials.gov. Local public health departments and other clinics may be&#xD;
        contacted for help with recruitment of individuals with moderate to severe atopic asthma.&#xD;
        In addition, if needed, the study may be advertised in local media outlets.&#xD;

&#xD;
        If a participant is recruited for the Bronchoscopy Visit but does not have current lab&#xD;
        values (within 4 weeks), the participant may be asked to return to the CRU for an&#xD;
        additional blood draw in order to run the requisite clinical assessments for safety&#xD;
        purposes. The participant will be compensated for the additional visit. This is anticipated&#xD;
        to be a rare occurrence, as the study team will make all efforts to schedule and complete&#xD;
        the bronchoscopy procedure while the lab results are current.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants with active bronchospasm on the day of the bronchoscopy will not undergo&#xD;
        bronchoscopy.&#xD;
