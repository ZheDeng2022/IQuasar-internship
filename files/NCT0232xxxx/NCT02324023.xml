      Cancer in the colon and rectum represents a global health burden being the most common cancer&#xD;
      of the digestive tract. It is the second most common cancer in Denmark and only about half of&#xD;
      the patients survive this diagnosis. Thorough characterization of the tumour preoperatively&#xD;
      is very important, since it determines if the patient should be treated with chemotherapy&#xD;
      before operation and, in the future, which operation would be most suitable for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has shown that endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is superior to a CT-scan, in determining&#xD;
      the local growth of the tumour in rectal cancer. Today, a CT-scan is the image modality of&#xD;
      choice, and is used in all Danish hospitals when it comes to colon cancer. Hopefully, the&#xD;
      investigators can apply EUS in colon cancer patients and thereby alter our diagnostic&#xD;
      approach, towards a quicker and safer way to determine which treatment the investigators&#xD;
      should offer the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the screening programme for colorectal cancer in Denmark the investigators will find&#xD;
      more and more cases of colorectal cancers, especially in the early stages, before symptoms&#xD;
      begin. These small tumours put doctors in several dilemmas concerning the strategy of&#xD;
      treatment. Even today, the investigators are very reluctant in offering large-scale&#xD;
      operations to elderly and fragile patients who have been diagnosed with cancer in the rectum.&#xD;
      Instead, local endoscopic operations are performed in selected patients. This approach has&#xD;
      not yet been tried in early colonic cancers. However, it might turn out that local,&#xD;
      endoscopic surgery will show to be beneficial for patients with colon cancers and maybe even&#xD;
      decrease morbidity, mortality and the regenerative period after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this PhD-project is to investigate the utility of the EUS-method in characterizing&#xD;
      tumours in the colon and in investigating the blood flow in the tumour.&#xD;

      Introduction Background: Colorectal carcinoma represents a global health burden being the&#xD;
      most common cancer of the digestive tract. The lifetime risk of developing colorectal&#xD;
      carcinoma is 5%, while the overall number of patients currently alive with diagnosed disease&#xD;
      in Denmark is estimated to be 30.000 patients. Approximately 70% of cases involve the colon,&#xD;
      with the remaining 30% involving the anus and rectum. The mortality rate is intimately&#xD;
      related to its high metastatic ability and therefore prognosis strongly depends on the stage&#xD;
      at diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiogenesis: Angiogenesis plays an important role in tumour growth and its metastatic&#xD;
      potential and it has been attracting a lot of attention in the past years, due to possible&#xD;
      implications in prognosis stratification, as well as in the targeted treatment of advanced&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. Most cancers depend firmly on the development of a new capillary network&#xD;
      to allow nutrition of newly formed tumour cells. These newly developed blood vessels are&#xD;
      usually highly permeable and allow the access of tumour cells in the general circulation,&#xD;
      leading to metastatic progression. Current treatment strategies for patients with advanced&#xD;
      colorectal cancer include a combined regimen of cytotoxic and biologic therapy targeting&#xD;
      angiogenesis. Thus, there is a great interest in finding alternative imaging tests for&#xD;
      assessing the efficacy of antiangiogenic agents earlier in the course of therapy, based on&#xD;
      functional imaging of tumour vascularity. The benefit that is seen in the survival of&#xD;
      patients with advanced disease by treatment with antiangiogenic drugs can maybe translate in&#xD;
      a neoadjuvant setting or an adjuvant setting in patients with stage III cancer or high risk&#xD;
      stage II cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staging: Tumour is described by the TNM classification of malignant tumours (TNM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accurate preoperative staging of colon and rectum cancer is the main factor determining the&#xD;
      treatment modality for patients and can greatly influence the results. Prognostication and&#xD;
      determination of T stage of colon tumours by using computed tomography (CT) scans have been&#xD;
      widely discussed in the literature. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has been suggested the&#xD;
      staging tool of choice for rectal cancer, when comparing to CT, yet colonic cancers remain to&#xD;
      be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the Danish National Bowel Cancer Screening Programme, increasing numbers of early&#xD;
      cancers are revealed. During recent years local treatment in patients with rectal carcinoma&#xD;
      in situ T0 or (T1/T2N0M0) cancers has become more and more accepted and has opened new&#xD;
      avenues in treatment of old, comorbid or in other ways, vulnerable patients. As a result of&#xD;
      the screening programme clinicians will naturally be placed in new dilemmas in terms of&#xD;
      treatment choices, radical versus local excision, for early colonic cancers. Important issues&#xD;
      on colonic cancer excisions, are the intramural extent of invasion and the presence or&#xD;
      absence of lymphnode metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUS: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a method consisting of an ultrasound transducer mounted&#xD;
      on the tip of an endoscope. It has evolved to be useful for both imaging and intervention in&#xD;
      the colon and rectum. The investigators chose to use the radial-array endoscope with its 360o&#xD;
      view in evaluating colonic cancers, often presenting as circumferential lesions. EUS ability&#xD;
      to depict the layers of the GI wall has proven the method usefull in staging GI cancers .&#xD;
      Imaging of the blood flow in the vessels and evaluation of blood flow velocity and flow&#xD;
      direction can be carried out using Doppler sonography. Further evaluation of tumour perfusion&#xD;
      can also be performed by low-mechanical contrast enhanced endoscopic ultrasound (CE-EUS).&#xD;
      This is a high-resolution technique enabling minimally invasive evaluation of tumour&#xD;
      perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the European Federation Societies in Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB)&#xD;
      guidelines, contrast enhanced-ultrasound (CE-EUS) can be utilized to assess early response to&#xD;
      biologic therapy in tumours such as metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) or&#xD;
      renal cell carcinoma or hepatocellular carcinoma. A similar approach has not been tested yet&#xD;
      in CRC patients using CE-EUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this Ph.D. study the investigators have chosen to focus on left sided colonic cancers&#xD;
      only, since they constitute approximately 70% of all colon cancers and, technically, are&#xD;
      easier to reach than transverse tumours or right sided tumours, thereby making the study more&#xD;
      feasible. The investigators have defined left sided colonic cancers as cancers including the&#xD;
      left flexure proximally and until 15 cm from the linea Dentata distally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims To examine if EUS can be used for stage assessment of left sided colon cancers and to&#xD;
      investigate if endoscopic ultrasound perfusion assessment correlates to histopathological&#xD;
      including immunohistochemical parameters of tumour vascular markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project description The Ph.D. study consists of 4 sub-studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Endoscopic ultrasound for assessment of T-stage and N-stage in left-sided colonic&#xD;
           cancers Hypothesis: EUS is a feasible staging method to accurately determine T-stage and&#xD;
           N-stage in left-sided tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Objectives: To investigate left-sided colonic cancers with EUS especially concerning the&#xD;
           muscular tumour invasion (tunica muscularis) and the detection rate of local lymph nodes&#xD;
           suspicious of malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Design: A prospective cohort study. Methods: Any patient at Køge/Roskilde and Herlev&#xD;
           Hospital scheduled for surgery and with histologically determined left-sided colonic&#xD;
           cancer will be included in the study and undergo EUS evaluation. Patients will undergo a&#xD;
           CT-scan and will be staged preoperatively according to this scan. Sensitivity and&#xD;
           specificity will be calculated for EUS and pathology specimens, regarding muscular&#xD;
           invasion. It is expected, based on previous publications, that the distribution between&#xD;
           patients with &quot;bad&quot; tumours (= T4 + T3 with &gt; 5 mm muscular invasion) and &quot;good&quot; tumours&#xD;
           (= T1 - T3 with &lt; 5 mm muscular invasion) will be 45% and 55% respectively. With an 80%&#xD;
           power and 5% type 1 error the investigators will include 74 patients in order to have an&#xD;
           expected sensitivity of 90% and a lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval at 75%.&#xD;
           The investigators will perform an interim analysis after inclusion of 35 patients. If&#xD;
           the observed sensitivity will be below 80% the study will be terminated and there will&#xD;
           be focus on method development. If the sensitivity will be higher than 80% the study&#xD;
           inclusion will continue until inclusion of 74 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Outcome: Outcome measures will be EUS stage compared to histological stage as well as to&#xD;
           CT scan stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The correlation between endoscopic perfusion assessments with immunohistochemical&#xD;
           parameters in left sided colonic cancer Hypothesis: EUS is a feasible diagnostic&#xD;
           modality to determine the vascular characteristics of left sided colonic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To investigate quantitative and qualitative EUS parameters of left-sided colonic&#xD;
      cancers with contrast enhanced EUS imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A prospective cohort study. Methods: When EUS staging has been performed in the&#xD;
      cohort of study 2, further evaluation of tumour perfusion will be done by low-mechanical&#xD;
      contrast enhanced endoscopic ultrasound (CE-EUS). Power Doppler vascularity index will be&#xD;
      calculated and used as a measure of tumour perfusion. The volume of tumour perfusion has&#xD;
      previously shown a strong correlation with the vascular density. The perfusion of tumour&#xD;
      tissue per cm3 (automated pixel analysis) will be compared with histologically determined&#xD;
      vascular density. The study is explorative and no sample size calculation is possible based&#xD;
      on present literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: Outcome measures will be endoscopic ultrasound perfusion parameters correlated to&#xD;
      histopathological vascular characteristics of left-sided colonic cancers (e.g. micro vessel&#xD;
      density measured by CD31 staining and double-staining techniques).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and side effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications may occur during EUS but they are rare. These consist of bleeding from the&#xD;
      tumour, since tumour masses may be very vulnerable, when positioning the scope. The bleeding&#xD;
      is self-limited. Perforation of the bowel is extremely rare. Making the EUS staging procedure&#xD;
      and the endoscopic perfusion assessment will, all in all, take about 10-15 minutes. SonoVue®&#xD;
      is not nephrotoxic and the incidence of hypersensitivity or severe allergic events is lower&#xD;
      than with current X-ray agents and comparable to that of other magnetic resonance contrast&#xD;
      agents. SonoVue® is approved for clinical use in EU countries and administration of the&#xD;
      contrast agent showed very low incidence of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Location:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection will take place at Department of Surgery, Endoscopy Units at Herlev&#xD;
      University Hospital and Køge/Roskilde University Hospital. The endoscopies will be performed&#xD;
      primarily at Herlev Hospital but also at Køge Hospital if necessary EUS equipment can be&#xD;
      provided. If not patients from Køge and Roskilde Hospital will be examined at Herlev&#xD;
      Hospital. The histopathological analyses follow the standard protocols for colorectal&#xD;
      carcinomas routinely performed in the Departments of Pathology at Herlev University Hospital&#xD;
      and Roskilde University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination of the results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All results, both positive, negative and inconclusive will be presented on national and&#xD;
      international conferences. The results will be submitted for publication to peer-reviewed&#xD;
      journals with Marie Louise Malmstrøm as the first author.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sponsors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research project is initiated by the principal supervisor, Peter Vilmann, MD, DMSc. The&#xD;
      costs associated with the project will be supported from the principal supervisor's&#xD;
      department budget and external funding. The EUS equipment is already available at the&#xD;
      endoscopy department of Herlev and funding for equipment for Køge/Roskilde Hospital have been&#xD;
      applied for at the Research Council of the Region of Zealand. Funding for salary for the&#xD;
      clinical investigator has been applied at private funds and public funds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is ethically approved (H-4-2014-075) and approved at datatilsynet. The studies&#xD;
      performed are registered in www.clinicaltrials.gov as requested by ICMJE (International&#xD;
      Committee of Medical Journal Editors). Research subjects will have to give informed consent,&#xD;
      based on written and oral information before inclusion in the study. Participants will be&#xD;
      informed about any side-effects, risks or unplanned events that might occur during the&#xD;
      implementation of the study. The minimal risks will be outweighed by the potential&#xD;
      implications for future patient care. The study will be carried out with respect to the&#xD;
      mental and physical integrity of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines in obtaining informed consent from participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Well informed signed consent from the research subjects is an essential criterion for&#xD;
      inclusion in the trial. Both written and oral information will be provided to each candidate&#xD;
      to the study by either the chief investigator or other health care persons that are qualified&#xD;
      in explaining the project in detail. The patient will be made aware of the possibility of a&#xD;
      second person (e.g. caregiver, relative) to be present at the interview. The interview will&#xD;
      take place in a private room in order to provide an uninterrupted communication. At the&#xD;
      interview the detailed information on the project will be covered, in oral and written form,&#xD;
      including an easy-to-read presentation of the project with its predictable risks and&#xD;
      side-effects, expected outcomes and benefits for the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be entitled to some reflection time before giving consent (24-48 hours),&#xD;
      taking care that the time limit stipulated for complete pretherapeutic evaluation of the&#xD;
      cancer patient is not exceeded, and taking care that the project will not interfere with the&#xD;
      routine clinical investigations and treatments of the patient.&#xD;
