  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For 25 years, the twin pregnancy rate has regularly increased in the majority of European&#xD;
      countries and in the United States, by 35% between 1981 and 2006. Increased use of medically&#xD;
      assisted procreation and older maternal age are the two main causes. At the present time twin&#xD;
      pregnancies represent nearly 20% of premature deliveries. The rate of very premature births&#xD;
      (&lt; 32-34 weeks) is 7 times higher in twin pregnancies than in singleton pregnancies. As&#xD;
      prematurity accounts for 75% of neonatal morbidity and mortality, and extreme prematurity is&#xD;
      the principal cause of neonatal mortality and of brain sequelae in twins, the search for a&#xD;
      preventive treatment appears as a priority in perinatal medicine. The investigators recently&#xD;
      showed in a prospective multicenter study that cervical ultrasound at 22 and 27 wks was a&#xD;
      better predictive investigation of premature delivery &lt; 34 wks than digital examination.&#xD;
      Recently in a randomized trial in a population of short-cervix singleton pregnancies, the&#xD;
      premature delivery rate decreased by 40% in the pessary group compared with the usual&#xD;
      management group. No other trial of pessary use in short-cervix twin pregnancies was&#xD;
      published today. Recently, in a historical comparison of twins with twin-to-twin transfusion&#xD;
      syndrome treated with laser, Carreras et al. have showed a decreased rate of preterm delivery&#xD;
      with the use of pessary in case of short cervix. The investigators wish to set up a&#xD;
      randomized multicenter study in France in the population of short-cervix twin pregnancies to&#xD;
      show a potential benefit of the pessary compared with simple surveillance.&#xD;

      better predictive investigation of premature delivery &lt; 34 wks than digital examination.[1]&#xD;
      As there is currently no recommended preventive treatment for prematurity in twin&#xD;
      pregnancies[2], the 2009 guidelines of the College of Obstetricians leave the teams with the&#xD;
      option of carrying out systematic cervical ultrasound or not during follow-up&#xD;
      investigations.[3] Recently in a randomized trial in a population of short-cervix singleton&#xD;
      pregnancies, the premature delivery rate decreased by 40% in the pessary group compared with&#xD;
      the usual management group.[4] In a recent multicenter trial (ProTWIN), while therapeutic&#xD;
      efficacy of the pessary (versus usual management) was not demonstrated in the overall group&#xD;
      of twin pregnancies, in the short-cervix subgroup (&lt; 25th percentile of the population) the &lt;&#xD;
      32 wks delivery rate decreased from 29% to 14% (OR= 0.49 (0.24-0.97) and neonatal morbidity&#xD;
      also decreased.[5] No other trial of pessary use in short-cervix twin pregnancies was&#xD;
      published today. Recently, in a historical comparison of twins with twin-to-twin transfusion&#xD;
      syndrome treated with laser, Carreras et al. have showed a decreased rate of preterm delivery&#xD;
      with the use of pessary in case of short cervix.[6] The investigators wish to set up a&#xD;
      randomized multicenter study in France in the population of short-cervix twin pregnancies to&#xD;
