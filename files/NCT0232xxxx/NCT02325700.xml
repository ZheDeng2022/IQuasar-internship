  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study was designed to analyse the postoperative and long-term outcomes of&#xD;
      total laparoscopic vs. open surgical repair of infra-renal abdominal aortic occlusive disease&#xD;
      (AOD) and infra-renal aortic aneurysmal disease (AAA) in comparable groups of patients using&#xD;
      a propensity analysis model.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From January 2006 to January 2010, 228 consecutive patients who received an aortic bypass for&#xD;
      AAA (n=139) or for AOD (n=89) were studied. Open repair was performed in145 patients&#xD;
      (AAA=109, AOD=36) and total laparoscopic repair in 83 patients (AAA=30, AOD=53). One-to-one&#xD;
      propensity score matching between study groups was done according to a difference in the&#xD;
      logit of propensity score of less than 0.04 between each patient pairs in the study groups.&#xD;
      Logistic regression with the help of backward selection was used to adjust the effect of&#xD;
      treatment method for propensity score as well as other variables in evaluating postoperative&#xD;
      and long-term outcome. A p value &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
