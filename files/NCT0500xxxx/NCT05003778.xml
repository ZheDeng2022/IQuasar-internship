  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to compare a minimal equipment training program with and&#xD;
      without blood flow restriction (BFR) training to periodized concurrent resistance and&#xD;
      endurance training. The outcomes of interest are Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) performance&#xD;
      along with laboratory measures of performance, which include body composition, power,&#xD;
      strength, and maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max). Additionally, based on the role of&#xD;
      mechanical tension in connective tissue adaptation and the importance for chronic&#xD;
      musculoskeletal health, tendon architecture will be assessed as well. Lastly, specific&#xD;
      blood-based biomarkers will be analyzed in conjunction with questionnaires to determine the&#xD;
      systemic physiological and psychological responses to training. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized into one of three training groups and will follow their respective program for 6&#xD;
      weeks. The three groups are traditional concurrent resistance and endurance training, minimal&#xD;
      equipment training, and minimal equipment training with blood flow restriction (BFR).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of minimal equipment training programs with an emphasis on resistance training&#xD;
      has seldom been assessed and compared to traditional strength training. Common training&#xD;
      strategies include traditional high-to-moderate load resistance training and low-to-moderate&#xD;
      load field training using minimal equipment. The benefit of traditional CT is likely due to&#xD;
      the higher loads relative to 1-repetition maximum (1RM) utilized and overall amount of&#xD;
      mechanical stress incurred. It is difficult to mimic this loading with minimal equipment&#xD;
      training, which is often performed at low loads relative to 1RM. However, one strategy to&#xD;
      improve the effectiveness of minimal equipment training may be the addition of blood flow&#xD;
      restriction (BFR) training. Due to the relatively low loads (20-70% 1RM) of minimal equipment&#xD;
      training, BFR training not only provides athletes with a novel training modality to elicit&#xD;
      hypertrophic and strength adaptation but also to augment recovery as a supplemental&#xD;
      low-damage, high-volume training method. The research design will allow for the direct&#xD;
      comparison of minimal equipment training with and without additional BFR training to&#xD;
      periodized CT with regard to changes in outcomes, in particular, ACFT performance.&#xD;
