  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Undiagnosed and untreated hypertension is a main driver of cardiovascular disease, affecting&#xD;
      disproportionately low and middle-income countries, where guidelines to screen and manage&#xD;
      hypertension are poorly used. More than 13% of Mozambique adults are infected with HIV, and&#xD;
      over 900,000 are on anti-retroviral therapy. HIV clinics are the only services within primary&#xD;
      care providing continued care, and can be used to standardize and scale the hypertension care&#xD;
      cascade. Hypertension affects 40% of Mozambican adults, and thus HIV and HTN often coexist in&#xD;
      the same person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to use low-cost tools that improve service performance, promote&#xD;
      routine hypertension diagnosis and management, and ameliorate flow through the hypertension&#xD;
      cascade, thus improving patients outcomes. Building on a current project some districts of&#xD;
      two provinces of central Mozambique, the investigators will establish scientific evidence on&#xD;
      the effectiveness of a tool that uses cycles of evaluation and improvement of health system,&#xD;
      to address the hypertension care cascade in HIV-infected people. The investigators will&#xD;
      strengthen the framework currently in use (based on nurses) setting a novel modality&#xD;
      delivered by district health supervisors, and will expand the geographic study area by adding&#xD;
      all districts of two Southern provinces, to create a foundation for national scale-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Project planning phase (two years) will develop a multi-sectoral partnership of key&#xD;
      stakeholders, establish national technical working groups with the participation of the&#xD;
      provinces, and identify key facilitators and barriers that could affect uptake of the&#xD;
      results, integration of high blood pressure and HIV services, scale-up to the entire country,&#xD;
      and sustainability of the tested framework. Additionally, the investigators will i) conduct a&#xD;
      six-months pilot study to assess feasibility and acceptability of the district supervisor-led&#xD;
      intervention in one primary care facility; and, ii) redesign tools and standard operating&#xD;
      procedures, as necessary. During the implementation phase (last three years) the&#xD;
      investigators will deploy the district-based dissemination and implementation randomized&#xD;
      trial in 45 health facilities - using an intervention that involves assessment, effectiveness&#xD;
      evaluation, promotion of local uptake, implementation and maintenance - and determine the&#xD;
      costs of the hypertension care cascade optimization, by estimating the total incremental&#xD;
      costs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Mozambique HIV prevalence is over 13% and hypertension (HTN) affects 40% of adults. HIV&#xD;
      and HTN comorbidity is increasing with aging of HIV-infected population and expansion of&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART), but guideline application for screening and management of HTN&#xD;
      being low and uneven. Around 14% of adults are aware of their HTN status and only 3% of those&#xD;
      with HTN have their condition controlled. The HIV treatment platform, being the only broadly&#xD;
      implemented chronic care service, provides an opportunity to standardize and scale HTN&#xD;
      screening and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systems-level implementation strategies may reduce drop-offs along the HTN cascade, improve&#xD;
      service quality, and maximize availability of efficacious HTN medicines. Systems engineering&#xD;
      tools can identify drivers of inefficiency, support locally informed provider decision-making&#xD;
      to prioritize solutions, and improve integration of services to reduce inefficiencies in&#xD;
      complex, multi-step health services using simple, low cost, iterative adaptations in service&#xD;
      delivery design. The participation of frontline staff and senior management champions in this&#xD;
      process improves patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to describe HTN care cascade at the health facility level and use it as&#xD;
      the entry point for systems optimization of HIV services, using cascade analysis and&#xD;
      associated systems engineering tools. In central Mozambique a Systems Analysis and&#xD;
      Improvement Approach (SAIA) identified HTN cascade steps for PLHIV, developed a HTN Cascade&#xD;
      Analysis Tool (HCAT), mapped data sources, and developed a registry to populate the HCAT and&#xD;
      capture study outcomes from outpatient registries and patient charts (SAIA-HTN). Building on&#xD;
      this, our project will 'scale out' through the novel modality of delivery by district health&#xD;
      supervisors, and 'scale up' by expanding to all districts in two additional provinces (SCALE&#xD;
      SAIA-HTN). It also aims at developing a dissemination and implementation model to serve as a&#xD;
      foundation for national scaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Projects Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop a multi-sectoral partnership of key stakeholders and establish HTN technical&#xD;
           working groups at the national level and participating provinces;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify key facilitators and barriers that could affect the adoption, integration,&#xD;
           scale-up and sustainment of the SAIA-HTN implementation strategy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To conduct a pilot study to assess feasibility and acceptability of the district MOH&#xD;
           supervisor-led SAIA-HTN intervention over six months in one primary care facility (to&#xD;
           redesign tools and standard operating procedures as necessary);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Develop a district-based dissemination and implementation of SAIA-HTN (SCALE SAIA-HTN)&#xD;
           using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) model&#xD;
           to evaluate the program: a.Determine the proportion of health facilities and population&#xD;
           in the two provinces reached, and identification of sub-groups not reached (target: 33%&#xD;
           of facilities and 80% HIV+ adults reached); b.Assess the intervention effect on HTN&#xD;
           process measures (BP screening, HTN diagnosis, HTN medication initiation, maintenance on&#xD;
           HTN treatment), and HTN treatment effectiveness (HTN control, HIV viral load&#xD;
           suppression); c.Determine the proportion of districts and facilities adopting the&#xD;
           intervention (target: 95%), and explore the determinants of adoption identified using&#xD;
           the Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change (ORIC); d.Determine core elements&#xD;
           of the scaled SAIA-HTN implementation process and describe drivers of success/failure&#xD;
           using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR); e.Calculate the&#xD;
           proportion of districts sustaining the intervention 12, 24, 36 months post-introduction&#xD;
           (target: &gt;90% at 12 months, &gt;80% at 24 months, and &gt;65% at 36 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Determine the costs of SCALE SAIA-HTN for care cascade optimization, including total&#xD;
           incremental and unit costs of integrating HTN diagnosis and management into HIV care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The investigators will use the SAIA strategy to visualize and quantify interconnected&#xD;
      service delivery steps, informed by previous SAIA research, epidemiologic research on HTN,&#xD;
      and ongoing research SAIA-HTN to optimize HTN screening, care and treatment for PLHIV in&#xD;
      central Mozambique (to evaluate SAIA-HTN's effectiveness on systems' and patient-level health&#xD;
      outcomes for PLHIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan: The investigators will use multiple novel implementation science methods to&#xD;
      understand and explain what influences implementation outcomes, including i) the CFIR to&#xD;
      identify barriers and facilitators (determinants) to implementation, ii) the ORIC scale to&#xD;
      assesses readiness for change as an organizational-level determinant of adoption, and iii)&#xD;
      the RE-AIM evaluative Framework, which measures the active ingredients for public health&#xD;
      impact (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planning phase: The investigators will mobilize a multi-sectoral stakeholder partnership,&#xD;
      conduct a needs assessment (to evaluate facilitators and barriers that could affect adoption,&#xD;
      integration, scale-up and sustainment of SCALE SAIA-HTN in the two provinces), and pilot the&#xD;
      intervention's feasibility and acceptability over six months in two clinics (to refine&#xD;
      implementation procedures for follow-on scaling out and scaling up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation phase: 'scale out' SAIA-HTN to test a novel delivery modality (using district&#xD;
      supervisors), 'scale up' to cover two provinces in a novel geographic area, and evaluate its&#xD;
      impact on cascade performance and patient outcomes. The investigators will randomly allocate&#xD;
      health facilities from the 15 districts in Maputo City and Province into three implementation&#xD;
      waves, staggered by one year (three years total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SAIA-HTN implementation strategy uses an iterative, five-step process applied at the&#xD;
      facility level to give clinic staff and managers a systems view of cascade performance,&#xD;
      identify priority areas for improvement, discern modifiable solutions, and test workflow&#xD;
      modifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCALE SAIA-HTN will test integration and scale up of SAIA-HTN through routine management&#xD;
      systems relying on district Ministry of Health (MOH) supervisors as the disseminating agents&#xD;
      (rather than research nurses), in three facilities per district during a one-year intensive&#xD;
      phase (mentored by study assistants), and subsequent sustainment phase (led independently by&#xD;
      district MOH supervisors). Based on trial results, the investigators will model out the costs&#xD;
      and potential benefits on HTN management for PLHIV given different scale-up scenarios&#xD;
      nationwide. The trial will culminate in the development and dissemination of the SCALE&#xD;
      SAIA-HTN package, summarizing trial results and providing implementation and cost guidance to&#xD;
      inform policy development and support national scale-up through routine management&#xD;
      structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: phased-in (stepped wedge) with random assignment of five districts to each of&#xD;
      the three one-year intervention waves, to reach all districts in Maputo City and Maputo&#xD;
      Province by the end of the three-year trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting: Maputo city and Maputo Province (joint population of &gt;3 million inhabitants;&#xD;
      &gt;98% of formal health services offered through public sector clinics). Health facilities with&#xD;
      highest numbers of active HIV+ patients on ART will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Team: This project brings together a diverse and uniquely qualified team of&#xD;
      cardiovascular, HIV, community surveys, health systems, and implementation scientists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Stakeholders meetings: to create a multi-sectoral partnership of key stakeholders&#xD;
      and establish HTN technical working groups (TWG) at the national level and with participating&#xD;
      provinces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stakeholder field visits to SAIA-HTN trial in central Mozambique: for key personnel and&#xD;
      district MOH supervisors from the pilot facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orientation meetings/workshops: for introducing SCALE SAIA-HTN, the implementation approach,&#xD;
      and evaluation design to study investigators, provincial MOH managers, and district MOH&#xD;
      supervisors in each province, who will review and agree on study procedures, and clinical and&#xD;
      organizational skills-building approaches. Throughout the two phases of the project the TWG&#xD;
      will inform on mediators and mechanisms of action, scale-up and sustainment efforts, and&#xD;
      ensure responsiveness to local needs; at end of the planning phase, the TWG will review&#xD;
      findings, discuss necessary adaptations and refine SCALE SAIA-HTN for the implementation&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized readiness assessments: in the 15 first wave health facilities to assess&#xD;
      structural and organizational readiness to deliver HTN services (ORIC measures, staffing&#xD;
      levels, attributes and training, availability of essential commodities, equipment and&#xD;
      supplies, and infrastructure) and repeated for subsequent waves prior to launching intensive&#xD;
      implementation phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot study: Outpatient staff managing HIV/CVD care and district MOH supervisors will&#xD;
      participate in orientation training for the feasibility and acceptability of the SCALE&#xD;
      SAIA-HTN intervention, which will be carried out over six months in two primary care&#xD;
      facilities. Tools and standard operating procedures will be redesigned as necessary for the&#xD;
      implementation phase. Facility-based HTN screening will be carried out by nurses at entry&#xD;
      into the pilot facility; all hypertensive (new and existing) patients will be recruited, with&#xD;
      the support of district supervisors and study teams. Feasibility and acceptability will&#xD;
      include i) measurement of intervention fidelity, reach and exposure, and adoption; ii)&#xD;
      knowledge and competency questionnaire to health personnel. Follow-up visits to both monitor&#xD;
      and support implementation will be carried out twice in the first month, and monthly&#xD;
      thereafter. Additional data will be collected by: focus group discussion (FGD) with key staff&#xD;
      to assess acceptability of content and delivery of the intervention; questionnaire to&#xD;
      participating staff pre- and post-intervention; key informant interviews with the district&#xD;
      supervisors, facility managers and frontline staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate programs' Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM)&#xD;
      Reach: determine the number, proportion/representativeness of individuals reached by&#xD;
      interventions; use study reports to estimate the proportion of facilities in the two&#xD;
      provinces reached by SCALE SAIA-HTN (target: 30%); determine the number and proportion of&#xD;
      HIV-infected adults with HTN reached (target: 80%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness: HTN treatment effectiveness (primary effectiveness outcome: HTN control,&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: HIV viral load suppression, proportion of HIV- infected patients screened&#xD;
      for HTN in outpatient services, HTN diagnosis, HTN prescription of eligible patients, &gt;90%&#xD;
      patient adherence to HTN treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adoption: ORIC assessment scale (target of 95%) used to six frontline staff working across&#xD;
      the HIV-HTN cascade and facility leadership in each clinic (n=270), and two supervisors (NCD&#xD;
      and HIV) from each district (n=30) to describe determinants of adoption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation: Tools at CFIR website will be adapted to gather data via interviews and FGDs&#xD;
      with facility and district staff (qualitative), intervention meeting minutes (qualitative),&#xD;
      and annual quantitative questionnaires to quantify facility structural determinants of&#xD;
      implementation of HTN management guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance. Proportion of districts sustaining the intervention as designed 12, 24 and 36&#xD;
      months post-introduction (target: &gt;90% at 12 months, &gt;80% at 24 months, and &gt;65% at 36&#xD;
      months). In-depth interviews and FGDs to probe district/facility perspectives on determinants&#xD;
      of sustainment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of the costs of SCALE SAIA-HTN for care cascade optimization: total incremental&#xD;
      and unit costs of integrating HTN diagnosis and management into HIV care. For cost estimation&#xD;
      activity-based cost menus will identify start up and recurrent activities, and measure&#xD;
      resource use and costs from design through implementation. Cost metrics will include the&#xD;
      total incremental costs and average unit costs.&#xD;

    <description>Intensive phase: district MOH supervisors receive a one-week training on SAIA-HTN. The first year of implementation will be mentored by INS study personnel who will accompany and support district MOH supervisors as they implement at the facility level. Over the first week of each iterative cycle, facility teams populate and interpret the HCAT, develop process maps, define one to two micro-interventions and indicators to monitor these modifications. Facility teams receive bi-weekly mentorship visits by district supervisors and study personnel for the first two months, followed by monthly visits throughout intensive implementation.&#xD;
Sustainment phase (zero, one or two years, depending on implementation wave allocation): district supervisors will independently lead implementation, with financial support for travel to clinics and to hold meetings, but without intensive support from study personnel.</description>
