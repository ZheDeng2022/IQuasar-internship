        The study population consists of 50 consecutive subjects who underwent a THA with the DELTA&#xD;
        Multihole TT acetabular cup. Patients are screened for enrolment into the study from a list&#xD;
        of patients who had a surgery at the Samodzielny Publiczny Szpital Kliniczny im. Prof.&#xD;
        Adama Grucy CMKP in 2019 onwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who do not meet all the inclusion criteria or meet any exclusion criteria are&#xD;
        excluded from study participation and should be considered as a Screening Failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and agree&#xD;
        to participate in the study signing the Informed Consent Form are enrolled.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female subjects who underwent a Total Hip Arthroplasty with Delta Multihole TT&#xD;
             acetabular cup, but showed any of the contraindications reported in the Instruction&#xD;
             for Use&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &lt; 18 years old&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. significant neurological or musculoskeletal disorders or disease that may&#xD;
                  adversely affect gait and compromise functional recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. neuromuscular or neurosensory deficit which would limit the ability to assess the&#xD;
                  performance of the device.&#xD;
