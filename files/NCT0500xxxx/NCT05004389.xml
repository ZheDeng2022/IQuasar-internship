  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prediction of walking recovery after stroke can inform patient-centered care and support&#xD;
      discharge planning. The accuracy of current prediction models is limited, however, due to&#xD;
      small study designs and narrow predictors assessed. The investigators propose a comprehensive&#xD;
      evaluation of a novel combination of biomarkers to improve prediction of walking recovery and&#xD;
      guide rehabilitation efforts after stroke. These include acute structural brain network&#xD;
      disruption (utilizing MRI); blood biomarker levels (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor&#xD;
      and vascular endothelial growth factor); and clinical assessments of strength and mobility.&#xD;
      The overall study objectives are to assess protocol feasibility and investigate relationships&#xD;
      between select biomarkers and walking recovery to provide strong justification for a larger&#xD;
      study on predictors of independent walking after stroke. The proposed objectives will be&#xD;
      pursued through the following specific aims: 1) Assess feasibility of a larger study and&#xD;
      develop methods for telehealth data collection; 2) Establish baseline levels of biomarkers&#xD;
      and average change over time; and 3) Elucidate relationships between baseline levels of&#xD;
      biomarkers and walking gains across time in persons after stroke. A longitudinal,&#xD;
      observational study design will be utilized for this study. Thirty-five persons with acute&#xD;
      (≤7 days) stroke will be recruited from the local medical center. Select inclusion criteria&#xD;
      include presence of new lower limb weakness and assistance for walking; select exclusion&#xD;
      criteria include cerebellar stroke or other neurological disorders such as Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease. Subjects will undergo clinical evaluation at week 1, 4, 9, 12, and 26 weeks&#xD;
      post-stroke. MRI scans will occur within 12 days post-stroke and at 12 weeks post-stroke, and&#xD;
      blood draws within 1 week, 1 to 2 weeks and at 12 weeks post-stroke. To assess feasibility&#xD;
      the investigators will examine study processes, recruitment, resources, study management, and&#xD;
      scientific assessment. To examine the role of acute clinical, neuroimaging, and physiological&#xD;
      measures in predicting walking recovery, the investigators will examine relationships between&#xD;
      these measures and walking outcome at 12-weeks post-stroke. The proposed research is expected&#xD;
      to provide strong scientific support for future clinical trials designed to target therapies&#xD;
      based on predicted functional potential. Such knowledge has the potential of enhancing&#xD;
      mobility gains and patient independence following stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will utilize a longitudinal, observational study design to investigate&#xD;
      predictors of walking recovery post-stroke. Subjects will undergo clinical evaluation at week&#xD;
      1, 4, 9, 12, and 26 weeks after the initial onset of stroke symptoms; MRI scan within 12 days&#xD;
      and at 12 weeks post-stroke; and blood draws at 1 week, 1 to 2 weeks and at 12 weeks&#xD;
      post-stroke. Subjects will be recruited from the University of Vermont Medical Center&#xD;
      (UVMMC), with a goal sample of 35 patients (accounts for 15% attrition). Subjects will&#xD;
      provide written consent before participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Assess feasibility of a larger study and develop methods for telehealth data&#xD;
      collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: To assess feasibility the investigators will examine study processes,&#xD;
      recruitment, resources, study management, and scientific assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analyses: Feasibility questions will be examined using descriptive statistics and&#xD;
      qualitative analyses. To ensure collection and dissemination of high quality data, the&#xD;
      &quot;CONSORT 2010 checklist of information to include when reporting a pilot or feasibility&#xD;
      trial&quot; will be used to guide data collection and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Establish baseline levels of biomarkers (clinical, neuroimaging, blood) and average&#xD;
      change over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Protocol: Subjects will undergo baseline clinical assessment (≤7 days&#xD;
      post-stroke), MRI scan (within 12 days post-stroke), and blood draw (within 1 week&#xD;
      post-stroke). These same measures will be repeated 12 weeks after stroke (primary predictive&#xD;
      outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establishing baseline levels of clinical measures, neuroimaging and blood biomarkers: To&#xD;
           determine the variability in participants' walking ability/balance/strength, post-stroke&#xD;
           preservation of sensorimotor connectivity, and acute changes in blood markers associated&#xD;
           with immune response (IL-6, IL-10, cross-reacting protein, TNFalpha), neural function&#xD;
           (BDNF), and blood vessel/ circulation (VEGF, matrix metalloproteinase, insulin like&#xD;
           growth factor-1, cGP), descriptive statistics will be obtained. Results will be&#xD;
           stratified by stroke characteristics and NIHSS score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quantifying change over time for clinical measures: defined as the average difference&#xD;
           between baseline and 4-,9-,12-, and 26-week values. To examine change over time, the&#xD;
           investigators will perform paired t-tests (or non-parametric equivalent) and effect size&#xD;
           calculations on all outcome measures, using the 12 week post-stroke timepoint as the&#xD;
           primary outcome. The investigators will also use the following minimal clinically&#xD;
           important difference (MCID) or minimal detectable change (MDC) values to determine if&#xD;
           observed statistical differences are clinically relevant: 0.16 m/s change in gait speed,&#xD;
           6-point change in Berg Balance Scale, and a change of three repetitions in 30 second&#xD;
           Sit-To-Stand.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Quantifying change over time for neuroimaging and blood biomarkers: defined as the&#xD;
           average difference between baseline and 12-week values. To examine change over time, the&#xD;
           investigators will perform paired t-tests (or non-parametric equivalent) and effect size&#xD;
           calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Secondary analyses: will be performed with assistance and training from Core C (e.g., 5&#xD;
           dimensions spatial-temporal maps of walking biomechanics and/or muscle activation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Elucidate relationships between baseline levels of biomarkers and walking gains across&#xD;
      time in persons after stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Protocol: Subjects will undergo the same experimental procedures as in Aims 1&#xD;
      and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: To study the role of acute clinical, neuroimaging, and physiological measures&#xD;
      in predicting recovery of independent walking post-stroke, the investigators will examine&#xD;
      relationships between these measures and walking outcome as defined by the Functional&#xD;
      Ambulation Category (FAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identifying the time to regaining independent walking after stroke: defined as the time&#xD;
           post-stroke (as measured at 4, 9, 12, or 26 weeks post-stroke) at which a participant&#xD;
           achieves a score of ≥4 on the FAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quantifying the relationship between acute measures and walking outcome at 12 weeks&#xD;
           post-stroke (primary predictive outcome): the relationship between clinical, MRI, and&#xD;
           blood biomarkers and walking outcome at 12 weeks post-stroke (± independently walking)&#xD;
           will be examined using logistic regression, correcting for potential confounders [age,&#xD;
           sex, stroke severity (NIHSS)]. Secondary analyses will be performed by evaluating trends&#xD;
           over time (repeated measures model).&#xD;
