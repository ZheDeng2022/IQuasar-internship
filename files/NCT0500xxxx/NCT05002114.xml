      Double-blind, randomized into two arms (TC and TP): patients get either topical cannabidiol&#xD;
      or topical placebo up to three times daily. Inclusion criteria will be chronic joint pain&#xD;
      with intent to treat or currently treated with opioids. Exclusion criteria will include&#xD;
      current cannabis use, severe medical illness or lacking in capacity to be involved in study.&#xD;
      TC and TP will be prescribed for use TID in predefined dosages and quantities.&#xD;

      Introduction and Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the opioid epidemic is a public health crisis. Use of opioids for chronic pain are&#xD;
      a large component of this crisis. If alternative means can be developed to treat chronic pain&#xD;
      that can replace the use of opioid-based treatments, this can improve clinical outcomes and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arthritis and musculoskeletal pain are often chronic conditions that cause significant&#xD;
      morbidity. Historically, one study estimated that the lifetime incidence is as high as 47%&#xD;
      for osteoarthritis over the lifespan, increasing with age and also increasing to 60% with a&#xD;
      body mass index over than 30. In our society today with over 50% of the population suffering&#xD;
      from obesity, this is a significant problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While cannabis products have been referenced for treating numerous medical issues including a&#xD;
      number of pain-related conditions, it has only been recently that mechanisms outside the&#xD;
      central nervous system have been recognized. There is very little published in regards to the&#xD;
      use of cannabidiol (CBD) in the treatment of arthritic pain, and even less on the topical&#xD;
      application of CBD products in its use in this manner. Two previous studies demonstrated the&#xD;
      efficacy of a local/transdermal application of CBD in rodent models of arthritis. Activity at&#xD;
      the TRPV2 receptor is one possible mechanism for this putative mechanism. Another possible&#xD;
      interaction is at the GPR55 receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The earliest known references to the medicinal properties of cannabis can be found in the&#xD;
      &quot;Shennong Ben Cao Jing&quot;, which describe Chinese uses of herbal remedies from as early as 2700&#xD;
      BC. In later compilations of this work, cannabis is described as being utilized for the&#xD;
      treatment of pain and inflammation. Since that time, cannabis has been used world-wide both&#xD;
      medicinally and for recreational purposes. It has only been a recent development (within the&#xD;
      past 100 years) that public health regulations have prohibited the use of cannabis products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, problems do exist with the use of CBD products. The FDA has issued numerous letters&#xD;
      warning manufacturers of CBD products about false advertising and/or illegal marketing of CBD&#xD;
      for unapproved uses to treat disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. In addition, prior&#xD;
      evaluations of products containing CBD found that 69% were mislabeled in regards to the&#xD;
      contents provided on the product labels. Given these matters, it is our intent to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of a topical CBD (TC) preparation in improving clinical outcomes in patients&#xD;
      with chronic musculoskeletal joint pain. Specifically the investigators wish to establish the&#xD;
      efficacy of TC, a product specifically formulated for topical application at pre-defined&#xD;
      dosages.&#xD;
