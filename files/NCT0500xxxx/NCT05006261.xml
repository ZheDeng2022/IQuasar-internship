  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm longitudinal feasibility study for older adults that involves a 12-week&#xD;
      home-based Tai Chi program and includes four remote and/or in-person data collection visits.&#xD;
      The investigators will collect additional clinical data in a subset of participants who agree&#xD;
      to undergo additional assessments in the Motion Analysis Laboratory at the Spaulding&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston, MA during two in-person data collection sessions. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess feasibility and acceptability of the Tele-Tai Chi intervention;&#xD;
      explore changes in clinically relevant outcome measures including: physical activity,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, quality of life, balance, and gait; and evaluate longitudinal changes in Tai&#xD;
      Chi proficiency.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the study is to test the delivery of a novel Tele-Tai Chi (TC)&#xD;
      intervention in a single-arm feasibility study for community-dwelling TC-naïve older adults.&#xD;
      The investigators will assess feasibility and acceptability of the Tele-TC intervention and&#xD;
      its specific components through both qualitative and quantitative feedback, as well as the&#xD;
      systematic tracking of adherence data to inform future trials and potential clinical use of&#xD;
      the Tele-TC system. The investigators will also explore changes in outcome measures including&#xD;
      physical activity, self-efficacy, quality of life, and gait, and evaluate changes in TC&#xD;
      proficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the course of the 12-week program, participants will be assessed 4 times (baseline, two&#xD;
      follow-up assessments at 4 and 8 weeks respectively, and a final assessment at 12 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study volunteers will be instructed to train on their own at least three times a week and to&#xD;
      participate in 1:1 live sessions with TC instructors two or more times during the study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes from baseline in Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-intervention (approximately 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC): 16-item self-report measure in which participants rate their balance confidence to perform motor activities. The minimum score is 0. The maximum score is 100. Positive changes (i.e., higher scores post-intervention) would represent a positive outcome.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 29 scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-intervention (approximately 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS 29 instrument is a 29-item questionnaire assessing each of the following domains: anxiety, depression, fatigue, physical function, pain interference, pain intensity, sleep disturbance, and ability to participate in social roles and activities. The minimum score is 4 per domain, except for pain intensity for which the minimum score is 0. The maximum score per domain is 20, except for pain intensity for which the maximum score is 10. For the physical function and the ability to participate in social roles and activities domains a high score is indicative of positive outcome. For the anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain interference, and pain intensity a low score is indicative of positive outcome.</description>

    <measure>Changes from baseline in Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-intervention (approximately 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE): self-reported level of physical activity in individuals aged 65 years or older during the previous 7 days. The score accounts for the type of activities performed and the time of performance of each activity. The minimum score is 0. The scale has theoretical maximum value of 864, if subjects spent 24 hours per day over 7 days engaged in vigorous activities. However, as this is not possible, a maximum value of 400 is typically considered as that would correspond to being engage in vigorous activities for 8 hours per day + more moderate activities for 4.5 hours per day.</description>

The participant is asked to draw a line between 24 circles randomly arranged on a page that have to be linked in consecutive order. The TMT is scored by how long it takes to complete the test.</description>
