  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomised study in patients with advanced solid malignancies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to recruit approximately 8 patients with a minimum number of 4 pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK) evaluable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be admitted to the study site pre-dose on Day -1 and will remain at the&#xD;
      study site until at least Day 8. Patients will receive a single administration of&#xD;
      [14C]adavosertib as an oral solution on Day 1. During this study, whole blood, plasma, urine,&#xD;
      faeces, and vomit samples (if presented) will be collected at various time points to&#xD;
      characterise the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and PK of adavosertib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the residential period will be evaluated following treatment of the first&#xD;
      patient and may be adjusted to ensure recovery of at least 90% of the total radioactivity&#xD;
      following the dose of [14C]adavosertib and/or until less than 1% of dose is recovered in&#xD;
      urine and/or faeces within a 24-hour period.&#xD;
