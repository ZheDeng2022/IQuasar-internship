    <textblock>
      RS and the RS plane are important anatomical markers in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;
      However, there are many variations in the shape and orientation of the RS, and the RS plane&#xD;
      is an imaginary plane, which can be misjudged by different surgeons. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to introduce a more intuitive anatomical marker and anatomical plane, hilum plane,&#xD;
      and discuss the application value of hilum plane in laparoscopic biliary surgery by comparing&#xD;
      it with RS and RS plane.&#xD;

      Hepatic hilum plane is the hepatoduodenal serosa plane that extends from the base of the&#xD;
      liver IVa segment down to the first segment of the gallbladder triangle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the operation, first pulling the gallbladder to the head side, using the separating&#xD;
      forceps to slide down horizontally from the hilum (the basement of hepatic segment â…£), and&#xD;
      along the serous of hepatoduodenal ligament, that is so called &quot;hilum plane&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It forms a &quot;neck-shoulder&quot; structure when the hilar plane meets the tent-like hepatobiliary&#xD;
      triangle. the serosa of hepatobiliary triangle was dissected on the neck area and ventral&#xD;
      side of hilar plane, and the serosa of posterior triangle of the gallbladder was also cutted&#xD;
      on the same extension line . In this process, the type and orientation of RS, the&#xD;
      relationship between the plane of the RS sulcus and the plane of the hilar plane were also&#xD;
      recorded and compared with hilum plane.&#xD;

    <description>The Rouviere sulcus was present if a fissure was seen in the liver parenchyma on the right side of the gallbladder and continues with the right posterior hepatic pedicle(fig ). RS were further subdivided into three classes: &quot;open type&quot;, &quot;fused type&quot; or &quot;absent type&quot;). The &quot;plane of RS sulcus&quot; was also recorded If the RS was not the absent type.</description>

    <description>the RS plane is an imaginary line drawn along the sulcus and carried across to the base of segment IV and form a &quot;security triangle&quot;. Similarly, the hilar plane can also form a triangle in posterior triangle of gallbladder. The areas of these triangles were Compared.</description>
