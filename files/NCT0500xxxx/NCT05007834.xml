  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy for cancer, due to its gonadotoxicity, can lead to impaired female fertility,&#xD;
      resulting in the occurrence of transient or prolonged chemo-induced amenorrhea (CIA).&#xD;
      According to recent data from the National Cancer Institute, 11.9% of women under the age of&#xD;
      40 diagnosed with cancer have been offered a fertility evaluation within five years of&#xD;
      diagnosis. Predicting the risk and especially the duration of the CIA remains difficult.&#xD;
      Known factors predicting a rapid return of menstruation are a young age at diagnosis, a low&#xD;
      gonadotoxic treatment (absence of alkylating agents) and a high pre-chemotherapy blood level&#xD;
      of AMH reflecting a large pool of growing follicles. A body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg / m²&#xD;
      could also be a positive predictor, but this remains debated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this project is to assess the impact of metabolism and energy reserves,&#xD;
      physical activity and the chronotype on the recovery of ovarian function in patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer who have developed CIA&#xD;
