  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the study of many extracts in different types of cancer has allowed the validation&#xD;
      of scientific knowledge either as a therapy that reduces the size of the tumor or that helps&#xD;
      to improve the quality of life of the patient by reducing the associated effects of the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Immunobiology and Cell Biology group of the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, a&#xD;
      standardized extract of Caesalpinia spinosa (Dividivi) called P2Et has been obtained. This&#xD;
      extract has been shown to have cytotoxic activity in different human and murine tumor cell&#xD;
      lines, favoring the induction of immunogenic cell death with the release of danger signals&#xD;
      such as calreticulin, HMGB1 and ATP. Additionally, treating mice with murine melanoma and&#xD;
      sinus tumors significantly reduces tumor size and metastases. On the other hand, induction of&#xD;
      complete autophagic flux and synergistic effects with anthracycline-type chemotherapeutics&#xD;
      have been shown in human cell lines and in animal models of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this background, and the results of the Phase I clinical study carried out in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers that showed that the extract is safe, the investigators propose that treatment&#xD;
      with the P2Et extract in patients with breast cancer could improve their general condition,&#xD;
      impacting their quality of life. , and induce antitumor immune response, improving the immune&#xD;
      infiltrate and acting as a transforming agent from a cold tumor to a warm tumor. This would&#xD;
      lead to an improvement in the long-term survival of patients treated with the phytomedicine&#xD;
      in conjunction with the chemotherapeutic treatment selected by the treating oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to advance on this path, and responding to the adjustments suggested in the phase I&#xD;
      study in healthy individuals, it is proposed to carry out a clinical study that allows&#xD;
      determining the optimal biological dose of the P2Et extract in a design based on randomized&#xD;
      simulations of adaptive form and considering the safety of the extract as an objective in&#xD;
      patients with breast cancer. Additionally, those parameters that allow defining the best&#xD;
      indicators of effectiveness of P2Et in this group of patients will be evaluated, such as&#xD;
      modulation of the immune response, quality of life, reduction of adverse effects and&#xD;
      progression-free survival.&#xD;

      Natural products and traditional herbal medicine are an important source of alternative&#xD;
      bioactive compounds, but very few herbal preparations have been scientifically evaluated and&#xD;
      validated for their potential as treatments in medical practice. Phytotherapy is a promising&#xD;
      field in current therapies based on plant-derived compounds given its immunomodulation&#xD;
      properties and its ability to act against tumors, favoring the activation of the immune&#xD;
      response and the reversal of the tumor phenotype through its action on the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last 8 years, the investigators have shown that a standardized extract of&#xD;
      Caesalpinia spinosa, which the investigators call P2Et and which is the study drug of this&#xD;
      protocol, presents an antioxidant activity both intracellular and in solution, which is much&#xD;
      higher than that of of the positive controls used as the TROLOX. P2Et can also modulate drug&#xD;
      resistance pumps, increasing sensitivity to anthracyclines in vitro and in vivo. It induces&#xD;
      apoptosis through the depolarization of the mitochondria in various tumor cells and&#xD;
      specifically in murine breast cancer cells, decreases clonogenicity, which seems to be&#xD;
      related to the reduction of the primary tumor and metastases in animal models of breast&#xD;
      cancer. It can also decrease the production of serum IL-6 in these animals, possibly related&#xD;
      to a reduction in the protumorigenic activity of tumor-associated fibroblasts (results not&#xD;
      yet published). The P2Et-induced tumor death process is accompanied by the expression of&#xD;
      immunogenic death markers such as the expression of calreticulin, secretion of HMGB1 and ATP,&#xD;
      which participate in the activation of dendritic cells. Vaccination of the animals with tumor&#xD;
      cells treated with P2Et allows the generation of long-lived memory LTs, producers of&#xD;
      IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-2, 4 and 5, which can be detected ex vivo. In vivo in animals,&#xD;
      treatment with a vaccine prepared with tumor cells treated with P2Et favors the recruitment&#xD;
      and differentiation of LT to the draining lymph nodes, which produce cytokines in response to&#xD;
      tumor antigens, showing their ability to recognize the tumor. The investigators were also&#xD;
      able to show that P2Et induces a tumor-specific immune response that is superior to that&#xD;
      induced by Doxorubicin, since the LTs generated present greater multifunctionality in terms&#xD;
      of cytokine production. Doxorubicin is known to also induce an immune response through&#xD;
      immunogenic cell death, however, it has also been observed that treatment with anthracyclines&#xD;
      can favor the selection of CMT within the tumor, which suggests that although they induce&#xD;
      antitumor immune response, it is necessary to improve the recognition of MTCs by the immune&#xD;
      system. Vaccination of animals with wild type 4T1 tumor cells treated with P2Et can induce&#xD;
      cytotoxic LTs capable of recognizing murine 4T1 tumor MTCs called H17. This strongly suggests&#xD;
      that there are cross-reactive antigens in both tumor lines and that in vivo, treatment with&#xD;
      P2Et could induce a cross-presentation of antigens that allows the activation of CMT-specific&#xD;
      LTs, which would be reflected in a greater disease-free survival. in animals, and that the&#xD;
      same could be observed in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability of P2Et to carry out its antitumor activity has also been observed in a murine&#xD;
      model of melanoma, in which the investigators show that treatment with P2Et induces LT CD8&#xD;
      specific for the melanoma-specific tumor antigen Trp-2, through a effective&#xD;
      cross-presentation and antigenic presentation by dendritic cells. In fact, the antitumor&#xD;
      activity of P2Et was reduced in RAGg KO immunodeficient animals, which do not present LT or&#xD;
      LB, confirming that the effect of this phytomedicine is partially mediated by the immune&#xD;
      response and that the immune response is required to be activated, to exercise its function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antitumor activity of P2Et may be due to the particular form of immunogenic cell death&#xD;
      induction that is different from that induced by anthracyclines, which allows tumor antigens&#xD;
      to not easily degrade when the cell is dying, due to its high capacity. antioxidant, which is&#xD;
      concomitant with the expression by the tumor cell of immunogenic cell death markers. These&#xD;
      two elements, together, allow dendritic cells to carry out better antigen processing with&#xD;
      complete antigens and therefore the diversity of the LT response, measured at the clonotypic&#xD;
      level, is greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are currently evaluating the local intratumoral and peripheral immune&#xD;
      response induced by anthracycline treatment in patients with breast cancer at Hospital San&#xD;
      Ignacio, in conjunction with a clonotypic analysis of the LTs generated in both compartments&#xD;
      (unpublished data). These results will serve as a basis for later comparing whether the&#xD;
      quality of the response in patients treated with P2Et in conjunction with conventional&#xD;
      chemotherapy is different and whether this may be related to its antitumor activity in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, in previous studies it has been observed that P2Et can modulate the&#xD;
      expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells, improving the therapeutic effect of the anti PD-L1&#xD;
      antibody in vivo in a murine melanoma model. Although the same additive response to&#xD;
      co-treatment (P2Et + anti-PD-L1) was not observed in the breast cancer model, protection of&#xD;
      the affected hematopoietic cells was evidenced with anti-PD-L1 therapy with an improvement in&#xD;
      the number of platelets, lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes in animals that received&#xD;
      P2Et in conjunction with anti-PD-L1 compared to those that only received anti-PD-L1. The&#xD;
      differences in melanoma and breast could be due to the increase in the expression of PD-L1&#xD;
      mainly in the murine melanoma line and not in the 4T1 line in response to P2Et, so it is&#xD;
      important to measure the effect of the P2Et extract on the PD-L1 expression in human tumor&#xD;
      cells and study the relationship with tumor type and other biological variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this background, and the results of the Phase I clinical study carried out in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers that showed that the extract is safe, the investigators propose that treatment&#xD;
      with the P2Et extract in patients with breast cancer could improve their general condition,&#xD;
      impacting their quality of life. , and induce an antitumor immune response, improving the&#xD;
      immune infiltrate and acting as a transforming agent from a cold tumor to a warm tumor. This&#xD;
      would lead to an improvement in the long-term survival of patients treated with phytomedicine&#xD;
      in conjunction with the chemotherapeutic treatment selected by the treating oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to advance on this path, and responding to the adjustments suggested in the phase I&#xD;
      study in healthy individuals, it is proposed to carry out a clinical study that allows&#xD;
      determining the optimal biological dose of the P2Et extract in a design based on randomized&#xD;
      simulations of adaptive form and considering the safety of the extract as an objective in&#xD;
      patients with breast cancer. Additionally, those parameters that allow defining the best&#xD;
      indicators of the effectiveness of P2Et in this group of patients will be evaluated, such as&#xD;
      modulation of the immune response, quality of life, reduction of adverse effects and&#xD;
      progression-free survival.&#xD;
