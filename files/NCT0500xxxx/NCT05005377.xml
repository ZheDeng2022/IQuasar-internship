  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The viability of Platelet Rich Fibrin (PRF) on enhancement of osseous and associated tissue&#xD;
      healing has been substantiated well in literature. This study aimed to assess peri-implant&#xD;
      soft and hard tissue changes after prosthetic loading of implants following socket&#xD;
      preservation with platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) and freeze-dried bone allograft (FDBA) in a&#xD;
      12-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Study evaluated 48 patients who were randomly divided into two groups for anterior ridge&#xD;
      preservation with PRF and FDBA. At 12 months after implant placement and prosthetic delivery,&#xD;
      bone loss was evaluated radiographically while soft tissue changes were evaluated by&#xD;
      measuring gingival recession, papilla index, and bleeding on probing (BOP). The differences&#xD;
      between the PRF and FDBA groups were analyzed using Fisher's exact test and student's t-test&#xD;
      (P&lt;0.05).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted on 48 patients over 18 years of age (average age of 38 years). The&#xD;
      patients required single-rooted incisor/premolar teeth extraction with a hopeless prognosis;&#xD;
      for whom, socket preservation with PRF or FDBA was later performed. The reasons for tooth&#xD;
      extraction included root fracture, failed root canal therapy, and extensive non-restorable&#xD;
      caries. The ethics and study design was approved the Research Ethics Committee of Tehran&#xD;
      University of Medical Sciences (IR.TUMS.DENTISTRY.REC.1396.2610) and conducted in accordance&#xD;
      with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients signed an informed consent prior to&#xD;
      enrollment. They were free to leave the study at any time and ensured about the&#xD;
      confidentiality of their information. The exclusion criteria included a history of systemic&#xD;
      disease and head/neck radiotherapy, use of drugs affecting bone metabolism, smoking more than&#xD;
      10 cigarettes per day, the presence of significant periapical or periodontal lesions around&#xD;
      the respective teeth, and the presence of dehiscence or fenestration larger than 3mm in the&#xD;
      buccal bone plate. After extraction of the teeth, the patients underwent socket preservation&#xD;
      with the use of PRF or FDBA. 4 months later, they received a Zimmer ScrewVent bone-level&#xD;
      implant (Zimmer, Biomet, USA) which was left in place for 2 to 4 month (mandible and maxilla&#xD;
      respectively) to achieve proper osseointegration. All implants were successfully&#xD;
      osseointegrated. 10 patients were excluded during the study due to poor cooperation in the&#xD;
      follow-up period. Eventually, 38 patients including 23 females and 15 males were subjected to&#xD;
      hard and soft tissue assessments at 6 and 12 months, postoperatively. Patients in the PRF&#xD;
      group included 9 males and 9 females (a total of 18) with a mean age of 30.81 years (ranging&#xD;
      from 21 to 50 years). Patients in the FDBA group included 6 males and 14 females (a total of&#xD;
      20) with a mean age of 37.25 years (ranging from 22 to 50 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In second-stage surgery, a full-thickness flap was elevated and a gingival former (Zimmer,&#xD;
      Biomet, USA) matching the fixture size placed. Soft tissue healing around the gingival former&#xD;
      was allowed for 3 weeks and then a fixture level impression made using the closed-tray&#xD;
      impression technique by additional silicone (Panasil, Kettenbach GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Eschenburg).&#xD;
      The master cast was poured with G-mask SnowRock (Velmix; MungyoGroup, Korea) and Moldano&#xD;
      dental stone (Tara, Iran). All selected abutments were straight, with a 0.5 mm gingival&#xD;
      height. If the gingival height around an implant was variable, the higher value was chosen&#xD;
      and other surfaces of the abutment were prepared such that the final finish line was&#xD;
      positioned 0.5 mm subgingivally. After abutment preparation, a metal framework was waxed-up&#xD;
      for a cement-retained metal-ceramic crown using resin pattern (GC Corporation, USA). The&#xD;
      framework was then cast (WirobondÂ® C, Bego, USA) and tried in the second session. Vita&#xD;
      Classic Shade Guide (Vitapan, Germany) was used to select the tooth shade. Porcelain&#xD;
      adjustments (VITA VM ceramic, VITA Zahnfabrik, Germany) including the contacts, occlusion,&#xD;
      contour and the esthetic appearance of the crown was performed at the third session. The&#xD;
      crowns were then glazed. In the fourth prosthetic session, the abutments were tighten to 25&#xD;
      N.Cm final torque and sealed with a Teflon band. The glazed crown was cemented with temporary&#xD;
      cement (TempBond, Kerr) and excess cement thoroughly removed. Complete seating of the crown&#xD;
      and excess cement removal were ensured in the first radiograph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the hard tissue stability around each implant, a digital radiograph (Digora Optime,&#xD;
      Acteon, India) was obtained with a size 2 sensor using a film holder (Kerr). All baseline and&#xD;
      follow-up radiographs were parallel and exposure settings were the same for each patient in&#xD;
      the baseline and follow-up radiographs. Using Scanora software (SCANORA lite, Soredex,&#xD;
      Helsinki, Finland), the distance from the crestal bone-fixture interface to the&#xD;
      abutment-crown interface (crown margin) was measured at the mesial and distal surfaces of the&#xD;
      implant at 0, 6 and 12 months after implant placement (Fig1).These measurements were repeated&#xD;
      3 times at the mesial and 3 times at the distal surfaces for each patient and the mean values&#xD;
      reported to minimize the errors. To assess soft tissue changes, clinical gingival parameters&#xD;
      including the gingival recession (defined as the change in the distance from the gingival&#xD;
      margin to the crown margin compared with time 0), the papilla index (distance from the tip of&#xD;
      the papilla to the crown margin in the mesial and distal surfaces) (Fig2), and bleeding on&#xD;
      probing (BOP) at the mesiobuccal and distobuccal points were measured at 0, 6 and 12 months,&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were analyzed using SPSS version 22. Qualitative variables were compared using Fisher's&#xD;
      exact test while quantitative variables were compared using unpaired student's t-test. The&#xD;
      level of significance was set at 0.05.&#xD;
