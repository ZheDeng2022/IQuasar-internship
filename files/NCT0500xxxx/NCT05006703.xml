  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will address the impaired quality of life of young people with asthma, despite&#xD;
      appropriate medicines. Research shows that young people report needing to calm themselves&#xD;
      down during an asthma attack to control their breathing. Although physiotherapist- delivered&#xD;
      breathing retraining programmes now have a clear evidence base in adults with asthma,&#xD;
      improving quality of life, there is a lack of evidence assessing its use in younger patients.&#xD;
      The investigators have redesigned an adult training package to make it appropriate for young&#xD;
      people and will now assess how effective such an intervention would be in this population.&#xD;
      This study will include young people (12-17 years) with physician diagnosed asthma. The&#xD;
      repurposing, optimisation and acceptability of the intervention in the adolescent age group&#xD;
      has been undertaken in Stages 1 and 2 of the BREATHE4T project. A self-guided, breathing&#xD;
      retraining digital intervention has been developed, delivered via a mobile friendly, online&#xD;
      platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is a randomised, controlled feasibility trial and will provide the&#xD;
      necessary information for a substantive cost-effectiveness trial. Participants with access to&#xD;
      the intervention will be compared to a usual care group. Asthma and quality of life of both&#xD;
      groups will also be assessed at baseline, 2-month and 6-month time points. At the end of the&#xD;
      6 months, the control group will also be given access to the website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The online nature of this study allows recruitment from across the UK. Recruitment methods&#xD;
      would include primary care, hospital clinics, social media and posters. Asthma UK will also&#xD;
      provide publicity to assist recruitment.&#xD;

      The trial will aim to assess the acceptability, uptake and success in collecting follow up&#xD;
      data and variance in asthma-related outcome measures. A parallel group design will be used&#xD;
      with participants being randomised to intervention or normal management. The intervention&#xD;
      will be a self-guided, breathing retraining digital intervention, delivered via a&#xD;
      mobile-friendly, online platform. The intervention will continue to be used for 6 months&#xD;
      after which both groups will be reassessed. The usual management control group will then have&#xD;
      access to the intervention (delayed access).&#xD;

    <description>A digital, self-management intervention for adolescents to control their asthma using breathing retraining. The mobile-friendly website provides information about asthma and how it affects the lungs, as well as how breathing patterns can be dysfunctional. Information is presented using short (30sec-2min) video clips featuring physiotherapists, researchers and adolescent role models. Users are given tips about their practice, including choosing a suitable time and place and building up gradually. Users can plan their practice, log how their practice went and record their confidence in using the breathing techniques. There are 8 sessions including peer-led videos demonstrating breathing exercises with voiceovers and step-by-step instructions. All features and sessions can be accessed via a main dashboard where users can tailor the intervention to allow parental involvement, reminders and a preferred format for notifications (email/text). Other features include FAQs and a progress chart.</description>
