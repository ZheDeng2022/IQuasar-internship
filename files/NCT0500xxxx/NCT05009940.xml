  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of Gradusox™ compression hosiery on the local&#xD;
      tissue oxygenation and compare this effect against that achieved by standard compression&#xD;
      hosiery.&#xD;

      After being informed about the study, all participants giving written informed consent will&#xD;
      be randomised by closed envelope randomisation to either a) first, GraduSOX on their right&#xD;
      leg and Sigvaris on their left leg, then GraduSOX on their left leg and Sigvaris on their&#xD;
      right leg, or b) first, GraduSOX on their left leg and Sigvaris on their right leg, then&#xD;
      GraduSOX on their right leg and Sigvaris on their left leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend the clinic and be fitted with their stockings. Non-invasive probes&#xD;
      will be taped to the skin above the inner ankle on both legs - these take measurements for&#xD;
      SO2, oxyHb and deoxyHb every second. Measurements for these variables will be taken for 15&#xD;
      minutes whilst participants are not wearing stockings, as well as with stockings (worn in the&#xD;
      order assigned to them). During these 15 minutes, participants will lie in supine for 5&#xD;
      minutes, then in sitting position for 5 minutes, then will return to supine for the last 5&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between each stocking, participants will be asked to take a 10 minute walk and return to the&#xD;
      recliner in supine to re-equilibrate for a further 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total time that measurements are taken for per participant is 50 minutes.&#xD;
