  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project proposes to use telemedicine-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      enhanced with continuous glucose monitor (CGM) review to target diabetes distress in young&#xD;
      adults with type 1 diabetes. The efficacy of CBT for diabetes distress (CBT-DD) will be&#xD;
      tested in comparison to commercial FDA-approved CGM only in a randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial. The investigators central hypothesis is that the addition of a CBT intervention that&#xD;
      targets diabetes distress and self-management directly will yield clinically significant&#xD;
      improvements in both diabetes distress and glycemic control relative to CGM alone. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to recruit 150 young adults (age 18-30) with type 1 diabetes from a&#xD;
      national population for an entirely virtual 6-month study over four years, with targeted&#xD;
      recruitment of racial/ethnic minorities. In addition to standard measurement of HbA1c for&#xD;
      glycemic control and validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) surveys, the investigators plan&#xD;
      to innovatively integrate momentary psychological and behavioral data via smartphone-based&#xD;
      ecological momentary assessment with CGM data to assess day-to-day changes in diabetes&#xD;
      distress, affect, self-management, and glycemia over the course of the trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of CBT-DD, enhanced by CGM&#xD;
      feedback. The study period will last for 6 months, with the first 3 months on CGM and&#xD;
      consisting of a 2-week run-in period prior to randomization, in which EMA data will be&#xD;
      collected daily, followed by an 8-week CBT intervention period in which EMA data will be&#xD;
      collected weekly surrounding CBT sessions, with a subsequent 2-week period post-intervention&#xD;
      in which EMA data will again be collected daily. Both intervention and control groups will be&#xD;
      doing the same EMA and CGM procedures to enable matching data for comparison. After this&#xD;
      3-month period, EMA and CGM will cease and a follow-up virtual study visit will occur 3&#xD;
      months afterward, at the 6-month time point, to assess 6 month outcomes and durability of&#xD;
      intervention effect from 3 to 6 months. Participants in both arms will be provided a&#xD;
      sufficient supply of CGM sensors to track their blood glucose daily, throughout the first 3&#xD;
      months of the study. If participants already have personal CGM, they will replace with&#xD;
      study-supplied CGM. Validated self-report questionnaires will be administered via REDCap to&#xD;
      collect diabetes distress and related patient-reported outcomes (PRO's) at baseline&#xD;
      (beginning of the 2-week run-in period), 3 months (end of the 2-week post-intervention EMA&#xD;
      period), and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess and to improve diabetes distress (DDS) in young&#xD;
      adults with Type 1 diabetes, using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Adherence and Depression&#xD;
      (CBT-AD).&#xD;

    <description>We will directly test whether targeting diabetes distress and glycemic control in YA with T1D with a time-limited cognitive behavioral intervention can result in clinically significant improvements, over those achieved with standard of medical care CGM alone. Our design is scientifically rigorous and our results will have a significant impact on our scientific understanding of the relationship between diabetes distress and glycemic levels and variability. We will use a secure web-based videoconferencing intervention delivery platform as an innovation that is responsive to the clear efficacy of remotely delivered CBT, CGM initiation and support, and currently covered in telemedicine diabetes care in T1D.</description>

    <description>Control arm participants will also wear CGM throughout the first 6 months, during the 2-week run-in, 12-week CBT intervention, and 2-week post-intervention period. Control arm participants will answer EMA surveys as in the intervention arm to enable paired analysis of responses between arms. Participants can initiate CGM review from their healthcare providers if desired. By allowing control arm participants to have access to CGM and to use CGM data for change in self-management behaviors, we will be able to control for CGM effect on diabetes distress levels in the intervention. We will also provide written materials for recognizing and managing diabetes distress and online resources</description>

    <description>Treatment and control arm participants will wear CGM throughout the CBT intervention period of 12 weeks plus 2-week run-in and 2-week post-intervention periods for a total of 6 months of CGM wear. Ecological momentary assessments (EMA) of DD, mood states, and self-management behaviors will be paired with CGM during the 2-week run-in and post-intervention periods. During the 2-week run-in and post-intervention periods, EMA surveys will be elicited daily to assess for certain domains of diabetes distress and diabetes self-management, which may vary on a daily basis. During the intervention period of 12 weeks, EMA will be delivered once per week prior to CBT sessions to allow for integration with CGM review during therapy. These intensive longitudinal assessments during the 12-week intervention period will guide treatment tailoring and during the first 6 months will facilitate examination of within-person change in diabetes distress, self-management, and CGM glucose over time.</description>
