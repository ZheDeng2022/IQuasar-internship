  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent and debilitating condition. The numerous&#xD;
      symptoms incurred by PD greatly lowers patients' quality of life and their self-care ability.&#xD;
      Conventional medications cannot control all symptoms yet inflict adverse effects.&#xD;
      Observational study reported that Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is frequently sought by PD&#xD;
      patients. However, clinical evidence on the effect of CHM is conflicted and low in quality.&#xD;
      This trial aims to explore the effect of CHM incorporating pattern subgroup differentiation&#xD;
      in treating PD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To explore the effect of CHM on PD parameters, including symptom severity and&#xD;
      quality of life, by utilizing a Chinese medicine (CM) pattern diagnostic and treatment&#xD;
      guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This trial is a pilot assessor-blind, add-on, randomised, controlled, pragmatic&#xD;
      clinical trial. 160 PD patients will be recruited and randomised into treatment or control&#xD;
      group in a 1:1 ratio. Patients in treatment group will receive a 32-week CHM treatment based&#xD;
      on CM pattern differentiation on top of their conventional medication (ConM), while control&#xD;
      group will receive ConM only. The primary outcome is part II of the Movement Disorder Society&#xD;
      Sponsored Revision of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), which assesses&#xD;
      motor-related quality of life. Secondary outcomes include part and total scores of MDS-UPDRS,&#xD;
      domain and total scores of Non-motor symptom scale (NMSS), and the pattern assessment in&#xD;
      Guiding Principle of Clinical Research on New Drugs of Chinese Medicine. Adverse events will&#xD;
      be monitored by monthly follow-ups and questionnaires. Data analysis will be conducted using&#xD;
      Jamovi or R.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval: Ethical clearance of this study is given by the Research Ethics Committee&#xD;
      of Hong Kong Baptist University (reference number: REC/20-21/0206).&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive integrated medicine treatment combining Chinese herbal treatment, given in the form of granules, and conventional medication for 32 weeks. Patients will be differentiated into 4 subgroups based on their Chinese medicine pattern, and receive herbal treatment accordingly. An existing clinical pathway will guide the diagnosis and treatment of the Chinese medicine patterns. The four pattern subgroups are as follows:&#xD;
1) the &quot;Phlegm-heat stirring Wind&quot; subgroup; 2) the &quot;Spleen-and Kidney-Yang&quot; subgroup; 3) the &quot;deficiency of Liver- and Kidney-Yin&quot; subgroup; and 4) the &quot;Qi deficiency and stasis of Blood&quot; subgroup&#xD;
To resemble actual clinical practice, minor adjustment of herbal treatment will be possible and also adhere to the mentioned clinical guideline. The dosage of each herbal drug will follow the instructions of China Pharmacopeia.</description>
