  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased prevalence of overweight and obesity is one of the main health problems recently.&#xD;
      Energy balance from nutrition intake and energy expenditure through physical activity,&#xD;
      especially structured physical activity, is needed to prevent overweight individuals become&#xD;
      obese individuals. This research obejective is to explore the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      structured high intensity interval training in male young adults subjects with overweight&#xD;
      based on change of body composition, oxidative stress and inflammatory markers. This research&#xD;
      used experimental model to test structured high intensity interval training program with&#xD;
      pre-post test in single group. Comprehensive analysis of training effect in this research&#xD;
      consists of measurement of several parameters, such as body composition, inflammatory&#xD;
      markers, and oxidative stress markers as the benchmark of training safety. Browning white&#xD;
      adipose tissue and cognitive function are complement parameters to the assessment of training&#xD;
      effectiveness. Daily food record and physical activity for 3 x 24 hours will be carried out&#xD;
      periodically to control confounding factors.&#xD;

      -  Subjects are recruited via e-flyer distributed online across university departments.&#xD;
           Individual who is interested in study participation fills out screening form. Research&#xD;
           assistants screen subjects eligibility. Subjects are coded based on the order of&#xD;
           screening form fulfillment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research assistants are using the standard operational procedures for each assessments.&#xD;
           Training for the research assistants precedes the data collection to ensure the&#xD;
           similarity of understanding and skills during measurements. One research assistant&#xD;
           responsible for scheduling the assessments and training sessions. Continuous evaluation&#xD;
           are planned weekly to provide room for improvements in the process of data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size assessment is measured from 5 primary output by a research assistants using&#xD;
           sample size calculation website for single intervention clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We use paper based data collection for each assessment and during training sessions.&#xD;
           Subject are encouraged to report any symptoms and signs during intervention period in&#xD;
           each meeting with the research assistants or via online messaging. Any reports will be&#xD;
           documented in separated form. One research assistant makes sure the data fields are&#xD;
           completed in each measurements and during training sessions. The assistant also check&#xD;
           the similarity of the data entered in the master table.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data analysis will be lead by one research assistant using newest version of SPSS&#xD;
           software. The analysis will be started after the baseline measurement is completed&#xD;
           although the data collection is not finished. All numeric data will be presented as mean&#xD;
           and standard deviations if normally distributed or median and minimum maximum range if&#xD;
           not normally distributed. Paired t-test will be used to identify the difference before&#xD;
           and after the intervention if the data are normally distributed. If the data are not&#xD;
           normally distributed, Wilcoxon test will be used to identify the difference before and&#xD;
           after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure that there is no missing data, the research assistant who responsible for data&#xD;
      completeness will perform daily checking. Any missing data will be stated and immediately&#xD;
      completed. Research assistants will provide close supervision for each subject to ensure the&#xD;
      delivery of all necessary reports.&#xD;
