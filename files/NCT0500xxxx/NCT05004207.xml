  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radionuclide scintigraphy is the gold standard technique to interpret OCTT but there is no&#xD;
      normative data available for its interpretation in Indian population. Previous studies to&#xD;
      determine OCTT have all been done with LHBT, which has many limitations. Besides there are&#xD;
      few small comparative studies between scintigraphy and LHBT, that too not in Indian&#xD;
      population. The aim of this study is to validate LHBT to measure OCTT compared with&#xD;
      scintigraphy and to standardize the normal OCTT in healthy individuals&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION Oro-caecal transit time (OCTT) can be defined as time taken for the meal to&#xD;
           reach from oral cavity to caecum and how long it takes for food to pass through small&#xD;
           intestines. It's important because it influences how efficiently nutrients are absorbed&#xD;
           from food and influences fermentation associated with healthy gut flora. Short transit&#xD;
           time may be due to inflammation caused by intestinal infection, food allergies, or by&#xD;
           absence of healthy intestinal flora. Long transit time is usually due to eating too much&#xD;
           refined and processed foods, low thyroid, dehydration, lack of dietary fibre, serotonin&#xD;
           deficiency and insufficient salt intake Several factors affect the oro-caecal transit&#xD;
           time such as: physiological (age, sex, menstrual cycle), usage of stimulants (coffee,&#xD;
           alcohol, cigarette smoking), as well as pathological conditions. Patients can have&#xD;
           gastrointestinal symptoms, which may be secondary to small intestinal dysmotility which&#xD;
           can be achieved by interpretation of oro- caecal transit time. Thus measurement of OCTT&#xD;
           helps in various GI diseases eg. chronic constipation, chronic diarrhoea, Dyspepsia,&#xD;
           Irritable bowel syndrome, chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction or functional&#xD;
           recto-sigmoid obstruction, scleroderma, celiac disease &amp; Malabsorption syndrome. Two&#xD;
           techniques are available to assess oro-cecal transit time, Lactulose hydrogen breath&#xD;
           test and Radionuclide scintigraphy, where latter is the gold standard technique to&#xD;
           interpret OCTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. RATIONALE Radionuclide scintigraphy is the gold standard technique to interpret OCTT but&#xD;
           there is no normative data available for interpretation of OCTT in Indian population.&#xD;
           Previous studies to determine OCTT have all been done with LHBT, which has many&#xD;
           limitations. Besides there are few small comparative studies between scintigraphy and&#xD;
           LHBT, that too not in Indian population. Interpretation of OCTT helps in assessment of&#xD;
           various GI disorders which may be secondary to small intestinal dysmotility having&#xD;
           gastrointestinal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY POPULATION- 50 healthy asymptomatic subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. DESIGN AND DURATION OF THE STUDY- It will be a pilot study. The study duration will be&#xD;
           till completion of data collection for 50 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. METHODOLOGY- 5a. SUBJECT RECRUITMENT - Healthy volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      5b. RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING- N/A&#xD;
&#xD;
      5c. STUDY METHODS- This observational study will be conducted among 50 patients of both sexes&#xD;
      after obtaining ethical clearance from institutional human ethical committee. Study&#xD;
      participants will be of the age more than 18 years. Exclusion criteria will consist of&#xD;
      thoracic or digestive foregut surgery, alcohol consumption &gt;40 g/day, use of medications that&#xD;
      alter intragastric acidity or esophageal motility, as well as history of diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      thyroid disorder, neurological disorders or other chronic gastrointestinal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5d. STUDY PROCEDURE- Subjects will be advised to stop any medications that affect GI motility&#xD;
      2 days prior to testing and avoid strenuous exercise and cigarette smoking on the day of&#xD;
      test. After fasting for at least 8 to 12 hours, standardised meal - 3 idli plus curd mixed&#xD;
      with 18.5-37 Minimum Base Quantity (MBq) (0.5-1 mCi) of 99mTc-sulfur colloid radiolabelled&#xD;
      test meal will be administered as quickly as possible, optimally within 10 min. Imaging will&#xD;
      be obtained with Siemens Symbia E dual head scanner in a format of at least 128 x 128 pixels&#xD;
      using a general-purpose collimator or a low energy high-resolution collimator The photopeak&#xD;
      settings are 20% at the 140-keV (kiloelectron volt) peak for 99mTc. Anterior and posterior&#xD;
      planar images (or a single left anterior oblique image) with the distal oesophagus, stomach,&#xD;
      and proximal small bowel in the field of view will be obtained for 1 min immediately after&#xD;
      ingestion of the test meal and Repeated images will be obtained in the same projections with&#xD;
      2 min static images at hourly intervals up to 6 h and 24 h, as was used for the initial&#xD;
      images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next day after at least 12 hours of fasting with no strenuous exercise and cigarette smoking&#xD;
      on the day of test, with no antibiotics 4 weeks prior to testing and no prokinetic drug or&#xD;
      laxatives 2 weeks prior to testing. Following administration of test substrate (Lactulose 10&#xD;
      grams) with one cup of water, breath samples will be analysed for hydrogen every 15 minutes&#xD;
      for 1 hour followed by every ½ hour for next 2 hour with LACTOFEN 2 device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5e. METHODS OF ASSESSMENT-.The analysis process will consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Interpretation of oro-caecal transit time with scintigraphy i.e by the percentage&#xD;
           accumulation of 99mTc in the caecum&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Interpretation of oro-caecal transit time with LHBT i.e the time interval between&#xD;
           ingestion of lactulose and rise in breath hydrogen 20 ppm above basal&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Co-relation of oro-caecal time between scintigraphy and LHBT&#xD;
&#xD;
           6. Sample Size Calculaion- It will be a pilot study. The study duration will be till&#xD;
           completion of data collection for 50 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7. Statistical Analysis- Data will be expressed as median and percentile values (5th,&#xD;
           25th, 75th and 95th percentiles). Depending on normality of distribution, we will use&#xD;
           either paired Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test for paired comparison. Likewise,&#xD;
           we will use one way analysis of variance with Tukey test or Kruskal-Wallis, followed by&#xD;
           Dunn's test as appropriate. Upper limit of normal will be defined as the 95th percentile&#xD;
           of normal values. P≤0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8. ETHICAL JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY - Both the procedure being done in this study are&#xD;
           considered safe and not associated with any major adverse event. But there is very&#xD;
           minimal risk of radiation exposure in radionuclide scintigraphy study, which is less&#xD;
           than exposure to a chest X ray.There is no normative data available for interpretation&#xD;
           of OCTT in Indian subjects using nuclear scintigraphy. The commonly used test for&#xD;
           measurement of OCTT, i.e LHBT has also not been validated in Indian subjects as compared&#xD;
           to the scintigraphy. This study will help us give a reference value for OCTT, which&#xD;
           could be used for defining altered small bowel transit time.&#xD;
