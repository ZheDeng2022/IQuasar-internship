  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability and to&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      GS-1811 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in 2 phases, Phase 1a (Part A and Part B: monotherapy) and Phase&#xD;
      1b (Part C: combination therapy), in participants with advanced solid tumors who have&#xD;
      received, been intolerant to, or been ineligible for all treatments known to confer clinical&#xD;
      benefit (Phase 1a and Phase 1b) and whose diseases are indicated for pembrolizumab&#xD;
      monotherapy treatment (Phase 1b only).&#xD;
