  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer in China. In recent years, immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor has gradually become a research hotspot, and it has continuously&#xD;
      achieved huge breakthroughs. The FDA and NMPA have approved multiple PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors&#xD;
      for first-line or second-line treatment of advanced or metastatic NSCLC. But In clinical&#xD;
      practice, there is still some controversy about PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy, especially for&#xD;
      patients with low PD-L1 expression, the efficacy of monotherapy needs to be further improved.&#xD;
      Strong genetic and functional evidence indicates that FGFR dysregulation can lead to the&#xD;
      development and progression of cancer. Genetic alterations of FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3 have&#xD;
      been found in a variety of tumors. Squamous non-small cell lung cancer has about 13% of FGFR&#xD;
      variants, while there are only 4% of any FGFR variants in lung adenocarcinoma. Studies of&#xD;
      FGFR inhibitors in NSCLC show that AZD4575 has shown partial efficacy in FGFR partially&#xD;
      mutated and expanded lung squamous cell carcinoma. FGFR pathway is involved in the regulation&#xD;
      of the tumor immune microenvironment. In the tumor suppressor model of rectal cancer, it has&#xD;
      been observed that FGFR2 overexpression promotes the expression of PD-L1 by activating&#xD;
      JAK/STAT3 pathway, leading to tumor growth. In a lung cancer suppressor mouse model, the&#xD;
      combination of FGFR inhibitor and PD-1 inhibitor can improve tumor remission and prolong&#xD;
      survival. Based on the preliminary clinical data, this study assumes that&#xD;
      Sintilimab(anti-PD-1) combined with Pemigatinib(FGFR inhibitor) can further improve efficay&#xD;
      of advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 positive and FGFR1-3 mutation) including but not limited to FGFR&#xD;
      amplification, rearrangement/fusion, mutation, etc.).&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, Phase II clinical study. 20 Histologically confirmed NSCLCs with&#xD;
      unresectable or locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease not suitable for radical&#xD;
      concurrent chemo-radiotherapy, treatment naive, and confirmed PD-L1 positive with FGFR 1-3&#xD;
      mutations are enrolled. The participants will receive Sintilimab combined with Pemigatinib&#xD;
      every 3 weeks (Q3W): Sintilimab is administered every 3 weeks (200mg, IV), Pemigatinib 13.5&#xD;
      mg once daily (QD) orally, continuous administration. The subject will continue treatment&#xD;
      until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, start of&#xD;
      other anti-tumor treatments, death or other conditions that should be stopped as prescribed&#xD;
      by the protocol. The longest administration time of Sintilimab is 2 years (35 cycles). In&#xD;
      consideration of the safety of the combination therapy, this study will conduct safety&#xD;
      monitoring on the 6 subjects initially enrolled in the safety observation period (defined as&#xD;
      21 days after the subjects received the study drug treatment for the first time) . After the&#xD;
      study enrollment reaches 6 subjects, enrollment will be suspended until the safety&#xD;
      observation period of the 6th patient is over and the conditions for continuing the study are&#xD;
      met. If ≥2 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) are observed in these 6 patients, the investigators&#xD;
      will review the data and discuss, and decide to revise the dosing regimen of the follow-up&#xD;
      study to reduce the incidence of adverse events, or terminate it completely. If DLT is less&#xD;
      than or equal to 1 of the 6 participants, the study will continue to follow the original&#xD;
      protocol. The primary endpoint is objective response rate, the secondary endpoints are&#xD;
      progression free survival, duration of response, time to response, disease control rate,&#xD;
      overall survival, safety and tolerance.&#xD;
