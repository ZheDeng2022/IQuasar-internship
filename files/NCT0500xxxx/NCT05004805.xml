  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of a single-center, blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel-group study testing for the efficacy and safety of Methylene blue when administered&#xD;
      topically as a 0.02% solution for nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal irrigation in COVID-19&#xD;
      patients requiring hospitalization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of the study. To test the hypothesis that the topical application of 0.02% MB&#xD;
      solution in the form of repeated nasopharyngeal irrigation will lead to an accelerated&#xD;
      recovery compared to placebo, defined by the clinical, laboratory, and radiological&#xD;
      improvement with a negative molecular test for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of 0.02% MB irrigation of&#xD;
      the nasopharynx mucosa over placebo, alongside the standard treatment carried out in&#xD;
      accordance with the Temporary Guidelines of &quot;Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Novel&#xD;
      Coronavirus Infection (COVID-19)&quot;, version 11 (May 7, 2021). Regarding the recovery of&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19, this is defined as a negative PCR test result for the SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      coronavirus in swabs from the nasopharynx and oropharynx on the 14th and 28th day after&#xD;
      initiation of the experimental treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the additional efficacy and overall safety&#xD;
      parameters, including saturation dynamics, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, CT signs of lung&#xD;
      damage, dynamics of the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) 2 during treatment. Due to the&#xD;
      pilot nature of this study, another goal is to calculate the effect based on the number of&#xD;
      subjects per group for a future study.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention is carried out in addition to the standard treatment. Administered Intervention is topical application of 0.02% Methylene blue solution in the form of repeated nasopharyngeal irrigation. The investigational drug is equipped with a spray nozzle to perform three administrations into both lower nasal passages. After three administrations on each side, it is recommended to take a deep breath so that the injected solution is distributed along the nasopharynx and oropharynx every 4 hours (5-6 times a day with a break for sleep). Duration is the period of stay of the subject, as long as there is no need for non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. If the subject refuses further treatment in a hospital but does not withdraw consent to participate in the study, they should continue to take study drug after discharge from hospital, but not later than the date of the follow-up visit.</description>
