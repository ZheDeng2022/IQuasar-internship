  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CochlearTM Osia®2 System was cleared by the Food and Drug Administration November 15,&#xD;
      2019 (K191921) for individuals aged 12 years and older who present with conductive or mixed&#xD;
      hearing loss (up to 55 dB HL) or single-sided-deafness (SSD).Published and unpublished data&#xD;
      suggest significant pre to postoperative benefit and minimal risk in both children and adults&#xD;
      who have received the Osia system. Thus the objective of this study is to examine the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of the Cochlear Osia 2 system in a group of pediatric subjects aged 5 to 11&#xD;
      years who suffer from conductive or mixed hearing loss (up to 55 dB HL), or&#xD;
      single-sided-deafness (SSD) with the intent of expanding the indications for use.&#xD;

      The CochlearTM Osia®2 System was cleared by the Food and Drug Administration November 15,&#xD;
      2019 (K191921) for individuals aged 12 years and older who present with conductive or mixed&#xD;
      hearing loss (up to 55 dB HL) or single-sided-deafness (SSD). Published and unpublished data&#xD;
      suggest significant pre to postoperative benefit and minimal risk in both children and adults&#xD;
      who have received the Osia system. Due to the success of the Osia 2 system in the United&#xD;
      States within the currently indicated patient population, clinical providers have since&#xD;
      requested the ability to use the Osia 2 system in children aged 11 years and younger who meet&#xD;
      the audiometric requirements. As the Osia 2 system is based on existing bone conduction and&#xD;
      cochlear implant technologies which each possess a younger age of implantation requirement (5&#xD;
      years for bone conduction and 9 months for cochlear implantation), the current proposal is to&#xD;
      align the age at implantation requirement with existing surgical bone conduction technology&#xD;
      such as the Baha Connect and Baha Attract Systems to 5 years of age. Therefore, the objective&#xD;
      of this study is to examine the safety and effectiveness of the Cochlear Osia 2 system in a&#xD;
      group of pediatric subjects aged 5 to 11 years who suffer from conductive or mixed hearing&#xD;
      loss (up to 55 dB HL), or single-sided-deafness (SSD) with the intent of expanding the&#xD;
      indications for use.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects aged 5 to 11 years of age with the following audiometric criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A conductive or mixed hearing loss and still can benefit from sound&#xD;
                  amplification. The pure tone average (PTA) bone conduction (BC) threshold&#xD;
                  (measured at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz) should be better than or equal to 55 dB HL. OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A profound sensorineural hearing loss in one ear and normal hearing in the&#xD;
                  opposite ear (i.e., single-sided deafness or &quot;SSD&quot;). The pure tone average air&#xD;
                  conduction hearing thresholds of the hearing ear should be better than or equal&#xD;
                  to 20 dB HL (measured at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior experience with amplified sound through properly fitted amplification device&#xD;
             such as a hearing aid, a CROS device, or a bone conduction device on a softband or&#xD;
             sound arc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Parent or Legally Authorized Representative who is willing and able to provide written&#xD;
             informed consent for the study participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Subjects may include individuals seeking new implantation unilaterally (in one ear)&#xD;
        or individuals already implanted with a bone-anchored device seeking a second-side implant&#xD;
        (sequential bilateral)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Insufficient bone quality or quantity to support implantation of both the BI300&#xD;
             Implant and the OSI200 Implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Chronic or non-revisable vestibular or balance disorders that could prevent benefit&#xD;
             from the device, as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Abnormally progressive hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Evidence that hearing loss is bilateral retro cochlear or bilateral central origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Evidence of conditions that would prevent speech recognition improvement as determined&#xD;
             by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Skin or scalp conditions that may preclude attachment of the Sound Processor or that&#xD;
             may interfere with the use of the Sound Processor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Unable or unwilling to comply with the requirements of the clinical investigation as&#xD;
             determined by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Investigator site personnel directly affiliated with this study and/or their immediate&#xD;
             families; immediate family is defined as a spouse, parent, child, or sibling.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Cochlear employees or employees of Contract Research Organizations or contractors&#xD;
             engaged by Cochlear for the purposes of this investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Currently participating, or participated within the last 30 days, in another clinical&#xD;
             investigation involving an investigational drug or device that could impact the safety&#xD;
             or effectiveness of the Osia 2 system as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
