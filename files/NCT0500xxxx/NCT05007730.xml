  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition significantly contributes to the disability and mortality associated with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias. Thus, nutritional status is&#xD;
      one important, modifiable clinical factor for maintaining physical and cognitive health among&#xD;
      persons with dementia (PWD). This project will pilot an innovative approach to enhancing&#xD;
      nutrition through the use of transitional-state snack supplements, or foods that start as one&#xD;
      texture and change to another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, this study aims to demonstrate the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of a&#xD;
      transitional-state therapeutic nutrition supplement among adults with dementia. The central&#xD;
      hypothesis is that access to ready-made, savory, nutrient- dense snack supplements that&#xD;
      resemble &quot;typical&quot; preferred foods and eating habits will result in improved nutritional&#xD;
      intake and status among PWD.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Prior to enrollment (to determine eligibility at baseline, prior to study onset; week 0)</time_frame>
    <description>Instrumental swallowing assessments will be conducted for each participant by a licensed speech-language pathologist to determine whether the potential participant can safely consume transitional-state foods based on their swallowing physiology. The number of potential participants deemed eligible to consume this consistency of food will be compared to the total number of potential participants receiving the swallow study.</description>

    <time_frame>Measured weekly for enrolled participants (weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Using a Likert (5 point) rating scale, participants will rate their acceptability of the nutrition supplements each week. Change in acceptability will be calculated over the length of the study (e.g., increased or decreased acceptability over time)</description>

    <time_frame>Measured weekly for enrolled participants (weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)</time_frame>
    <description>As a measured of adherence to the protocol, participants will document the total number of test snacks consumed each week (protocol is for at least one snack per day)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in malnutrition status (not present, present, moderate, severe)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline (study onset) and post-intervention (end of study after 8 weeks of snack consumption)</time_frame>
    <description>Malnutrition status (not present, present, moderate, severe) will be assessed via a nutrition-focused physical exam (NFPE) by a registered dietitian. The exams will be guided by the recommendations of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) in conjunction with the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) and use the following characteristics for diagnosing malnutrition: insufficient energy intake, weight loss, loss of muscle mass, loss of subcutaneous fat, fluid accumulation, and diminished functional status. Using published definitions of the six clinical characteristics, a diagnosis of severe malnutrition, moderate malnutrition, or not malnourished will be made.</description>

    <measure>Change in malnutrition risk score</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline (study onset) and post-intervention (end of study after 8 weeks of snack consumption)</time_frame>
    <description>A malnutrition risk score will be calculated using the Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF). Using the information collected by a registered dietitian during a nutrition-focused physical exam, the MNA-SF will be scored; the MNA-SF is a six-item, validated, and reliable screening tool for malnutrition risk.</description>
