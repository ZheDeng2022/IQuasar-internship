    <textblock>
      Neurogenic osteoporosis is a common complication of spinal cord injury (SCI) that is&#xD;
      associated with low impact bone fractures. It is concerning that more than 46,000 Veterans&#xD;
      affected with SCI and are at risk of osteoporosis and possible low impact fractures. About&#xD;
      fifty percent of all individuals with SCI will develop low impact fracture in their life&#xD;
      time. The management of osteoporosis-related fractures can impose substantial economic burden&#xD;
      on the health care system, the individual and the families. Previous studies did not succeed&#xD;
      in reversing the process of bone loss after SCI. In the present pilot study, we will evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation Resistance Training in combination with&#xD;
      oral Vitamin D supplementation, on bone quality in Veterans with chronic SCI, using a&#xD;
      randomized experimental design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurogenic osteoporosis is a devastating problem that is likely to impact 46,000 Veterans&#xD;
      with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). It is typically associated with low impact fractures&#xD;
      of long bones and other medical comorbidities. It is estimated that approximately fifty&#xD;
      percent of all individuals with SCI will develop low impact fracture during their lifetime.&#xD;
      The management of osteoporosis related fractures can impose substantial economic burden on&#xD;
      the health care system, individuals with SCI and their families. Advancement in medical&#xD;
      research clearly indicated that neurogenic osteoporosis is linked to reduced loading and&#xD;
      Vitamin D (Vit D) deficiency. Our pilot work indicated that a simple rehabilitation paradigm&#xD;
      targeting towards evoking skeletal muscle hypertrophy may attenuate deterioration in&#xD;
      trabecular bone parameters after SCI. Evoked resistance training (RT) using surface&#xD;
      neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has been shown as a successful and feasible&#xD;
      home-based approach to load skeletal muscles after SCI. Our earlier results may imply&#xD;
      long-term compliance and adherence if successfully applied in conjunction with a telehealth&#xD;
      approach. In the present study, we propose a simple home-based approach of using NMES RT in&#xD;
      conjunction with oral Vit D supplementation on trabecular bone quality in 20 Veterans with&#xD;
      chronic SCI. Data will include measurements of trabecular bone quality as determined by&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and bone biomarkers associated with the process of bone&#xD;
      remodeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty participants with chronic (&gt; 1-year post-injury) motor complete (AIS A and B) SCI (18&#xD;
      to 65 years of age) will be randomly assigned into either NMES RT plus 2000IU of Vit D (10&#xD;
      participants) or passive movement plus 2000IU Vit D (10 participants) to participate in a&#xD;
      repeated measure design trial for 9 months. The NMES RT plus Vit D will undergo 4.5 months of&#xD;
      open kinematic chain resistance training followed by 4.5 months of closed kinematic chain&#xD;
      using simple rowing approach. This pilot work will have two main specific aims. Aim 1. To&#xD;
      determine the impact of home-based NMES RT protocol plus oral Vit D supplementation compared&#xD;
      to passive movement plus oral Vit D on bone microarchitectural properties. Aim 2. To&#xD;
      determine the impact of home-based NMES RT protocol plus oral Vit D compared to passive&#xD;
      movement and Vit D supplementation on biomarkers of bone formation and bone resorption.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be included, participants will have to:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be 18-65 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have history of traumatic SCI ( 1-year) with NLI of C8-T10 and AIS A or B (confirmed&#xD;
             by AIS examination performed by PI or a qualified Provider&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a caregiver who is available and willing to be trained to apply intervention&#xD;
             protocol in the home (placing weights and positioning the Veteran) throughout study&#xD;
             duration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be a wheelchair user for primary mode of mobility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have Knee extensors that must respond to standard surface electrical stimulation&#xD;
             procedures (stimulation frequency procedures, 30 Hz; pulse duration:1 ms and amplitude&#xD;
             of the current of less than200 mA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be able to receive written clearance from their medical Providers to ensure safety of&#xD;
             participants&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be a Veteran (male or female), however, the Department of Veteran Affairs has limited&#xD;
             number of female Veterans, especially those with motor complete injury at level C8-T10&#xD;
             (currently, there are only 3 female Veterans with the target NLI in our SCI registry).&#xD;
             Hence, inclusion of women Veterans may be challenging due to this disparity in the SCI&#xD;
             population. If we fail to recruit 20 Veterans, we may seek an IRB approval to recruit&#xD;
             non-Veterans to meet our target sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have normal ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Commit to undergo 9 months of trial; 4.5 months of open-kinematic chain resistance&#xD;
             training followed by 4.5 months of closed-kinematic chain using simple rowing approach&#xD;
             + Vit. D supplementation (Experimental group) or 9 months of passive movement +Vit D&#xD;
             supplementation (control group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Potential participants will be excluded if they exhibit any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neurological injury other than SCI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Older than 65 years of age as they may likely have considerable amount of bone loss at&#xD;
             that age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have severe osteoporosis because loading porous/fragile bone by electrical stimulation&#xD;
             may result in bone fracture&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those classified as AIS C &amp; D, as they may already be engaging in weight bearing&#xD;
             activities that may confound the results of this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unhealed or unstable fractures in either lower or upper extremities&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe scoliosis, deformities in the hip, knee, or ankles OR impaired range-of-motion,&#xD;
             as these could be a barrier to safe positioning on the rowing machine, and on MRI or&#xD;
             DXA tables&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No caregiver or family member/significant other, willing to help with placing weights&#xD;
             and positioning participants' lower extremities on the rowing machine&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Anti-coagulation or anti-platelet therapy (including aspirin)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Implanted pacemakers, implanted defibrillator devices or any metallic implants&#xD;
             including knee or hip implants&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of bullets in vertebral column or shrapnel anywhere in the body that may&#xD;
             interfere with MRI procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other medical conditions including cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled type II DM,&#xD;
             active deep vein thrombosis (DVT), uncontrolled autonomic dysreflexia, use of insulin&#xD;

             scores of less than 0.6 g/cm2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Untreatable severe spasticity bearing on potential participants' activities of daily&#xD;
             living, such as transfers from bed to wheelchair or maintaining position in wheelchair&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any psychiatric illness confounding judgment or cognitive impairment in participant or&#xD;
             caregiver who is expected to help participant in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those with prosthetic lower limbs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that, in the judgment of the PI or other medical Providers, preclude&#xD;
             safe participation in the study and/or has the potential to expose/increase&#xD;
             participant's risk of infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to tolerate increasing either electrical stimulation current or weights to the&#xD;
             lower legs for any reason&#xD;
