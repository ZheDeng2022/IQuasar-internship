    <textblock>
      This study investigates the burden of intermittent catheterization in adult individuals with&#xD;
      neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) following spinal cord injury (SCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals will be recruited to compare two types of catheters. Each participant will use a&#xD;
      non-hydrophilic catheter at one time point and a hydrophilic catheter at a different time&#xD;
      point to perform intermittent catheterization. The order that participants use either a&#xD;
      non-hydrophilic or a hydrophilic catheter will be determined randomly. The purpose of the&#xD;
      study is to provide evidence for time spent on bladder management (performing intermittent&#xD;
      catheterization) as well as consumer satisfaction on using both catheters.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NLUTD and its management is of high priority for individuals living with SCI as it&#xD;
      significantly reduces quality of life and interferes with their daily life. Intermittent&#xD;
      catheterization in individuals with NLUTD following SCI is considered the preferred method of&#xD;
      bladder emptying, i.e. gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although intermittent catheterization offers reduced risk for urinary tract infection (UTI)&#xD;
      compared to other methods of bladder emptying, the burden of complications including UTI and&#xD;
      their management remains high. Another important aspect for individuals following SCI is&#xD;
      improving quality of life. Since bladder management is a time-consuming and demanding task,&#xD;
      reducing the time needed for intermittent catheterization and improving comfort during this&#xD;
      procedure, i.e. convenience and ease of handling could significantly benefit quality of life&#xD;
      for individuals living with SCI. Therefore, the investigators intend to compare hydrophilic&#xD;
      versus non-hydrophilic catheters; time needed to perform intermittent catheterization and the&#xD;
      convenience/ease of handling in this present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized controlled crossover trial investigating the burden of&#xD;
      intermittent catheterization in adult individuals with NLUTD following SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief outline of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 - Screening assessment to determine study eligibility. After providing informed&#xD;
      consent, individuals will be assigned a unique study number and the following information&#xD;
      will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion / exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history including concomitant medication and procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic information&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures will be conducted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Classification of SCI, i.e. neurological level and completeness using American Spinal&#xD;
           Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be randomized, i.e. either to start with the hydrophilic and&#xD;
           non-hydrophilic catheter second or vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 - Participants will perform intermittent catheterization to obtain a urine sample for&#xD;
      culture (women will be administered a pregnancy test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 - Assessment of time to perform intermittent catheterization using catheter A or B&#xD;
      (depending on randomization, e.g., starting with catheter A) followed by feedback on&#xD;
      convenience and ease of handling using a satisfaction survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4 - Assessment of time to perform intermittent catheterization using catheter A or B&#xD;
      (depending on randomization, e.g., now using catheter B) followed by feedback on convenience&#xD;
      and ease of handling using a satisfaction survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5 - Individuals will receive a phone call and be asked to provide information regarding&#xD;
      any changes in health and specifically bladder health.&#xD;
