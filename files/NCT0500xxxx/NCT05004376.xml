  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, we intend to conduct a randomized pilot trial of a structured behavioral&#xD;
      intervention, grounded in the Theory of Planned Behavior and Self-Determination Theory, to&#xD;
      promote adherence of patients aged 45 - 75 to USPSTF colorectal cancer screening&#xD;
      recommendations. We will also collect qualitative feedback on perceptions of the intervention&#xD;
      to inform its refinement.&#xD;

      The investigators propose a pilot randomized controlled trial with a prospectively collected&#xD;
      convenience sample of 130 ED patients non-adherent with CRC screening guidelines over a&#xD;
      3-month period. ED Research Associates (EDRAs) will use the EPIC eRecord system to screen&#xD;
      adult patients registered in the ED at URMC and Noyes Memorial Hospital (when an EDRA is&#xD;
      present in that ED) for eligibility. Inclusion criteria will include: 45-75 years and English&#xD;
      or Spanish speaking (costs for interpreting study surveys and patient interactions will be&#xD;
      paid for from PI discretionary research funds). Exclusion criteria will include personal&#xD;
      and/or family history of colorectal cancer, personal history of inflammatory bowel disease,&#xD;
      and a history of abdominal or pelvic radiation to treat a prior cancer. These exclusions were&#xD;
      chosen due to their impact on standard colorectal screening recommendations. After consent,&#xD;
      subjects will complete a ~10-minute questionnaire administered by the EDRA to determine&#xD;
      adherence to current USPSTF guidelines for colorectal cancer screening using validated items&#xD;
      in the CDC's National Health Interview Survey16. The enrollment process will categorize study&#xD;
      participants into three groups: adherent, uncertain, or non-adherent. Subjects found to be&#xD;
      adherent will be notified and their participation will conclude. Subjects found to be in the&#xD;
      uncertain or non-adherent groups will be randomized into the treatment or control condition.&#xD;
      Following intervention, subjects who were non-adherent will be referred to their usual care&#xD;
      provider to discuss options for becoming adherent. Subjects for whom adherence is uncertain&#xD;
      will be referred to their usual care provider to confirm their adherence status. Subjects who&#xD;
      find through their PCP that they are adherent will be treated as screen failures. Sensitivity&#xD;
      analyses will be performed to evaluate estimates of intervention efficacy with and without&#xD;
      inclusion of subjects initially determined uncertain and later categorized as non-adherent.&#xD;
      Following the initial enrollment, randomization, and recommendation to contact their PCPs,&#xD;
      subjects in the intervention condition will receive a series of 6 text messages, sent at&#xD;
      approximately 15 day intervals, presenting theory-based messages aimed at encouraging&#xD;
      colorectal cancer screening uptake. Subjects without a primary care provider will be given&#xD;
      information on how to establish a PCP in Rochester and on cancer screening services&#xD;
      subsidized through the Cancer Services Program (CSP) of the Finger Lakes Region (our current&#xD;
      R01 includes referrals to the CSP). All subjects in the non-adherent and uncertain groups&#xD;
      will receive a follow-up call at 150 days for a ~5-minute survey to determine if they&#xD;
      underwent or scheduled screening, if they learned that they did not require screening, and&#xD;
      what barriers they perceived in getting screened. Qualitative feedback regarding perceptions&#xD;
      of the intervention will also be collected in order to refine the intervention for future&#xD;
      study. Medical chart review will also be conducted to confirm patient self-reports, making&#xD;
      use of UR records and records from the Rochester Regional Health Information Organization&#xD;
      (RHIO; our current R01 has incorporated the RHIO).Completion of a &quot;second-level&quot; consent form&#xD;
      for use of the RHIO for chart review will be required for enrollment. In our cervical cancer&#xD;
      pilot study, we successfully contacted 68% of participants for follow-up, 11 of whom declined&#xD;
      to complete the follow-up interview. Based on lessons learned in our preliminary work, we&#xD;
      have developed several strategies (currently employed in our R01 study), in addition to the&#xD;
      incentive payment for study completion, which we will employ to maximize retention in this&#xD;
      study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Telephone numbers will be confirmed in the ED during enrollment by the EDRA performing&#xD;
           the enrollment by calling the patient's phone to be certain the number is correct.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Up to five calls will be made to each study participant during the follow-up window.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Each participant will be provided with study team contact information and asked to&#xD;
           notify us in the event that their phone number changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. In addition to their primary cell phone number, alternative contact information will be&#xD;
           sought from each participant to enable attempts at re-engagement, including: a.Secondary&#xD;
           telephone number of participant b.Email address(es) and mailing address.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The EHR will be accessed to check for changes in contact information&#xD;
