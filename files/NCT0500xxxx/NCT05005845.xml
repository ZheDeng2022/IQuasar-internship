  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel group dose response study&#xD;
      evaluating the safety and effectiveness of 2 concentrations of NFX-179 Gel in subjects with&#xD;
      cutaneous neurofibromas. At Visit 1, the investigator will identify 10 Target cNFs that&#xD;
      fulfil the enrollment criteria. The Target cNFs must be located on the subject's face,&#xD;
      anterior trunk, or upper extremities. Two Target cNFs must be on the face and 8 must be on&#xD;
      the anterior trunk or upper extremities. The study medication will be applied topically QD to&#xD;
      the Target cNFs for 182days (26 weeks). During the duration of the study subjects will be&#xD;
      evaluated for safety and efficacy.&#xD;

    <measure>Safety and effectiveness of once daily NFX-179 gel treatment for 182 days measured by local tolerability assessments, safety laboratory tests, and target cNF volume reduction</measure>
    <time_frame>182 days</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be measured by routine safety laboratory tests (CBC/differential, serum chemistry, urinalysis), and local tolerability assessment where the investigator will assess erythema, edema, scabbing/crusting, vesiculation, and erosion. The subject will assess stinging, burning, and pruritus. All assessments are performed using a 4-point scale (0 none, 1 mild, 2 moderate, 3 severe). Effectiveness will be measured by the percent of treated subjects with at least a 50% reduction in cNF volume after 6 months of treatment.</description>

    <description>Treatment effectiveness will be measured by the percent of treated subjects with at least a 50% reduction in cNF volume after 6 months of treatment. Tumor volume will be measured by ruler measurements and two-dimensional photography. All modes of tumor volume measurement are reported in cubic millimeters.</description>

    <measure>Physician's Tumor Assessment of Target cNF severity over 182 days</measure>
    <time_frame>182 days</time_frame>
    <description>Effect of treatment with The Physician Tumor Assessment is the investigator's assessment of the average overall severity of each Target cNF tumor at a particular time point. The Physician Tumor Assessment is a 5-point measuring tumor severity (0 clear/none, 1 almost clear, 2 mild, 3 moderate, 4 severe). This assessment is performed at Screening, Baseline/Day 1, Days 58, 183, and 211.</description>

    <measure>Subject's Self-Assessment of Target cNF severity over 182 days</measure>
    <time_frame>182 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Subject Self-Assessment is the subject's assessment of the average overall severity of each Target cNF at a particular time point and is not a comparison with any other time point. The Subject Self-Assessment is a 5-point measuring tumor severity (0 clear/none, 1 almost clear, 2 mild, 3 moderate, 4 severe). This assessment is performed at Screening, Baseline/Day 1, Days 58, 183, and 211.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Outcome Measure to assess Target cNF symptoms over 182 days</measure>
    <time_frame>182 days</time_frame>
    <description>This assessment is performed via the subject's assessment of their experience over the previous week with 9 items for each Target cNF (sensitivity, pain, itch, noticeability, size, appearance, care to avoid irritation, how much the cNF bothers the subject, self-consciousness). Each item is assessed by using a 5-point scale.</description>
