      This explorative post hoc analysis included patients randomized in the DEX-2-TKA trial&#xD;
      (NCT03506789) who were operated under general anesthesia with remifentanil and propofol.&#xD;
      Patients having general anesthesia with sevoflurane were excluded. As the two groups&#xD;
      receiving preoperative dexamethasone were identical at the time of outcome assessment, they&#xD;
      were merged to one and were compared with placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The DEX-2-TKA was a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial in&#xD;
      participants undergoing primary TKA conducted to investigate the effects of dexamethasone on&#xD;
      morphine consumption, levels of postoperative pain, and harm. The methodology has been&#xD;
      described in detail in the primary publication (ref), the protocol article and in the&#xD;
      statistical analysis plan. In short, the trial was conducted at one private and four public&#xD;
      Danish hospitals. Patients were randomized into one of three groups receiving either:&#xD;
      Dexamethasone + placebo, dexamethasone + dexamethasone or placebo + placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio.&#xD;
      The first dose of trial medication (intravenous dexamethasone 24 mg or placebo) was&#xD;
      administered immediately after onset of anesthesia. Twenty-four hours after end of surgery,&#xD;
      the second dose (dexamethasone 24 mg or placebo) was administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the two groups receiving preoperative dexamethasone were identical at the time of outcome&#xD;
      assessment for thi post-hoc analysis, they were merged to one and were compared with placebo&#xD;
      yielding a ratio of 2:1 between the groups recieving dexamethsone and the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients received either spinal anesthesia or general anesthesia (remifentanil and propofol&#xD;
      were preferred). Before end of surgery all patients received ondansetron iv 4 mg. For&#xD;
      patients in general anesthesia, sufentanil (0.3 μg/kg) was administered. All participants&#xD;
      were provided with a patient-controlled analgesia pump (morphine 1 mg/mL, bolus 2 mg,&#xD;
      lock-out 6 minutes, no background infusion) for 24 hours postoperatively. Additional boluses&#xD;
      of 2 mg morphine on participant request were allowed the first hour after cessation of&#xD;
      anesthesia. All participants received a protocolled non-opioid analgesic pain alleviation&#xD;
      regime comprised of oral paracetamol 1 g and ibuprofen 400 mg given 1 hour before and every 6&#xD;
      hours after surgery and the surgeon administered local infiltration analgesia&#xD;
      intraoperatively according to a standardized regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present explorative post hoc analysis included patients randomized in the DEX-2-TKA trial&#xD;
      who were operated under general anesthesia with remifentanil and propofol. Patients having&#xD;
      general anesthesia with sevoflurane were excluded.&#xD;
