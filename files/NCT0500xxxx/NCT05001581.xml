  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of massive rotator cuff tears (MRCT) is associated with high rates of failure. The&#xD;
      long head of the biceps tendon augmentation (LHBTA) by reinforcement of the reconstruction&#xD;
      and additional blood supply may improve healing and provide better outcome than partial&#xD;
      repair only.&#xD;

      Patients with irreparable supraspinatus muscle (SSP) tear, and complete infraspinatus muscle&#xD;
      (ISP) tear are including in the prospective, comparative study. Excluding criteria consist&#xD;
      of: problems or previous surgery of contralateral shoulder, subscapularis muscle tear larger&#xD;
      than stage 2 by Lafosse classification, uncontrolled diabetes and previous surgery. First&#xD;
      group consisting of patients treated by partial cuff repair with LHBTA. Second group is&#xD;
      comparative group consisting of patients treated by only partial cuff repair without LHBTA.&#xD;
      Group stratification depends on quality of the biceps tendon. In case of good tendon quality&#xD;
      - its used for biological augmentation, if it's degenerated- tenotomy of the tendon and only&#xD;
      partial repair is performing. Irreparability is defined as SSP â‰¥ 3 in Goutallier&#xD;
      classification and stage 3 in Patte classification what is preoperatively assessed by MRI.&#xD;
      Assessment tools consisting of range of motion (ROM), strength measurements in position&#xD;
      adequate to assess reconstructing tendons and muscles force, Acromio-humeral index (AHI),&#xD;
      Constant, SST, Hamada, and Sugaya scores. Goutallier classification for SSP and ISP and&#xD;
      diameter of the teres minor muscle (TMn). Radiological and clinical assessment is performing&#xD;
      one year after the surgery&#xD;
