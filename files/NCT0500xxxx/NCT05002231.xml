  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to assess the relative bioavailability and the effect of food on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of a new 15 mg tablet formulation of losmapimod&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1, open-label, 3-period, 6-sequence, randomized, single-dose, crossover&#xD;
      study designed to assess the relative bioavailability of a 15 mg tablet of losmapimod versus&#xD;
      two 7.5 mg tablets of losmapimod under fasted conditions and to assess the effect of food on&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics of a 15 mg tablet of losmapimod under fasted and fed conditions in 18&#xD;
      healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a screening period, 3 treatment periods with a single dose of study&#xD;
      drug per treatment period, a 48-hour washout period between dosing, and an end of study&#xD;
      visit. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive 1 of 6 treatment sequences (3 subjects&#xD;
      per treatment sequence) prior to dosing on Day 1 of Period 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is to assess the relative bioavailability and the effect of&#xD;
      food on the pharmacokinetics of a new 15 mg tablet formulation of losmapimod. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints include assessing the safety and tolerability and evaluating target engagement in&#xD;
      the blood of a new 15 mg tablet formulation of losmapimod in healthy subjects.&#xD;
