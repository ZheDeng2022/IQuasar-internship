  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective, single-tertiary centre observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population consists mainly of patients with instrumented posterolateral spine&#xD;
      fusion operated at the Department of Neurosurgery or at the Department of Orthopaedics and&#xD;
      Traumatology in the Turku University Hospital. Also, patients with non-instrumented&#xD;
      posterolateral spine fusion, interbody spine fusion, and a combination of posterolateral and&#xD;
      interbody spine fusion are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approximate number of the above-mentioned operations with BonAlive® putty is 400 - 500&#xD;
      between September 2013 and April 2021. In the operations, the BonAlive® putty was used either&#xD;
      alone, together with autologous bone (AB) chips, with milled allogenous bone chips, with&#xD;
      demineralized bone matrix (DBM), with other synthetic bone grafts, or with a combination of&#xD;
      the above-mentioned.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the first stage of the investigation, the clinical safety and efficacy of BonAlive® putty&#xD;
      are assessed in a retrospective case-series, and the observations are compared to the&#xD;
      existing literature. Thereafter, a retrospective case-controlled study will be created to&#xD;
      compare the use of a mixture of BonAlive® putty and AB to AB alone for clinical safety and&#xD;
      efficacy. The cases will be matched up with the controls by gender, age, smoking behavior,&#xD;
      the number of operated levels and the site of operated levels as far as possible. The chosen&#xD;
      surgical technique will be the most commonly used.&#xD;
