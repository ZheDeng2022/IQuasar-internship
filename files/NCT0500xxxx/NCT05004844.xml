  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bleeding control often poses a great challenge for clinicians due to trauma-induced blood&#xD;
      clotting disorder (TIC), a condition that is present in one-third of bleeding trauma&#xD;
      patients. As platelets are considered as central mediators in TIC, the understanding of&#xD;
      mitochondria-mediated processes in thrombocytes may disclose new therapeutic targets in the&#xD;
      management of severely injured patients. The investigators hypothesize that mitochondrial&#xD;
      dysfunction occurs in the platelets of trauma patients with TIC. The investigators intend to&#xD;
      quantitatively characterize the derangements of mitochondrial functions in TIC; and assess&#xD;
      the relation between mitochondrial respiration and clinical markers of platelet function&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Viscoelastic assays and aggregometry tests</intervention_name>
    <description>Viscoelastic assays and aggregometry tests performed with ROTEM will allow us to characterize the clot forming abilities and platelet functions of our patients. ROTEM is used routinely for aiding clinicians in choosing the appropriate blood products for patients ROTEM requires samples of whole blood in an amount that does not entail additional burden or risk for patients. In our study, viscoelastic assays and aggregometry will be performed upon arrival, and 24-,48-,72-hours post-admission.</description>
