  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this research is to evaluate the implementation of an online tele-coaching&#xD;
      community-based exercise (CBE) intervention with adults living with HIV.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will use the RE-AIM (Reach-Effectiveness-Adoption-Implementation-Maintenance)&#xD;
      Framework to evaluate the tele-coaching CBE intervention. The RE-AIM Framework includes&#xD;
      criteria to evaluate the impact and translation of an intervention at both individual and&#xD;
      organizational levels in order to promote uptake, transferability and ultimate enhance the&#xD;
      impact of health promotion interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific study objectives are: 1) To determine the extent (proportion of sessions attended,&#xD;
      frequency, intensity, time, type) to which adults living with HIV participate in the&#xD;
      intervention (Reach); 2) To assess the impact of the intervention on physical activity,&#xD;
      health, and engagement in the care cascade (Effectiveness); 3) To assess engagement in&#xD;
      exercise for adults living with HIV over time (physical activity, adherence) (Maintenance);&#xD;
      and 4) To evaluate the a) process (strengths, challenges, accessibility, cost, fidelity) and&#xD;
      b) feasibility of sustainability of the implementation, from the perspective of adults living&#xD;
      with HIV, representatives of community-based organizations (CBOs), health and fitness&#xD;
      centres, health providers, and policy stakeholders to build capacity, products, and&#xD;
      considerations for broader implementation (Implementation and Adoption).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will conduct a prospective longitudinal mixed methods intervention study to&#xD;
      evaluate the implementation of an innovative online tele-coaching CBE intervention with&#xD;
      adults living with HIV. They will use a combination of quantitative (self-reported&#xD;
      questionnaires, fitness assessments) to assess outcomes bimonthly during the tele-coaching&#xD;
      CBE intervention (6 months) and during a follow-up monitoring phase (6 months) to evaluate&#xD;
      the short and long term impact of online CBE. Investigators will use a qualitative&#xD;
      longitudinal design using interviews to assess processes and outcomes at baseline (0 months),&#xD;
      post-intervention (6 months) and post-follow-up (12 months).&#xD;

    <description>PHASE 1-Intervention Phase (6 months): Participants will engage in an individual tailored home-based exercise program involving aerobic, resistance, balance and flexibility training ~60min, 3 times per week for 24 weeks. Intervention will include: Component 1) biweekly 60 min personal online coaching with a certified trainer from the YMCA (13 sessions) who will monitor and progress exercise intensity; Component 2) weekly online group-based exercise classes ~60 min each led by a trainer at YMCA; Component 3) monthly online evidence-based self-management education sessions focused on topics related to self-management and health, and physical activity living with HIV; and Component 4) a wireless physical activity monitor (WPAM) to self-monitor steps, distance, calories burned, and active minutes.&#xD;
PHASE 2: Post-Intervention (6 months): Participants will be encouraged to continue with unsupervised home / outdoor-based exercise 3 times per week and to continue using their WPAM throughout.</description>
