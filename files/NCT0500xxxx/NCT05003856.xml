  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IV trial studies the effect of radiofrequency ablation in treating patients with&#xD;
      benign or low risk thyroid nodule. Radiofrequency ablation uses a needle to deliver a&#xD;
      high-frequency electric current to kill tumor cells by heating them. The goal of this&#xD;
      research study is to learn if ultrasound guided radiofrequency ablation can provide the same&#xD;
      treatment result as standard surgical removal of the thyroid nodule, small primary thyroid,&#xD;
      or thyroid cancers that have come back. Researchers also want to learn if the procedure can&#xD;
      be less invasive and perhaps provide a better recovery response than surgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the longitudinal thyroid nodule volume changes induced by radiofrequency ablation&#xD;
      (RFA) during post procedure follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate treatment response to compressive and/or cosmetic symptoms that affect patient's&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the sonographic features of the nodule induced by RFA. III. Compare cost of&#xD;
      ultrasound guided RFA to gold standard surgical thyroidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo ultrasound guided RFA over 1-2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;
