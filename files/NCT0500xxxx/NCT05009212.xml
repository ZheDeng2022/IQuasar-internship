  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stenosis is one of the most frequent complications in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). In&#xD;
      particular, CD patients with intestinal strictures are often faced with short bowel syndrome&#xD;
      after repeated or extensive surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic management shows good efficacy and safety in the treatment of strictures in CD&#xD;
      patients. The European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) guideline recommended that&#xD;
      endoscopic balloon dilatation is suitable to treat short [&lt;5 cm] strictures of the terminal&#xD;
      ileum in CD. Recently, Lan et al. reported that endoscopic stricturotomy appeared to be more&#xD;
      effective in treating CD patients with anastomotic stricture than endoscopic balloon&#xD;
      dilatation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is no prospective clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      endoscopic stricturotomy in the treatment of fibrostenotic Crohn's disease. The trial aims to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy and safety of endoscopic stricturotomy with endoscopic balloon dilation&#xD;
      in the treatment of small bowel stricture in patients with Crohn's Disease.&#xD;
