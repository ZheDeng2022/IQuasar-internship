  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With an ageing population, fragility fractures secondary to osteoporosis are on a increasing&#xD;
      trend. Proximal humerus fractures are common fractures which account for a significant&#xD;
      proportion of these fragility fractures. They significantly affect patients function and&#xD;
      independence particularly in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, treatment options range from conservative treatment with an arm sling to fixation&#xD;
      either with plates or intramedullary devices to arthroplasty ranging from a hemiarthroplasty&#xD;
      to the latest reverse shoulder arthroplasty. While is there has been a global trend towards&#xD;
      surgical treatment for such fractures, there is significant controversy regarding the best&#xD;
      treatment with many studies reporting disappointing functional outcomes including residual&#xD;
      shoulder pain, limitation in shoulder motion and decreased quality of life regardless of&#xD;
      treatment option selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this day and age where healthcare cost is a big concern both at the individual patient&#xD;
      level but at a government level as well, evaluating the cost effectiveness of treatment&#xD;
      becomes essential as well. Currently in Singapore, there have been a significant trend of an&#xD;
      increased use of surgical treatment of proximal humerus fractures however we have very little&#xD;
      data in our local context not only to evaluate the clinical effectiveness but also the cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of surgical treatment in comparison to conservative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To understand the epidemiology and prognostic factors for proximal humerus fractures&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Incidence&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Health service utilization&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  clinical and functional outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of surgical vs non-surgical treatment&#xD;
           pathways for managing patients with proximal humerus fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that surgical fixation of the proximal humerus is both clinically and cost&#xD;
      effective&#xD;

    <measure>Constant Shoulder Score - change over 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the clinical outcomes over time by comparing the change in constant shoulder score over a period of 1 year. The Constant Shoulder Score is used to assess the level of pain and the patient's ability to carry out normal daily activities.&#xD;
Constant score of the unaffected shoulder was also assessed at baseline to compare the function between the two shoulders.</description>

    <measure>Oxford Shoulder Score - change over 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A 12-item patient-report questionnaire developed to evaluate the outcome of shoulder surgery, excluding surgery for instability. The OSS contains two subscales, pain and activities of daily living. Each responses is of a 0-4 scoring format with a higher score representing better function. Hence, the highest possible total score is 48 and a higher score represents a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>QuickDASH scoring - change over 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This score is a subset of 11 items from the 30-item DASH and is a self-reported questionnaire in which the response options are presented as 5-point Likert scales. At least 10 of the 11 items must be completed for a score to be calculated and the scores range from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability).</description>

    <measure>EQ5D-5L - change over 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) consists of 2 dimensions, the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by selecting the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS will be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome.</description>
