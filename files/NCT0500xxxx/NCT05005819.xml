      The overall goal of this protocol is to evaluate [18F]APN-1607 as a PET radiotracer for&#xD;
      measuring longitudinal change in tau pathology in participants with PSP. The specific&#xD;
      objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize and demonstrate the longitudinal progression of tau deposition in vivo&#xD;
           in participants with PSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine optimal PET analysis parameters for [18F]APN-1607 quantification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the stability of tau deposition in vivo over time in healthy volunteers&#xD;
           (HVs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate consistency of [18F]APN-1607 quantification in characterizing tau&#xD;
           deposition.&#xD;
