  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A small pilot study comparing different blood thinners (non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants&#xD;
      [NOACs] and warfarin) will be conducted in people at risk for blood clots after open-heart&#xD;
      surgery. This study will help us design a much bigger study to test the effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety of different blood thinners in people after open-heart surgery. The study will test&#xD;
      the following hypotheses: (1) Our standardized use of different blood thinners is feasible in&#xD;
      patients early after cardiac surgery. (2) NOACs are safe to use early after cardiac surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing cardiac surgery (CVS) have various indications for anticoagulation, with&#xD;
      the most common being pre-existing atrial fibrillation (AF) or post-operative atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation (POAF). The incidence of POAF is up to 42% and both pre-existing AF and POAF&#xD;
      have been associated with 62% higher odds of stroke and 44% higher odds of mortality. Even&#xD;
      though non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have superseded warfarin as the choice&#xD;
      anticoagulant for non-valvular AF based on the results of landmark trials, these trials&#xD;
      generally excluded patients with recent CVS. Although recommendations on anticoagulation for&#xD;
      POAF are extrapolated from general AF guidelines, there is hesitancy to use NOACs early after&#xD;
      cardiac surgery due to concerns regarding hemorrhagic cardiac tamponade and the fast&#xD;
      anticoagulant onset of these agents with limited access to reversal agents. The investigators&#xD;
      recently conducted a systematic review of 7 studies evaluating NOACs in the post-CVS setting,&#xD;
      which identified insufficient evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of NOACs versus&#xD;
      warfarin. Despite there being 3 planned randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing NOACs to&#xD;
      warfarin early following cardiac surgery, none indicated a standardized bridging protocol,&#xD;
      which is a significant limitation, as anticoagulation trials lacking in standardized bridging&#xD;
      may significantly influence incidences of bleeding and embolic events. The investigators&#xD;
      propose a multi-centered pilot RCT of 100 patients comparing NOACs to warfarin initiated&#xD;
      early after cardiac surgery (ie. within the index hospitalization) to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility of conducting a large, definitive RCT. Patients with an indication for&#xD;
      anticoagulation (most common being pre-existing AF or POAF), will be randomized to receive a&#xD;
      NOAC (starting on post-operative day [POD] 5 or later) or warfarin (starting on POD 1 or at&#xD;
      time of diagnosis of indication for anticoagulation) and supported by a standardized bridging&#xD;
      protocol with unfractionated heparin infusion or low molecular weight heparin as early as POD&#xD;
      3 in patients with high-risk of thrombosis and low risk of bleeding. The co-primary&#xD;
      feasibility outcomes are (1) &gt;70% of eligible patients recruited into the study, and (2) &gt;80%&#xD;
      adherence to the anticoagulation protocol (defined as adherence to the bridging protocol and&#xD;
      the initiation of the study drug on the right POD). The primary scientific outcome is a&#xD;
      composite of death, stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding, or pericardial effusion&#xD;
      requiring intervention. Follow up will be conducted at 1 and 3 months and corroborated by&#xD;
      re-admission data. The results of this pilot RCT will inform the design and feasibility of a&#xD;
      large definitive RCT.&#xD;

    <description>NOAC Group (Intervention):&#xD;
Patients randomized to the NOAC group will receive a NOAC dosed according to the Canadian monograph for the respective indication. Patients receiving a NOAC before cardiac surgery will resume the same NOAC as pre-operatively, whereas patients not previously receiving a NOAC will preferentially receive apixaban according to local practice. The NOAC will be started no earlier than post-operative day 5 and based on the standard protocol depending on whether the patient has a pre-existing indication for anticoagulation or new indication (e.g. post-operative atrial fibrillation).&#xD;
Patients at high risk of thrombosis and low risk of bleeding will receive a standardized bridging protocol as early as post-operative day 3 with unfractionated heparin infusion or low molecular weight heparin until the NOAC is initiated.</description>

Patients randomized to the warfarin group will receive warfarin titrated to achieve a target International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.5 (range 2.0 to 3.0).
