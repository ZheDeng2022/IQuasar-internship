  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled and double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of FB825 in adult patients with moderate-to-severe allergic asthma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study comprises of a 4-week (±2 weeks) screening period, a 24-week treatment period and a&#xD;
      12-week follow-up period. Approximately 100 subjects who meet the criteria for study entry&#xD;
      are planned to be enrolled to the study. Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      placebo or FB825 in a 1:1 ratio with 50 subjects in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility will be checked in patients with allergic asthma during the 4-week (±2 weeks)&#xD;
      screening period. Potential candidates should provide signed informed consent forms before&#xD;
      starting any screening activities. The subjects will receive one dose of 8 mg/kg FB825 or&#xD;
      placebo, and five doses of 4 mg/kg FB825 or placebo every 4 weeks subsequently. The study&#xD;
      drug will be administered as a 1-hour IV infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may administer albuterol (or equivalents) as rescue medications as needed throughout&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to screening, patients must be on a stable dose of any of formulations of inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroids (ICS)/long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) combination therapy for at least 1&#xD;
      month, including Fluticasone/salmeterol, Budesonide/formoterol, or Mometasone/formoterol.&#xD;
      Patients who have been on budesonide/formoterol or mometasone/formoterol will be switched to&#xD;
      an equivalent dose of fluticasone/salmeterol at randomization (Day 1), and patients who have&#xD;
      been on fluticasone/salmeterol will remain on their current treatment as background therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICS/LABA (fluticasone/salmeterol) combination therapy during background therapy stable phase&#xD;
      (Day 1 to Day 28) followed by ICS only (fluticasone) during ICS tapering phase (Day 29 to Day&#xD;
      140), and than followed by the FB825 monotherapy phase (Day 141 to Day 168).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completing 24 weeks of treatment with the investigational product, patients will be&#xD;
      placed on their original dose of fluticasone/salmeterol combination therapy (dose at study&#xD;
      entry) and albuterol (or equivalents) (as needed) to control their symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occurrence of an exacerbation of asthma will be evaluated as the primary endpoint at week 24.&#xD;
      Mean change in morning PEF and the occurrence of an exacerbation of asthma at other time&#xD;
      points will also be evaluated as the secondary endpoint in the study. Exacerbation of asthma&#xD;
      as defined by any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 30% or greater reduction from baseline in morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) on 2&#xD;
           consecutive days, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ≥6 additional reliever puffs of albuterol (or equivalents)in a 24 hour period (compared&#xD;
           to baseline) on 2 consecutive days or,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deterioration of asthma, as determined by the investigator, requiring:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Systemic (oral and/or parenteral) steroid treatment, or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  An increase of ICS usage by ≥4 times of the protocol-defined dose (refer to 5.1.3&#xD;
                background therapy table) at each phase throughout the study period, or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hospitalization, or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ER (emergency room visit) due to asthma attack&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have site visits after receiving study drug for efficacy, safety, and biomarker&#xD;
      evaluation (see Study Flow Chart). Subjects who prematurely withdraw from the study will have&#xD;
      an end of study (EOS) visit within 7 days. The daily status of subject, such as peak flow,&#xD;
      will be recorded in the e-diary every day during the study. PI can ask the subject for an&#xD;
      unscheduled visit any time if any abnormal status reported on the e-diary. The e-diary system&#xD;
      will send a notification to the PI automatically once the subject meets the protocol defined&#xD;
      exacerbation of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relative change in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 , post-bronchodilator FEV1, and asthma symptoms&#xD;
      will be evaluated during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunologic biomarkers including changes from baseline in total IgE, allergen-specific IgE,&#xD;
      blood eosinophils, exhaled NO, mIgE B cell counts, Immunoglobulin G (IgG)2, Immunoglobulin G&#xD;
      (IgG)4, and cytokines such as serum thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC),&#xD;
      periostin and eotaxin-3, will be measured and evaluated. Adverse events will be checked and&#xD;
      recorded at every visit. Laboratory tests, vital signs and physical examinations will be&#xD;
      performed as scheduled and will also be used in safety evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum levels of FB825 for pharmacokinetic assessments will be measured via intensive and&#xD;
      sparse PK. For intensive PK, 24 subjects (12 subjects of each Arm) participate in the&#xD;
      intensive PK sub-study, serum samples will be collected at 0.5 hour pre-dose and at 0.5, 1,&#xD;
      1.25, 2, and 4 hours after the start of infusion on dosing days at Visits 2 and 9, and a&#xD;
      single collection at any time on Visit 3 and Visit 10. For sparse PK, all other subjects will&#xD;
      participate in the sparse pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments, serum samples will be collected&#xD;
      at 0.5 hour pre-dose and at 1.25 hour after the start of infusion at Visits 2 and 9. Serum&#xD;
      samples will be collected at 0.5 hour pre-dose and at 1.25 hour after the start of infusion&#xD;
      at Visits 5, 6, 7 and 8, and a single collection will be conducted at Visits 4 as well as at&#xD;
      follow-up Visits 11, 12, 13 and 14 for intensive and sparse PK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IgE (total IgE and allergen-specific IgE) will be analyzed and serum samples will be&#xD;
      collected at all visits during treatment and follow-up periods. IgG2, IgG4, and biomarkers&#xD;
      (e.g. TARC, eotaxin-3, and periostin), will be measured and collected at all Visits except&#xD;
      visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) analysis (assessing the mIgE B cell counts) will be&#xD;
      measured at Visits 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) will be assessed in samples before infusion at Visits 2, 7,&#xD;
      and 9, and at any time at Visits 11, 13 and 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For risk management of the sponsor, independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) meetings&#xD;
      will be conducted to evaluate participant safety data during the study. The DSMB will be&#xD;
      conducted in one month after the visit 2 of 10th, 30th, and 80th randomized patient.&#xD;
      Unscheduled meetings may be recommended and initiated by the DSMB Chairperson, the sponsor,&#xD;
      or the principal investigator.&#xD;

             factors and an eosinophil count more than twice the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. The subject has received live vaccine within 12 weeks prior to dosing or planned live&#xD;
             attenuated vaccinations during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. The subject has a history of any clinically relevant arrhythmias as determined by the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. The subject has a history of respiratory failure or near fatal asthma events which&#xD;
             resulted in intensive care unit admission or intubation within five years before the&#xD;
             screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. History of anaphylaxis to any biologic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. The subject has major surgery, for example organ replacement, joint replacement, full&#xD;
             hysterectomy, heart surgeries, within 8 weeks before the screening. The subject who&#xD;
             has major surgery prior to 8 weeks of screening should have fully recovered from any&#xD;
             surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. The subject has comorbid disease that might interfere with the evaluation of IMP&#xD;
             (investigational medicinal product) or conduct of study procedures (eg, bronchodilator&#xD;
             test).&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. The subject requiring non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor blockers for any reason&#xD;
             and initiation or dose change of a selective beta-1 adrenergic receptor blocker within&#xD;
             3 months prior to Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. The subject who received bronchial thermoplasty within 3 years of Visit 1 OR patients&#xD;
             who plan to begin therapy during the Screening Period or the Randomized Treatment&#xD;
             Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. The subject with active autoimmune disease (excluding atopic dermatitis) or patients&#xD;
             using immunosuppressive therapy for autoimmune disease (excluding atopic dermatitis)&#xD;
             (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, primary biliary cirrhosis,&#xD;
             systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, etc.) or patients with high titer&#xD;
             autoantibodies at screening who are suspected of having high risk for developing&#xD;
             autoimmune disease at the discretion of the Investigator or the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         28. Use of Traditional Chinese Medications in the treatment of asthma within 3 months&#xD;
             prior to screening. (To be listed in Prohibited Medications)&#xD;
&#xD;
         29. Aggravating factors that are inadequately controlled e.g., medication uncontrolled&#xD;
             gastroesophageal reflux disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         30. The subject has adrenal insufficiency (ACTH-resistant) by rapid ACTH stimulation test&#xD;
             due to known history of adrenal insufficiency or being suspected of adrenal&#xD;
             insufficiency or long-term use of systemic corticosteroids (annual average more than 6&#xD;
             months in the past two years).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adrenal insufficiency: after 30 minutes of ACTH injection, the cortisol level ≦20 mg/ml in&#xD;
        rapid ACTH stimulation test.&#xD;
