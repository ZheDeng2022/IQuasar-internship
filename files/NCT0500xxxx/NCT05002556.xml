      The AFU has set itself the task of setting up a register of medical practices in order to&#xD;
      define possible improvements in the therapeutic management and follow-up of NMIBC. In order&#xD;
      to obtain representative data, all urologists who are members of the AFU may be invited to&#xD;
      include their patients in accordance with the rules of clinical research.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-muscle infiltrating bladder tumors are a cancerous pathology with an estimated incidence&#xD;
      of 13,000 new cases/year in France. Â¾ of new cases are diagnosed at a stage where the cancer&#xD;
      is of limited extension to the urothelial mucosa and/or its underlying chorion&#xD;
      (non-muscle-infiltrating bladder tumors, NIMBT). The management and follow-up of NMITVs are&#xD;
      performed according to the best practice recommendations issued by the Cancer Committee of&#xD;
      the French Urology Association. The risk of recurrence at 1 and 5 years for NMITT has been&#xD;
      estimated in clinical trials to be between 15%-61% and 31%-78%, respectively, depending on&#xD;
      grade, stage, number, size, frequency of previous recurrence and presence of carcinoma in&#xD;
      situ. In this context, patients should have regular endoscopic examinations to ensure the&#xD;
      absence of tumor lesions inside their bladder. Urine cytology pathology is recommended for&#xD;
      the detection of recurrence of NMITV. However, the negative predictive value of this&#xD;
      examination does not allow it to be substituted for bladder endoscopy, as the risk of not&#xD;
      recognizing a bladder tumor, especially of low grade, is too high. To date, no urinary&#xD;
      biomarker has been shown to be clinically useful and their use is not recommended for the&#xD;
      non-invasive detection of endovesical tumor recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine sampling is recommended prior to bladder endoscopy for follow-up of NMITV to ensure&#xD;
      urine sterility (UDEC) and to perform urine cytology in patients with high-grade NMITV and/or&#xD;
      carcinoma in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observational study of the clinical validity of the negative and positive predictive&#xD;
      values of the biomarkers in a population of patients followed for a bladder tumor previously&#xD;
      characterized is able to demonstrate the possibility of postponing the realization of the&#xD;
      fibroscopy according to the tumoral characteristics and the treatments received by the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the research will be to evaluate the diagnostic performance of&#xD;
      biomarkers available in France, performed on a urine sample and providing a binary result&#xD;
      (positive: probable presence of a tumor recurrence; negative: probable absence of a tumor&#xD;
      recurrence) to the result of the bladder endoscopy performed as part of the routine care for&#xD;
      the follow-up of NMVT: determination of the negative and positive predictive values of&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives will be to describe the anatomopathological characteristics, the&#xD;
      pathological history and the treatments received in the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHOD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each examination, the participating patients will produce a urine sample of&#xD;
      approximately 20 to 40 ml in total dedicated to the determination of the marker proposed by&#xD;
      your urologist, made by medical analysis laboratory. At each follow-up endoscopic examination&#xD;
      scheduled in the patient's personalized care plan, the investigating urologist will record&#xD;
      its date and endoscopic findings (white light bladder fibroscopy). The name and result of the&#xD;
      urine test will also be recorded by the investigating urologist. The performance of the test&#xD;
      will be evaluated from these data by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive&#xD;
      predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) and by means of an analysis of&#xD;
      variance (ANOVA) to explore possible differences within the test by tumor grade and stage,&#xD;
      and according to previous endovesical treatments received The inclusion target is 2000&#xD;
      patients in France over a 3-year period.&#xD;
