  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-specific chronic neck pain (NCNP) is commonly seen in office workers. Individuals with&#xD;
      NCNP not only demonstrate impaired neck movement control and muscle activation, but also show&#xD;
      abnormal scapular kinematics and muscle activation timing. Office workers with NCNP also show&#xD;
      higher activity of upper trapezius during computer typing and have difficulty relaxing upper&#xD;
      trapezius after typing. These changes related to scapula may increase strain over neck. In&#xD;
      addition to the altered neuromuscular control, recent studies found neuroplasticity changes&#xD;
      in the central nervous system on patients of chronic musculoskeletal disorders. Therefore,&#xD;
      few studies found shifts and alterations of motor cortex representation of neck muscles in&#xD;
      individuals with NCNP, which was correlated with delayed muscle activation of deep neck&#xD;
      flexors muscle in functional activities. However, no studies have explored that whether this&#xD;
      corticospinal adaptation also happens over scapular muscles, especially after a computer&#xD;
      typing task. The objectives of this proposal are to investigate the differences in&#xD;
      corticospinal and neuromuscular control of shoulder complex between office workers with and&#xD;
      without NCNP. Thirty-five individuals with NCNP and 35 healthy controls will be recruited.&#xD;
      Twenty young healthy subjects will be also recruited for a pilot study to test the&#xD;
      reliability of all the measures. Scapular kinematics and muscle activation will be tested&#xD;
      during arm elevation. Corticospinal parameters of trapezius and serratus anterior will be&#xD;
      tested with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), including active motor threshold, motor&#xD;
      evoked potential, cortical silent period, short interval intracortical facilitation, short&#xD;
      interval intracortical inhibition and cortical mapping. Corticospinal parameters, except&#xD;
      cortical mapping, will be measured again after a 30-minute computer typing task. Scapular&#xD;
      muscle activation will be also recorded during the typing task.&#xD;
