      This is an open-label, single-arm, phase 2a trial with a safety run-in cohort followed by a&#xD;
      Simon two-step design expansion cohort, of two checkpoint blockage treatments and&#xD;
      radiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have failed&#xD;
      first-line immunotherapy (alone or as a combination regimen with chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the safety run-in phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate safety of the triple combination of irradiation -Durvalumab - Tremelimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-Primary objectives of the entire study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate safety of the triple combination (as for the run-in phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate response rate on study drug compared to historical data of response to&#xD;
           first-line platinum-doublet chemotherapy and 2nd-line docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate PFS and OS compared to historical data .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the mechanism of resistance to first-line immunotherapy .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the immune response in irradiation -Durvalumab - Tremelimumab treated patients&#xD;
           and identify potential predictors of clinical benefit.&#xD;

      A cycle is defined as 28 days. Eligible patients who have a radiologically confirmed&#xD;
      progressive disease on first line Immunotherapy treatment will receive an intravenous&#xD;
      injection of 300 mg Tremelimumab at D1 and 12 weeks later a second dose of 300 mg&#xD;
      tremelimumab, and an intravenous injections of 1500 mg Durvalumab q4w (starting from D1) .&#xD;
      Treatment duration is until objective radiological disease progression as per RECIST 1.1&#xD;
      assessed by the local radiologist, and as long as the patients are benefiting from treatment&#xD;
      according to the investigator's opinion and they do not meet any other discontinuation&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      21 days after the first immunotherapy treatment, a radiotherapy course of 11 fractions of 3&#xD;
      Gy (total of 33 Gy) will be administrated to metastatic or primary lesion/s over two weeks&#xD;
      and one day. The second durvalumab treatment will be administered at the beginning of the 2nd&#xD;
      week of radiotherapy, one week after radiotherapy start day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following patients consent, a fresh biopsy specimen will be obtained (if not previously&#xD;
      obtained after PD) for correlative studies, preferably from site of disease progression on&#xD;
      first line immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, tissue samples will be obtained from both existing archived biopsy (diagnostic&#xD;
      specimen), if available. An optional newly biopsied tissue sample will be taken 20 weeks&#xD;
      after initiation of study treatment and at the time of progression on study treatment. Biopsy&#xD;
      at PD is mandatory if can be performed with no significant risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and microbiome samples for correlative studies will be taken at predefined intervals,&#xD;
      to explore predictive biomarkers for clinical efficacy, determine pharmacodynamic effects on&#xD;
      immune cells, determine immune response signatures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor imaging should be acquired by CT and include the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with and&#xD;
      without IV contrast and with oral contrast. CT should be performed at baseline and every 8&#xD;
      weeks until objective radiological disease progression assessed as per RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have discontinued treatment should be seen at end of treatment and 28 days post&#xD;
      discontinuation for the evaluations outlined in the study schedule. Patients will be&#xD;
      contacted every 90 days following discontinuation visit to capture survival status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient who discontinues study treatment for reasons other than objective radiological&#xD;
      progression should continue to undergo scheduled objective tumor assessments according to the&#xD;
      study schedule in order to assess objective radiological progression of disease.&#xD;
