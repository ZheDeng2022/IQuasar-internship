  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-significant risk, multi-center, randomized, active-controlled study to compare&#xD;
      the effectiveness of three digital therapies in the management of fibromyalgia over 12 weeks.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is mean change from baseline to Week 12 in the weekly revised&#xD;
      Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ-R) total score.&#xD;
