  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will add to the current knowledge by combining several electrophysiological&#xD;
      techniques to examine the relationship between physiological responses and cognitive fatigue&#xD;
      and daily activity performance in a stress- and fatigue-inducing protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are: 1) to evaluate the feasibility and usability of assessing&#xD;
      physiological responses in an experimental set-up and 2) to investigate the association&#xD;
      between physiological outcomes, experimentally induced stress and cognitive fatigue in people&#xD;
      with multiple sclerosis (MS) and healthy controls.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In an experimental set-up participants (20 people with MS and 20 healthy controls) will&#xD;
      perform a high-challenging cognitive protocol to provoke stress and (cognitive) fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological responses (heart rate variability, skin conductance, body temperature) and&#xD;
      brain activity (EEG) will be measured while resting (resting baseline), while speaking as&#xD;
      normal (speaking baseline), during protocol performance and following the protocol&#xD;
      (post-protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as levels of perceived fatigue, stress,&#xD;
      pain, daily activity performance, quality of life and anxiety and depression will be assessed&#xD;
      using medical records and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility and usability will be assessed in participants and researcher(s) by standardized&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;

    <description>The NASA-TLX is a self-report questionnaire that measures perceived work-related stress using six dimensions with a focus on mental stress: mental, physical and time-related stress, frustration and execution. The dimensions are assessed on the basis of a semantic differential scale (0-10). The six individual scores are converted to a global score by means of a &quot;paired comparison task&quot; in which &quot;comparison cards&quot; are used prior to the assessment.&#xD;

    <measure>Decline in Symbol Digit Modalities Test</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately post protocol (approx. 2 hours after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) Performance&#xD;
The SDMT is frequently used in the normal treatment and follow up of people with MS. Therefore, a customized version for this study is developed.&#xD;
Participants are shown one file with at the top a row as example consisting of symbols with related numbers. Beneath this row, a couple of rows with symbols are shown. The participant has to link the number to the specific symbol according to the example row. This as fast as possible within 90 seconds.&#xD;
Scores&#xD;
A total score consisting of the total amount of correct answers will be determined.&#xD;
The SDMT will be divided in three equal parts of 30 seconds.&#xD;
For part1 part2, and part3 a correct score will be determined.&#xD;
Additionally, a cognitive fatigability score is determined: the difference between part3 versus part1.</description>

    <measure>Decline in N-Back Task</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately post protocol (approx. 2 hours after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The N-Back Task (NBT)&#xD;
Performance:&#xD;
The participants are shown a presentation of a series of letters. The participants have to respond with 'yes' whenever the same letter appeared as two letters previously.&#xD;
The participants perform two versions of this: with a 2- and 1-second interstimulus interval.&#xD;
Scores:&#xD;
A total score consisting of the total amount of correct answers is determined.&#xD;
The NBT is then divided in three equal parts. For part1, part2, and part3, a total correct score is determined.&#xD;
Additionally, a cognitive fatigability score (i.e. difference between part3 and part1) is determined.</description>

    <measure>Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The MFIS is a self-report questionnaire used to measure the perceived impact of fatigue on physical, cognitive and psychosocial functioning. The participant answers 21 items on the basis of a 5-point Likert scale (0 = never; 5 = almost always). A higher score on the subscales (physical dimension: 0-36; cognitive dimension: 0-40; psychosocial functioning: 0-8) or in the total score represents a higher degree of fatigue.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire on perceived stress in daily life (14 items) The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a self-report questionnaire to measure the perceived stress. In 14 items perceived stress is judged by taking into account the previous month's experiences.. Scoring is done using a 5-point Likert scale (0 = never; 4 = very often), with a maximum score (56) representing a higher degree of perceived stress.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report questionnaire of depression and anxiety (14 items) The HADS is aimed at assessing anxiety and depression in a non-psychiatric setting, without questioning physical complaints such as fatigue.The HADS is a self-report questionnaire of 14 items that are answered on the basis of an ordinal scale with four answer options (0-3). Depression and anxiety subscale scores range from 0-21, with higher scores indicating increased depression or anxiety, respectively.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Life Balance Inventory (LBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>LBI is a self-report assessment instrument containing 53 activities and on a dichotomous scale of yes/no, people have to answer, whether or not they do the activity or want to do the activity. For each item scored 'yes', participants have to rate their satisfaction with the amount of time they have spent doing that activity in the past month compared to the amount of time they wanted to do the activity. The possible answers are: &quot;always less than I want (1), sometimes less than I want (2), about right for me (3), sometimes more than I want (2), always more than I want (1)&quot;.&#xD;
The LBI contains four subscales: (1) Health subscale (ex. Relaxing, getting regular exercise, …), (2) Relationship subscale (ex. Doing things with friends, partner, …), (3) Identity subscale (ex. Taking care of your appearance, participating in religious events, …), (4) Challenge/interest subscale (ex. Working for pay, making music, …).&#xD;
Higher scores reflect better life balance.</description>

    <description>Baseline measurement is done in two parts: 1) resting for five minutes (no talking, no movement) and 2) speaking at normal pace (2 minutes).&#xD;
This is immediately followed by a measurement of the physiological response variables during the testing, in which the following protocol is performed in the order presented: 1) SDMT-NBack task-SDMT*-NBacktask**, 2) NBack task-SDMT-NBack task-SDMT. Participants will run either sequence to check for effects of the previous testing. During the conduct of the study, it will be ensured that half of the participants in each group followed Sequence 1 and the other half of the group followed Sequence 2.&#xD;
During all these measurements, the participant will sit at a table with a computer on which the tests are performed.&#xD;
