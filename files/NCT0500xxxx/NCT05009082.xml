  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, multicenter, randomized, open, Phase III trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of carboplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab and&#xD;
      niraparib compared to carboplatin/paclitaxel followed by niraparib in patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be those patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed,&#xD;
      advanced (FIGO stage III/IV, except FIGO stage IIIA2 without nodal involvement) invasive high&#xD;
      grade epithelial ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer, who have either&#xD;
      undergone upfront primary surgery or plan to undergo chemotherapy with interval debulking&#xD;
      surgery (IDS). In addition, patients should not have any medical contraindications that would&#xD;
      exclude treatment with bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients will receive the first cycle of chemotherapy (carboplatin area under&#xD;
      curve [AUC] 5 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m²) as part of Study Run-In-Period (cycle 1). In&#xD;
      parallel, central laboratory will determine the breast cancer (BRCA) status in tumor tissue&#xD;
      (tBRCA). All patients with a valid central tBRCA test result will be randomized prior to day&#xD;
      1 of cycle 2 in a 1:1 ratio in the following treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: Patients will receive further 5 cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel q21d followed by&#xD;
      niraparib once daily for up to a total of 3 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: Patients will receive further 5 cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel plus bevacizumab&#xD;
      q21d followed by bevacizumab q21d (for up to 1 year) and niraparib once daily for up to a&#xD;
      total of 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to investigate, if the treatment strategy of carboplatin / paclitaxel /&#xD;
      bevacizumab / niraparib is superior to the treatment of carboplatin / paclitaxel /&#xD;
      niraparib-Inhibitor in an all-comer population.&#xD;
