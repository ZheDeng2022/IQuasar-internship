  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Symptoms of anxiety are prevalent during the menopausal transition and early postmenopause.&#xD;
      These symptoms are mainly improved by anti-anxiety agents, which are associated with some&#xD;
      adverse effects including dizziness, sleepiness, and constipation and not all patients&#xD;
      respond to currently available pharmacological treatments, thus novel agents with fewer side&#xD;
      effects are needed. Some studies have shown that traditional Chinese medicine can alleviate&#xD;
      menopausal symptoms safely and economically, and improve quality of life. Xiangshao granules&#xD;
      reportedly have good curative effects on menopausal symptoms and premenstrual syndrome and&#xD;
      exhibit good safety. This study aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Xiangshao granule&#xD;
      in improving anxiety state of women with menopause syndrome.&#xD;
