  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the difference of breast milk microbiota between mothers&#xD;
      with and without vaginal infections during pregnancy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The maternal microbiota is one of the relevant factors in the development of the infant's&#xD;
      immune system, whereby the colonization of microbes in human begins at birth, when the&#xD;
      newborn baby is exposed to maternal vaginal, gastrointestinal microbiota and as well as the&#xD;
      microbes from the external environment. The neonatal intestine is colonized by symbiotic&#xD;
      bacteria can be divided into four main steps; (i) acquisition of maternal vaginal, colonic,&#xD;
      and skin flora at birth; (ii) introduction of oral feedings (breastfeeding or formula&#xD;
      feeding); (iii) weaning; and (iv) acquisition of complete adult colonization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breastfeeding is associated with the protection of the infants from either infections or&#xD;
      infection-related conditions, such as gastroenteritis, upper and lower respiratory tract&#xD;
      infection, acute otitis media, urinary tract infection, neonatal septicaemia and necrotizing&#xD;
      enterocoltis. The protection is through the combination of action of the breast milk&#xD;
      components, such as maternal immunoglobulins, immunocompetent cells, or variety of&#xD;
      anti-microbial compounds. Besides that, breast milk also contains prebiotic substances which&#xD;
      may selectively stimulate the growth of limited number of beneficial bacteria in the gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total number of 100 lactating mothers are needed for this study. Subjects will be recruited&#xD;
      from HUSM Kubang Kerian, USM Main Campus Penang, and Institut Perubatan &amp; Pergigian Termaju&#xD;
      USM Penang. The subjects will be explained on all related information in the consent form&#xD;
      prior to signing. The procedure of collecting sample is hands must be washed before milk&#xD;
      expression, and nipples are cleaned with sterile water and alcohol swab. 15mL of fresh breast&#xD;
      milk will be collected into a tube and stored at -20℃ until further analyses.&#xD;
