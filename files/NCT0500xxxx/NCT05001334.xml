  <brief_summary>

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of kangaroo care on physiological weight loss&#xD;
      in term newborns.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The data collection process continues in a randomized controlled experimental study conducted&#xD;
      to determine the effect of kangaroo care on physiological weight loss in term newborns. In&#xD;
      the calculation made for the determined effect size, 80% power, 5% margin of error and&#xD;
      one-way statistical significance, the experimental group was planned as 51 and the control&#xD;
      group as 51 newborns. In this reporting period, 25 newborns as the experimental group and 30&#xD;
      newborns as the control group were followed up and interviewed with the mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers who meet the criteria to participate in the research are informed about the research&#xD;
      in the delivery room or in the first hours of delivery. The mothers of the experimental group&#xD;
      who accept to participate in the research are given training on how to make kangaroo care and&#xD;
      what to pay attention to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breastfeeding of the mother, the number and frequency of bottle feeding, kangaroo care,&#xD;
      diuresis, defecation numbers and weight are recorded by following up. Physiological weight&#xD;
      losses are determined by comparing birth weight with daily weight losses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cotton kangaroo care blanket is given to every mother who agrees to participate in the&#xD;
      study, so that mothers can care for their kangaroos comfortably and to continue kangaroo care&#xD;
      at home. These covers, prepared for kangaroo care, increase the motivation of mothers to&#xD;
      participate in the study. In order to facilitate the follow-up of diuresis and defecation&#xD;
      numbers, the family is supported in the evaluation of diapers (number, weight).&#xD;

    <description>Physiological weight loss of term newborns whose mothers are trained about and perform kangaroo care, is theorised to be less than those who receive standard newborn care information. Periodical weight measurements will be recorded. To evaluate feeding efficiency, number of feedings and kangaroo care periods, changed diaper numbers will be evaluated.</description>
