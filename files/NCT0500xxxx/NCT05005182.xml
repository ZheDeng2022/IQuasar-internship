    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effects of luspatercept with or without hydroxyurea in&#xD;
      treating patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms with ring sideroblasts&#xD;
      and thrombocytosis or unclassifiable with ring sideroblasts. Biological therapies, such as&#xD;
      luspatercept, use substances made from living organisms that may stimulate or suppress the&#xD;
      immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Hydroxyurea may stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving&#xD;
      luspatercept with or without hydroxyurea may help doctors determine what doses of the&#xD;
      combination is safe for patients to take and how the disease responds to the treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To document the erythroid response rate assessed as per the 2015 International Working&#xD;
      Group (IWG) myelodysplastic (MDS)/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) response criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To document response duration, time to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation,&#xD;
      AML-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with MDS/MPN-with ring&#xD;
      sideroblasts (RS) and thrombocytosis (T) and MDS/MPN-unclassifiable (U)U with RS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To document safety of luspatercept (luspatercept-aamt) in patients with MDS/MPN-RS-T and&#xD;
      MDS/MPN-U with RS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I: To find an effective biomarker of response to luspatercept-aamt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT A: Patients receive luspatercept subcutaneously (SC) on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21&#xD;
      days for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT B: Patients receive luspatercept SC on day 1 and hydroxyurea orally (PO) on days 1-21.&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 21 days for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;
