  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label clinical study to evaluate the safety and antitumor&#xD;
      activity of FCN-437c in combination with Fulvestrant for the treatment of post-menopausal&#xD;
      female patients with ER+ and HER2- advanced breast cancer, FCN-437c in combination with&#xD;
      Letrozole + Goserelin for the treatment of pre-menopausal female patients with ER+ and HER2-&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer, and to evaluate the PK characteristics of the FCN-437c combination&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is consist of two cohorts, Cohort 1: FCN-437c in combination with Fulvestrant (1st&#xD;
      or 2nd line treatment for postmenopausal ER+, HER2-advanced breast cancer); Cohort 2:&#xD;
      FCN-437c in combination with Letrozole + Goserelin (1st line treatment for premenopausal ER+,&#xD;
      HER2- advanced breast cancer). Thirty patients will be enrolled in each cohort, for a total&#xD;
      of 60 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor evaluation will be performed every 8 weeks (Â±7 days) according to RECIST version 1.1&#xD;
      until disease progression, withdrawal of informed consent, or death; for patients who&#xD;
      discontinue the drug due to toxicity, imaging evaluation is required until disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Treatment and End of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study (EOS) is defined as 2 years after the last patient's first dose or the end of&#xD;
      treatment (whichever is earlier). At the end of the study, the investigator will decide&#xD;
      whether the patients whose disease has not progressed shall continue taking FCN-437c and&#xD;
      other combination agents or not based on clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: Post-menopausal patients diagnosed with ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer, who have&#xD;
      not received prior systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer, or who have disease&#xD;
      progression determined by imaging assessment during their 1st line endocrine therapy; Cohort&#xD;
      2: Pre-menopausal patients diagnosed with ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer, who have not&#xD;
      received prior systemic therapy for advanced breast cancer;&#xD;
