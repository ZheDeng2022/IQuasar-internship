  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The length of prophylactic antibiotic use with antibiotic impregnated External Ventricular&#xD;
      Drains (EVD)s is unknown. This study is a randomized clinical trial with two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. twenty four hours of prophylactic antibiotic use or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. prophylactic antibiotic use for entire duration of EVD&#xD;

      The principle objective of this study is to compare the incidence of ventriculostomy related&#xD;
      infections (VRIs) in patients who receive twenty-four hours of antibiotics, beginning no more&#xD;
      than sixty minutes prior to EVD placement, to the incidence of VRIs in patients who also&#xD;
      receive a pre-procedural dose of antibiotics with continued dosing of antibiotics for the&#xD;
      duration of the external ventricular drain (EVD).&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients over the age of 18 years and patients diagnosed with a subarachnoid&#xD;
             hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage or acute ischemic stroke who require an EVD for&#xD;
             management of their underlying condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In certain cases (a small minority), an EVD must be replaced due to failure (i.e.;&#xD;
             blood clot interrupting flow). In such cases, patients will be re-dosed with&#xD;
             antibiotics prior to catheter exchange in typical fashion, and continue in their&#xD;
             previously randomized treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients who underwent any intracranial procedure in the 30 days prior,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients who were on antibiotics within the week prior to admission,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with leukopenia (&lt;5000) at baseline,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with signs of meningitis, ventriculitis or any other infection at&#xD;
             presentation,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients who are pregnant or prisoners.&#xD;
