  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal anastomotic leaks (AL) are associated with high morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Management of AL and its intra-operative decision making is often difficult. The aim of this&#xD;
      multi-centre study is to explore different management strategies, including different&#xD;
      surgical options, and analyse rates and patterns of failure of initial management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consecutive patients who had a confirmed AL after elective colorectal resections from 1st&#xD;
      January 2014 to 31st December 2019 were included at seven hospitals across the East of&#xD;
      England Region. Morbidity (length of stay, and failures) and mortality were compared across&#xD;
      the different management strategies, and survival analyses were performed.&#xD;

      The International Study Group of Rectal Cancer proposed a grading system for the management&#xD;
      of colorectal anastomotic leaks (Rahbari et al., 2010). Grade A anastomotic leaks are&#xD;
      identified by radiographic findings of a perianastomotic fluid collection, leakage of&#xD;
      contrast through the anastomosis, or observation of new drainage of enteric contents through&#xD;
      either a drain or through a fistula but without accompanying clinical complaints. These may&#xD;
      be managed expectantly. These may become apparent during the preoperative work-up prior to&#xD;
      closure of a diverting ostomy and will at least delay reversal. Grade B leakage requires&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention but does not necessarily require reoperation. Antibiotics and&#xD;
      percutaneous drainage of fluid collections are the most common nonoperative interventions.&#xD;
      Grade C anastomotic leakage requires relaparotomy. Surgical treatment is performed with the&#xD;
      goal of controlling life-threatening sepsis. The traditional operation with takedown of the&#xD;
      anastomosis and end colostomy may be appropriate, but washout with drain placement and&#xD;
      diverting loop ileostomy may also be appropriate. 1 Elective colorectal resection surgeries&#xD;
      have an over 30-day mortality rate of 5.8%. While emergency resections have a 7.8% mortality&#xD;
      (Morris, 2011). Experiencing an anastomotic leaks should not have a higher mortality than the&#xD;
      above rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The main interest of this study is to firstly assess our practice and management of AL,&#xD;
      evaluate whether hospitals in the region are identifying AL as per The International Study&#xD;
      Group of Rectal Cancer, grading the AL as Grade A, B, and C above, and analyse the natural&#xD;
      evolution of leaks and their subsequent treatment(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes of Interest&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of anastomotic leaks and associated outcome in terms of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 2-year mortality after anastomotic leaks of different grades.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Standards of reference for audit:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Elective colorectal resection surgeries have an over 30-day mortality rate of 5.8%.&#xD;
           While emergency resections have a 7.8% mortality (Morris, 2011). Experiencing an&#xD;
           anastomotic leaks should not have a higher mortality than the above rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Outcomes of different treatment strategies of Colorectal anastomotic leaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Grading of AL as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need for subsequent management strategies after failure of initial strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion requiring laparotomy, bowel resection, defunctioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of ITU stay, overall length of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-surgical complications (pneumonia, urine infection, DVT, PE, MI etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Delay / change in oncological management Methods Data will be collected retrospectively&#xD;
           going back to 2014 (five years), at multiple East of England sites. The study will&#xD;
           initially commence across trusts in the East of England Deanery however efforts will be&#xD;
           made to recruit other research collaboratives through existing and established ties with&#xD;
           the National Research Collaborative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population Identification&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients can be identified and recruited to the study through a variety of ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multi-Disciplinary Teams (MDTs): Most MDTs will record data as to who has had a leak and&#xD;
           what treatment they have had or are to have&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colorectal Clinical Nurse Specialists (CNS): In most trusts, the CNS keep records of&#xD;
           patients who have had complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  National Bowel Cancer Audit (NBOCAP): Although this will not capture patients who have&#xD;
           had benign disease, it will provide data on patients with cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consultants: Many consultants collect their own data, and this can be an excellent&#xD;
           source of information An estimated of 10-30 leaks occur every year at each site. We&#xD;
           expect to have between 30-60 leaks with 3 year follow up per hospital site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration Data collection 3-6 months from date of project launch (October 2019).&#xD;
      Reminders for date of study closure will be sent closer to the time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      It must be stated that the aim of this study is not to investigate 'leak-rates' or&#xD;
      comparatively analyse data of individual surgeons or trusts. No patient identifiable or&#xD;
      surgeon identifiable information will be requested. Data and outcomes from individual trusts&#xD;
      will not be compared against each other. The name of the trust will be recorded as one of the&#xD;
      variables only for data validation purposes and to identify the lead investigators at each&#xD;
      trust for the purposes of communication only. Names of Trusts or Surgeon level details will&#xD;
      not be published. The variables that will be recorded are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trust&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Symptomatic/Non-Symptomatic Leak&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment 1 (IV antibiotics are always given once a leak is diagnosed. So it should not&#xD;
           be inserted automatically as treatment 1. So I would reserve inserting &quot;IV antibiotics&quot;&#xD;
           or &quot;conservative&quot; as treatment 1 unless the patients actually had a trial of&#xD;
           conservative management.)&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Treatment 2&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Length of stay in Leak episode (total in days, if the leak occurred during the index&#xD;
           operation episode, it is the total length of stay in that whole episode.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date CT confirmed leak resolved&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of days of drainage (if drain inserted. This column is for radiologically&#xD;
           inserted drains; or EUA inserted drains in low pelvic leaks. It is the total number of&#xD;
           days a drain was kept in until removal of the drain (including changes).)&#xD;

           during an elective or emergency admission, who had an AL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laparoscopic or open surgery Ethical approval &amp; Registrations This is a retrospective&#xD;
           audit, aiming to analyse the region trust's management of colorectal anastomotic leaks,&#xD;
           and whether this is in accordance with published literature. This study therefore needs&#xD;
           to be registered as a retrospective audit in each trust. Please keep a record of those&#xD;
           that were subsequently excluded and the reason why (most probably was not a leak, or not&#xD;
           managed as leak).&#xD;
