  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of the evolving nature of psychology research, non-scientists are more likely to&#xD;
      struggle or misinterpret evidence regarding a person's psychological state. Misconceptions&#xD;
      may thus be highly prevalent within the justice system, leading to negative consequences for&#xD;
      people with psychological or neurobiological disorders. At the same time, no research has&#xD;
      been conducted to compare the punishment perspectives of non-scientists, that typically make&#xD;
      sentencing decisions, to scientists who possess a more advanced understanding of human&#xD;
      biology and behavior.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, closely inspired by the paradigms of Berryessa, Coppola, and Salvato,&#xD;
      perspectives on punishment based on psychobiological explanations of behaviour are assessed,&#xD;
      aiming to understand how scientists with knowledge of human psychobiology versus lay people&#xD;
      (of similar educational level) interpret offending behaviour. Human-science is contrasted to&#xD;
      natural-science/arts graduates because the former have been exposed to and may possess&#xD;
      scientific knowledge that shapes their understanding of behaviour, their views, and potential&#xD;
      (essentialist) biases. In contrast, non-scientists have been found to possess scientific&#xD;
      misconceptions that can impact their sentencing decisions. This leads to the question whether&#xD;
      scientists may draw different judgements based on their professional knowledge and experience&#xD;
      with psychological phenomena. If indeed scientists with greater insight on human behaviour&#xD;
      are found to hold less punitive views on punishment and rehabilitation, that has important&#xD;
      implications for criminal justice systems that rely on lay peoples' understanding of science.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred sixty participants who completed all study procedures (2 main groups of 80&#xD;
      participants) will be surveyed. A sample size calculation was performed using G*Power version&#xD;
      3.1.9.4, based on Berryessa and colleagues who conducted a similar survey study in 2021 with&#xD;
      comparable outcome measures and analyses. The required effect size is based upon&#xD;
      approximately 3-4 outcome measures. The primary research question is between-groups, while&#xD;
      secondary ones include within groups measures. Based on the power analysis, a sample of 160&#xD;
      participants will be targeted, which is enough for sufficient power for f = 0.25, power =&#xD;
      0.80, df = 4, for 2 different groups.&#xD;
