  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study to better understand i) the prevalence of&#xD;
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) in Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF), ii)&#xD;
      its hemodynamic correlates, and iii) the impact of intervention with Continuous Positive&#xD;
      Airway Pressure (CPAP) on exercise capacity and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective non-randomized observational study which will recruit patients with&#xD;
      gold standard HFpEF defined by exercise catheterization. The prevalence of OSA will be&#xD;
      determined in all HFpEF patients at baseline using home sleep apnea testing and all patients&#xD;
      will complete the Mayo Sleep Questionnaire. Patients with known OSA at baseline will also be&#xD;
      included only for the baseline assessment to accurately estimate prevalence of OSA in gold&#xD;
      standard diagnosed HFpEF. The subset of initially recruited patients with HFpEF who have&#xD;
      newly diagnosed OSA will be offered and initiated on CPAP therapy to treat their underlying&#xD;
      OSA. Repeat evaluation after 6 months of CPAP therapy for end point assessment with repeat&#xD;
      exercise supine CPET using simultaneous echocardiography, accelerometry (2 weeks prior to&#xD;
      return visit), 6 minute walk, NTproBNP measurement, and KCCQ, which will all be identical to&#xD;
      baseline measurements. In addition, ESS will be administered at this visit.&#xD;
