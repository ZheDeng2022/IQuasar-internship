      Healthcare workers (HCWs) play a vital role in determining the success of vaccination&#xD;
      programs. Patient acceptance and vaccination rely greatly on the utilization and attitude of&#xD;
      HCWs towards the vaccine, their attitude also influences patients' adherence to vaccination&#xD;
      schedules and their hesitancy. HCWs themselves can be hesitant about a certain vaccine and&#xD;
      thus can transfer their negative attitudes to their patients, increasing vaccine hesitancy&#xD;
      among the general population. Frontline HCWs are at an increased risk of exposure to COVID-19&#xD;
      due to their direct contact with their patients, working hours, psychological stress and job&#xD;
      burnout, they also face stigma. Dental health professionals in particular are at an increased&#xD;
      risk due to their occupational hazards that include continuous exposure to body fluids and&#xD;
      aerosols, this increases their risk of contracting COVID-19. Therefore vaccinating healthcare&#xD;
      workers will be beneficial, not only for themselves, but also for their households and&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      To mitigate the rapid spread of COVID-19 and its massive impact on the economy worldwide,&#xD;
      efforts have to be made to protect people against the disease, one of the most effective&#xD;
      means was found to be vaccination. The range of technology in the development of COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccine is a striking feature where various approaches are being evaluated including, but not&#xD;
      limited to: nucleic acid (DNA and RNA), recombinant protein, live-attenuated virus,&#xD;
      inactivated virus and virus-like particles approaches. It is the responsibility of&#xD;
      governments to ensure equity in the distribution and access to the novel vaccine. Authorized&#xD;
      and currently available vaccines in Egypt include: 1) COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca (AZD1222)&#xD;
      which is an adenovirus vaccine manufactured in UK, 2) Sputnik V, a recombinant adenovirus&#xD;
      vaccine manufactured in Russia and 3) BBIBP-CorV Sinopharm, which is an inactivated vaccine&#xD;
      manufactured in China. The total number of vaccine doses administered in Egypt was reported&#xD;
      to be 1,315 doses in March 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, vaccine availability is not enough to ensure large-scale immunization; success of&#xD;
      vaccination programs depend greatly on the population's demand and acceptability of the&#xD;
      vaccine. Governments should strive to understand determinants of vaccine acceptability and&#xD;
      perception of people towards the vaccine. Although vaccination has largely contributed to&#xD;
      decreasing the global burden of diseases and mortality, various factors can affect the&#xD;
      acceptance of a new vaccine. &quot;Vaccine hesitancy&quot; has been declared by WHO as one of the ten&#xD;
      global health threats worldwide, and has been defined as 'delay in acceptance or refusal of&#xD;
      vaccination despite availability of vaccination services.' Causes of vaccine hesitancy&#xD;
      include concerns about its safety, efficacy, personal beliefs, religious reasons, concerns&#xD;
      about its rapid development as the rapid development of swine flu vaccine was previously&#xD;
      associated with increased risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome, low benefits perceived and fear of&#xD;
      side effects. Moreover, some people have concerns about the manufacturing process of the&#xD;
      vaccine, as a defective polio vaccine lead to development of incident cases of polio and&#xD;
      paralysis and death in earlier times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Egypt, healthcare workers are the first group to have access to COVID-19 vaccine and&#xD;
      hence, act as a primary source of knowledge to the public about the vaccine, therefore it is&#xD;
      crucial to estimate their level of perception and acceptability of the vaccine and determine&#xD;
      factors affecting their acceptability. This will help inform stakeholders to make decisions&#xD;
      regarding COVID-19 vaccination programs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first&#xD;
      study in Egypt targeting dental health professionals in particular, owing to their exclusive&#xD;
      high exposure level to COVID-19 among healthcare workers&#xD;
