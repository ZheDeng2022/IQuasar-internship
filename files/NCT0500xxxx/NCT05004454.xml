  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of a novel Bacillus subtilis&#xD;
      spore preparation on abdominal bloating, flatulence, and burping in healthy adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a&#xD;
      health benefit on the host. Examples of probiotic health benefits include the support of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal health, immune health, and mood. Common probiotic strains include species&#xD;
      from the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Bacillus. Bacillus species are&#xD;
      particularly well suited for probiotic applications because they are often manufactured as&#xD;
      spores that persist without refrigeration and show survivability in the acidic conditions of&#xD;
      the human gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIO-CAT Microbials' proprietary Bacillus subtilis BS50 strain (&quot;BS50&quot;) has previously been&#xD;
      shown in bacterial culture to secrete digestive enzymes and candidate gut&#xD;
      microbiota-modulating molecules which may help support digestion and gastrointestinal health&#xD;
      (unpublished data). BS50 also showed robust heat resistance and pH tolerance, which predicts&#xD;
      strain survival across the wide pH range of the human gut. The objective of this clinical&#xD;
      study is to investigate the effect of BS50 supplementation at 2x10⁹ CFU per day for 42 days&#xD;
      on abdominal bloating, flatulence, and burping in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design trial consisting of one&#xD;
      screening visit (Visit 1) and two study visits (Visits 2 and 3). At Visit 1 (Day -7),&#xD;
      subjects will arrive at the clinic in a fasting state. After subjects provide voluntary&#xD;
      informed consent, subjects will undergo medical history, prior and current&#xD;
      medication/supplement use, and inclusion and exclusion criteria assessments. Additionally,&#xD;
      height, body weight, and vital signs will be measured and BMI will be calculated. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected for chemistry and hematology analyses. Subjects will also be&#xD;
      dispensed a paper Bowel Habits Diary with Bristol Stool Scale (BHD-BSS) and paper&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal Tolerance Questionnaire (GITQ) with instructions to capture events occurring&#xD;
      during the 7 continuous days prior to Visit 2 (Day 0). The GITQ contains a series of&#xD;
      questions regarding the presence and severity of GI symptoms occurring during the past 24 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 2 (Day 0), subjects will arrive at the clinic in a fasting state. Subjects will&#xD;
      undergo clinic visit procedures (concomitant medication/supplement use, assess&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, body weight and vital signs measurements), and adverse event&#xD;
      (AE) assessment. The paper BHD-BSS and GITQ will be collected and reviewed. To assess sleep&#xD;
      quality and determine presence and duration of respiratory infection, subjects will be&#xD;
      instructed to complete a paper Sleep Quality and Respiratory Infection Questionnaire (SQ-RIQ)&#xD;
      in the clinic. Blood samples will be collected for assessment of markers of intestinal&#xD;
      permeability, inflammation, and lipid profile. Subjects will be randomly assigned to a study&#xD;
      product. Subjects will be dispensed their assigned study product and will be instructed to&#xD;
      consume it once a day (1 capsule/d) for 42 days starting on Day 0. To assess sleep quality&#xD;
      and determine presence and duration of respiratory infection, subjects will be dispensed a&#xD;
      weekly electronic SQ-RIQ with instructions to complete this questionnaire weekly prior to&#xD;
      Visit 3 (Day 42). Subjects will be dispensed the electronic BHD-BSS and electronic GITQ with&#xD;
      instructions to capture events occurring daily leading up to Visit 3 (Day 42).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 3 (Day 42), subjects will arrive at the clinic fasted and undergo clinic visit&#xD;
      procedures (concomitant medication/supplement use, assess inclusion/exclusion criteria, body&#xD;
      weight and vital signs measurements), and adverse event (AE) assessment. Blood samples will&#xD;
      be collected for chemistry and hematology analyses as well as for assessment of markers of&#xD;
      intestinal permeability, inflammation, and lipid profile.&#xD;
