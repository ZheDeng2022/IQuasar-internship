      This pilot study will evaluate the cognitive and behavioral outcomes of using a novel,&#xD;
      adaptive attention training in pediatric cancer survivors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric cancer survivors (PCS) often experience attentional difficulties that have&#xD;
      downstream effects on their quality of life, academic achievement, and future occupational&#xD;
      attainment. As such, the primary goal of this project is to examine the outcomes of a novel,&#xD;
      mindful attention training in this population. Specifically, PCS will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of two adaptive attention training groups ('Engage') and complete tasks on the device for&#xD;
      up to 8 weeks. Participants will also complete pre- and post-training assessments of&#xD;
      cognition and behavior. The investigators hypothesize that completion of 'Engage' training&#xD;
      will result in enhanced attentional control beyond the active comparator group that extends&#xD;
      to other aspects of cognition in PCS.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean performance on a Continuous Performance Task (CPT) over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CPT is a 23-minute task, where participants are instructed to respond to target stimuli (squares at the top of the screen) and withhold responses to non-target stimuli (squares at the bottom of the screen). Performance will be quantified as: (1) mean reaction times, (2) standard deviation of reaction times (RTV), and (3) d-prime (comparing correct target detections or 'hits' to incorrect non-target detections or 'false alarms').</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean performance on a Delay Discounting Task over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Delay Discounting task is an untimed task, where participants choose between smaller, more immediate rewards and larger, more delayed rewards. Performance will be quantified by comparing choices between smaller/immediate rewards and larger/delayed rewards as the rate of delay discounting (the hyperbolic discounting index).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sub-test scores on the Adaptive Cognitive Evaluation (ACE) neuropsychological battery</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ACE is a mobile cognitive assessment tool, which includes a battery of cognitive control tests for rapid tests of cognition. The sub-tests (or 'modules') in ACE are adapted from standardized tasks to rapidly assess various aspects of cognition, including attention, memory, and multitasking.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean performance on a computerized Math Fluency Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess math fluency, participants solve simple math problems (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication) over a 3-minute period. Performance is measured as the number of correct responses.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean performance on a computerized Reading Fluency Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess reading fluency, participants indicate whether sentences are 'True' or 'False' over a 3-minute period. Performance is measured as the number of correct responses.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean scores on the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MAAS is a 15-item scale designed to assess a core characteristic of mindfulness by asking participants to respond to statements about everyday experiences on a scale from 1=&quot;Almost always&quot; to 6=&quot;Almost never&quot;. The total score is obtained by averaging the scores of the 15 items, to generate a total score for from 1-6. Greater scores are indicative of a greater level of mindfulness.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean scores on the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS) over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 14-item scale WEMWBS addresses mental well-being by asking participants to respond to individual items on a scale from 1=&quot;None of the time&quot; to 5=&quot;All of the time&quot;. The total score is obtained by summing the scores for each of the 14 items, to generate a total score ranging from 14-70. Lower scores are indicative of a lower overall well-being.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean scores on a modified Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) Scale over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The modified ISI consists of the first three of seven items in the full ISI scale. These three questions ask participants about the the severity of their insomnia symptoms on a scale from 0=&quot;None&quot; to 4=&quot;Very&quot;. The total score is obtained by summing the scores for each of the three items, to generate a total score from 0-12. Higher scores are indicative of more insomnia problems.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean scores on the Child Self-Control Rating Scale (parent rating) over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Child Self-Control Rating Scale consists of 33 items that assess children's self control. Parents respond to individual items on a 7-point scale. The total score is obtained by summing the scores for each of the 33 items, with a higher score reflecting greater lack of child self-control.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Adaptive Attention Training</intervention_name>
    <description>The training is comprised of a time-based titration of rich audiovisual and sparse audio interactive environments. Training progressively transitions the participants from an immersive and rapid reward setting to a less immersive, sensory impoverished, and slower reward setting. Further, the participants' actions require delayed gratification decisions to accomplish play in the sparse setting, building fronto-parietal control through sustained attention and suppression of ventral-striatal reward impulses.</description>
