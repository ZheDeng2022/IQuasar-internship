      This study will test the effectiveness of two interventions (parent-targeted text messages&#xD;
      and a brief clinician-targeted training) at increasing HPV vaccination among 11- to&#xD;
      12-year-olds living in Florida.&#xD;

      Random Assignment: The study will test the hypotheses with a doubly randomized, two-level&#xD;
      nested design for testing two nested implementation factors. Randomization will occur at two&#xD;
      levels: the clinic and patient/parent. A group randomized trial forms the basis of&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will randomly assign a fixed number of 30 clinics (and the providers within each&#xD;
      clinic) equally to one of three provider trainings: (1) bundled training (n=10 clinics), (2)&#xD;
      benefits training (n=10 clinics), and (3) no training (n=10 clinics). All providers in each&#xD;
      clinic will be invited to participate in the assigned training. The investigators anticipate&#xD;
      an average of 2 providers per clinic. The study will stratify by baseline vaccination rates&#xD;
      to ensure balance across the three groups. The investigators chose to assign provider&#xD;
      trainings at the clinic level because it is more feasible to conduct one training at each&#xD;
      clinic and it limits the potential for contamination between providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second level of randomization will occur among patients/parents. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate between 70-100 adolescents per clinic. The study will randomly assign parents&#xD;
      (nested within clinic) equally to one of three text message groups: (1) bundled (n=30), (2)&#xD;
      benefits (n=30), and (3) no messages (n=30). Inclusion criteria are: 10 , 11 , and&#xD;
      12-year-olds, attended the clinic in the past two years, and do not have records of changing&#xD;
      providers or receiving the adolescent vaccines. Randomization will include 10-year-olds&#xD;
      because text messages will be sent just prior to the adolescents' 11th birthday. The study&#xD;
      will stratify text message assignment by patient biologic sex because of large differences in&#xD;
      HPV vaccination and possible differential effectiveness of text messages. To ensure&#xD;
      auditability, separate SAS programs will be written for the two levels of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery of interventions: At each clinic randomized to training, providers will be invited&#xD;
      to participate in a group-based training occurring over Zoom. Each training will last&#xD;
      one-hour and providers will receive continuing medical education (CME) credit for&#xD;
      participating. Trainings will focus on increasing the providers' intention to recommend the&#xD;
      vaccine. Following best practices, each provider training will have a combination of&#xD;
      activities (presentation, concrete skills development, role-play, and feedback), will be&#xD;
      learner-centered, and engaging. Training will include: (A) presentation of HPV vaccination&#xD;
      background; (B) the approach explanation, script, and a video-recorded example of a provider&#xD;
      talking to a parent; (C) practicing prepared role play scenarios in small groups; and (D) an&#xD;
      explanation of the follow-up, audio-recorded trainings. For part B, the bundled training will&#xD;
      include existing nationally endorsed materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will audio-record thee visits with each provider to give individual feedback, to&#xD;
      offer boosters (e.g., script review or barrier discussions) to providers who are lower than&#xD;
      80% adherent, and to evaluate provider adherence to assigned approaches. To increase the&#xD;
      trialability, providers will be encouraged to use a standardized form to record their vaccine&#xD;
      recommendations with their next ten patients and compare the HPV vaccination rates to their&#xD;
      preceding ten patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For feasibility of scale-up and dissemination, text messages will be sent from clinics to&#xD;
      parents by integrating our message content and timing into the clinic's existing appointment&#xD;
      reminder system. The study will restrict recruitment to clinics with appointment reminder&#xD;
      systems. If integration is not feasible or preferable to a clinic, study staff will&#xD;
      facilitate texting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will be sent the interactive text messages as part of the clinics' quality&#xD;
      improvement efforts. Each clinic will send the text messages from their appointment reminder&#xD;
      phone number so parents are aware the messages are from the clinic. Parents who have&#xD;
      opted-out of clinic text messages or who did not provide the clinic with a text-enabled phone&#xD;
      number will be sent an email or automated voicemail message. Text messages will include an&#xD;
      opt-out option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study, text messages will be sent to the parents of all 11- to&#xD;
      12-year-olds who have attended each clinic within the past two years and do not have records&#xD;
      of changing providers or receiving the adolescent vaccines. Throughout the study year, we&#xD;
      will send a text message two weeks prior to the child's 11th birthday. Additional text&#xD;
      messages will be sent to parents of 11- to 12-year-olds who have a clinic appointment during&#xD;
      the study period at the same time as the texted appointment reminder. Parents who respond to&#xD;
      the text message will receive an appointment scheduling call within two business days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis accounting for clustered design. Throughout the analysis, the&#xD;
      statistical team will be blinded to study arm assignments. Initially, descriptive statistics&#xD;
      (rates and means with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be compared between implementation&#xD;
      strategies (brief provider training and interactive text messages) and recommendation&#xD;
      approaches (bundled versus benefits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve all four study aims and evaluate the process measures, the study will account for&#xD;
      the clustered data with generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs; e.g., SAS PROC GLIMMIX)&#xD;
      rather than generalized estimating equations (GEE) given the relatively small number of&#xD;
      clusters (30 clinics) and the two levels of randomization. In all four aims, the primary&#xD;
      outcomes are HPV vaccination (initiation and up-to-date): binary variables at the patient&#xD;
      level. The GLMMs will assume a binomial distribution and use a log link, modeling risk (i.e.,&#xD;
      rates) of initiation and up-to-date and estimating rate ratios (RRs) between implementation&#xD;
      strategies and recommendation approaches. Staying within the framework of RR will aid&#xD;
      analysis of additive interactions (Aim 3). If convergence failure is an issue after exploring&#xD;
      avoidance methods, we will use the logit link and make interpretations around odds of&#xD;
      initiation and up-to-date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims 1 and 2: Main Effects of Implementation Strategies on Outcomes. The study will test the&#xD;
      main effects of our implementation strategies on HPV vaccination rates with the inference of&#xD;
      the fixed effects. For inference on the fixed effects, we will use the between-within DDFM.&#xD;
      To account for the nested design, we will include random effects for provider and clinic.&#xD;
      Initially, the study will include a multiplicative interaction between provider training and&#xD;
      parent text messages to examine if one implementation strategy modifies the effect of the&#xD;
      other. If not significant (P&gt;=0.05), as hypothesized, the investigators will remove the&#xD;
      multiplicative interaction and focus inference on the main effects (Aim 2) and additive&#xD;
      interactions (Aim 3). Given the stratified randomization, the investigators will adjust for&#xD;
      baseline HPV vaccination rates and patient sex. The investigators will also examine patient&#xD;
      sex and race/ethnicity as possible effect modifiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes of interest are provider recommendation frequency (Aim 1) and patient&#xD;
      clinic visits (Aim 2). Clinic visits will be analyzed as binary (yes/no) with similar&#xD;
      modeling approaches described above. The study will also model number of clinic visits per&#xD;
      patient, most likely using a zero-inflated Poisson model (accounting for the clustered data&#xD;
      via random effects). The investigators will carefully examine the distribution of the&#xD;
      provider recommendation frequency, which is measured as a percentage of patient encounters&#xD;
      and will resemble continuous outcomes, to determine the appropriate distribution/link&#xD;
      function of the GLMM. The unit of analysis is provider, and therefore, only a random effect&#xD;
      of clinic is needed. For Aim 1, the investigators will also perform sensitivity analyses to&#xD;
      adjust for provider adherence score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Additive Interaction of the Implementation Strategies. The investigators will&#xD;
      calculate the synergy index (S), which measures the extent to which the RR for concordant&#xD;
      provider and parent recommendation approaches together is greater than the sum of the&#xD;
      provider approach RR and parent approach RR (i.e., additive interaction). An S &gt; 1 indicates&#xD;
      synergy and S &lt; 1 indicates antagonism between the two approaches. Standard error&#xD;
      calculations for S will be estimated using standard software/modules based on the delta&#xD;
      method. S is a commonly-used measure of additive interaction of treatments/interventions. The&#xD;
      investigators will calculate this synergy to test the hypothesis associated with Aim 3.1&#xD;
      (testing the combined effectiveness of any provider and parent intervention), and the&#xD;
      investigators will calculate it separately for Aim 3.2 (testing the combined effectiveness of&#xD;
      concordant interventions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Clinical Practice-Level Moderators of Implementation. To determine if the five&#xD;
      specified clinical practice factors modify the implementation strategies' effectiveness, we&#xD;
      will consider fixed effects for clinical practice factors on HPV vaccination, and assess the&#xD;
      specified interactions between clinical practice factors and the implementation strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process Evaluation Analysis Plan. The study will evaluate the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      implementation strategies on the process measures. For the provider training, the study will&#xD;
      evaluate changes in the primary targeted construct, provider intent to vaccinate, before,&#xD;
      immediately after, and a year after training. Mean levels of provider intent to vaccinate (a&#xD;
      composite of Likert-scaled questions) will be estimated and compared across the three time&#xD;
      points and across provider training arms via GLMMs as described above. For the interactive&#xD;
      text messages, the primary targeted construct of parent salience is measured in a one-time&#xD;
      survey of parents in all study arms. Parent salience rates will be estimated (with 95% CIs)&#xD;
      and compared across the parent text message arms using a similar modeling approach (with a&#xD;
      binary variable/logit link).&#xD;
