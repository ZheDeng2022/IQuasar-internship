    <measure>Clinician-Completed Congenital DM1 Rating Scale (CDM1-RS)</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinician-completed Congenital DM1 Rating Scale is an 11-item rating scale completed by the clinician to score the symptom severity of domains that are clinically relevant in Congenital DM1.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Top 3 Caregiver Concerns Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>54 weeks</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions Severity Scale (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>54 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S is a 7-point Likert type scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the subject's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with subjects who have the same diagnosis.</description>
