    <textblock>
      The principle of participant distribution into groups is the type of surgical intervention&#xD;
      and preoperative preparation. Total up to 135 participants with pelvic organs prolapse I-II&#xD;
      degree of severity, or any other pathology of pelvic organs, which require surgical&#xD;
      intervention will be involved in the study. Participants will be divided into three groups:&#xD;
      group with anterior and/or posterior (A/P) colporrhaphy and laser preoperative treatment&#xD;
      (laser treatment group), group with A/P colporrhaphy only (control group 1), and group with&#xD;
      any other surgical intervention of pelvic area with obtaining a biopsy of the vaginal wall&#xD;
      (control group 2), by 45 participants in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The types of examination of each group are the same and include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General methods: physical examination, clinical blood analysis including glucose&#xD;
      determination, clinical urine test, vaginal smear for flora and oncocytology, pelvic&#xD;
      ultrasound, tests for hepatitis B, C viruses, human immunodeficiency viruses and syphilis,&#xD;
      blood clotting tests, blood type and rhesus factor determination, electrocardiography,&#xD;
      colposcopy, consultation of a therapist about the absence of contraindications for surgical&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Special methods: filling out the questionnaire (Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory&#xD;
      Questionnaire, The Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire,&#xD;
      International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form, Pelvic Floor Impact&#xD;
      Questionnaire), Vaginal Health Index determination, Doppler ultrasonography of vagina,&#xD;
      histological examination, immunohistochemical examination, optical coherence tomography (OCT)&#xD;
      (elastography).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment procedure of this study is the laser treatment of the vagina and vulva with a&#xD;
      &quot;Magic Max&quot; laser with subsequent monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser treatment procedure will be carried out in three stages. In total, three procedures&#xD;
      will be performed with an interval of 4 weeks. Colporrhaphy will be carried out 1 month after&#xD;
      last treatment. Three follow-up visits will follow: 1, 6 and 12 months after colporrhaphy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the procedure, the following sequence of actions will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. st Stage - vaginal processing with a conical mirror handpiece,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nd Stage - vaginal processing with a corner mirror handpiece,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. rd Stage - external vulva and paraurethral region processing with a switched beam&#xD;
           diameter handpiece.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser radiation is emitted by a series of pulses following each other through a pause. The&#xD;
      duration of one pulse is 20-200 nanoseconds (ns), the pause between pulses is 30 microseconds&#xD;
      (us). The energy of one pulse is about 1.5 millijoule (mJ). The procedure is performed&#xD;
      without anesthesia. The doctor always focuses on the participant's feeling of warmth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants of all groups will be tested with the general methods necessary to include the&#xD;
      participant in the study at the first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control groups general surgery preparation protocol (sanitation of vagina) will be&#xD;
      used as a therapeutic tool. After completing of preparation course, the operation will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operation technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A part of the stretched vaginal wall in the posterior fornix area including the mucous&#xD;
      membrane and muscle layer will be excised with its further suturing during colporrhaphy&#xD;
      surgery (the excised material will be examined). This will allow comparing the vaginal walls&#xD;
      state at the time of surgery after laser treatment and without it, and with the age norm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants of all groups will be tested with the general methods necessary to include the&#xD;
      patient in the study at the first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the laser treatment group: Studies will be carried out using filling out the&#xD;
      questionnaires, Vaginal Health Index determination, and Doppler ultrasonography, and then&#xD;
      laser treatment of the vagina, vulva and paraurethral region will be performed during the&#xD;
      2nd, 3d, and 4th visits. Filling out the questionnaires, Vaginal Health Index determination,&#xD;
      and Doppler ultrasonography will be repeated during the 5th visit (1 month after last laser&#xD;
      treatment and 1 day before colporrhaphy). Vaginal biopsy for histological examination,&#xD;
      immunohistochemical examination, and optical coherence tomography (elastography) will be&#xD;
      carried out during A/P colporrhaphy in the 6th visit. Physical examination only will be&#xD;
      carried out during the 7th (follow-up) visit - 1 month after colporrhaphy. Filling out the&#xD;
      questionnaires, Vaginal Health Index determination, and Doppler ultrasonography will be&#xD;
      carried out during 8th and 9th (follow-up) visits - 6 and 12 months after colporrhaphy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For control group 1: Studies will be carried out using filling out the questionnaires,&#xD;
      Vaginal Health Index determination, and Doppler ultrasonography during the 1st visit after&#xD;
      including patient. Vaginal biopsy for histological examination, immunohistochemical&#xD;
      examination, and optical coherence tomography (elastography) will be carried out during A/P&#xD;
      colporrhaphy in the 2nd visit. Physical examination only will be carried out during the 3th&#xD;
      (follow-up) visit - 1 month after colporrhaphy. Filling out the questionnaire, Vaginal Health&#xD;
      Index determination, and Doppler ultrasonography will be carried out during 4th and 5th&#xD;
      (follow-up) visits - 6 and 12 months after colporrhaphy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, a direct comparison between laser preoperational treatment and lack of preoperational&#xD;
      treatment will be made during the investigation, 6 and 12 months after the end of each type&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For control group 2: Studies will be carried out using filling out the questionnaires,&#xD;
      Vaginal Health Index determination, and Doppler ultrasonography during the 1st visit after&#xD;
      including participant. Vaginal biopsy for histological examination, immunohistochemical&#xD;
      examination, and optical coherence tomography (elastography) will be carried out during A/P&#xD;
      colporrhaphy in the 2nd visit (no more than 1 month after 1st visit). The obtained data will&#xD;
      allow to study the tissues of the vaginal wall in normal conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out with the participation of several clinics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Privolzhsky Research Medical University (main scientific coordinator, histological&#xD;
           examination, immunohistochemical examination, and optical coherence tomography&#xD;
           (elastography)),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. LLC &quot;Medical Center&quot; AIST &quot;&quot; (location of laser equipment, recruiting, laser treatment,&#xD;
           special tests),&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. State Budgetary Institution of Health Care of the Nizhny Novgorod Region &quot;Nizhny&#xD;
           Novgorod Regional Clinical Oncological Dispensary&quot; (colporrhaphy and biopsy),&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clinic &quot;Preventamed&quot;, LLC &quot;Aesthetic Medicine&quot; (colporrhaphy and biopsy),&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. State-Funded Healthcare Institution of the Nizhny Novgorod region &quot;Nizhny Novgorod&#xD;
           Regional Clinical Hospital named after N.A. Semashko&quot; (recruiting, special tests).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data obtained during the study will be transferred to the manufacturer of laser equipment&#xD;
      LLC &quot;MeLSyTech&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be monitored by LLC &quot;MeLSyTech&quot; as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once a month, monitoring of provided documents (copies of individual registration&#xD;
           records of participants, informed consent, test results) for the complete filling of the&#xD;
           forms; the clarity of filling out forms, the possibility of systematizing information&#xD;
           from the forms of their assessment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once every six months, monitoring will be conducted with a coordinator visit of the&#xD;
           research center and analysis activities, such as participants recruitment, data&#xD;
           collection, data management, data analysis, reporting for adverse events, and change&#xD;
           management;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once a year, the investigator submits a clinical evaluation report to the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will be carried out both between groups of participants receiving different&#xD;
      types of therapy (analysis of independent groups) and within groups at different time&#xD;
      intervals (analysis of matched groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before performing statistical analysis of the data, the distribution type of the variables&#xD;
      will be assessed. To assess the normality of distribution for each variable, histograms of&#xD;
      frequency distributions will be visually evaluated, indicators of skewness, kurtosis, and the&#xD;
      D'Agostino-Pearson normality test will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to checking the type of distribution of variables, the equality of variances of&#xD;
      the studied groups will be assessed using the methods of analysis of variance, in particular&#xD;
      the Brown-Forsythe test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of descriptive analysis will be used depending on the type of distribution of the&#xD;
      variable. With a normal distribution, the mean (M) and standard deviation (SD) will be&#xD;
      calculated. In case of an nongaussian distribution, the median (Me) and interquartile range&#xD;
      will be calculated. Different algorithms of statistical analysis will be applied depending on&#xD;
      the type of distribution of variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of the paired and unpaired groups with a normal distribution, in case of the&#xD;
      equality of the variances, will be carried out by the methods of analysis of variance ANOVA.&#xD;
      Comparison of groups in pairs will be performed using the post-hoc method of posterior&#xD;
      multiple comparisons (Tukey test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of groups in which variables do not follow the normal distribution will be carried&#xD;
      out using the methods of nonparametric analysis of variations: the Kruskal-Wallis test (ANOVA&#xD;
      tests) for independent groups and the Friedman test for matched groups. Dunn's multiple&#xD;
      comparison test will be used to assess intergroup differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before assessing intergroup differences, the initial samples (1 visit) will be analyzed for&#xD;
      identity using ANOVA or nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests (depending on the type of data).&#xD;
      In case of significant differences in the samples, the search and removal of extremely&#xD;
      deviating values (outliers) will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences will be considered statistically significant if the significance P values are&#xD;
      &lt;0.05.&#xD;

    <description>Measurement is a part of immunohistochemical analysis. The measurement of Cluster of Differentiation 31 expression will be carried out in the vaginal wall submucosa using the ImageJ Fiji software package (version 1.2) on histological samples stained according to the instructions of the CD 31+ immunohistochemical kit. To obtain images, a light microscope with 40x objective magnification and CMOS APS-C camera will be used. Expression will be assessed semi-quantitatively in the five non-overlapping fields of view as the ratio of the positive-stained area to the field of view total area * 100. An average value will be calculated for each participant. Parameter will be measured in percentages (%).</description>

    <description>Elastography with optical coherence tomography (elastography) will be used to visualize inter-frame strains in the tissue and subsequently map the Young modulus. The OCT probe will slightly press onto the studied resected Vaginal Wall surface, and strain distribution in the probe vicinity will be reconstructed. For quantification of the tissue Young's modulus (stiffness), a reference silicon layer on the surface tissue with preliminary calibrated stiffness will be used. The obtained optical coherence elastography (OCE)-images are represented in the color-coded form, such that stiffer areas (those with weaker strain) are shown in blue, and soft areas, where deformation is greater, are shown in red. The Stiffness of Vaginal Wall will be measured in kiloPascal (kPa). The average stiffness value over the entire elastographic image will be obtained.</description>
