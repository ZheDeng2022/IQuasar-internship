    <textblock>
      This feasibility study is designed to explore several facets of hearing performance that may&#xD;
      show improvements for alternative modes of stimulation compared to Monopolar (MP) stimulation&#xD;
      within a group of adult cochlear-implant recipients. Measures of speech recognition, music&#xD;
      appreciation, listening effort, quality of life, and real-world assessments will be gathered&#xD;
      to determine the most promising benefits for further examination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alternative modes of stimulation will be investigated that may improve spectral resolution&#xD;
      through reduced cochlear spread of excitation and in turn provide enhanced speech perception&#xD;
      and real-world clinical benefits over MP stimulation. The purpose of this feasibility study&#xD;
      is to explore several facets of hearing performance that may show improvements with these&#xD;
      alternative modes of stimulation compared to MP stimulation within a group of adult&#xD;
      cochlear-implant recipients. Measures of speech recognition, music appreciation, listening&#xD;
      effort, quality of life, and real-world assessments will be gathered to determine the most&#xD;
      promising benefits for further examination. Individual neural, psychophysical, cognitive, and&#xD;
      electrode placement data will also be obtained to inform questions related to across-subject&#xD;
      variability, and practical aspects of power consumption and device fitting will be evaluated.&#xD;
