  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate that imaging via home ultrasound can identify submucosal fibroids. The image&#xD;
      quality and submucosal fibroid detection specificity of the home imaging has already been&#xD;
      demonstrated; the aim of this study is to generate further data for sensitivity. This will be&#xD;
      a single visit study, with participants scanning themselves at home with healthcare&#xD;
      professional (HCP) supervision. Targeted population is women with previously diagnosed&#xD;
      submucosal fibroids that have not been removed. The study will be single-blinded to the image&#xD;
      raters.&#xD;

    <description>Qualified independent raters will be asked if they see a submucosal fibroid on the uterine videos. Answer options are: Yes, definitely; Almost certain; Possibly; Unlikely; No; N/A. In order to consider a fibroid present, either (1) two raters must answer &quot;Almost certain&quot; to having seen a submucosal fibroid or (2) one must answer &quot;Yes definitely&quot; to having seen a submucosal fibroid</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women with one or more submucosal fibroid, with appropriate attestation (see more&#xD;
             detail below)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women between the ages of 18 and 49 inclusive (women 38 and younger can also receive&#xD;
             their antral follicle count, or AFC; 39 and older will participate in uterine scanning&#xD;
             only)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women with BMI up to 40&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women located in states where the PI or sub-PI licensure is valid&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women able to freely give consent electronically, given COVID. For the purposes of&#xD;
             this study, this is defined as women who speak native or fluent English; and have a&#xD;
             high school degree or equivalent, and who are otherwise, in the professional judgement&#xD;
             of the PI, able to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women with expert ultrasound experience, e.g., ultrasound technologists, radiologists,&#xD;
             OB/GYNs, Reproductive Endocrinologists&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women with BMI over 40&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who do not speak English natively or fluently&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who have recently given birth, and have had fewer than 3 postpartum menstrual&#xD;
             cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who have recently had a stillbirth or abortion more than 20 weeks (subject to&#xD;
             the 3 postpartum menstrual cycles above). Miscarriages or abortions less than 20 weeks&#xD;
             are subject to two wait cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are currently pregnant or may be pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any woman the PI believes is not capable of giving independent, informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Turtle Health employees&#xD;
