  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will increase knowledge about how a simple intervention, grocery delivery,&#xD;
      impacts weight gain and diet among low-income pregnant young women. Results can then be used&#xD;
      to support other pregnant young women.&#xD;

    <measure>Weekly weight gain in pregnancy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to delivery, approximately 40 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of weight categorizations, categorized as above, below, or within Institute of Medicine/National Academy of Medicine (IOM/NAM) guidelines, will be assessed. Data collected from BodyTrace scale and calculated as weight for a particular week minus pre-pregnancy weight.</description>

    <time_frame>At delivery, approximately 40 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of weight categorizations, categorized as above, below, or within Institute of Medicine/National Academy of Medicine (IOM/NAM) guidelines will be assessed. Data collected from BodyTrace scale and calculated as end of pregnancy weight minus pre-pregnancy weight.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dietary Quality as measured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to delivery, approximately 40 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dietary recall data collected via the ASA24 (Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour) Dietary Recall Survey will be used to determine continuous HEI scores. ASA24 data are collected twice at enrollment, twice in second trimester, and twice in third trimester and used in pairs to calculate 3 HEI scores per participant. The HEI uses a scoring system to evaluate a set of foods. The scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores correlating to higher diet quality.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Occurrence of prenatal complications</measure>
    <time_frame>Delivery, approximately 40 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of prenatal complications will be assessed. Complications are collected from mother's medical record examples include gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders.</description>
