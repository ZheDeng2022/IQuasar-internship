  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoke Free SafeCare (SFSC) is a proposed braided intervention consisting of two&#xD;
      evidence-based interventions: Some Things are Better Outside (STBO), aimed at promoting smoke&#xD;
      free home rules, and SafeCare, aimed at reducing child maltreatment and improving mother and&#xD;
      child outcomes. STBO is effective in creating smoke free homes and reducing second-hand smoke&#xD;
      in low-SES (socioeconomic status) households. SafeCare is an effective parent training&#xD;
      program that is broadly disseminated in child protective services in the United States.&#xD;
      SafeCare is a promising mechanism to effectively increase the reach of STBO to reduce SHS&#xD;
      (secondhand smoke) exposure in families with documented high rates of tobacco use and&#xD;
      children with cumulative risk for negative health outcomes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Longitudinal studies have found beneficial effects of prevention and intervention efforts for&#xD;
      children exposed to poverty and other adverse experiences on long-term health and a range of&#xD;
      social and psychological outcomes. Evidence-based intervention programs exist for smoke-free&#xD;
      homes and for child maltreatment risk. However, to our knowledge, no programs jointly target&#xD;
      SHS (secondhand smoke) exposure and maltreatment risk, despite the evidence that these risk&#xD;
      factors often co-occur for children living in low-SES households.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some Things are Better Outside (STBO) is a brief intervention that is highly effective in&#xD;
      promoting adoption of smoke-free home rules among low-SES households. Three randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials (RCTs) documented significant intervention effects, with 40.0 to 62.9% of&#xD;
      clients reporting a smoke-free home when reached for follow-up at 6 months post-baseline.&#xD;
      Self-reported smoke-free homes were validated by air nicotine at 3-months post-baseline. STBO&#xD;
      was also effective in a dissemination trial conducted with five 2-1-1 agencies across&#xD;
      multiple states. The six-week intervention was designed to be easy to deliver, consisting of&#xD;
      three mailings of print materials and a 15-20 minute coaching call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SafeCare is a brief parenting intervention that is highly effective in reducing child&#xD;
      maltreatment perpetration and improving behavioral outcomes for Child Protective&#xD;
      Services-involved (CPS-involved) parents of young children (0 to 5 years) as the result of&#xD;
      child physical abuse or neglect (the two most common forms of substantiated maltreatment).&#xD;
      SafeCare is delivered in the home over 18-weeks, and the curriculum focuses on promotion of&#xD;
      positive parenting skills, home safety, and child health. SafeCare is disseminated through&#xD;
      the National SafeCare Training and Research Center (NSTRC) at Georgia State University (GSU),&#xD;
      directed by Self-Brown (MPI) and Whitaker (Co-I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In considering the best approaches for targeting SHS, it is imperative to consider how to&#xD;
      integrate interventions with documented success for improving smoke-free rules and with high&#xD;
      levels of parent engagement (which STBO has consistently demonstrated), into effective&#xD;
      parenting intervention programs, such as SafeCare (which has also been demonstrated to be&#xD;
      highly engaging). Thoughtful integration would ensure the maintenance of active ingredients&#xD;
      for both programs, and parent engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of Smoke Free SafeCare is to conduct an effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial&#xD;
      type 1 of the SFSC intervention for parents with substantiated maltreatment. This braided&#xD;
      intervention will be compared to standard SafeCare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To conduct an effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial type 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare SFSC to standard SafeCare on the addition of a full smoking ban in the home, and&#xD;
           maintenance and stability of the smoking ban.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Understand impact and sustainability of SFSC on parenting outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Examine the variability in SFSC effects across sites and client characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will implement a mixed methods approach to gain insight about the perceived&#xD;
      feasibility and impact of SFSC with mothers who report at least two risk factors at initial&#xD;
      screening that are commensurate with child maltreatment perpetration risk. Understanding&#xD;
      whether there is additive benefit to the integration of these programs will inform policy for&#xD;
      best practices of programs serving low-SES families, and will further establish a structured&#xD;
      approach for systematically integrating evidence-based programs for populations who have&#xD;
      cumulative risk.&#xD;

    <description>Research staff will place an air nicotine monitor in one room in which the family spends the most time. The monitors, the size of a petri dish, will be labeled and left in place for 7 days. For quality assurance and control, one blank sample per 10 samples will be included, along with duplicate samples collected for 10% of the total sample. Research staff will return to the home after 7 days to collect the monitor. Time-weighted average airborne nicotine will be assayed. The amount of nicotine collected is determined in the laboratory using gas chromatographic analysis. The sensitivity of these devices is sufficient to quantify low levels of passive smoke exposures over a period of a few days. Outcome is reported in micrograms of nicotine per cubed meter.</description>

    <description>SFSC is the systematically braided curriculum which combines both SafeCare and STBO programs, but in a new delivery format. To take full advantage of the home delivery mechanism of SafeCare, the content delivery of STBO has been adapted so that original mailings will be delivered in the SafeCare sessions. STBO has been fully braided into the Health and Safety modules. One of these interventions will be delivered first throughout the course of the study. The Smoke Free SafeCare intervention will involve 25 providers receiving training for the SFSC program. They will each recruit 10 mothers and conduct the SFSC program for each family. Overall, 250 families will receive the SFSC intervention.</description>

        Provider Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SafeCare providers in this study must 1) have completed the SafeCare workshop and&#xD;
             passed field Certification (9 sessions of SafeCare delivered with fidelity according&#xD;
             to the SafeCare Fidelity Checklist); 2) be employed at an accredited SafeCare agency&#xD;
             in a target state based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) adult&#xD;
             smoking data or prior SafeCare research documenting high smoking rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Mother Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mothers in this study must meet the following inclusion criteria to participate: 1)&#xD;
             Mother referred to a SafeCare Provider study participant as the result of a child&#xD;
             protection case; 2) Mother reports in-home smoking behavior by herself or another&#xD;
             person (person must reside in the home 3 or more nights a week) 3) Mother must be aged&#xD;
             18 or older and 4) must be a parent to a child between the ages of 0 and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Provider Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SafeCare providers will be excluded if they have planned for significant employment&#xD;
             leave, resignation, or promotion during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Mother Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will exclude those who 1) Report that no one smokes in the home; 2) Demonstrate an&#xD;
             inability to understand their responsibilities as outlined in the consent form. This&#xD;
             will be determined as the research staff verbally go through the consent form with the&#xD;
             mothers. If mothers do not understand the consent form and subsequent procedures, they&#xD;
             will be excluded.&#xD;

Once we have completed our primary analyses, we will upload the de-identified quantitative datasets to an online data storage site, with accompanying documentation.</ipd_access_criteria>
