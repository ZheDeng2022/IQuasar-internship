    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to conduct a randomized trial comparing a web-based&#xD;
      Mindful Mood Balance for Moms course without coaching support to waitlist control among&#xD;
      pregnant or early parenting women with depression histories.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) prevents depressive relapse and reduces residual&#xD;
      depression symptoms among adults with recurrent depression not currently in episode. Women in&#xD;
      perinatal or early parenting years constitute a significant portion of this at-risk&#xD;
      population with a history of depression for whom MBCT was designed. Novel delivery formats&#xD;
      that provide access to core knowledge and skills of MBCT could increase public health&#xD;
      impact-particularly for perinatal or early parenting women-but it is unclear whether such&#xD;
      formats have comparable mental health outcomes and changes in putative targets as in-person&#xD;
      MBCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, we planned to randomize 60 pregnant or early parenting women with a&#xD;
      history of major depression and current residual depressive symptoms to MMB for Moms, a&#xD;
      web-based course that teaches skills from MBCT customized specifically for pregnant and&#xD;
      postpartum women, or waitlist control. We planned to address the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. We evaluated the extent to MMB for Moms was associated with significant reduction in&#xD;
      residual depression symptoms as compared to WLC. We predicted the rate of change in&#xD;
      depression symptoms across the study would be greater on average for participants randomized&#xD;
      to MMB for Moms relative to those randomized to WLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. We evaluated the extent to MMB for Moms significantly engaged the putative target of&#xD;
      decentering as compared to WLC. We predicted the rate of change in decentering across the&#xD;
      study would be greater on average for participants randomized to MMB for Moms relative to&#xD;
      participants randomized to WLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. We evaluated the extent to MMB for Moms significantly engaged the putative target of&#xD;
      self-compassion as compared to WLC. We predicted the rate of change in self-compassion across&#xD;
      the study would be greater on average for participants randomized to MMB for Moms relative to&#xD;
      participants randomized to WLC.&#xD;
