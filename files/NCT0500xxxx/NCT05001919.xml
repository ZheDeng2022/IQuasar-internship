  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 20 intra-bony defects in 10 LAP patients were randomly assigned into two groups 10&#xD;
      defects each in a split-mouth design. Group I treated by surgery plus Bio-Oss bone graft +&#xD;
      collagen membrane (Control group). Group II, treated by surgery plus Bio-Oss bone graft + CGF&#xD;
      membrane (Test group). Gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing pocket depth&#xD;
      and clinical attachment level (CAL) were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Cone beam&#xD;
      radiograph evaluation was taken at baseline, and 12 months after surgery..&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Full mouth scaling and root planing was done for all patients followed by Augmentin I gm and&#xD;
      metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days. Additionally, Comprehensive oral hygiene&#xD;
      instructions were given to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sites grouping Four weeks following phase I therapy, the twenty defect sites were randomly&#xD;
      classified by sealed envelopes into two groups ten each by a masked supervisor as follows:&#xD;
      Group I (10 sites) received surgery + Bio-oss bone graft (Geistlich Pharma AG, Wolhusen,&#xD;
      Switzerland) + collagen membrane (control group). Group II (10 sites) received surgery +&#xD;
      Bio-oss bone graft +concentrated growth factors membrane (tested group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the administration of local anesthesia (Xylocaine 2% Adrenaline 1:80,000, ICPA, India),&#xD;
      buccal and lingual sulcular incisions were made, and mucoperiosteal flaps were elevated.&#xD;
      Thorough debridement of the defects was achieved with hand instruments. The surgical area was&#xD;
      irrigated with copious amounts of sterile saline. Bio-oss granules were placed into the&#xD;
      defects and the CGFs membrane was trimmed and adapted over the entire defect to cover 2-3 mm&#xD;
      of the surrounding alveolar bone and to ensure the stability of the wound and the graft&#xD;
      material. For control sites, Bio-oss grafts and a bioresorbable collagen membrane were&#xD;
      trimmed and adjusted over the defect in such a way that the whole defect and 2-3 mm of the&#xD;
      surrounding alveolar bone were completely covered. Then the flap was repositioned to achieve&#xD;
      complete interproximal closure. The flap was then sutured with 4-0 absorbable sutures with&#xD;
      single interrupted sutures. A periodontal pack was applied over the surgical area for 10&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
