  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, two-part Phase I/Ib study of RP12146 in adult patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      or metastatic solid tumors. The first part (Part 1) is a Phase I dose-escalation, 3+3 design,&#xD;
      open-label, MTD determination study and will enroll patients who have tumors known to harbour&#xD;
      DNA repair deficiencies. The second part (Part 2) is a Phase Ib, dose-expansion at the MTD&#xD;
      (or optimal dose) and will enroll patients with a confirmed deleterious HRR mutation in their&#xD;
      tumor as identified by a central genomics testing laboratory.&#xD;
