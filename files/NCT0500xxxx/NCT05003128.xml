  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Video display terminals (VDTs) are ubiquitous, and engagement in digital screens has grown&#xD;
      substantially across all age groups worldwide. Prolonged exposure to VDTs is associated with&#xD;
      the development of various health problems. By now, it is unclear whether transient exposure&#xD;
      to VDTs leads to ocular surface changes, especially regarding lipid layer thickness (LLT).&#xD;
      This study aim to determine if short-term exposure to light-emitting diodes (LEDs) leads to&#xD;
      ocular parameter changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, cross-sectional study. Patients were recruited at the National&#xD;
      Cheng-Kung University Hospital, a tertiary referral center in southern Taiwan, for&#xD;
      examination, including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), lipid&#xD;
      layer thickness (LLT), and blink rates and patterns before and after watching an LED display&#xD;
      for 15 minutes. The estimated result is that the LLT and blink rates will decrease after VDT&#xD;
      watching.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Video display terminals (VDTs) are ubiquitous, and engagement in digital screens has grown&#xD;
      substantially across all age groups worldwide. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)&#xD;
      pandemic, lockdowns and increasing demand for digital learning and working have led to more&#xD;
      frequent and sustained VDT use. Prolonged exposure to VDTs is associated with the development&#xD;
      of various health problems, including psychosocial issues, venous thromboembolism, fatigue,&#xD;
      and visual complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer vision syndrome (CVS) is one of the most frequently encountered problems among VDT&#xD;
      users. CVS comprises several visual and musculoskeletal symptoms resulting from VDT use, such&#xD;
      as eye strain, dryness and burning sensation of the eye, blurred vision, and neck and&#xD;
      shoulder pain. A major alteration is the development of dry eye disease (DED), occurring in&#xD;
      60 % of those with CVS. Dry eye symptoms, corneal erosions, short tear-film breakup time&#xD;
      (BUT), low tear meniscus height, and meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) are all DED&#xD;
      presentations encountered by VDT users. The continuous use of VDTs is an established risk&#xD;
      factor for CVS and DED. However, it is unclear whether transient exposure to VDTs leads to&#xD;
      ocular surface changes, especially regarding lipid layer thickness (LLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigated if the short-term use of light-emitting diode (LED) displays (one&#xD;
      type of VDT) changed the ocular parameters, including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA),&#xD;
      intraocular ocular pressure (IOP), the CVS-Questionnaire (CVS-Q) score, the blink rate, the&#xD;
      partial blink ratio, and LLT. To our knowledge, this is the first study to focus on the&#xD;
      immediate effects of LEDs on the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective clinical study was conducted in the Ophthalmology Department of the National&#xD;
      Cheng Kung University Hospital (NCKUH), Tainan, Taiwan. The study was approved by the&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board of NCKUH and followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
      Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria were generally healthy individuals aged between 20 and 65 years who&#xD;
      were willing to participate in the study. The exclusion criteria were ages below 20 or over&#xD;
      65 years, a BCVA score of &lt;0.1 on the Landolt C chart in either eye, a BCVA difference of&#xD;
      &gt;0.2 between the eyes, and a history of ocular diseases or previous ocular surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were instructed to fill out a basic information form, including their name, sex,&#xD;
      age, and contact information. They were also informed to avoid wearing contact lenses for two&#xD;
      days before the test. The experiment was conducted on August 22, 2020. For the baseline test,&#xD;
      the participants were asked to complete the CVS-Q to assess their CVS. Next was a series of&#xD;
      ocular examinations, including BCVA, IOP, LLT, an optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan of&#xD;
      the macula, and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging. The LLT and blink rates were measured&#xD;
      using the LipiView II Ocular Surface Interferometer following the standard protocol&#xD;
      (TearScience, Morrisville, NC, USA). After the examination, the participants watched a short&#xD;
      movie on an LED screen (InnoLux, Taiwan) for 15 minutes in a bright room. The viewing&#xD;
      distance was approximately 1.5 meters. After the movie ended, the participants were&#xD;
      instructed to complete the CVS-Q and undergo the BCVA, IOP, and LLT tests again. The baseline&#xD;
      BCVA, IOP, OCT, and FAF images of each participant were reviewed by three NCKUH&#xD;
      ophthalmologists to screen for clinically significant ocular pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses were performed using R software version 4.1.0 (R Core Team, Vienna,&#xD;
      Austria) and SAS Enterprise Guide (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Paired&#xD;
      t-tests were used to compare the BCVA, IOP, CVS-Q score, LLT, blink rate, and the partial&#xD;
      blink ratio before and after watching the LED display. Statistical significance was set at P&#xD;
      &lt;0.05.&#xD;
