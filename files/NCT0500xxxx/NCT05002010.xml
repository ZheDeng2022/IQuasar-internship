    <textblock>
      The number of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is growing worldwide, while patients&#xD;
      with impaired renal function are at high or very high risk for developing cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD). Mortality due to CVD in patients with CKD is 1020 times higher than that in&#xD;
      the general population, and the likelihood of developing cardiovascular complications (CVC)&#xD;
      is several times higher than the risk of end-stage CKD{1} In CKD cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      abnormalities are due to volume overload, hypertension, endothelia dysfunction, inflammation,&#xD;
      uremic pericarditis cardiomyopathy, anemia, dyslipidemia and oxidativel stress{2} Left&#xD;
      ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a key feature that allows you to get an accurate picture of&#xD;
      systolic-diastolic lesions of the left heart in patients with CKD and therefore is one of the&#xD;
      most important factors in the development of adverse CVC LVH is initially formed as an&#xD;
      adaptive process aimed at maintaining normal heart function under conditions of myocardial&#xD;
      overload by pressure or volume, but then acquires the character of pathological adaptation,&#xD;
      becoming the structural basis of heart failure, myocardial ischemia and cardiac arrhythmias&#xD;
      {3}. It was shown that the probability of LVH increases already with a moderate decrease in&#xD;
      eGFR and increases further as CKD progresses, reaching a maximum in the terminal stage [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      . in CKD LVH is associated with increased mortality and the risk of adverse outcomes,&#xD;
      especially at the terminal stage of CKD{5-6}&#xD;
