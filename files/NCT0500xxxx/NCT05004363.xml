  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: CKD in patients with heart failure (HF) is common and associated with poor&#xD;
      prognosis. Despite evidence of benefit with Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone-System inhibitor&#xD;
      (RAASi) agents, they are avoided due to fear of hyperkalaemia. New potassium binders, e.g.&#xD;
      Sodium Zirconium Cyclosilicate (SZC), reduce incidence of hyperkalaemia in CKD-HF patients&#xD;
      and hence may help RAASi maximisation, which has not been investigated in an RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The proposed study will randomise HFrEF patients with stable CKD 3-5 and serum&#xD;
      potassium 5-5.0 mmol/L, to receive SZC or placebo while RAASi therapy is maximised. The aim&#xD;
      of the study is to examine if SZC is superior to placebo in achieving maximal doses of&#xD;
      ACEi/ARB, e.g. Ramipril 10 mg, Candesartan 32 mg; and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist,&#xD;
      e.g. Epleronone 50 mg or Spironolactone 50 mg, avoiding hyperkalaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Eligible patients with eGFR&lt;60 mL/min/1.73m2, heart failure (EF&lt;40%) on&#xD;
      none/submaximal dose of RAASi will be randomised to receive 10g TDS of investigational&#xD;
      medicinal product (IMP), either SZC or placebo, for 48 hours and in 10 or 5g OD guided by&#xD;
      laboratory serum potassium (K+). Every two weeks the RAASi dose will be increased and IMP&#xD;
      adjusted according to a strict protocol and guided by laboratory potassium and creatinine.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is achievement of maximal dose of RAASi in randomised&#xD;
      patients avoiding hyperkalaemia, i.e. K+≤5.6 mmol/L. Patients will be allowed to continue&#xD;
      with RAASi maximisation to K+&lt;6.0mmol/L. Patients will be tested at baseline and follow-up&#xD;
      visits for hyperkalaemia, AKI, symptomatic hypotension and QT prolongation on ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: The study results will show if SZC is superior to placebo for RAASi maximisation in&#xD;
      CKD-HF patients while maintaining safe levels of serum potassium without any adverse impact&#xD;
      on quality of life. The study will demonstrate if SZC allows higher RAASi dose and more dose&#xD;
      escalations than placebo. It will also examine the impact of RAASi escalation on creatinine,&#xD;
      proteinuria, and cardiac blood biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: If positive, the results of this study will demonstrate that SZC enables RAASi up&#xD;
      titration in CKD-HF patients, which potentially can help achieve optimal treatment and&#xD;
      improve quality of life of the patient.&#xD;

      achieve the target Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone-System-inhibitors (RAASi) dose while keeping&#xD;
      K+ &lt; 5.6. (numbers and proportion of patients in each group)&#xD;

      10 g TDS for 48 hours followed by 10 or 5 g per day&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND Chronic Kidney disease (CKD) is common in patients with heart failure, 32% in a&#xD;
      meta-analysis of 1,076,104 patients and 47% in all acute heart failure admissions in our&#xD;
      hospital. [Damman,K. 2014] These patients suffer 2.4 times higher mortality. Potentially&#xD;
      lifesaving medications for systolic heart failure are not used in patients with CKD and heart&#xD;
      failure due to risk of hyperkalaemia. These medications include Angiotensin Converting Enzyme&#xD;
      inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and mineralocorticoid receptor&#xD;
      antagonists (MRA) [Bowling 2013; Eschalier,R. 2013]. The risk of hyperkalaemia in CKD stage&#xD;
      4-5 patients on ACEi and MRA is high and potentially fatal. [Sarafidis,P.A. 2012] Hence there&#xD;
      is reluctance amongst general practitioners, general physicians and cardiologists managing&#xD;
      these patients to use medications which may increase serum potassium [Epstein,M. 2015].&#xD;
&#xD;
      St George's experience:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study of 1056 acute heart failure admissions of 851 patients at St George's Hospital&#xD;
      patients with CKD stage 4/5 and systolic heart failure were less likely to receive ACEi/ARB&#xD;
      compared to no-CKD patients (36% versus 84%; p&lt;0.001) and less likely to receive MRA (17%&#xD;
      versus 57%; p&lt;0.001) http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ehf2.12185/full [Jenkins,R.&#xD;
      2017]. These findings have led to the setting up of a kidney failure-heart failure service at&#xD;
      St George's Hospital funded by three local clinical commissioning groups to improve care for&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      St George's Hospital has an established heart failure unit and more recently a kidney&#xD;
      failure-heart failure service. Audit of all new referrals to our kidney failure-heart failure&#xD;
      clinic between March and September 2017 have shown that only 3% of all patients with left&#xD;
      ventricular systolic dysfunction was on maximum dose of ACEi/ARB, and only 2% was on maximum&#xD;
      dose of MRA. In another audit of 200 patients with CKD followed in our heart failure clinics&#xD;
      between 1 March and 5 October 2017 only 13% of patients were on maximum dose of ACEi/ARB and&#xD;
      2% on maximum dose of MRA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium Zirconium Cyclosilicate (SZC) for hyperkalaemia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that Sodium Zirconium Cyclosilicate lowers serum potassium non-CKD,&#xD;
      CKD and separately in heart failure patients [Ash,S.R. 2015; Packham,D.K. 2015; Kosiborod,M.&#xD;
      2014; Anker,S.D. 2015]. Another potassium binder has also been shown to be effective. In a&#xD;
      phase 3 randomised controlled trial of 258 patients, Sodium Zirconium Cyclosilicate lowered&#xD;
      serum potassium from 5.6 to 4.5 mmol/L in 48 hours and maintained a potassium of &lt;5.1 mmol/L&#xD;
      in 90% (as opposed to 48% of patients on placebo. Most potassium binder studies have been&#xD;
      short and none have investigated exclusively the high-risk group with CKD and heart failure,&#xD;
      particularly with an aim to maximise RAASi therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical outcome measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Achieving target level of RAASi without hyperkalaemia i.e. serum potassium of &gt;5.6 mmol/L&#xD;
      (and potassium&gt;6.0 mmol//L)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Event definition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The binary outcome is defined as reaching potassium level of &gt;5.6 mmol/L within the trial&#xD;
      period. Serum potassium will be measured by point of care and laboratory testing. For the&#xD;
      extended study the event will be defined as a potassium&gt;6.0 mmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL DESIGN We propose a pilot 1:1 randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of the potential drug aiming at lowering the potassium levels if taken&#xD;
      in conjunction with RAASi. Randomisation is stratified by the baseline RAASi dose the&#xD;
      patients are subjected to when they join the trial. All eligible patients will be randomised&#xD;
      to either oral Lokelma or equivalent placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will consist of the following phases: screening, correction phase and maintenance&#xD;
      phase. During screening, a patient's eligibility will be assessed. After the screening is&#xD;
      completed, the eligible patients will be randomized to Lokelma or Placebo and the initial&#xD;
      potassium correction phase will be initiated. This phase will use correction phase dosing as&#xD;
      per label (10 mg thrice daily) and be at most 48h long. During this period, potassium will be&#xD;
      assessed at 48 hours, and patients judged to be normokalaemic (K+ between 3.5 and 5) will be&#xD;
      transferred to the maintenance phase and initiate maintenance phase dosing regimen. After&#xD;
      48h, all patients will be transferred to maintenance phase, regardless of whether or not they&#xD;
      are found to be normokalaemic at that time point. During the maintenance phase, a titration&#xD;
      of IP will take place as shown below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel to the IP administration, a patient's ACEi/ARB and MRA treatment will be&#xD;
      initiated or, if a patient already on ACEi/ARB and MRA, intensified. For details, see Study&#xD;
      Schema and below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent Full informed consent will be obtained prior to the participant undergoing any&#xD;
      activities that are specifically for the purposes of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant's GP will be informed in writing of their participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data Baseline data will be recorded on the eCRF (web based secure system &quot;redcap&quot;)&#xD;
      and will include demographics such as age, gender, ethnicity; clinical comorbidities such as&#xD;
      diabetes, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease; cardiovascular risk factors such as&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia, BMI, smoking, family history of IHD; blood test results such as&#xD;
      haemoglobin, ferritin, urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, BNP, troponin, calcium,&#xD;
      phosphate, PTH, ECG and results of an echocardiogram. In addition, we will record pulse, BP&#xD;
      (average of 3), weight, oedema, chest crepitations, elevated Jugular Venous Pressure (JVP),&#xD;
      frailty score, QOL score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial assessments Patients will be seen every two weeks for safety checks, blood tests, drug&#xD;
      dosing and RAASi dosing. Data will be recorded on history for symptoms of heart failure,&#xD;
      breathlessness, tiredness, leg swelling; physical examination finding, weight, oedema, chest&#xD;
      crackles; blood test sodium, potassium, creatinine and drug dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of trial visit will record the same along with the QOL score. Long term follow-up&#xD;
      assessments At the end of the trial the patient's data will be collected from the EPR on&#xD;
      RAASi dose and outcome from their standard of care visits. There will be no follow up visits&#xD;
      related to the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal criteria The patient may be withdrawn from the study if they request to do so, or&#xD;
      due to safety concerns (such as a SUSAR). Each withdrawal will be replaced. Their data will&#xD;
      be collected from EPR until the end of the study. The study may need to be stopped if there&#xD;
      are multiple SUSARs; this will be discussed with the DMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Storage and analysis of clinical (biological) samples The sample will be collected and&#xD;
      serum/plasma will be saved in -80 degrees Celsius freezer in the cardiovascular research&#xD;
      institute for future biochemical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of trial The trial will end with the last visit for the last patient. The MHRA and the&#xD;
      REC will be notified within 90 days of the trial end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL TREATMENTS Lokelma or matching Placebo will be administered 10 g thrice daily for the&#xD;
      initial 48h. If normokalaemia, defined as K+ between 3.5 and 5, is reached earlier,&#xD;
      maintenance phase dosing will be initiated, starting with 5 g daily. If by the end of the&#xD;
      correction phase normokalaemia is not reached, the patient will be started on 10 g daily&#xD;
      dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the maintenance phase, the IP will be titrated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose at start of visit Serum potassium end of visit Dose change at the end of visit If on 10&#xD;
      g daily 5.0-6.0 mmol/l Continue 10 g daily 3.5-5.0 mmol/l Change to 5 g daily &lt;3.5 mmol/l&#xD;
      Stop &gt;6 mmol/l Stop and initiate rescue If on 5 g daily &gt;5.0 mmol/l Change to 10 g daily&#xD;
      3.5-5.0 mmol/l Continue 5 g daily &lt;3.5 mmol/l Stop If on 0 g daily (temporary stop) &lt;= 5&#xD;
      Continue with no IP &gt;5 Initiate 5 g daily&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug can be restarted 2 weeks after discontinuation due to hypokalaemia depending on the&#xD;
      blood result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient will remain on their baseline RAASi treatment during the first two weeks&#xD;
      post-randomization. The dose of RAASi will then be increased in a step-wise fashion as&#xD;
      mentioned above every two weeks provided there is no allergy, severe hyperkalaemia (potassium&#xD;
      &gt;6.0 mmol/L) or symptomatic hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of allergy or severe hyperkalaemia are observed, the RAASi treatment will be stopped&#xD;
      with no possibility of re-initiation. In case of symptomatic hypotension, the change in&#xD;
      dosing will be delayed. The dose changes will be allowed within 2 days of the scheduled&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other concomitant treatments and monitoring Other concomitant medications will continue.&#xD;
      During the trial period clinicians are advised to use diuretics such as furosemide for lung&#xD;
      congestion, shortness of breath and oedema in doses 40-160 mg daily (or equivalent bumetanide&#xD;
      1-4 mg), and metolazone 2.5 to 5 mg daily as clinically indicated. Patients will be&#xD;
      encouraged to monitor their own blood pressures at home.&#xD;
