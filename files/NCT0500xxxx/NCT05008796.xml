  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the 4th highest incidence of cancer and 6th&#xD;
      of cancer death of the males in Taiwan. Because the patients were mainly middle-aged male,&#xD;
      the disease eventually resulted in a huge loss of labor force, productivity and a huge burden&#xD;
      of family supports and medicinal costs. Unfortunately, the incidence and death of HNSCC&#xD;
      seemed to be increasing in Taiwan. Currently, the primary treatments of HNSCC are mainly&#xD;
      surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or targeted therapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
      Immune checkpoint inhibitors become an emerging treatment in recent days. However, how to&#xD;
      select adequate patient by using biomarkers remains an unsolved problem. Therefore,&#xD;
      investigator have developed a new method for isolation and detection of circulating tumor&#xD;
      cells (CTCs) in HNSCC patients. Moreover, the expression of immune markers (such as PD-L1,&#xD;
      PD-L2, PD-1) on CTCs or immune cells might be a good target to study. Investigator's&#xD;
      preliminary data found CTCs and circulating cancer stem-like cells but not PD-1 expression&#xD;
      levels on peripheral T cells in patients with recurrence or metastasis HNSCC did not&#xD;
      associated with overall survival. Therefore, investigators are wondering if PD-L1 more&#xD;
      specific due to it expression on cancer cells. Therefore, in the 3-year project,&#xD;
      investigators will utilize developing device and protocol in first year and then enroll 40&#xD;
      freshly diagnosed participants with head and neck cancer at stage III-IV with intent to&#xD;
      receive curative concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT), and then analyze CTCs, PD-L1&#xD;
      expression levels on CTCs. Blood sample will be taken before, during (definition: 3-6 weeks&#xD;
      after start RT) and after (definition: 4 +/-2 weeks after complete CCRT) completion of CCRT.&#xD;
      Investigators will also enroll 10 health participants and taking blood sample for 3 times and&#xD;
      follow up. Further statistical tests with clinical conditions (disease status, treatment&#xD;
      effects, progression or distant metastasis and death) will be performed to elucidate their&#xD;
      clinical significance. Hopefully, investigators will clarify the correlation between clinical&#xD;
      outcomes and expression of PD-L1 on CTCs in head and neck patients. This could be a new&#xD;
      biomarker for clinical cancer care.&#xD;
