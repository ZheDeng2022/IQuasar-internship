      This is a multicenter, open label, Phase 2 study of TJ004309 in combination with atezolizumab&#xD;
      in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This clinical study includes two&#xD;
      cohorts: Cohort 1 will include Immuno-Oncology (IO) treatment naïve ovarian cancer (OC)&#xD;
      patients who have progressed on or after platinum therapy; and Cohort 2 will include patients&#xD;
      with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancer (GC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), or ovarian carcinoma (OC)&#xD;
      with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%. Additional cohorts for selected tumor types might be added later.&#xD;
