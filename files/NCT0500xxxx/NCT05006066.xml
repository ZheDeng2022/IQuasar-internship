  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temporal summation is a mechanism that enhances pain perception. It is a natural mechanism&#xD;
      present in most individuals. Generally, temporal summation is measured by the application of&#xD;
      a moderately painful stimulation for several seconds.However, there is still no official&#xD;
      recommendation in the literature. There is therefore a great disparity in the protocols. Some&#xD;
      studies apply thermal stimulation (heating the skin) while others apply mechanical&#xD;
      stimulation (applying pressure). Another point of contention is that some studies apply&#xD;
      continuous stimulation for 2 minutes while others apply a series of several small stimulation&#xD;
      of 1 second). Between these studies, the amplitude of temporal summation varies according to&#xD;
      the stimulation performed. Note also that the study population is also very different between&#xD;
      studies. In these conditions, it remains difficult to know the impact of the nature of the&#xD;
      stimulation on the measured amplitude of the temporal summation.&#xD;

      Objective: To determine the effect of the nature and frequency of the stimulation used to&#xD;
      measure one of the physiological mechanisms of pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In order to meet the objective, 34 pain-free participants will be recruited (17&#xD;
      females and 17 males) between the ages of 18 and 30 years. A single visit will be proposed&#xD;
      (approximately 1 h). Each participant will be stimulated with 4 stimulation conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  continuous thermal (1 stimulation of two minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  repetitive thermal (30 stimulations of 1 second)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  continuous mechanical (1 stimulation of two minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  repetitive mechanical (30 stimulation of 1 second) In order to control certain&#xD;
           psychological parameters, questionnaires measuring anxiety, depression and fear of pain&#xD;
           will be administered. This will allow the investigation team to perform subgroup&#xD;
           analyses if necessary. A repeated measures analysis of variance will be performed to&#xD;
           meet the objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Results: The objective of this project is to determine the impact of different&#xD;
      stimuli on the measurement of a pain mechanism. In this sense, the results will be important&#xD;
      since they will allow to develop recommendations to optimize the measurement of this&#xD;
      mechanism.&#xD;
