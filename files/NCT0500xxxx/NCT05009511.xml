  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to examine the influence of feedback timing on learning and&#xD;
      brain function in individuals with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), with and&#xD;
      without depression.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the proposed project is to investigate brain mechanisms during&#xD;
      learning in individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) with and without clinical&#xD;
      depression. Such knowledge can help guide rehabilitation strategies and reduce the burden of&#xD;
      TBI. Feedback about the accuracy of one's actions can improve learning by informing an&#xD;
      individual whether his/her action is correct or not. Individuals with depression have been&#xD;
      shown to have learning deficits and altered brain activity during learning compared to&#xD;
      healthy individuals when feedback is presented immediately. Impaired learning through&#xD;
      immediate feedback has also been observed in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. However, PD&#xD;
      patients are able to learn from feedback when it is presented after a delay, engaging&#xD;
      separate neural mechanisms. Individuals with TBI have also been shown to have learning&#xD;
      deficits that are likely exacerbated by depressive symptoms. However, there is no evidence&#xD;
      directly examining the neural mechanisms of learning in individuals with TBI with and without&#xD;
      depression. The proposed research explores this distinction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The elucidation of the neural mechanisms associated with learning in individuals with TBI&#xD;
      with and without clinical depression will inform 1) scientific knowledge about the effect of&#xD;
      depression on the injured brain, 2) TBI interventions about the effectiveness of feedback and&#xD;
      its timing, and 3) interventions for other clinical populations that require rehabilitation&#xD;
      and have high occurrence of depression. These objectives lie at the heart of the mission of&#xD;
      the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke as they will broaden &quot;fundamental&#xD;
      knowledge about the brain and nervous system&quot; associated with learning in TBI and the&#xD;
      knowledge gained from fulfilling the above objectives will &quot;reduce the burden&quot; of learning&#xD;
      deficits after TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test these hypotheses, participants will be recruited based on structured clinical&#xD;
      interview performed by the team member trained in psychiatric interviewing. Qualified&#xD;
      participants will perform an experiment during which they will first study word pairs outside&#xD;
      of the functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Then, in the scanner, participants will&#xD;
      see word pairs again in a multiple-choice format and will have to choose a match for each&#xD;
      word. After participants make their choice, feedback will be presented either immediately or&#xD;
      after a delay of 25 minutes. The experiment will end with the Test phase, which takes place&#xD;
      outside of the scanner, where participants will be presented with the words in the&#xD;
      multiple-choice format again so the influence of each feedback type on learning can be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that depressed individuals with and without TBI will learn better&#xD;
      from delayed compared to immediate feedback, because learning through delayed feedback relies&#xD;
      on a different neural mechanism, which is not affected by depression and TBI, compared to&#xD;
      learning through immediate feedback. Non-depressed individuals without TBI and clinically&#xD;
      depressed individuals without TBI will also be recruited to delineate the influences of&#xD;
      depression from the impact of TBI on the brain.&#xD;
