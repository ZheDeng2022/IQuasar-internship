  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress, anxiety, distress and depression are exceptionally high among healthcare workers at&#xD;
      the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors underlying distress and resilience are&#xD;
      unknown and there are no evidence based interventions to impact the mental wellbeing of&#xD;
      frontline healthcare workers. This study will evaluate a novel virtual reality platform to&#xD;
      gather the &quot;distress experience&quot; of frontline healthcare workers at Unity Health Toronto in&#xD;
      real time during the ongoing COVID pandemic by developing and showing feasibility of digital&#xD;
      technology (Virtual Reality (VR) and mobile app) as a digital platform to understand the&#xD;
      causes and ultimately reduce the moral distress of healthcare providers during the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic. The project will develop innovations which can be used for future pandemics and&#xD;
      other contexts prone to producing moral distress and injury.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Users will go through a VR experiment before and after a brief interventional informative video describing moral distress. The VR experiment is a simulation that will lead the participant through a stressful experience about moral distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Before, during, and after the experiment, active and physiological data will be collected from the participant to monitor their level of acute distress and health, respectively. Following the experiment, active and passive data will be collected on each user through the investigators' mobile platform (DiiG) for longitudinal monitoring of moral distress and injury.</intervention_model_description>
