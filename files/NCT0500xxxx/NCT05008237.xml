      Cisplatin plus weekly docetaxel as first-line chemotherapy in metastatic salivary gland&#xD;
      cancer patients : a multicenter phase II study&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preclinically, paclitaxel and docetaxel have demonstrated activity against salivary gland&#xD;
      cancers1. Phase II trial of single-agent paclitaxel2, conducted by Eastern Cooperative&#xD;
      Oncology Group in 45 patients with advanced SGC. Eight partial responses were observed among&#xD;
      the 31 patients with mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) or adenocarcinoma, but no responses were&#xD;
      identified in the 14 patients with ACC. Based on its impressive anti-tumor activity in&#xD;
      patients with head and neck cancer, especially in squamous cell carcinoma, Ragusa et al.3&#xD;
      evaluated the activity of docetaxel in 4 patients with high grade MEC of the major salivary&#xD;
      glands. The treatment was well tolerated, and there was complete response in two and partial&#xD;
      response in the other two patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, myelosuppression is one of the serious concerns with every 3 week schedule of&#xD;
      docetaxel administration, especially in older patients. Alternatively, a weekly dosing of&#xD;
      docetaxel has been reported to reduce toxicity and Investigator previously reported weekly&#xD;
      docetaxel and cisplatin chemotherapy in recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer&#xD;
      demonstrated high response rate with modest toxicities4. So Investigator planned this phase&#xD;
      II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cisplatin plus weekly docetaxel in patients&#xD;
      with metastatic salivary gland cancer.&#xD;
