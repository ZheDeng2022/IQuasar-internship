      The purpose of this study is to explorethe brain excitability in patients undergoing heart&#xD;
      valve replacement surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and the correlation with postoperative&#xD;
      delirium&#xD;

      Delirium is the most common surgical patients postoperative complications of brain&#xD;
      dysfunction. Delirium is a kind of consciousness attention and cognitive function changes of&#xD;
      acute brain dysfunction, with volatility and reversibility of postoperative delirium (POD),&#xD;
      increased hospital costs and length of hospital stay and mortality rate, and can lower the&#xD;
      quality of life, lead to long-term postoperative cognitive dysfunction and dementia. The&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in patients undergoing cardiac valve&#xD;
      replacement under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) can be as high as 44-53%. However, since the&#xD;
      specific mechanism of POD is still not clear, there is still a lack of effective prevention&#xD;
      and treatment measures. Therefore, early detection and identification are helpful for the&#xD;
      early treatment of POD.When brain injury occurs, the levels of excitatory neurotransmitters&#xD;
      (glutamate and aspartate) will rise in a short period of time, and the high concentration of&#xD;
      glutamate causes excessive intracellular calcium flow, causing cellular calcium overload, and&#xD;
      generating excitatory cytotoxic effects. And abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) is a kind of&#xD;
      due to brain excitability/inhibitory amino acid imbalance caused by brain excitability&#xD;
      increased result in abnormal discharge mode, can affect cognitive awareness and activities.&#xD;
      Increased brain excitability is harmful to the potential, should avoid to happen. At present,&#xD;
      the relationship between brain excitability and POD is still in exploring. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      important to clarify the correlation between brain excitability and POD in patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac valve replacement under CPB for improving the pathogenesis of POD.&#xD;
