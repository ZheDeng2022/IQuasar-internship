  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, interventional, single arm, multicenter, phase 4 study to evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy and safety of initiating Insulin glargine U300 in insulin-naive patients or&#xD;
      switching from any other basal insulin to Insulin glargine U300 in insulin pre-treated&#xD;
      patients with uncontrolled T2DM.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maximum study duration per participant will be approximately 37 weeks per patient: up to 1&#xD;
      week screening period, 24 weeks insulin glargine U300 treatment period and 12 weeks&#xD;
      observational extension period.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Adult patients (age≥18 years) who diagnosed with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who should initiate Insulin glargine U300 treatment following local label and&#xD;
             guideline at investigator's discretion, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  insulin naive patients (no current or previous insulin used during the last year&#xD;
                  prior to screening except for a maximum 10 days in relation to acute illness or&#xD;
                  surgery, etc.) uncontrolled (HbA1c between 7.5% and 11.0%) at screening visit on&#xD;
                  stable dose treatment with ≤ 2 OADs (metformin, sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione,&#xD;
                  DPP-4 inhibitor, SGLT-2 inhibitor, glinide, α-glucosidase inhibitor) within 8&#xD;
                  weeks prior to screening, at least one of which must be on maximum tolerated&#xD;
                  dose, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  patients uncontrolled (HbA1c between 7.5% and 11.0%) at screening visit with&#xD;
                  other basal insulin, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  patients controlled with other basal insulin but experienced frequent&#xD;
                  hypoglycemia or with increased hypoglycemia risk at investigator's discretion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who treated with basal insulin must have a stable dose of antidiabetic drugs&#xD;
             (dose change no more than ±20% vs. the dose on screening visit for basal insulin)&#xD;
             within 8 weeks prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically significant abnormality identified on physical examination, laboratory&#xD;
             tests, or vital signs at the time of screening, or at baseline, or any major systemic&#xD;
             disease resulting in short life expectancy that in the opinion of the Investigator&#xD;
             would restrict or limit the patient's successful participation for the duration of the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any product containing short or rapid acting insulin in the last 3 months prior&#xD;
             to screening (unless used for ≤10 days in relation to hospitalization or an acute&#xD;
             illness)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of oral anti-diabetic drugs other than those allowed and listed in the inclusion&#xD;
             criteria, Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, or any investigational&#xD;
             agent (drug, biologic, device) within 3 months prior to screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of systemic glucocorticoids (excluding topical application or inhaled forms) for&#xD;
             two weeks or more within 8 weeks prior to the time of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity / intolerance to insulin glargine or any of its excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential with no effective contraceptive method&#xD;
