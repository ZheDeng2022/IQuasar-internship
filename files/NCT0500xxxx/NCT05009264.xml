    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine if osteopathic manipulative treatment is as&#xD;
      effective to traditional lidocaine injection technique in treating myofascial trigger points&#xD;
      in regard to post intervention pain intensity and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myofascial pain syndrome is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders seen in the&#xD;
      aging US population. Its characterized by myofascial trigger points (MTPs) which were defined&#xD;
      as hyperirritable nodules in a taut band of skeletal muscle, associated with pain on manual&#xD;
      stretching, contraction, or stimulation of the muscle. Trigger points are further classified&#xD;
      into active and latent based on their clinical features. Active MTPs are characterized by&#xD;
      spontaneous pain at rest with referred pain on palpation whereas latent MTPs produce pain on&#xD;
      palpation in addition to restriction of range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are a variety of treatment options for MTPs including lidocaine injections,&#xD;
      dry needling, osteopathic manipulative treatment, massage therapy, ultrasound therapy etc.&#xD;
      There has been a lot of research investigating the safety and efficacy of dry needling and&#xD;
      lidocaine trigger point injection techniques in treating MTPs. It was found that dry needling&#xD;
      and lidocaine injections were both equally effective in reducing symptoms associated with&#xD;
      MTPs as it was the mechanical disruption of the taut fibers due to the needle effect and the&#xD;
      depth of adequate penetration that resulted in pain reduction more than the substance&#xD;
      actually delivered into the muscle. Some authors also suggested the importance of a local&#xD;
      twitch response (LTR); which is an observable contraction of the taut part of muscle band&#xD;
      upon stimulation, during dry needling technique as being pertinent for maximum effectiveness.&#xD;
      However, a recent systemic review found that LTR during dry needling treatment was&#xD;
      unnecessary and not required for management of myofascial pain syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, there has been fewer research investigating the effects of manual&#xD;
      treatment on trigger points. Reasearchers had initially treated trigger points with ischemic&#xD;
      compression but later changed their recommendation to applying gentle digital pressure to&#xD;
      trigger points. A recent study done on traction-compression-stretch technique (TTCE) compared&#xD;
      with ischemic compression showed some, albeit minor, increased outcome measures (pain&#xD;
      pressure threshold) warranting clinical investigation. Another study compared active release&#xD;
      and muscle energy techniques in treating latent trigger points of the upper trapezius and&#xD;
      found that both techniques were equally effective in increasing cervical range of motion and&#xD;
      decreasing pain and upper trapezius thickness. Other studies have also shown interest in&#xD;
      similar osteopathic manipulative techniques such as counterstrain, myofascial release,&#xD;
      facilitated positional release and high velocity-low amplitude thrust techniques in treating&#xD;
      trigger points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have showed that the upper trapezius is one of the most common muscles affected by&#xD;
      myofascial pain syndrome leading to referred pain manifesting as headaches and stiff neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no consensus as to which treatment method is superior, with the decision&#xD;
      to treat in a certain way largely based upon the training received by the individual&#xD;
      physician rather than the characteristics of the trigger point itself. There are no studies&#xD;
      to date evaluating the efficacy of the various treatment options specifically osteopathic&#xD;
      manipulative treatment vs. trigger point injections. Thus, the intention of the present study&#xD;
      is to determine the efficacy rates of muscle energy techniques vs. lidocaine injections in&#xD;
      treating MTPs in the upper trapezius region.&#xD;
