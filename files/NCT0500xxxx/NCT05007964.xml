      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the function of the adjustment procedure with the&#xD;
      Spatz4 in subjects with a BMI ≥ 27.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 66 eligible subjects will undergo endoscopy and those without endoscopic&#xD;
      contraindications will be implanted with the Spatz4 balloon. All subjects will follow a&#xD;
      calorie restricted diet designed by the dietician. An up adjustment will be performed at 16&#xD;
      weeks (±2 weeks). The subjects will be followed for 2 weeks after the up adjustment&#xD;
      procedure, after which the study ends. Subjects will be given the option to continue the&#xD;
      implantation period until 52 weeks.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the function of the adjustment procedure with the&#xD;
      Spatz4 in subjects with a BMI ≥ 27.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be studied in an open label multi-center center study that will have one&#xD;
      endpoint at 20 weeks. Up to 66 eligible subjects will undergo endoscopy and those without&#xD;
      endoscopic contraindications will be implanted with the Spatz4 balloon. All subjects will&#xD;
      follow a calorie restricted diet designed by the dietician. The initial diet will be liquid&#xD;
      and will be advanced as per the dietician's recommendations. Changes in diet will depend on&#xD;
      subject tolerance to the balloon and specific food intolerances and will be adjusted&#xD;
      frequently by the dietician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial balloon volume will be 450 to 550 ml of 0.9% normal saline with 2 ml of a 1%&#xD;
      solution of methylene blue. It is estimated, based on clinical studies, that approximately&#xD;
      10% of subjects will be intolerant in the first month and will require a down adjustment,&#xD;
      wherein 150 ml of fluid will be removed from the balloon. An up adjustment will be performed&#xD;
      at 16 weeks (±2 weeks) with the addition of 200-300 ml of 0.9% normal saline. The balloon&#xD;
      adjustment procedure is done with an endoscopy procedure under the same sedation as the&#xD;
      implantation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be followed for 2 weeks after the up adjustment procedure, after which the&#xD;
      study ends. Subjects will be given the option to continue the implantation period until 52&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
