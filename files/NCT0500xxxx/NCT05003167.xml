    <textblock>
      A tele-health treatment study for individuals with early stage ALS with the aim to improve&#xD;
      communication, cough response, and respiratory strength. All participants complete a&#xD;
      respiratory strength training program using an Expiratory Muscle Strength Training (EMST 150)&#xD;
      device from the comfort of their homes for 6 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are looking for people with early stage ALS to participate in a completely&#xD;
      tele-health (no in-person visits required) treatment study examining the effects of an&#xD;
      Expiratory Muscle Strength Training device (EMST-150) on communication, cough, and&#xD;
      respiratory strength. Participants will be required to attend 2 virtual baseline assessment&#xD;
      sessions followed by 12 additional virtual training sessions (2 per week for 6 weeks).&#xD;
      Participants should plan to be actively enrolled in the study for ~10 weeks (3 weeks of&#xD;
      baseline monitoring followed by 6 weeks of training). Participants will also be required to&#xD;
      fill out a series of questionnaires assessing the EMST's effectiveness via tele-health.&#xD;
