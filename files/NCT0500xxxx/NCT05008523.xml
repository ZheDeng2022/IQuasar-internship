  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overdose deaths are currently the largest cause of accidental death in the US and&#xD;
      opioid-related overdose deaths constitute the overwhelming majority of these deaths. Demands&#xD;
      for a knowledge-base for effective law enforcement interventions is growing. This proposed&#xD;
      study is designed to provide a knowledge base regarding key obstacles and facilitators of the&#xD;
      willingness and preparedness of police to administer naloxone and related risk reduction&#xD;
      practices and evaluate the efficacy of a web-based opioid-related occupational safety and&#xD;
      risk reduction curriculum. Findings from this study will be applied to the development and&#xD;
      implementation of effective interventions for police officers aimed at harmonizing law&#xD;
      enforcement practices with public health goals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This application proposes to contribute to the harmonization of law enforcement practices and&#xD;
      public health goals to combat rising morbidity and mortality rates associated with&#xD;
      opioid-related overdose (OD). Police departments around the U.S. are increasingly making the&#xD;
      OD reversal drug, naloxone, available to their officers. This intervention has the potential&#xD;
      to greatly improve emergency response after an OD. The proportion of precincts mandating that&#xD;
      officers carry naloxone remains small, however, and barriers remain that make adoption of&#xD;
      these first-responder programs problematic. Lawsuits from police unions contesting naloxone-&#xD;
      related mandates and occupational safety concerns, including the potential for needle stick&#xD;
      injuries (HIV/HCV risk) and incidental contact with fentanyl-class substances, constitute&#xD;
      barriers, as do stigma and concerns about legal jeopardy. The study team proposes to equip&#xD;
      police with best-practices for minimizing workplace harms related to encounters with&#xD;
      PWUO/PWID and the legal and practical knowledge to respond confidently to an OD without fear&#xD;
      of legal jeopardy as well as reduce health risks to PWUOs and PWIDs associated with law&#xD;
      enforcement. More than 10,000 law enforcement officers in Pennsylvania (roughly one third of&#xD;
      all PA officers) have already received naloxone and OD response training from&#xD;
      GetNaloxoneNow.org (GNN), a web-based intervention. With the support of county departments of&#xD;
      health, harm reduction agencies, law enforcement, and district attorneys, the team proposes&#xD;
      to adapt extant interventions for police to create an online training module aimed at&#xD;
      reducing barriers to police engagement in OD response. Using a mixed-method design, organized&#xD;
      around a pragmatic trial design, the study will achieve the following objectives:1) Adapt an&#xD;
      occupational risk reduction (ORR) curriculum to add to a web-based OD response and naloxone&#xD;
      training platform (GNN); 2) Describe naloxone use patterns, OD response experiences, and&#xD;
      attitudes related to illicit opioid use among a sample (N = 300) of police officers in PA&#xD;
      trained via the GNN platform; 3) Evaluate the relative effectiveness of ORR + GNN, compared&#xD;
      with GNN-only, with respect to the following outcomes: a) rates of carrying naloxone while&#xD;
      on/off-duty; b) rates of OD response in which naloxone is/isn't administered; c) numbers of&#xD;
      referrals to treatment; d) numbers of syringes confiscated; and e) rates of information&#xD;
      sharing with OD survivors and others. Mediators and moderators of efficacy will also be&#xD;
      analyzed. 4) Document the range of psychosocial mechanisms underlying participant OD response&#xD;
      engagement post-intervention. This study aims to remove barriers to life-saving police&#xD;
      engagement with PWUO/PWID by focusing both on the safety of law enforcement and&#xD;
      evidence-based and best-practices for working with persons at risk of an opioid OD. The study&#xD;
      also will provide empirical evaluation of the diffusion of naloxone-based response among law&#xD;
      enforcement.&#xD;
