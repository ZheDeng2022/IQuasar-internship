  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Veteran suicide death is a national crisis. Risk factors include emotion dysregulation, which&#xD;
      occurs across mental health disorders. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is an&#xD;
      evidence-based suicide intervention that targets emotion dysregulation but is&#xD;
      resource-intensive and not widely available at VHA. A more efficient evidence-based DBT&#xD;
      Skills Group (DBT-SG) is associated with reduced suicidal ideation and emotion dysregulation&#xD;
      and likely more feasible to implement at VHA. This is a randomized controlled trial to test&#xD;
      whether DBT-SG in addition to VHA treatment-as-usual, compared to only VHA&#xD;
      treatment-as-usual, reduces Veteran suicide attempt.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a randomized controlled trial at four VHA medical centers. Veterans will be&#xD;
      randomized to VHA treatment-as-usual or VHA treatment-as-usual plus DBT-SG.&#xD;

    <description>The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale is a widely used interview measure of suicide risk. The number of suicide attempts during 18month follow-up will be reported (range 0 to infinity), with a higher score indicating more suicide attempts.</description>

    <description>Emotion dysregulation will be assessed with the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, a self-report measure. The scale ranges 36-180 with a higher score indicating greater difficulties in emotion regulation.</description>
