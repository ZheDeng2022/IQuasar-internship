  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thoracolumbar (TL) burst fractures are seen in all ages and usually associated with&#xD;
      high-energy trauma. Treatment include both surgical and non-surgical options. In cases&#xD;
      without neurological deficit or definite rupture of the posterior ligament complex (PLC) both&#xD;
      surgical treatment and non-surgical treatment are considered standard of care. This study&#xD;
      aims to compare outcome between surgical and non-surgical in patients with a single level TL&#xD;
      burst fracture (AO A3/4) in a register-based randomized controlled trial (R-RCT).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a nationwide, multicenter, register-based randomized controlled trial. 202&#xD;
      patients with a single level TL burst fracture will be enrolled in the study by way of the&#xD;
      Swedish Fracture Register. They will be randomized 1:1 to either surgery with posterior&#xD;
      fixation or non-surgical treatment. The study is pragmatical in its approach, i.e., the&#xD;
      treating physician can decide on details of the surgical treatment as well as details of the&#xD;
      non-surgical treatment. In non-surgically treated patients brace treatment is not required,&#xD;
      but a hyperextension brace may be offered. The subjects will be followed with patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes, clinical assessments, and radiological assessments. Data will be collected&#xD;
      from other national registers to compare sick leave, medical complications, pharmaceutical&#xD;
      prescriptions and overall costs for each treatment.&#xD;

             cauda equina injury&#xD;

          -  Definite rupture of the posterior tension band (through bony and/or ligamentous&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients not deemed suitable due to severe co-morbidities. (E.g., established&#xD;
             osteoporosis that would impair the possibility to maintain integrity of spinal&#xD;
             implants, pathological fractures, severe cardiac or pulmonary compromise, or other&#xD;
