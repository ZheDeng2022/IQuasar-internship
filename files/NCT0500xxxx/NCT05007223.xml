  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Hailey-Hailey disease is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a genetic defect in a&#xD;
      calcium ATPase (ATP2C1) leading to a defect in keratinocyte adhesion. The characteristic of&#xD;
      this disease is the involvement of intertriginous areas of the skin, which are the moist&#xD;
      sites including the axillary vault and the inguinal crease. The composition of microbial&#xD;
      communities is primarily dependent on the physiology of the skin site and the moist sites&#xD;
      have distinct compositions of skin microorganisms. In addition, treatment with doxycycline is&#xD;
      often helpful in the management of Hailey-Hailey disease. These findings suggest a role of&#xD;
      the skin microbiome in the pathogenesis of Hailey-Hailey disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the skin microbiome in patients with&#xD;
      Hailey-Hailey disease by the 16S method, to better understand the pathogenesis of the disease&#xD;
      and to discover new therapeutic targets in the future.&#xD;

      Investigators will look at patients with Hailey-Hailey disease, and healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will look at skin microbiome (Bacterial diversity and the relative abundance of&#xD;
      major bacterial taxa) Investigators will assess this in patients with Hailey-Hailey disease&#xD;
      before and after doxycycline and compare them to healthy controls.&#xD;

Change in the relative abundance of major bacterial taxa of skin microbiome before and after the treatment of doxycycline in those with Hailey-Hailey disease&#xD;
The representative Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) sequences were assigned to a taxonomy at a confidence threshold of 50% using remote desktop protocol classifier with reference to the Greengenes database. Relative abundance of OTUs based on all unique sequences was measured.</description>
