  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Body weight can be affected by the content of fat and carbohydrate in the diet. On average,&#xD;
      people will lose a modest (&lt; 5 kg) amount of weight when switched from a high fat diet to a&#xD;
      low fat, high carbohydrate diet. Determining mechanisms whereby changing the makeup of the&#xD;
      diet can change one's body weight will be important in understanding why body weight in the&#xD;
      US population is trending upward recently and what health care providers can recommend to&#xD;
      reverse this trend. Previous studies have shown that increasing the carbohydrate and lowering&#xD;
      the fat content in the diet leads to a change in the appearance of the hormone leptin in the&#xD;
      blood over 24 hours. Leptin is an important signal from the fat cell to the brain that leads&#xD;
      to a reduction in appetite and weight loss. A previous study found that after keeping&#xD;
      people's weight stable, that the greater rise in leptin over the day on a low fat-high&#xD;
      carbohydrate diet compared to a high fat diet predicted the reduction in calories they ate&#xD;
      over a subsequent 12 weeks when their weight was allowed to freely fluctuate. Recent studies&#xD;
      have also provided evidence that limiting fat and increasing the amount of protein in the&#xD;
      diet also leads to modest weight loss. It is therefore proposed to test whether low fat, high&#xD;
      protein diets also result a change in leptin secretion, and if this change predicts a&#xD;
      reduction in appetite when they are allowed to eat freely.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The role of leptin in regulating body fat mass in humans is incompletely understood. Although&#xD;
      complete loss of leptin signaling results in morbid obesity, there is an inconsistent&#xD;
      association between more subtle changes in leptin levels and changes in body composition.&#xD;
      Administration of recombinant leptin to human volunteers also results in a variable loss of&#xD;
      fat mass. Therapeutic high carbohydrate diets generally lead to decreased caloric intake and&#xD;
      weight loss compared with high fat diets. The mechanism of this decrease in appetite is,&#xD;
      however, unknown. In preliminary data, the invesigators have shown that compared to high fat&#xD;
      feeding, isocaloric high carbohydrate feeding over 2 weeks leads to increased leptin&#xD;
      excursion during 24 hours. In addition, this change in leptin signaling predicts subsequent&#xD;
      reduction in daily caloric intake with ad-lib high carbohydrate feeding. It has recently been&#xD;
      reported that an increase in dietary protein also leads to modest spontaneous weight loss in&#xD;
      ad-lib feeding subjects. The current proposal is to therefore determine whether prolonged&#xD;
      high protein feeding leads to a sustained increase in the integrated daily leptin level and&#xD;
      whether this increase predicts a subsequent decrease in caloric intake in human volunteers.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will consume a control protein diet (15%, low protein) followed by a high&#xD;
      protein diet (30% protein) for 2 weeks each while maintaining weight stability. At the end of&#xD;
      each 2-week feeding phase, subjects will be admitted to the inpatient GCRC for frequent&#xD;
      sampling for insulin and leptin levels over 24 hours. Immediately following the second CRC&#xD;
      inpatient visit, subjects will continue to consume the high protein diet ad-libitum for&#xD;
      another 12 weeks, during which time they will be followed for changes in their caloric intake&#xD;
      and body weight. Because of limitations in metabolic kitchen resources, if this study were to&#xD;
      be conducted solely at OHSU, it would require recruitment and study of two groups of subjects&#xD;
      over sequential time periods. This results in delay of acquisition of data, completion of the&#xD;
      study, and the potential introduction of seasonal variation as a study confounder. Therefore,&#xD;
      a two-site study is proposed utilizing the metabolic kitchen resources of OHSU and the&#xD;
      University of Washington GCRC's jointly. Instead of two groups of subjects being recruited&#xD;
      and studied sequentially at one site, subjects will be recruited at both sites and studied in&#xD;
      parallel, thus allowing the completion of the protocol in half the usual amount of time and&#xD;
      without additional study confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that switching human volunteers from a 15% protein diet to an isocaloric&#xD;
      high (30%) protein diet will cause a significant increase in the area under the diurnal&#xD;
      plasma leptin versus time curve (AUC-leptin) and the insulin versus time curve (AUC-insulin),&#xD;
      that these increases will be sustained over 2 weeks of isocaloric high protein feeding, and&#xD;
      that the elevation in AUC-leptin will predict the extent to which caloric intake decreases&#xD;
      when subjects are switched from an isocaloric to an ad libitum high protein diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine whether an isocaloric increase in dietary protein content from&#xD;
      15% to 30% causes a significant increase in AUC-leptin and AUC-insulin that is sustained for&#xD;
      two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine whether the increase in AUC-leptin on a 30% protein diet&#xD;
      predicts a subsequent decrease in ad libitum caloric intake and weight loss.&#xD;
