      The objective of this data-collection study is to retrospectively evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      clinical performance of the Portico transthoracic aortic valve for Valve-in-Valve treatment&#xD;
      of a failed aortic surgical bioprosthetic valve in patients who are considered at increased&#xD;
      surgical risk for a redo surgical aortic valve replacement.&#xD;

        Study may enroll up to 100 patients who had a documented failed surgical aortic&#xD;
        bioprosthetic valve (due stenosis, insufficiency, or a combination of both) at increased&#xD;
        risk for redo surgical aortic valve replacement surgery. Patients must have met the sizing&#xD;
        requirements of the Portico transthoracic aortic valve sizing specification (≥19 mm and ≤27&#xD;
        mm). Patients must meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, an exploratory registry arm will collect data for patients that were treated&#xD;
        for a failed surgical bioprosthetic aortic valve true inner diameter size of &lt;19 mm or &gt;27&#xD;
        mm. There will be no enrollment limit in the exploratory registry arm&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject had a degenerated surgical aortic bioprosthetic valve with severe aortic&#xD;
             stenosis, severe regurgitation, or a combination of at least moderate stenosis with at&#xD;
             least moderate regurgitation per EAPCI-ESC-EACTS standardized criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Surgical bioprosthesis true inner diameter (true ID) was ≥ 19 mm and ≤ 27 mm and was&#xD;
             confirmed by either CT or confirmed by the Valve in Valve Aortic App. Refer to the PCR&#xD;
             website&#xD;
             https://www.pcronline.com/PCR-Publications/PCR-mobile-apps/Valve-in-Valve-Aortic-app&#xD;
             Note: if CT was contraindicated and/or not possible to be obtained, a transesophageal&#xD;
             echocardiogram (TEE) will be accepted for sizing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior to Portico ViV procedure, the patient was deemed at increased risk for surgery&#xD;
             to replace the surgical aortic bioprosthetic valve.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject provided written informed consent prior to performing data collection for&#xD;
             study specific visits. For patients that are deceased at the time of enrollment, all&#xD;
             institutional/local legal and regulatory requirements for consent must be met prior to&#xD;
             enrollment and data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject is ≥ 18 years of age or legal age in host country at the time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Prior to the Portico ViV index procedure, the subject had New York Heart Association&#xD;
             (NYHA) class II, III, or IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject had a minimum vessel diameter of 6.0 mm for Portico™ delivery system access or&#xD;
             a minimum of 5.0 mm for the FlexNav™ delivery system.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject had the Portico or FlexNav delivery system enter their vasculature&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject had evidence of an acute MI, percutaneous intervention, or a peripheral&#xD;
             intervention ≤30 days prior to Portico ViV index procedure (MI defined as: ST Segment&#xD;
             Elevation as evidenced on 12 Lead ECG).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject had uncontrolled blood dyscrasias defined as: leukopenia (WBC&lt;3,000 mm3),&#xD;
             acute anemia (Hb &lt;9 g/dL), or thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;50,000 cells/mm³).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject was considered hemodynamically unstable at the time of the ViV procedure&#xD;
             (requiring inotropic support or mechanical heart assistance)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject had severe ventricular dysfunction with left ventricular ejection fraction&#xD;
             (LVEF) &lt;20% as measured by resting echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject had imaging evidence of intracardiac mass, thrombus or vegetation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject had an active peptic ulcer or has/had upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding ≤3&#xD;
             months prior to ViV index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject had a documented history of a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or a transient&#xD;
             ischemic attack (TIA) ≤6 months prior to index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject had renal insufficiency (serum creatinine &gt;3.0 mg/dL (265.5μmol/L)) and/or end&#xD;
             stage renal disease requiring chronic dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject had active bacterial endocarditis or ongoing sepsis ≤ 6 months prior to the&#xD;
             index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Surgical aortic bioprosthetic valve was unstable or rocking.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject had a vascular condition (i.e. stenosis, tortuosity, or severe calcification)&#xD;
             that made insertion and endovascular access to the aortic valve impossible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject was unable to tolerate antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy&#xD;
