      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melanoma mortality remains almost stable with a 0.2-1.5% increase annually despite rapid&#xD;
      growth in reported melanoma incidence of 2.5-8.6% per year. Part of this discrepancy could be&#xD;
      explained by overdiagnosis of melanoma, which may be as high as 54%. Histopathology is&#xD;
      considered the gold standard diagnosis for melanocytic lesions despite only a moderately good&#xD;
      intra- and inter-rater reliability. A possible explanation of why the inter-rater reliability&#xD;
      is suboptimal could be that pathologists are inexperienced, extra cautious, or lack&#xD;
      sufficient information needed for a reliable diagnosis.It has been hypothesized that the&#xD;
      horizontal overview of a lesion through dermoscopy combined with clinical information on a&#xD;
      given tumor, enables the generation of a tentative diagnosis that the pathologists can use to&#xD;
      actively search for signs of pathology. Former research shows that clinicians' competence in&#xD;
      dermoscopy can be improved by a short learning intervention, but that these skills aren't&#xD;
      sustainable&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to examine how acquired basic skills in dermoscopy of pigmented&#xD;
      lesions and access to clinical images of a lesion, affect pathologists' confidence, accuracy&#xD;
      and inter-rater reliability when interpreting melanocytic lesions.&#xD;

      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparative phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case database&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lesion data will be collected from patients during the period between 02.11.2020 and&#xD;
      22.01.2021 at the Department of Plastic Surgery, Herlev Hospital. Requirements for&#xD;
      eligibility are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is referred through the clinical cancer pathways for melanoma The lesion is&#xD;
      excised upon evaluation by the plastic surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An internal investigation has shown that approximately ⅓ of all melanocytic lesions referred&#xD;
      in the clinical cancer pathway are melanomas (in situ and invasive).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive oral and written information about the project and be asked to sign a&#xD;
      consent form before participation. Participation will not affect the treatment, diagnostics,&#xD;
      or follow-up of included patients. Upon consent the following information will be collected&#xD;
      for each lesion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical image Dermoscopic image Patients´ CPR-number (personal ID-number) Gender and age of&#xD;
      the patient Location of skin tumor (3D avatar) Medical history (congenital nevi, pregnant&#xD;
      patient, how long has it been present, appearance change, symptoms, former melanoma, family&#xD;
      history of melanoma, sun exposure within the last six months) As soon as the lesions have&#xD;
      been prepared for pathological examination, a representative slide (including pathognomic&#xD;
      features) for each skin lesion will be chosen by an experienced dermatopathologist. This&#xD;
      slide will subsequently be digitized and coupled to the remaining information (dermoscopic&#xD;
      and clinical image, tumor location, gender, age, lesion information, etc.). Thereafter the&#xD;
      CPR number is deleted, rendering the case anonymous. Each case will be stored in a database&#xD;
      under a random anonymous ID number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Web-based IT-platform&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to maximize patient participation and the number of pathologists that can be&#xD;
      included in the study, the investigators will develop an IT platform for the trial. The&#xD;
      platform will enable the following features:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sign-in Automated randomization Login Case presentation Diagnosis of cases Tracking&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IT platform:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic options will be based on the standardized MPATH-Dx formula (participants will&#xD;
      be introduced to this before participation) used in former studies on inter-rater&#xD;
      reliability. Subsequent to diagnosing the lesion, participating pathologists will rate their&#xD;
      confidence in the chosen diagnosis on a 5-step Likert scale. Participants will be grouped by&#xD;
      department or affiliation center in order to enable post-hoc cluster analyses and continuous&#xD;
      status reports during the study. The tracking feature will enable search pattern analysis&#xD;
      including time per diagnosis and percentage of time spent looking at the histology slide and&#xD;
      dermoscopy photo. Saliency heat maps will be developed that enable visualization of&#xD;
      &quot;classical&quot; search patterns (both global and feature specific) in both study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Executive phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General pathologists and dermatopathologists from Denmark, Australia and other countries will&#xD;
      be enrolled between 1.09.2021 and 1.10.2021. All participants will be sent an email informing&#xD;
      them about the trial and the handling of their data before signing a digital consent. Upon&#xD;
      inclusion each enrolled pathologist will be asked to fill out a digital sign-in form with the&#xD;
      following variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Name E-mail address (including verification) Age Gender Subspecialization (general&#xD;
      pathologist or dermatopathologist) Number of years interpreting skin lesions Caseload from&#xD;
      melanocytic lesions per month Percentage of caseload from melanocytic lesions Number of&#xD;
      second opinion assessments per month Number of second opinion referrals per month Former&#xD;
      training in dermoscopy (yes/no) Perceived relevance of dermoscopic images during&#xD;
      histopathological evaluation on a 5-step Likert scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the sign-in, all participants will be asked to answer a dermoscopy test consisting&#xD;
      of 20 formerly validated test items. Then they will be automatically stratified by level of&#xD;
      dermatopathological experience and randomized (allocation ratio 1:1) to either the&#xD;
      intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group will receive immediate&#xD;
      access to a previously developed digital (tablet or smartphone) educational platform in&#xD;
      dermoscopy of melanocytic lesions and then answer the dermoscopy test again, before&#xD;
      diagnosing the lesions in this study. Participants in the control group will not be given&#xD;
      access to the learning intervention but will diagnose the lesions from this study immediately&#xD;
      after sign up and dermoscopy test. Each participant will be asked to assess a minimum of 50&#xD;
      cases within 14 days, preferably all 200 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accuracy will be measured as the number of correct answers divided by the total number of&#xD;
      answers. Consensus agreement among pathologists with a caseload of more than 60 melanocytic&#xD;
      lesions per month and at least 10 years of experience will be used as the gold standard.&#xD;
      Inter-rater reliability will be measured using generalizability theory that allows&#xD;
      calculations in nested and unbalanced designs. Mean time spent per diagnosis and diagnostic&#xD;
      confidence during 1st evaluation will be compared between the study groups using independent&#xD;
      t-tests. A post hoc ANOVA will compare time spent per diagnosis and confidence of&#xD;
      pathologists grouped by time spent training in dermoscopy.&#xD;
