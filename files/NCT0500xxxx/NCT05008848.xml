    <textblock>
      This phase III trial compares the effect of text-based cessation intervention to a manual in&#xD;
      helping rural cancer patients who smoke, quit. Text-based scheduled gradual reduction may&#xD;
      reduce the frequency of cigarette use to zero and may be effective in quitting smoking.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of an eight-week text-based scheduled gradual reduction (SGR)&#xD;
      intervention (a personalized eight-week reduction schedule paired with National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute's [NCI's] Smokefree.TXT) compared to a control intervention (NCI Clearing the Air&#xD;
      Cessation Booklet) on biochemically-validated smoking cessation six-month post-quit date in&#xD;
      rural cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare the efficacy of the eight-week text-based SGR intervention and a control&#xD;
      intervention on Linear Analog Self-Assessment (LASA)-6 overall quality of life (QOL) at&#xD;
      30-days post-quit date and six-months post-quit date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients participate in schedule gradual reduction program over 8 weeks to reduce&#xD;
      the frequency of cigarette use. Patients also receive cessation support messages via text&#xD;
      messages for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients receive NCI's Clearing the Air booklet to help plan to gradually quit&#xD;
      smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 6 months.&#xD;

    <description>Response will be defined as (1) urine cotinine levels &lt; 50 ng/ml or (2) urine cotinine levels &gt;=50 ng/ml and an urine anabasine level &lt; 2 ng/ml if a patient self-reports vaping use or the use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Patients who do not return at 6 months post-quit date for the cotinine assessment (and anabasine, if applicable) will be deemed non-responders. The analysis population is defined as all randomized and eligible patients. The primary evaluation of the primary outcome will be the covariate-adjusted intervention effect (adjusted odds ratio) obtained from a multiple logistic regression model adjusted for the three stratification factors baseline daily cigarette consumption, age, and sex as well as the potential confounding variables cancer diagnosis, cancer type, receipt of chemotherapy, receipt of radiation therapy, and active treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serially measured overall quality of life (QoL) scores obtained at baseline and at 30-days and 6-months post-quite date</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6-months post-quit date</time_frame>
    <description>At a given measurement time point, the patient-reported overall QoL score will be obtained from a linear analogue self-assessment scale (LASA), which is an 11-point scoring scale (0, 1, â€¦, 10) where 0 indicates as bad as can be and 10 indicates as good as can be. A linear mixed model will be used to compare the average difference between the randomized arms across the two post-randomization time points after adjusting for the baseline overall QoL score, the three stratification factors baseline daily cigarette consumption, age, and sex as well as the potential confounding variables cancer diagnosis, cancer type, receipt of chemotherapy, receipt of radiation therapy, and active treatment.</description>
