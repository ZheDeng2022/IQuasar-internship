  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Pregnancy and childbirth are factors that affect a woman's pelvic floor. Pelvic&#xD;
      floor disorders (PFD) often occur in the perinatal period. Symptoms and difficulties related&#xD;
      to urinary continence and/or pelvic organ prolapse significantly affect daily activities,&#xD;
      including physical activity, but also the quality of life and sexual activity. Patient&#xD;
      education that includes both the anatomy and function of the pelvic floor, as well as&#xD;
      information on the prevention of PFD during pregnancy and postpartum is an important part of&#xD;
      the prevention of these dysfunctions. Diastasis recti abdominis (DRA) is another common&#xD;
      musculoskeletal issue related to pregnancy and postpartum period. In addition to the cosmetic&#xD;
      consequences, it can be associated with abdominal pain, the occurrence of pelvic floor&#xD;
      dysfunction and a negative correlation with the image of a woman's own body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods: Primiparous women after vaginal delivery will be invited to this study.&#xD;
      The study will consist of three stages. First phase (baseline measurements) will take place&#xD;
      at the hospital and the following assessments will be performed: pelvic floor muscle&#xD;
      palpation examination (PERFECT scheme, OXFORD scale, Reissing scale), palpation and&#xD;
      ultrasound examination of diastasis recti abdominis. After 12-16 weeks postpartum&#xD;
      participants will complete questionnaires about pelvic floor dysfunctions and diastasis recti&#xD;
      and their impact on quality of life. Third part, 12-16 weeks postpartum, the pelvic floor&#xD;
      muscle examination, palpation and ultrasound examination of diastasis recti abdominis will be&#xD;
      repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the function of the pelvic floor muscles,&#xD;
      prevalence of pelvic floor dysfunctions and diastasis recti abdominis in the primiparous&#xD;
      women postpartum. Our secondary objective will be investigation if there are any prognostics&#xD;
      factors during the early postpartum period, that can indicate higher risk of PFD and/or DRA 3&#xD;
      months postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: Results of this study will inform about prevalence of pelvic floor&#xD;
      dysfunctions and diastasis recti in primiparous women in Poland. Additionally, we hope to&#xD;
      obtain predictors suggesting pelvic floor or abdominal muscles dysfunction 3 months&#xD;
      postpartum. Prevention of pelvic floor disorders may contribute to the early identification&#xD;
      of problems and reduce cost of treatment of unrecognized dysfunction. To our knowledge this&#xD;
      will be the first study in this area conducted in Poland.&#xD;
