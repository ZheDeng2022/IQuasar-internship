    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the effect of Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) Transcranial&#xD;
      Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) in decreasing distress and cannabis use. 46 participants&#xD;
      with Relapse Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS), Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) and elevated&#xD;
      distress (K10 score of 10-35) will be recruited.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>K10 is a 10-item questionnaire intended to yield a global measure of distress based on questions about anxiety and depressive symptoms that a person has experienced in the most recent 4 week period. Each question is given a score between 1 (none of the time) to 5 (all of the time). The total score ranges from 10 to 50. People with scores &lt; 20 are likely to be well, 20-24 are likely to have a mild mental disorder, 25-29 are likely to have moderate mental disorder, and &gt; 30 are likely to have a severe mental disorder.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS-SF) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>PANAS-SF consists of 20 affects (e.g., interested, distressed, excited, upset, etc.). The participant indicates the extent he/she has felt the specific affect over the past week on scale of 1 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely). The total score ranges from 1-100; the higher the score, the more negative affects felt.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Marijuana Craving Questionnaire (MCQ-17) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>MCQ is a standardized measure assessing marijuana craving. Each statement is scored on a 7 point likert scale of 1 (strongly disagree) and 7 (strongly agree).&#xD;
There is no total range for scoring because each individual question is assessed separately.&#xD;
Questions 1-7 measure compulsivity. Questions 8-11 measure emotionality. Questions 12-15 measure expectations. Questions 16-17 measure purposefulness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cannabis Withdrawal Scale (CWS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The version of CWS used in the study asks about symptoms experienced over the last 24 hours and consists of 19 statements. For each statement, its negative impact on normal daily activities is rated on a likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely). The total score ranges from 0 to 190; higher scores indicate that symptoms are having a larger negative impact on normal daily activities.</description>
