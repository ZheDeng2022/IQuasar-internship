      A Phase 1, Randomized, First-in-human, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Safety and&#xD;
      Immunogenicity of eOD-GT8 60mer mRNA Vaccine (mRNA-1644) and Core-g28v2 60mer mRNA Vaccine&#xD;
      (mRNA-1644v2-Core) in HIV-1 Uninfected Adults in Good General Health. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      sequential vaccination by a germline-targeting prime followed by directional boost immunogens&#xD;
      can induce specific classes of B-cell responses and guide their early maturation toward&#xD;
      broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) development through an mRNA platform. Fifty-six&#xD;
      participants. Adults 18 to 50 years of age who meet all protocol inclusion criteria, who do&#xD;
      not meet any protocol exclusion criteria, who understand the study (as demonstrated by the&#xD;
      Assessment of [Informed Consent] Understanding [AOU]), and who can provide written informed&#xD;
      consent. Randomization allocation is 16:16:16:8 for Groups 1-4 respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no blinding in this study. Site and study staff will not be blinded to the IP.&#xD;
