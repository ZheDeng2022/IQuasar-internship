  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a global epidemic, and is an important cardio-metabolic risk factor associated&#xD;
      with many non-communicable diseases, such as coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes and&#xD;
      non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) (1-6). In 2010, our team recruited a cohort of&#xD;
      obese adolescents [mean age at baseline: 17.2 years, mean body mass index (BMI): 30.9 kg/m2]&#xD;
      from school surveys (7). Our group has examined the impact of dietary intervention using low&#xD;
      glycemic index (GI) diet to reduce body weight of adolescents. We have reported that&#xD;
      participants in the low GI group had a significantly greater reduction in obesity indices&#xD;
      namely waist circumference after 6 months of intervention compared to counterparts in usual&#xD;
      diet counselling group. We recently conducted a phone interview of the participants and most,&#xD;
      if not all, of them remained obese from self-reported body weight. Pharmacological treatment&#xD;
      options for obese individuals are limited (8-10). Amassing evidence showed that the gut&#xD;
      microbiota plays an important role in energy harvesting and lipid metabolism. Gut microbiota&#xD;
      dysbiosis was repeatedly reported in patients with obesity (11-13). Studies in humanized&#xD;
      mouse models suggest that the obese gut microbiota was more efficient in harvesting energy&#xD;
      from diet and may be a causative factor in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders, including&#xD;
      obesity, type 2 diabetes and NAFLD (14). Therefore, modulation of microbiota might be a&#xD;
      potential strategy for prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders. Microbial-based&#xD;
      therapeutics such as probiotics, prebiotics, symbiotic or fecal microbiota transplantation&#xD;
      have shown promising effect in improving host metabolic health (15, 16). Prebiotics&#xD;
      consumption changes the composition of gut microbiota, alters levels of satietogenic gut&#xD;
      peptides, decreases systemic inflammation, and improves insulin sensitivity and glucose&#xD;
      tolerance (17). Supplementation of probiotics in overweight and obese individuals with&#xD;
      probiotics reduces body weight and obesity indices (16, 18, 19). The use of probiotics also&#xD;
      reduces intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (20)&#xD;
      and improves post-prandial glucose control in subjects with type 2 diabetes (21). G-NiiB®, a&#xD;
      patent-protected microbiome immunity formula, composed of naturally occurring food-grade&#xD;
      bacteria approved by health authorities, has been developed by a group of CUHK&#xD;
      gastroenterology experts.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a 24-week randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled study on the effect of&#xD;
      G-NiiB®, CU Medicine Immunity Microbiome Formula, on young obese individuals who exited from&#xD;
      a randomized controlled interventional trial with dietary intervention with low GI diet for&#xD;
      12-month that was conducted in 2010 (NCT no. 01278563). This study protocol complies with the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki and ICH-GCP guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 281 obese adolescents who participated in the randomized controlled interventional trial&#xD;
           with low GI index diet&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Willingness to give written consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects who are allergic to any ingredients listed in G-NiiB®, microbiome immunity&#xD;
           formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects with any condition that the investigator deems as a sound reason (e.g. active&#xD;
           gastrointestinal diseases and malignancies) for disqualification from enrollment into&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements, including body weight and height, waist and hip circumferences,&#xD;
      percentage body fat by bioimpedance (23).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires to document 1) demographic data including past medical and history, birth&#xD;
      weight, 2) 3-day diet record using locally validated questionnaires (24) and 3) physical&#xD;
      activity level/log sheet (IPAQ) ; 4) change of eating behavior and quality of life by eating&#xD;
      disorders examinations (EDE) and 36-item short form survey (SF-36).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacist to record past and present medication history, including prescribed drugs,&#xD;
      over-the-counter drugs and supplements, especially, 1) Subjects who have received&#xD;
      antibiotics, antifungal, antiparasitic, or antiviral treatment within 12 weeks prior to study&#xD;
      entry; 2) Subjects who plan to use antibiotic, antifungal, antiparasitic, or antiviral&#xD;
      treatment during the study; 3) Subjects using proton pump inhibitor; 4) Present use of&#xD;
      probiotics/nutritional supplements e.g., the use of replacement doses of Vitamin D, calcium&#xD;
      supplements, and multi-vitamin tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an overnight fast of 8-10 hours, baseline blood tests will be sampled including plasma&#xD;
      glucose, insulin, complete blood picture, renal and liver function tests, thyroid function&#xD;
      test, lipid profiles, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (25). Additional 15ml of&#xD;
      blood will be collected for PBMC isolation (22). Spot urine for albumin-creatinine ratio will&#xD;
      be collected for detection of microalbuminuria (26). Various indexes of insulin resistance&#xD;
      (HOMA-IR) and pancreatic beta-cell function (HOMA-beta) will be calculated from the&#xD;
      homeostasis model assessment (27). Insulin secretion will be calculated from plasma glucose&#xD;
      and insulin during various time points of OGTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver assessment by transient elastography (Fibroscan®), in which controlled attenuation&#xD;
      parameter (CAP) will be used to detect liver steatosis while liver stiffness measurement&#xD;
      (LSM) will be used to assess liver fibrosis (28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound scan for mesenteric fat, fatty liver and carotid intimal medial thickness will be&#xD;
      performed (29, 30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool for gut microbiota will be sampled. Blood for genetic studies (5ml), plasma (350 µL)&#xD;
      and urine (500 µL) for metabolomics investigations will also be stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At randomization visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to either intervention or control arms in 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
      Allocation will be performed using block randomization with varying block sizes to maintain a&#xD;
      good balance of subjects between the two arms and optimize allocation concealment throughout&#xD;
      the subject recruitment period. A random sequence of grouping identifiers (I=intervention or&#xD;
      C=control), based on computer-generated random codes will be prepared in advance by a&#xD;
      statistician who is independent to arm allocation. The allocation sequence list will be&#xD;
      password-protected and stored in a computer, and only be accessible to staff who is for arm&#xD;
      allocation. The arm allocation of each participant will be assigned sequentially according to&#xD;
      his/her sequence of enrolment and the corresponding group identifier in the prior prepared&#xD;
      random sequence list. The research staff responsible for data collection will be blinded to&#xD;
      the arm allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be dispensed a 12-week supply of double-blinded study intervention or&#xD;
      placebo products. Each participant will be given an administration log to record the daily&#xD;
      intake of G-NiiB® or its placebo-control. Patient will be counselled to take one packet of&#xD;
      the dispensed product once daily and record the time of ingestion and any adverse reactions&#xD;
      in the logbook daily for a total of 24 weeks. Patient will be advised to take photo of the&#xD;
      administration logbook within first week of enrollment into this study to ensure the log&#xD;
      entry has been filled accurately. Patient will receive monthly phone calls from a pharmacist&#xD;
      to ensure compliance of study product administration (31).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At interim study visit (at 12-week) All participants will be dispensed a 12-week supply of&#xD;
      double-blinded study intervention or placebo products. Administration logbook will be checked&#xD;
      by research staff. Adherence will be documented to compare the good adherence group and bad&#xD;
      adherence group for the efficacy of the product provided. Good adherence is defined as&#xD;
      missing not more than one daily dose of the product provided, while poor adherence is defined&#xD;
      as missing two or daily dose of the product provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements, including body weight and height, waist and hip circumferences,&#xD;
      percentage body fat by bioimpedance (23).&#xD;
