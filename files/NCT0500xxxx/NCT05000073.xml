  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The report of the Epidemiological and Information Network in Nephrology counted 44,978&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients in France in 2017, with more than 93% of them attending 3 sessions per&#xD;
      week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-weekly recourse to the healthcare system in the context of substitution treatment&#xD;
      constantly reminds patients of their disease and has a strong impact on their quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2011 REIN quality of life report showed that the quality of life of patients with renal&#xD;
      failure, particularly dialysis patients, is impaired, particularly in its physical and mental&#xD;
      components. A recent comparative study (van Sandwijk et al., 2019) comparing hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients with hematological cancer patients under chemotherapy supports these data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The June 2013 report of the &quot;Etats généraux du rein&quot;, an initiative of patient associations,&#xD;
      called for the improvement of quality of life to be made a priority and for the possibility&#xD;
      of using supportive care and complementary non-drug techniques to be proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socio-aesthetic care, defined &quot;as the practice of aesthetic care for people who are suffering&#xD;
      or vulnerable&quot;, has found its place in hospitals as a complementary discipline to medical&#xD;
      care, particularly in oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that in order to improve the overall quality of life of hemodialysis patients, the&#xD;
      quality of the experience of each session must be improved. In this perspective, the&#xD;
      repetition of socio-aesthetic care performed during dialysis sessions could contribute to the&#xD;
      overall improvement of the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A national survey (Saghatchian et al., 2018) on the impact of socio-aesthetic care in&#xD;
      oncology confirms the positive perception of this care among cancer patients. Two studies&#xD;
      carried out in hemodialysis (Bullen et al., 2018; Unal &amp; Balci Akpinar, 2016) using&#xD;
      complementary techniques, such as acupuncture, massage, or foot reflexology, highlight an&#xD;
      impact on sleep, fatigue and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experience of implementing socio-aesthetic care in our hemodialysis unit also leads us to&#xD;
      believe that they positively influence the perception of the session, and therefore perhaps&#xD;
      the quality of life measured with a validated scale, the KDQOL (Kidney Disease Quality Of&#xD;
      Life).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research therefore focuses on the effectiveness of social and aesthetic care during&#xD;
      hemodialysis sessions to improve the quality of life of the hemodialysis patient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have been conducted on the overall quality of life of hemodialysis patients, but&#xD;
      our original approach is to hypothesize that the course of each dialysis session, taken&#xD;
      individually, can influence the overall quality of life of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the repetition of socio-aesthetic care as supportive care during the&#xD;
      dialysis session would be a non-drug means to improve the quality of life of hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients and to improve the experience of the dialysis session, the overall satisfaction of&#xD;
      the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized open clinical trial, monocentric, with two parallel arms, comparing a&#xD;
      social and esthetic care procedure performed during a session by two certified aesthetics at&#xD;
      the usual treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population for this study will be individuals suffering from chronic renal failure&#xD;
      who have been undergoing hemodialysis in the Reims University Hospital for at least one month&#xD;
      and who will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental group with socio-aesthetic care: choice of the type of care (facial&#xD;
           modeling, hand modeling or manicure) by the patient at the rate of one session per week&#xD;
           for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control unit with standard support&#xD;
&#xD;
      we use several validated scales:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of the quality of life with the KDQOL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of anxiety and depression with the HADS anxiety and HADS depression scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analogous visual evaluation of overall satisfaction with the session&#xD;
