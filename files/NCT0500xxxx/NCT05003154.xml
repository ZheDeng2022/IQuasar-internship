  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) can lead to adverse perinatal and long-term outcomes, and&#xD;
      it is so important to manage this disease in pregnancy. Digitalized managements have been&#xD;
      proved economical and effective in some chronic diseases like type II diabetes mellitus. The&#xD;
      purpose of the current study was to develop and evaluate a digitalized mode for GDM&#xD;
      management using mobile healthcare and some wearable devices. Subjects were randomly divided&#xD;
      into a conventional management group and combined digitalized management group after&#xD;
      diagnosed with GDM during 24-28 weeks of gestation. The conventional mangement group received&#xD;
      conventional GDM management and could freely use the mobile healthcare application. The&#xD;
      mobile management group received digitalized healthcare services from artificial intelligence&#xD;
      under the supervision of obstetricians, in addition to conventional management. The&#xD;
      effectiveness of digitalized management were evaluated mainly through the result values of&#xD;
      the labotatory tests related to blood glucose controlling and perinatal outcomes.&#xD;

The pivotal AI are based on clinical experience from obstetricians, therapeutic principle from official Guidelines and abundant data in previous work, and it will works under strict supervision.</description>
