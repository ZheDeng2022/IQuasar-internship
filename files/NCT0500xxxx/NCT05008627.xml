      PERSONAL PROTECTION EQUIPMENT AND SARS-CoV-2 CONTAMINATION: An observational quality control&#xD;
      study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs through common routes, aerosols and medical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal protective equipment (PPE) reduces the risk of contamination. The risk of&#xD;
      contamination of skin and clothing may be particularly high during removal PPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ministry of Health (MOH) of Israel adapted the technique of using a supervisor that&#xD;
      monitors during removal of the PPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study to examine the using the pre-established protocol, where a staff member&#xD;
      removing the PPE according supervision by a staff monitor in comparison with removing the PPE&#xD;
      without being instructed neither supervised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Protocol provided by MOH is in accordance with the recommendations of the Centers for&#xD;
      Disease Control United States (CDC), was presented to all staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population will include 35 participants: 7 nurses, 7 clinician physicians, 7 cleaning&#xD;
      personal, 7 X-rays technicians and 7 physiotherapists, will performed this quality control&#xD;
      observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trail processes of doffing the PPE will be performed twice, first in the present of a&#xD;
      trained supervisor and verbal instructions and once again independently in the absence of&#xD;
      supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After donning the routine uniform with a new PPE, then the subject will be asked to transfer&#xD;
      to an area were the participant's' PPE will be &quot;contaminated&quot; (in the same areas in all&#xD;
      participants: over the thorax, shoulders, arms, hands legs and Face Shield) using a brush&#xD;
      tool, with the 'Glo' Germ Solution that simulates contamination with a virus on the PPE. The&#xD;
      'Glo' Germ Solution is a non toxic, odorless gel, which glows brightly in the dark when&#xD;
      exposed to ultraviolet light to simulate contamination with the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To proceed, the participant will be asked to move a step aside to another area. There the&#xD;
      participant will remove the PPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the removal of the PPE the participant will be examined in a dark plot in order to&#xD;
      detect a probably contamination traces with the 'Glo' Germ solution that will be illuminated&#xD;
      under the ultraviolet UV light.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will repeat the procedure from the beginning, following all stages only in&#xD;
      this second time without following the supervisor verbal instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both trails, after the PPE removal, Ultraviolet Lamp will be used in order to check if the&#xD;
      participant had been contaminated in any part of the body or cloth with the 'Glo' Germ&#xD;
      Solution&#xD;

      PERSONAL PROTECTION EQUIPMENT AND SARS-CoV-2 CONTAMINATION: An observational quality control&#xD;
      study Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) occurs through common routes such&#xD;
      as direct transmission, contact transmission and airborne transmissions as aerosols and&#xD;
      during medical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal protective equipment (PPE) reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of skin and&#xD;
      clothing contamination with a virus among health care personnel. High-risk exposures, such as&#xD;
      prolonged exposure, handling contaminated body fluids, and failure to correctly use PPE,&#xD;
      increases the risk of contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of inadvertent contamination of skin and clothing may be particularly high during&#xD;
      removal of contaminated PPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was presented that during PPE removal, the subject, especially the dorsum of his hands,&#xD;
      were contaminated and virus was transferred to the palms hands and clothing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operating protocols recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have&#xD;
      been associated with less frequent hand and clothing contamination compared with no&#xD;
      standardized methods, suggesting that the use of the appropriate technique can reduce&#xD;
      contamination. Another potential measure to reduce contamination during PPE removal is in the&#xD;
      present of a trained supervisor monitoring each step of the removal process, as has been&#xD;
      recommended when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola virus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ministry of Health (MOH) of Israel adapted the technique of using a supervisor to guide&#xD;
      the medical personal that work in the Covid Unit during donning and doffing the PPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A quality controlled observational study will be performed to examine if using visual&#xD;
      vigilance control and verbal oral instructions to remove the contaminated PPE, in an&#xD;
      appropriate technique, that prevents or reduces contamination during the procedure, in&#xD;
      comparison with performing the removal of the PPE independently without visual control and&#xD;
      verbal instructions by in the absence of supervisor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study to examine the using the pre-established protocol, where a staff member&#xD;
      removing the PPE according to the visual supervision by a staff monitor and follows the&#xD;
      instructions carefully, in comparison with the removing the PPE without being instructed&#xD;
      neither supervised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study received the approval of the Bnai-Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel, Ethic&#xD;
      Committee No 0059-21-BNZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis A 1% of contamination will be considered as an acceptable level and 10%&#xD;
      of contamination as a non-acceptable level. To detect such deviation from the acceptable&#xD;
      level in a Z-test on the proportion of contamination with 95% power and one-sided Î± of 0.05,&#xD;
      34 participants be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods Before opening of the Corona Unit at the Hospital, the Infected Disease&#xD;
      Department provided educational sessions for personnel from long term care facility. The&#xD;
      session included 15 minutes video presentation and practicing of PPE donning and doffing&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol provided by the MOH according with CDC recommendations was presented to all&#xD;
      staff. A poster highlighting the instructions was displayed throughout the Corona Unit. Based&#xD;
      on national recommendations, a checklist including 10 instructions (See Appendix 1) were&#xD;
      compiled, it contained items to assess the processes of doffing of the PPE with the necessary&#xD;
      work steps such as the required of hand disinfection. The Protocol includes additional&#xD;
      measures to reduce contamination, during PPE removal. A trained supervisor was observing and&#xD;
      giving verbal indication of each step of the removal process. This strategy was used during&#xD;
      Ebola epidemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present simulation study will be conducted in the Simulation Unit of the Anesthesiology&#xD;
      Department in Bnai Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population will include 35 participants: 7 nurses, 7 clinician physicians, 7 cleaning&#xD;
      personal, 7 X-Ray technicians and 7 physiotherapists, will performed this quality control&#xD;
      observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trail processes of donning the PPE will be performed twice, first with the present of a&#xD;
      trained supervisor and verbal instructions and once again independently in the absence of&#xD;
      supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiment will be conducted in 3 areas, namely, area A (clean zone), area B (preparation&#xD;
      zone), and area C (test zone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Area A, a clean zone where subjects will donn their clean isolation gown or apron by&#xD;
      themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After putting on over the routine uniform a new PPE (Cobes Industries Co Ltd, Hefei, China)&#xD;
      gown or apron, NP95 Mask and a face shield, the subject then will be asked to transfer to&#xD;
      area B, there participant's' PPE will be &quot;contaminated&quot; in the same areas in all&#xD;
      participants: over the thorax, shoulders, arms, hands legs and Face Shield using a brush&#xD;
      tool, with the Glo Germ Solution (Glo Germ Lotion, Glo Germ, Moab, Utah, USA) that simulates&#xD;
      contamination with a virus on the PPE. The Glo Germ Solution is a non toxic, odorless gel,&#xD;
      which glows brightly in the dark when exposed to ultraviolet light to simulate contamination&#xD;
      with the virus, including transfer to skin, clothing, and environmental surfaces during PPE&#xD;
      removal. (www.amazon.com/Glo Germ-Powder solution).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To proceed, the participant will be asked to move a step aside to area C. There the&#xD;
      participant will remove the PPE, boats, the apron, mask NP95 and face shield according the&#xD;
      pre-established Protocol under an oral indications by the research staff following the 10&#xD;
      guidance instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contaminated PPE equipment will be discarded in a dumpster. After the removal of the PPE&#xD;
      the participant will be examined in a dark plot in order to detect a probably contamination&#xD;
      traces with the Glo Germ solution that will be illuminated under the ultraviolet UV light.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will repeat the procedure, following all stages only in the second time&#xD;
      without the following the supervisor verbal instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both trails, after the PPE removal, Ultraviolet Lamp will be used in order to check if the&#xD;
      participant had been contaminated in any part of the body or cloth with the Glo Germ&#xD;
      Solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the procedures will be recorded with a I-Phone 8 camera during all the time of the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
