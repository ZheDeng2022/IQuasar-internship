  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common malignant tumor of the hematological system,&#xD;
      accounting for 10% of all hematological malignancies. With the emergence of new drugs such as&#xD;
      proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulators, the efficacy of MM has been significantly&#xD;
      improved, and the progression-free survival rate and overall survival rate of patients have&#xD;
      been significantly improved. However, due to primary or secondary drug resistance, MM is&#xD;
      still incurable , and patients will eventually be relapsed and refractory. At present, most&#xD;
      first-line treatments contain proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulators at the same time,&#xD;
      and patients are often resistant to these two types of drugs. CD38 monoclonal antibody is a&#xD;
      new drug that was launched two years ago, but the price is too high, roughly 500,000 yuan a&#xD;
      year, and most patients cannot afford it. At present, new drugs available to patients in&#xD;
      China is still very limited, and investigator urgently need to find new treatment options&#xD;
      among the existing drugs in China to prolong the lives of patients. Bendamustine is an&#xD;
      alkylating agent and is currently mainly used in the treatment of lymphoma in China. But in&#xD;
      Europe, bendamustine has been approved as a MM drug. The NCCN guidelines also include&#xD;
      bendamustine + proteasome inhibitors or immunomodulators + hormones as the recommended&#xD;
      treatment for MM. Because most of the patients with relapse and refractory MM have been&#xD;
      resistant to proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulators, investigator found that the NCCN&#xD;
      guidelines recommended schemes are not effective when used in these patients. Therefore,&#xD;
      investigator tried to combine bendamustine with liposomes and dexamethasone (BAd) to treat&#xD;
      relapsed and refractory MM. At present, 3 patients have been treated with this program, all&#xD;
      of which are multi-line recurrences. Among them, 1 patient achieved complete response (CR)&#xD;
      after 2 courses of treatment. At present, 6 courses of treatment have been completed and have&#xD;
      been in CR state. The other 2 cases achieved partial response, and the total response rate&#xD;
      reached 100%. The common adverse reaction in patients was hematological toxicity, but they&#xD;
      were all tolerated. No patient stopped the drug due to adverse reactions. The price of&#xD;
      bendamustine per course of treatment is roughly between 6000-8000 yuan, which patients can&#xD;
      basically afford. Therefore, the program is feasible in terms of effectiveness, economy and&#xD;
      safety. Due to the small number of patients, investigator need to further expand the number&#xD;
      of samples to observe the optimal dose, efficacy and adverse reactions of the drug. If the&#xD;
      program is validated and feasible, it will benefit more patients, extend their lives as much&#xD;
      as possible, and have the opportunity to wait for other new drugs to come out.&#xD;
