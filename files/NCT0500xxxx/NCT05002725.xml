  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neck of femur (NOF) fracture is a common presentation to the emergency department,&#xD;
      particularly in our older population. NOF fracture is associated with a high social and&#xD;
      economic cost with significant effects on patients' quality of life. Analgesia and ambulation&#xD;
      are important determinants of outcome following NOF surgery. We propose to compare whether&#xD;
      PENG or Femoral Nerve Block is associated with a greater degree of quadriceps motor&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;

      Neck of femur (NOF) fracture is a common presentation to the emergency department,&#xD;
      particularly in our older population.1.NOF fracture is associated with a high social and&#xD;
      economic cost with significant effects on patients' quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      The latest Irish Hip Fracture Database (IHFD) report from 2019 detailed 3,701 NOF fractures&#xD;
      in patients over 60 years of age in Ireland and 437 of these patients attended CUH.2 This&#xD;
      frail and vulnerable group had an average age of 81 and many people suffered numerous&#xD;
      co-morbid conditions. 3 This population of patients is therefore at significant risk of&#xD;
      complications and require multidisciplinary input to optimise clinical outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a patient's perspective, NOF fracture is a very painful condition, requiring early&#xD;
      surgical fixation. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In 2019, 5% of&#xD;
      patients who sustained a hip fracture in Ireland died, an additional 4% of patients required&#xD;
      new admission to a nursing home following this fracture and a further 13% required&#xD;
      convalescent care3&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients are also particularly at risk for under-treatment of pain. Contraindications&#xD;
      to many commonly used analgesics such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) exist&#xD;
      in this population, including renal dysfunction in 40%5. Older adults suffer more adverse&#xD;
      effects from opiate analgesia such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness and&#xD;
      respiratory complications. This population also have a 25% incidence of cognitive impairment&#xD;
      which may make communication and assessment of their pain more challenging. 1, 3&#xD;
      Under-treated pain also confers a 9 fold increased risk of delirium in cognitively intact&#xD;
      patients14&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral nerve blocks (PNB) have been extensively researched in this group of patients with&#xD;
      a view to improving the quality of pain relief while reducing the side effects of analgesic&#xD;
      medications used. In 2017, a Cochrane review on PNB in the management of patients with NOF&#xD;
      fractures concluded that there was high quality evidence that PNB reduces pain on movement&#xD;
      within 30 minutes after block placement and reduces opioid consumption and moderate quality&#xD;
      evidence that PNB reduces the incidence of pneumonia, time to first mobilization and cost. 6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Widespread use of PNB on admission to hospital and in the early postoperative period is also&#xD;
      supported by the latest Association of Anaesthetists' (AoA) guideline: &quot;Guideline for the&#xD;
      management of hip fractures 2020&quot;. In this, they recommend using femoral or fascia iliaca&#xD;
      blocks as pericapsular nerve group (PENG) blocks have not yet been compared with these more&#xD;
      established blocks in trials. They also recommend that general anaesthesia or spinal&#xD;
      anaesthesia should be routinely supplemented with PNB and state that there is little evidence&#xD;
      at present for continuous catheter techniques which may delay remobilisation5&#xD;
&#xD;
      Issues with current practice:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Often patients with NOF fractures endure significant pain during their hospitalisation. The&#xD;
      proportion of patients receiving PNB varies nationally from 10-95% depending on hospital. The&#xD;
      AoA recommend that PNB should be undertaken in the Emergency department and at the time of&#xD;
      surgery provided 6 hours have passed.5 Under-treated pain has been demonstrated to increase&#xD;
      the risk of delirium in cognitively intact patients with NOF fractures with a relative risk&#xD;
      of 9.014 It is also likely to lead to significant patient dissatisfaction Single injection&#xD;
      PNB blocks are limited by short duration a fact that can be mitigated by continuous catheter&#xD;
      techniques. A study from our institution published in 2012 demonstrated more effective&#xD;
      perioperative analgesia, reduced opiate consumption and improved patient satisfaction when&#xD;
      continuous femoral nerve blockade was compared with a standard opiate based regime in&#xD;
      patients with NOF fractures.7 However, femoral nerve blockade can be associated with weakness&#xD;
      of the quadriceps muscle, possibly reducing early postoperative mobility and increasing the&#xD;
      risk of falls. A study of healthy volunteers demonstrated a significant reduction in&#xD;
      quadriceps strength and balance scores following femoral nerve blockade8 Another study&#xD;
      suggested a causal relationship between continuous peripheral nerve blocks and falls after&#xD;
      hip and knee arthroplasty 9&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposal of novel intervention We propose performing a PENG block for postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia. The pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block, first described in 2018, is a PNB&#xD;
      technique which aims to provide analgesia for patients with NOF fractures by blocking sensory&#xD;
      branches of the femoral nerve, obturator nerve and accessory obturator nerve to the anterior&#xD;
      hip capsule.10&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification in support of the intervention The PENG block aims to block the articular&#xD;
      branches of the femoral, obturator and accessory obturator nerves which supply the hip&#xD;
      joint.10 Tran et al demonstrated spread to all three nerves using the PENG block&#xD;
      technique.11This is theoretically a more comprehensive blockade of the pain fibres from the&#xD;
      hip than would be achieved with a traditional femoral nerve block. Therefore the analgesia&#xD;
      achieved may be superior than with other blocks. Published case reports and case series&#xD;
      suggest PENG block efficacy.13&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PENG block aims to block the sensory articular branches while sparing the motor&#xD;
      innervation of the quadriceps muscle. This is likely to result in less quadriceps muscle&#xD;
      weakness which in turn can affect balance and may cause contribute to falls&#xD;
      postoperatively.8,9&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AoA do not recommend continuous catheter techniques in their latest guideline due to a&#xD;
      lack of evidence and the potential contribution of quadriceps weakness to falls.5 If the PENG&#xD;
      block does not cause quadriceps weakness and has the potential to provide superior analgesia,&#xD;
      this is likely to improve a patient's ability to mobilise early postoperatively and engage&#xD;
      with physiotherapy and rehabilitation. This may improve outcomes. Continuous catheter&#xD;
      techniques (most commonly PENG catheters) are currently used in our institution for&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia&#xD;
