  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the acceptability and feasibility of the implementation of a&#xD;
      collaborative care model (CCM) to screen and treat depression. This model will includes&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and useof a task-shifting model to address depression&#xD;
      among adolescents and young adults (AYA) who are seeking HIV treatment and prevention&#xD;
      services at a hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. Analyses will be guided by the consolidated&#xD;
      framework for implementation research (CFIR), which will include the identification of&#xD;
      facilitators and barriers to implementation of this CCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last 3 years, 10-20% of AYA patients at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (KCMH)&#xD;
      who seek HIV treatment or prevention services suffer from mental health disorders. As a&#xD;
      result, CCM integration for depression screening and treatment was implemented at the 'CU&#xD;
      Buddy Clinic' KCMH with the ultimate goal of increasing access to and engagement in mental&#xD;
      healthcare with a goal to improve the overall quality of life for Thai AYA. This project will&#xD;
      inform a future implementation science study that will focus on how the optimization of&#xD;
      integrated mental healthcare into routine AYA HIV treatment and prevention services can&#xD;
      impact health outcomes for patients, including ART adherence and long-term viral suppression&#xD;
      (AYA living with HIV) and HIV acquisition risk behaviors and PrEP adherence (AYA at risk for&#xD;
      HIV).&#xD;
