  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of topically administered&#xD;
      WST-057 for 16 weeks in subjects with HIV with sensory polyneuropathy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase A: Is an open-labeled feasibility investigation of the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      limited efficacy in 14 subjects with HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy (HIV-DSP)&#xD;
      after topical daily dosing of WST-057 (4% pirenzepine free base monohydrate). Subjects will&#xD;
      be stratified based on their baseline scores for pain/discomfort using the VAS. Subjects will&#xD;
      attend visits at screening; Day 0 (baseline); Weeks 4, 8, and 16; and follow-up (Week 18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase B: Is a randomized outpatient, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-site study of&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability, and exploratory efficacy of topically administered WST-057 for 16&#xD;
      weeks in subjects with HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy (HIV-DSP). Stratification&#xD;
      of subjects based on baseline pain will be included based on the results of Part A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will attend visits at screening; Day 0 (baseline); Weeks 4, 8, and 16; and follow-up&#xD;
      (Week 18). Approximately 60 subjects with HIV-DSP will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment&#xD;
      groups in a 3:2 ratio: WST-057 (4 mL) (n = 36 subjects) versus placebo control 4 mL (n = 24&#xD;
      subjects); with the assumption that a total of 50 subjects will complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed with 4 periods in both study phases: screening, baseline/day 0,&#xD;
      outpatient treatment, and safety follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>MOS-HIV is a brief, comprehensive health status measure that has been used extensively in studies of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). The 35-item questionnaire includes ten dimensions (health perceptions, pain, physical, role, social and cognitive functioning, mental health, energy, health distress and quality of life (QoL) and takes approximately 5 minutes to complete. Subscales are scored on a 0-100 scale (a higher score indicates better health) and physical and mental health summary scores can be generated.</description>

    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIC scale will be used to assess patients' perception of changes following treatment (i.e., &quot;feeling better&quot; or &quot;feeling worse&quot;). The PGIC is a 7-point scale from &quot;much improved&quot; to &quot;much worse.&quot; The PGIC is commonly used in clinical studies assessing pain relief following treatment, due to its ease of administration and scoring and because it is a generic scale applicable to a wide variety of conditions and treatments including diabetic peripheral neuropathy</description>

    <measure>Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>

    <measure>Utah Early Neuropathy Score (UENS)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>UENS is a simple, rapid, and reproducible test targeted to detect early sensory peripheral neuropathy. It includes motor examination, pin sensation, allodynia, hyperesthesia, large-fiber sensation, and deep tendon reflexes. The sensations are reported on 0-, 1-, or 2-point scoring for normal, reduced or absent vibration or reflexes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropathic Pain Scale-10 (NPS-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NPS-10 will be used to assess the effect of treatments impacting neuropathic pain. It is reported on 0-10 scale with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating the most pain imaginable. It is suggested that an NPS-10 score greater than 43 of 100 may indicate the presence of neuropathic conditions.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are eligible for the study if all the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. HIV infection documented by serologic testing at screening; virally suppressed on ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male and female patients in the age range of 18 to 80 years (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosis of HIV-DSP determined by a neurological exam performed by qualified&#xD;
             personnel and defined as one or more clinical signs (symmetrical, diminished distal&#xD;
             vibration or dull/sharp sensation in feet or reduced ankle reflexes using HNRC CH40);&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior week VAS for average pain/discomfort (altered sensation) and/or altered&#xD;
             sensations on lower extremities &gt; 20 mm and &lt; 80mm (0 mm = no pain-100 mm = very&#xD;
             severe pain) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Baseline IENF density &lt;5%ile (ankle) based on age- and sex-adjusted Lauria norms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Provide written informed consent prior to entering the study or undergoing any study&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Females should be either not of childbearing potential as a result of surgery or&#xD;
             menopause (1 year after onset), or of childbearing potential and must be practicing a&#xD;
             highly effective medically acceptable method of contraception, including abstinence;&#xD;
             hormonal contraceptives (e.g., combined oral contraceptives, patch, vaginal ring,&#xD;
             injectables, and implants); intrauterine device or intrauterine system; or vasectomy&#xD;
             (partner), for at least 1 month before the screening visit and for 1 month after the&#xD;
             end of the last dose of study drug. If access or use of a highly effective medically&#xD;
             acceptable method of contraception is not achievable, then a combination of barrier&#xD;
             methods (e.g., male condom, female condom, cervical cap, diaphragm, contraceptive&#xD;
             sponge) is acceptable. Eligible female subjects must also have a negative serum&#xD;
             beta-human chorionic gonadotropin at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Males must use an acceptable form of contraception (e.g., male condom with diaphragm,&#xD;
             male condom with cervical cap, or male condom in association with spermicide).&#xD;
&#xD;

             three months prior to randomization. Optimal glycemic control (by HgbA1C&lt;7; at&#xD;
             discretion of PI) refers to the best possible diabetic control that an individual&#xD;
             patient can attain with usual standards of care, which usually takes more than two&#xD;
             months to establish.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Participating subjects must be reliable, willing, and able to cooperate with all study&#xD;
             procedures, including the following:&#xD;

                  wounds, infections, or other anomalies, and be able to self-administer the&#xD;
                  investigational drug to calves and top surface of feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Be able to accurately and reliably report symptoms (including treatment-emergent&#xD;

             or injectable antidiabetic therapy and/or lifestyle) that is not anticipated to change&#xD;
             during the course of the study, except if medically required.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Be on stable nonpharmacological pain/uncomfortable sensation treatment for at least 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to screening and remain on this stable treatment throughout the study&#xD;
             (unless otherwise directed by a physician). Nonpharmacologic pain treatment includes&#xD;
             the following: relaxation/hypnosis, physical or occupational therapy, counseling, etc.&#xD;
             Episodic or periodic treatments, such as monthly injections for treatment of pain&#xD;
             (e.g., local anesthetics) or trans electrical nerve stimulation will not be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Regular and stable use of pharmacological pain/uncomfortable sensation treatment (less&#xD;
