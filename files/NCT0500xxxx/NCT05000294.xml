  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Checkpoint inhibitor therapy represents a significant advance in cancer care. The interaction&#xD;
      between PD-1 and PD-L1 induces immune tolerance, and the inhibition of this interaction is an&#xD;
      effective treatment strategy for numerous malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite its demonstrated potential, immunotherapy is not currently thought to be an effective&#xD;
      intervention in the treatment of several immunologically &quot;cold&quot; tumors such as prostate&#xD;
      cancer, biliary tract cancers, soft tissue sarcomas, well-differentiated neuroendocrine&#xD;
      tumors, microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and non-triple negative&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is thought to play a key role in modulating the&#xD;
      anti-tumor immune response. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is secreted by tumors&#xD;
      and leads to endothelial cell proliferation, vascular permeability, and vasodilation. This in&#xD;
      turn leads to the development of an abnormal vasculature with excessive permeability and poor&#xD;
      blood flow, limiting immune surveillance. In addition, VEGF inhibits dendritic cell&#xD;
      differentiation, limiting the presentation of tumor antigens to CD4 and CD8 T cells. Vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) VEGF-TKIs are&#xD;
      currently utilized in the treatment of a variety of malignancies and are widely utilized in&#xD;
      combination with checkpoint blockade in the treatment of clear cell kidney cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the inhibition of VEGF, it may be possible to potentiate the effect of immune&#xD;
      checkpoint blockade even in tumors which have traditionally been thought to be unresponsive&#xD;
      to immunotherapy. This study aims to evaluate the combination of the immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitor atezolizumab and the VEGF-TKI tivozanib in a variety of tumors which have a low&#xD;
      response rate to checkpoint inhibitor therapy alone.&#xD;
