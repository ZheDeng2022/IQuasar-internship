    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multi-site, adaptive, open-label clinical trial comparing the immune&#xD;
      response to different COVID-19 vaccine booster doses in participants with autoimmune disease&#xD;
      requiring immunosuppressive medications. All study participants will have negative serologic&#xD;
      or sub-optimal responses (defined as a Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (RBD) result ≤ 50&#xD;
      U/mL) to initial COVID-19 vaccine regimen with Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, Pfizer-BioNTech&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine, or Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will initially focus on 5 autoimmune diseases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiple Sclerosis (MS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pemphigus.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants will be assigned to one of 3 cohorts based on their&#xD;
      immunosuppressive regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort A: Receipt of MMF or MPA (± other rheumatic disease medications, including&#xD;
           biologics)&#xD;
&#xD;
           --Participants who are taking mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or mycophenolic acid (MPA),&#xD;
           without additional B cell depleting medications or methotrexate (MTX), will be placed in&#xD;
           this cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B: Receipt of MTX (± other rheumatic disease medications, including biologics)&#xD;
&#xD;
           --Participants who are taking MTX (without additional B cell depleting medications or&#xD;
           MMF/ MPA) will be placed in this cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort C: Receipt of B cell depletion therapy within the past 12 months (± other&#xD;
           rheumatic disease medications) --Participants taking B cell depletion medications,&#xD;
           regardless of whether they are also taking MMF or MTX, will be placed in this cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Arms: Participants in Cohorts A, B, and C will be assigned to receive a booster of&#xD;
      the same vaccine as their original vaccine series (Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, Pfizer-BioNTech&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine, or Janssen COVID-19 vaccine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Cohorts A and B will be randomized into two immunosuppressive medication (IS)&#xD;
      treatment plans as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants continue to take their immunosuppressive medications without alterations in&#xD;
           schedule and dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants withhold their immunosuppressive medications before and after the booster,&#xD;
           per protocol.&#xD;
