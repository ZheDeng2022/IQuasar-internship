      This is a phase 1b, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of STI-1492 administered&#xD;
      by a single intravenous infusion in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will determine the MTD and RP2D, assessing safety and preliminary efficacy using a&#xD;
      conventional 3+3 study design with two design stages, an ascending dose stage followed by an&#xD;
      expansion study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled sequentially within each cohort and between cohorts during the dose&#xD;
      escalation portion of the study with the staggered intervals of at least 28 days. Only one&#xD;
      patient will be allowed to receive study treatment at any time through the end of the&#xD;
      staggering period before the next subject may begin study treatment.&#xD;
