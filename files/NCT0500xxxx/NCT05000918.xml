      The aim of this study is to investigate the anti-exercise-fatigue effects of okara protein&#xD;
      hydrolysate (OPH) in men&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject must undergo a cardiopulmonary capacity test to assess the maximum oxygen uptake&#xD;
      1 week before the intervention (day 1), and then eat the test food for 4 weeks (day 8 to day&#xD;
      35). Before and after the intervention (the 8th and 35th day), posture measurement, diet&#xD;
      questionnaire survey and endurance exercise ability test were carried out. The trial period&#xD;
      was 35 days. The subjects will take blood samples before, during, after, and 30 minutes and&#xD;
      60 minutes after the end of the two endurance exercise tests. During the whole period of&#xD;
      participating in the program, blood will be collected 10 times, each with a blood volume of&#xD;
      15 mL. Gas is collected during the period and within 1 hour after exercise. Gas is collected&#xD;
      every 15 minutes and 1 minute at a time. Analyze his exercise time, oxygen intake and blood&#xD;
      biochemical value.&#xD;
