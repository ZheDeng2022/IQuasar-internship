      This study is a single-arm, single center study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of FMT capsules XBI-302 combined with Nivolumab in the treatment of&#xD;
      anti-PD-1/L1 resistant gastric cancer.&#xD;

      The primary purpose of this single-arm, open-label, single center trial is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of XBI-302 combined with Nivolumab in the treatment of anti-PD-1/L1&#xD;
      resistant gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment period, all eligible subjects will receive XBI-302 with Nivolumab following&#xD;
      gut preparation. The imaging evaluation of efficacy will be performed every 6 weeks.&#xD;
