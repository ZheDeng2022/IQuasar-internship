  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to carry out a study to determine the role of Doble Lumen Tubes with&#xD;
      built-in camera Viva Sight-DL (VDLT) in thoracic surgery. With this study the investigators&#xD;
      want to study and enlarge the information in the different surgical approaches, including&#xD;
      robotic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is report a single-center experience using individual data costs&#xD;
      to compare the cost effectiveness of VDLT Viva Sight versus the use of conventional Doble&#xD;
      Lumen Tubes (cDLT) together with fiberoptic bronchoscope in patients undergoing thoracic&#xD;
      surgery, in order to generate information for future decision making related to both devices.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to carry out a comparative clinical study on the use of conventional&#xD;
      double-lumen endobronchial tubes (cDLT) or video double-lumen endobronquial tubes Vivasight&#xD;
      DL (VDLT) during intubation in thoracic lung resection surgery, to study their possible&#xD;
      advantages and disadvantages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, single-center cohort study of Thoracic Surgery in which the&#xD;
      VivaSight-DL (n = 55 patients) or conventional DLT (n = 55 patients) is used for lung&#xD;
      isolation in elderly patients (≥ 18 years), thoracic surgery procedures of the &quot;lung&#xD;
      resection&quot; type: wedge resection, transegmental resection, lobectomy, bilobectomy or&#xD;
      pneumectomy by the different surgical approaches: VATS, robotic surgery and thoracotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to find out if the use of VDLT reduces the need for fiberoptic&#xD;
      bronchoscope (FBS) to verify the positioning of the endobronchial tube during intubation and&#xD;
      intraoperatively. Reducing the need for FBS could improve the quality of care provided to the&#xD;
      patient and reduce costs to the hospital.&#xD;
