  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) portends substantial morbidity, mortality, and health care costs in the&#xD;
      United States and the prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)&#xD;
      relative to HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has been increasing. HFpEF is&#xD;
      associated with a high morbidity and mortality burden and is projected to be the predominant&#xD;
      subtype of HF in the near future. While multiple therapies have proven efficacious for&#xD;
      patients with HFrEF, no pharmacological agents have demonstrably been shown to improve&#xD;
      outcomes in HFpEF, highlighting the need for novel approaches to HFpEF treatment. Exercise&#xD;
      intolerance (EI) is the cardinal symptom of HFpEF, which manifests as dyspnea and fatigue. EI&#xD;
      leads to functional deconditioning and reduced quality of life (QOL), both of which elevate&#xD;
      risk of death and hospitalization in patients with HFpEF. Supervised exercised training is&#xD;
      associated with improvements in exercise capacity and QOL in adults with HFpEF. However,&#xD;
      supervised exercise has not been widely utilized for the treatment of HFpEF due to logistical&#xD;
      and fiscal barriers. Home-based exercise using an m-Health platform is an alternative to&#xD;
      supervised exercise that can deliver clinician prescribed exercise interventions and wellness&#xD;
      education though monitoring and care coordination. The goal of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility and efficacy of a patient specific progressive home-based cardiac rehabilitation&#xD;
      program leveraging the technology of the m-Health program in improving functional status,&#xD;
      exercise capacity, and QOL in patients with HFpEF.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 6.2 million adults in the United States suffer from heart failure (HF), of&#xD;
      which almost one-half maintain a left ventricle ejection fraction (EF) &gt;50% known as heart&#xD;
      failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The prevalence of HFpEF has been increasing&#xD;
      as compared with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) over time, particularly in older&#xD;
      adults. HFpEF is associated with a high morbidity and mortality burden and remains&#xD;
      recalcitrant to available pharmacotherapies, significantly highlighting the need for novel&#xD;
      strategies for management. Emerging data suggests HFpEF is a multiorgan disease with complex&#xD;
      pathophysiology culminating in debilitating exercise intolerance (EI). This key clinical&#xD;
      manifestation of HFpEF, stems from multiple causal pathways: accelerated fitness decline with&#xD;
      aging, high comorbidity burden, sarcopenia, impaired cardiovascular reserve, and skeletal&#xD;
      muscle myopathy. EI demonstrated by dyspnea and fatigue cascades into functional&#xD;
      deconditioning and reduced quality of life (QOL). In addition to EI, &gt;90% of patients with&#xD;
      HFpEF are pre-frail or frail and demonstrate physical function limitations. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      these characteristic clinical findings in HFpEF are strongly predictive of death and&#xD;
      hospitalization. There is an urgent need to develop effective therapeutic approaches&#xD;
      targeting EI and physical function to achieve meaningful improvements in patient-reported and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supervised exercise training has been shown to improve functional status, exercise capacity,&#xD;
      quality of life (QOL), and lower risk of hospitalization in patients with HF with most&#xD;
      studies conducted in the HFrEF population. Smaller trials have demonstrated significant&#xD;
      improvements in exercise capacity and QOL with supervised exercise training in HFpEF.5&#xD;
      Accordingly, the AHA/ACC 2013 HF guidelines recommend exercise and cardiac rehabilitation&#xD;
      (CR) for patients with chronic HF who can participate in exercise to improve QOL and&#xD;
      functional status. Furthermore, a statement from the AHA committee on exercise,&#xD;
      rehabilitation, and prevention recommends exercise intensity, duration, and frequency should&#xD;
      be tailored to the individual needs of patients. In 2014, HFrEF became a reimbursable&#xD;
      diagnosis for comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation (CR) but HFpEF was excluded due to lack of&#xD;
      large-scale clinical end-point driven trial evidence. Despite the established benefits, CR is&#xD;
      widely underutilized with &lt;10% of eligible HF participants engaging in the same. CR&#xD;
      participation barriers include comprehensive institutional expertise needed, widespread&#xD;
      regulations, low reimbursement rates, high patient cost, patient time and travel, and&#xD;
      facility requirement. Considering the benefits effects of exercise training on&#xD;
      patient-oriented functional outcomes in HFpEF and the lack of availability of the current&#xD;
      supervised exercise CR model (3 times/week x 12 weeks) for this patient population, there is&#xD;
      a need for a more feasible, scalable, and cost-effective alternative approach to delivering&#xD;
      exercise training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home-based CR using a m-Health platform is a novel alternative to supervised CR that can&#xD;
      deliver clinician specific exercise interventions and CR wellness education with remote&#xD;
      monitoring and care coordination. The feasibility and efficacy of home-based CR among&#xD;
      patients with HFpEF have not been evaluated but have a critical potential impact for this&#xD;
      population. This is particularly relevant given the focus on telehealth and home-based in the&#xD;
      era of COVID-19. This represents a significant knowledge gap and opportunity considering the&#xD;
      current clinical reality that patients with HFpEF have a high burden of physical function&#xD;
      impairment and exercise intolerance, the previously reported benefits of exercise training in&#xD;
      this patient population, and the current lack of therapeutic opportunities that can be&#xD;
      feasibly implemented on a population scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home-based CR with m-health platform is not the standard of care currently, but is an&#xD;
      exploratory intervention.&#xD;
