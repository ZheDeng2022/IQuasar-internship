  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that ultrasound guided serratus anterior plane block Combined With Modified&#xD;
      Pectoral Nerve Block is going to be more effective than Ultrasound guided Serratus anterior&#xD;
      plane block alone in patients undergoing MRM as modified Pecs block involves the block of&#xD;
      medial and lateral pectoral nerves which are spared in case of serratus block alone,&#xD;
      resulting in reducing myofascial pain and opioid consumption.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound guided Serratus anterior plane block was introduced in 2013 for analgesia of&#xD;
      breast and lateral thoracic wall surgery. At the axillary fossa, the intercostobrachialis&#xD;
      nerve, lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves (T3-T9), long thoracic nerve, and&#xD;
      thoracodorsal nerve are located in a compartment between the serratus anterior and the&#xD;
      latissimus dorsi muscles, between the posterior and midaxillary lines at this plane local&#xD;
      anesthetic will be injected . Complications of serratus anterior plane block include local&#xD;
      anesthetic toxicity and pneumothorax , unfortunately medial and lateral pectoral nerves are&#xD;
      preserved which are responsible for the myofacial pain .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pectoral nerves (Pecs) block types I and II (Modified Pectoral block) , is less invasive&#xD;
      technique described by Blanco et al where local anesthetic is deposited into the plane&#xD;
      between the pectoralis major muscle(PMm) and the pectoralis minor muscle (Pmm) (Pecs I&#xD;
      block)and above the serratus anterior muscle at the third rib (Pecs IIblock).,Blocking&#xD;
      intercostobrachial, third to sixth intercostals the long thoracic nerves in addition to&#xD;
      medial and lateral pectoral nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addition of Modified Pecs block to Serratus anterior plane block will enhance the control of&#xD;
      pain as it block the medial and lateral pectoral nerves which are responsible for the&#xD;
      myofacial pain and which are spared in case of Serratus block alone .&#xD;

    <description>SAPB Technique; U/S probe will be placed on the patient's midaxillary line in the transverse plane, at the level of the fifth rib, Then, using U/S guidance, A 38-mm 22-gauge regional block needle is advanced in-plane at an angle of approximately 45 degrees towards the fifth rib. After aspiration to avoid IV injection 30ml of levobupivacaine 0.25% is injected anteriorly to the rib and deep to the serratus anterior muscle.&#xD;
SAPB combined with Modified Pectoral Nerve Block :&#xD;
SAPB with injection of 20 ml levobupivacaine 0.25% as discussed before. Modified Pectoral Nerve Block:After identification of the axillary vessels, the U/S probe will turned inferolaterally till the serratus anterior and the two pectoralis muscles are detected in one plane. 10 ml of levobupivacaine 0.25%was injected between the two pectoralis muscles. After that,10 mL of levobupivacaine 0.25%is injected above this muscle.</description>
