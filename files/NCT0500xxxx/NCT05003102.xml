      This is a study of mechanically ventilated pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) teenage&#xD;
      patients and the effects of the medication dexmedetomidine on sleep, delirium, and sedation&#xD;
      level. The Investigators will assess sleep with an 8 lead polysomnogram study and increase&#xD;
      the medication at night for one night to see if the sleep architecture changes. The&#xD;
      Investigators will assess their sleep with our unit's sedation protocol for an additional&#xD;
      night.&#xD;

      Background: Sleep deprivation is a common problem in the intensive care unit (ICU). Poor&#xD;
      sleep is both a modifiable risk factor for improved recovery from severe illness and for&#xD;
      delirium which is associated with increased mortality (1, 2). Sleep deprivation is a&#xD;
      physiological stressor that can affect the autonomic, immune, metabolic, and hormonal&#xD;
      functions of the body. Inflammatory cytokines are increased during sleep deprivation and&#xD;
      hormonal responses to stress which are already affected by critical illness are worsened with&#xD;
      lack of sleep (3, 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedation greatly confounds the ability to distinguish if a patient is asleep or simply deeply&#xD;
      sedated particularly in the mechanically ventilated pediatric population. Kudchadkar et.al&#xD;
      looked at sleep architecture using limited montage electroencephalogram and saw that sleep&#xD;
      was abnormal on sedative infusions although this study did not look at dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      infusion (5). However, polysomnography as the gold standard to asses sleep can offer more&#xD;
      details about sleep architecture including arousal index. It is well known that sedatives&#xD;
      have natural sleep properties, but The Investigators do not have much data on how they impact&#xD;
      sleep architecture in the pediatric population. When attempting to describe sleep in the ICU,&#xD;
      sleep is inaccurately determined by bedside providers clinically (6-8). The age and severity&#xD;
      of illness of intubated pediatric patients them poor candidates for self-reporting using a&#xD;
      behavioral scales to describe sleep. Evaluating sleep using polysomnography both removes&#xD;
      observer inaccuracy and provides information on the sleep architecture of patients on&#xD;
      sedative infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine is a commonly used infusion for sedation in the ICU that also has natural&#xD;
      sleep properties. It is an alpha 2 agonist that acts at the locus coeruleus which is involved&#xD;
      in arousal (9). It mimics natural sleep in animal models (10). Dexmedetomidine is commonly&#xD;
      used in pediatric intensive care units, although its use has gained increased popularity in&#xD;
      the last five years. While some pediatric intensivists cycle, increase the dose at night, of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine to reduce delirium, there is only adult data describing an association&#xD;
      between nocturnal dexmedetomidine infusion and reduced delirium (11,12). There are no studies&#xD;
      published assessing sleep architecture via polysomnography in pediatric patients on&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine infusions. The Investigators aim to assess sleep architecture as well as&#xD;
      incidence of delirium in patients who have dexmedetomidine infusions increased during&#xD;
      nocturnal hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well established that critically ill children and adults have poor sleep quality and&#xD;
      quantity during an ICU stay. Emerging research suggests sleep may improve patient outcomes by&#xD;
      mitigating negative effects of the ICU environment such as delirium. Many of the sedatives&#xD;
      used in the ICU may disrupt sleep architecture, but pharmacologic studies suggest the&#xD;
      sedative dexmedetomidine may improve sleep. Clinical studies in critically ill adults have&#xD;
      shown benefit to using dexmedetomidine sedation overnight, or by increasing the dose at night&#xD;
      for patients receiving continuously. Pediatric intensivists have started increasing&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine infusion doses at night for delirious patients with anecdotal improvements in&#xD;
      mental status and delirium state the following day, but no evidence has been published to&#xD;
      support this practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study: The purpose of this small pilot study is to assess if nocturnal sleep quality and&#xD;
      quantity improves with increasing the dose of continuous intravenous infusion of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine exclusively to attain a targeted Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS)&#xD;
      state in intubated and critically ill pediatric patients between the age of 12 and 17 in the&#xD;
      pediatric intensive care unit instead of utilizing increasing doses of 2-3 agents with&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine being one of them. The FDA has not approved this medication for use in&#xD;
      children, so this study will only enroll patients already placed on the medication by their&#xD;
      care team as it is already used by this unit in spite of lack of FDA approval for pediatrics.&#xD;
      An Investigational New Drug (IND) application was submitted to the FDA and this study was&#xD;
      deemed IND exempt (IND 155894). For the control night, the Investigators will make no&#xD;
      modifications to the Vanderbilt Children's Hospital approved pediatric intensive care unit&#xD;
      sedation protocol. The Investigators will use the same titration and approved maximum doses&#xD;
      which are as follows: Initiate fentanyl infusion at 1 mcg/kg/hr and dexmedetomidine infusion&#xD;
      at 0.3 mcg/kg/hr, if RASS greater than desired RASS implement the following in order until&#xD;
      RASS goal is met. Step 1: Give fentanyl bolus of 1 mcg/kg, reassess in 10 minutes; Step 2:&#xD;
      Repeat fentanyl bolus of 1 mcg/kg and increase drip by 1 mcg/kg/hr, reassess in 10 minutes;&#xD;
      Step 3: Give dexmedetomidine bolus of 0.5 mcg/kg, reassess in 10 minutes; Step 4: Repeat&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine bolus of 0.5 mcg/kg and increase drip by 0.3 mcg/kg/hr, reassess in 10&#xD;
      minutes. Repeat steps 1-4 until goal RASS reached or at max drips (fentanyl 5 mcg/kg/hr and&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine 2 mcg/kg/hr). For the intervention night, the Investigators will use the same&#xD;
      titration and maximum dose of dexmedetomidine that is Vanderbilt Children's Hospital&#xD;
      approved. The Investigators will start the dexmedetomidine where the patients daytime&#xD;
      providers have dosed it and titrate to a targeted RASS goal one level deeper. The&#xD;
      Investigators will follow the unit titration of using 0.5 mcg/kg bolus and increasing the&#xD;
      drip by 0.3 mcg/kg/hr. Reassess RASS 10 minutes later, and if not at desired RASS goal,&#xD;
      repeat bolus of 0.5 mcg/kg and increase by 0.3 mcg/kg/hr until either the desired RASS goal&#xD;
      is met or a maximum of 2 mcg/kg/hr is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators aim to enroll children who are currently receiving mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      and dexmedetomidine infusion for sedation per current pediatric ICU practice and assess the&#xD;
      effects of preferentially increasing dexmedetomidine infusion on nocturnal sleep&#xD;
      architecture. The Investigators will assess sleep using an 8 lead montage of polysomnography.&#xD;
      Each patient will wear the polysomnogram leads for two nights. One of the two nights will&#xD;
      follow the intensive care unit sedation protocol (allowing for use of other sedatives as&#xD;
      needed) versus increasing the dose of dexmedetomidine to a target Richmond Agitation-Sedation&#xD;
      Scale state one level deeper than what was targeted during the day. Those interpreting the&#xD;
      sleep studies will be blinded to which night was the night that the dexmedetomidine infusion&#xD;
      was preferentially increased.&#xD;
