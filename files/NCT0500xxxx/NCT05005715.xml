  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In multiple previous studies that have explored the use of dexmedetomidine in transsphenoidal&#xD;
      tumor resection surgery, dexmedetomidine showed many beneficial effects like reducing the&#xD;
      requirement of analgesics and anesthetics, improving hemodynamic stability and decreasing the&#xD;
      emergence time, extubation time and visual analog scale at emergence. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesized that dexmedetomidine would decrease neuroendocrine stress response&#xD;
      and improve the quality of postoperative recovery.&#xD;
