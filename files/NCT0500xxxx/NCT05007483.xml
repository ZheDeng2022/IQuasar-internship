  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this project is to critically evaluate the efficacy of incorporating&#xD;
      dietary guidance within multiple sclerosis (MS) care for improving long-term quality of life&#xD;
      (QoL) compared to usual care. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of two dietary interventions (time restricted olive oil based (TROO) ketogenic and modified&#xD;
      Paleolithic elimination) on MS QoL compared to usual care control (Dietary Guidelines for&#xD;
      America), and the secondary objectives and the long-term effects on, motor function,&#xD;
      low-contrast vision sensitivity, fatigue, mood, and disease activity assessed by brain&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, MS affects nearly 1 million people with a 2.8:1 female to male ratio&#xD;
      and the highest incidence rates among whites and African Americans. The economic cost of&#xD;
      managing MS is substantial. In the U.S., the total medical costs for patients with MS&#xD;
      increased from $116 million in 2002 to $198 million in 2013. MS is a chronic,&#xD;
      neuroinflammatory, and neurodegenerative disease-causing symptoms of pain, fatigue, and&#xD;
      changes in vision, cognition, and movement that greatly reduce quality of life (QoL) and the&#xD;
      ability to maintain employment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goal of this project is to critically evaluate the efficacy of incorporating&#xD;
      dietary guidance within multiple sclerosis (MS) care for improving long-term quality of life&#xD;
      (QoL) compared to usual care. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of two dietary interventions (time restricted olive oil based (TROO) ketogenic and modified&#xD;
      Paleolithic elimination) on MS QoL compared to usual care control (Dietary Guidelines for&#xD;
      America), and the secondary objectives and the long-term effects on, motor function,&#xD;
      low-contrast vision sensitivity, fatigue, mood, and disease activity assessed by brain&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will consist of study participants attending 2 in-person site visits, one&#xD;
      at baseline and the other 2 years later (months 0, and 24) with online surveys every 2 months&#xD;
      (months 0-24).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a randomized single-blind controlled design to test the short-term (6&#xD;
      months) and long-term (an additional 18 months) impact of the intervention diets on symptoms&#xD;
      of MS including QoL and related outcomes stated above. We will use a fourteen-day run-in&#xD;
      period to identify participants who are most likely to be successful in completing study&#xD;
      procedures; this process has been effective in our previous studies. Participants who&#xD;
      successfully complete all baseline self-reported outcomes and follow all study procedures&#xD;
      during the seven-day run-in period will be scheduled for an on-site baseline visit for&#xD;
      randomization to intervention diets (time restricted olive oil based (TROO) ketogenic and&#xD;
      modified Paleolithic elimination) or usual care control (Dietary Guidelines for America).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On-site study visits will include blood draws, motor, cognitive, vision function assessments,&#xD;
      and MRI. Motor assessments will include a 6-minute walk test, 25-foot walk test, 9-hole&#xD;
      pegboard to test hand function, symbol digit exercise to test thinking functions, and low&#xD;
      contrast vision sensitivity to test vision. The study participant will be escorted to the MRI&#xD;
      unit to complete a non-contrast MRI of the brain. At the baseline visit, participants will be&#xD;
      randomized. Participants assigned to the intervention diets will be given intervention&#xD;
      specific educational materials including shopping lists, example menus and recipes, and the&#xD;
      study supplements. Study participants randomized to the control arm will receive emails&#xD;
      and/or text messages (approximately 3-6 weeks) to receive resources with websites for the&#xD;
      Dietary Guidelines of America, and recent multiple sclerosis-related research that does not&#xD;
      involve diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study team will provide fish oil, essential fatty acids, and phosphatidylcholine to the two&#xD;
      intervention groups only. The participant will be scheduled for a Zoom video conference&#xD;
      meeting with the assigned registered dietitian to review the assigned study diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, subjects will collect saliva specimens for microbiome analysis at each of the 2&#xD;
      site study visits (month 0 and 24).&#xD;
&#xD;
      24-hour dietary recalls will be collected by a study registered dietitian (RD) (who did not&#xD;
      provide training on the respective participants assigned study diet) on three non-consecutive&#xD;
      days at baseline, and one per month, at months 10-12, and 22-24. Participants will be given a&#xD;
      3-month window to complete dietary recalls in the event of scheduling conflicts. Participants&#xD;
      will be instructed to record key study diet components each day using a study specific&#xD;
      questionnaire in the study related (MyCap) application on their smart device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The online questionnaires sent to participants every 2 months will also be used to track&#xD;
      supplement intake, medication use, and details about health &amp; life events, MS symptoms,&#xD;
      fatigue, quality of life, doctor's appointment, and side effects they may be experiencing.&#xD;
