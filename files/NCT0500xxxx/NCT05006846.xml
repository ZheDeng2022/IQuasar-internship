  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With over 72,000 overdose deaths in 2017, of which 47,600 are attributable to opioid&#xD;
      overdose, the opioid epidemic has become North America's most widespread behavioral public&#xD;
      health problem. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly&#xD;
      efficacious. The Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS), comprised of a healthcare team&#xD;
      portal connected to a patient mobile application, provides opioid-related education, promotes&#xD;
      connectedness with clinicians, and tracks MAT treatment progress. This study will conduct&#xD;
      interviews with patients that will inform optimal design of OARS, assess the efficacy of OARS&#xD;
      in improving MAT outcomes in primary care settings, and evaluate the sustainability and&#xD;
      return on investment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It joins an outstanding scientific team at University of California, Los Angeles and a small&#xD;
      business that has developed, Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS) -- a software platform&#xD;
      that by integrating with the Electronic Health Record (EHR) improves clinical management of&#xD;
      patients by primary care providers (PCPs) treating patients with OUD using MAT. OARS platform&#xD;
      uses a dashboard to show the real-time measurement of patient achievements in recovery. It&#xD;
      provides opportunities for patients to interact with their PCPs, allowing for better&#xD;
      connection to and support from their PCPs. OARS platform features artificial intelligence to&#xD;
      analyze information from the EHR and from patients to provide a relapse risk assessment for&#xD;
      patients receiving MAT for OUD, an innovation that sets OARS apart from other software&#xD;
      solutions. The goal of Phase 1 was to modify the OARS platform for use in primary care&#xD;
      settings by conducting interviews with Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) (N=20) and their&#xD;
      patients with OUD (N=40) in primary care settings to collect data on feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of engaging with OARS to inform the user-centered design of OARS.&#xD;

        The primary care providers (PCPs) willing to prescribe buprenorphine-naloxone and willing&#xD;
        to allow two of their patients with OUD to participate were recruited through mailed&#xD;
        recruitment flyers and by reaching out to individual clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients were recruited through their PCP, with a maximum of two patients per PCPs&#xD;
        participating in the study using passive recruitment of patients via email describing the&#xD;
        study which is used so that potential patient participants can elect to or not engage in&#xD;
        this research project independent of their PCPs decisions. Recruitment materials clarified&#xD;
        that patients' decisions regarding research participation did in no way impact patients'&#xD;
        clinical care. Patients whose PCPs elected not to participate in this research were also&#xD;
        not eligible to participate.&#xD;
