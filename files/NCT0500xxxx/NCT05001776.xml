      Ð rospective single-centre randomized open-label study for comparison three modes of treatment&#xD;
      for thrombosis of varicose great saphena vein - standard medical with fondaparinux sodium for&#xD;
      45 days, endovenous laser ablation close to the saphenofemoral junction with a 7-day course&#xD;
      of anticoagulation and endovenous laser ablation close to the saphenofemoral junction without&#xD;
      the use of anticoagulants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Superficial venous thrombosis is a common complication in patients with varicose veins of low&#xD;
      extremities. The most dangerous consequence of such thrombosis is its propagation to deep&#xD;
      veins and subsequent pulmonary embolism. Recommended mode of treatment for superficial vein&#xD;
      thrombosis is a prolonged usage of anticoagulants (preferably fondaparinux sodium for least&#xD;
      45 days as the best-studied approach). However, it may be not suitable for some patients, for&#xD;
      example with a high risk of bleeding. Another possible mode of treatment is endovenous laser&#xD;
      ablation of the saphenous vein very close to the saphenofemoral junction. This a minimally&#xD;
      invasive procedure that may be performed ambulatory is able to decrease the risk of deep&#xD;
      veins thrombosis and possibly allow to shorten or even eliminate the necessity of&#xD;
      anticoagulant use. Such a suggestion was not appropriately studied in randomized clinical&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective single-centre randomized open-label study is to compare three&#xD;
      modes of treatment for thrombosis of varicose great saphena vein - standard medical with&#xD;
      fondaparinux sodium, endovenous laser ablation close to the saphenofemoral junction with&#xD;
      shortening the course of anticoagulation and endovenous laser ablation close to the&#xD;
      saphenofemoral junction without the use of anticoagulants.&#xD;
