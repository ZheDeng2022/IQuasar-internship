    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects will first be ventilated with the TTIP technique. If the subjects are adequately ventilated, as defined by carbon dioxide measured during exhalation in at least one of the first three consecutive breaths, ventilation will continue until completion of 10 breaths, for 1 min (Step 1).Subjects will then be ventilated with mask ventilation (Step 2).In Step 1, if ventilation fails with the TTIP technique for all of the first three consecutive breaths, the subject will be crossed over to the mask ventilation. If ventilation fails again with all the first three consecutive breaths after crossover,the study will be terminated.The routine care is resumed including tracheal intubation or laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion.</description>
