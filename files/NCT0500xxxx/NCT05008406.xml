  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      E-learning is now a well-established method of education all over the world, and it has been&#xD;
      used for years as a major method of teaching in many fields. The medical field is not far&#xD;
      away, but the use of e-learning in it has become increasing, and the technological advances&#xD;
      have made this process more realistic and interactive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The emergence and spread of COVID-19 virus as a global pandemic has placed many restrictions&#xD;
      on daily life activities including enrolment in schools and universities in many countries,&#xD;
      including Jordan, which has led to a marked and increased use of e-learning as a significant&#xD;
      alternative to traditional education. Medical teaching has some peculiar characteristics,&#xD;
      especially the need for direct interaction between the student and the patient, attending&#xD;
      clinics, wards, and operating rooms, and the close exposure to clinical cases. This have&#xD;
      created some restrictions and obstacles in the way of using e-learning in medicine education,&#xD;
      in addition to other important influencing and limiting barriers, such as technical barriers,&#xD;
      especially in the light of the abrupt transition to e-learning utilization under the current&#xD;
      circumstance, and the psychological barriers -in terms of anxiety and stress- that resulted&#xD;
      by this pandemic and the consequent home quarantine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cross-sectional study aims to study the current state of e-learning in the School of&#xD;
      Medicine at the University of Jordan, by evaluating the teaching tools used and the effect of&#xD;
      the rapid transition in basic medical teaching and clinical medical training to become mainly&#xD;
      based on the e-learning methodology on the academic achievement and assimilation of the&#xD;
      clinical part of the medical courses, and the general satisfaction of the medical students at&#xD;
      their different academic levels. Other influencing factors will be studied, such as the&#xD;
      extent of students' readiness and preparedness to use the e-learning tools and their previous&#xD;
      experience in it, the extent of the readiness and experience of their teachers, and the&#xD;
      general mental health status of students and their effects on accepting the distance&#xD;
      e-learning process, and the commitment to participate and interact with various electronic&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, after exploring the difficulties and hurdles facing the e-learning process and&#xD;
      after analysis, aims to propose practical solutions to facilitate and maintain it beyond the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic era.&#xD;
