      This is an open label vaccine booster follow-up study. Participants who had received a&#xD;
      primary course of GBS-NN/NN2 or placebo in Study MVX0002 will be invited to return to receive&#xD;
      a booster dose (or first dose in the case of placebo or vaccine naïve participants) 1 to 5&#xD;
      years after the completion of the primary course of vaccination. All participants will&#xD;
      receive a single dose of GBS-NN/NN2 containing 50μg of each fusion protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 30 and a maximum of 40 female participants will be recruited, comprised of&#xD;
      between 20 and 30 participants who had received previous vaccination with GBS-NN/NN2 in the&#xD;
      MVX0002 study and up to 10 participants who had received placebo in the MVX0002 study. If an&#xD;
      insufficient number of participants (less than 5) who previously received placebo return to&#xD;
      this study, vaccine naïve participants will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 7 visits: Visit 1 (Screening), Visit 2 (Day 1 dosing), Visit 3 (Day&#xD;
      8), Visit 4 (Day 29), Visit 5 (Day 57), Visit 6 (Day 85) and Visit 7 (Day 183 Follow-up).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be confirmed at Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Women who have participated in study MVX0002, with GBS-NN/NN2 vaccine and received&#xD;
             active vaccine or placebo (unless it is necessary to recruit vaccine naïve&#xD;
             participants to bolster the number of participants who received placebo in MVX0002).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Able to voluntarily provide written informed consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Healthy female participants aged 18-40 years (vaccine naïve participants only).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Female participant of childbearing potential willing to use a highly effective method&#xD;
             of contraception (in addition to a condom for male partners), if applicable (unless of&#xD;
             non-childbearing potential or where abstaining from sexual intercourse is in line with&#xD;
             the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant) from the first dose until&#xD;
             completion of the Day 85 visit. A woman is considered of childbearing potential, i.e.&#xD;
             fertile, following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently&#xD;
             sterile. Permanent sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy&#xD;
             and bilateral oophorectomy. For the purposes of this study, this definition of a&#xD;
             female of childbearing potential applies to all females in the study i.e., those who&#xD;
             participated in the MVX0002 study and those who are considered vaccine naïve.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female participant of non-childbearing potential. For the purposes of this study, this&#xD;
             is defined as the participant being at least 4 months post-surgical sterilisation&#xD;
             (including bilateral fallopian tube ligation or bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
             hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Female participant with a negative pregnancy test at Screening and prior to dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Female participant of menopausal status confirmed by demonstrating at Screening that&#xD;
             the serum level of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) falls within the respective&#xD;
             pathology reference range. In the event a participant's menopausal status has been&#xD;
             clearly established (for example, the participant indicates she has been amenorrhoeic&#xD;
             for 10 years, confirmed by medical history, etc), but serum FSH levels are not&#xD;
             consistent with a postmenopausal status, determination of the participant's&#xD;
             eligibility to be included in the study will be at the Investigator's discretion&#xD;
             following consultation with the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Body mass index (BMI) ≥18 and ≤30 kg/m2 (vaccine naïve participants only).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participants' weight ≥ 50 kg and ≤ 100 kg at Screening (vaccine naïve participants&#xD;
             only).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Non-smokers for at least 3 months prior to study vaccine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. No clinically significant abnormal test results for serum biochemistry, haematology&#xD;
             and/or urine analyses within 28 days before dose administration of the IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Participants with a negative urinary drugs of abuse (DOA) screen (including alcohol)&#xD;
             test results, determined within 28 days before dose administration of the IMP (N.B.: A&#xD;
             positive test result may be repeated at the Investigator's discretion, if on&#xD;
             prescribed opiates resulting in a positive test, participants may be eligible at the&#xD;
             investigators discretion).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. No clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs (supine blood pressure/heart&#xD;
             rate, respiration rate, tympanic temperature) determined within 28 days before dose of&#xD;
             IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Participants with a negative coronavirus (COVID-19) Reverse Transcription Polymerase&#xD;
             Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test on admission (Day 1 or Day-1 if deemed appropriate by the&#xD;
             Principal Investigator (PI)) if required at the time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be re-confirmed prior to dose administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants continue to meet all screening inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants with a negative urinary drugs of abuse screen (including alcohol) prior&#xD;
             to dose administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants with a negative pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants with a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test on admission (Day 1) (or Day -1 if&#xD;
             deemed appropriate by the PI) if required at the time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be confirmed at Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants who have an autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants who have a current infection or any significant illness at Screening&#xD;
             (such participants can be rescreened once the active infection or significant illness&#xD;
             has resolved).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants with history or presence of significant cardiovascular disease,&#xD;

          4. Laboratory values at Screening which are deemed by the Investigator to be clinically&#xD;
             significantly abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)&#xD;
             or hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participation in a clinical drug study during the 90 days or 5 half-lives, whichever&#xD;
             is longer, preceding the initial dose in this study (such participants can be&#xD;

         10. Participants who have received immunosuppressive therapy within the 6 months prior to&#xD;
             Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Participants with tattoos at the proposed site of vaccine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Participants who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are unsuitable for participation&#xD;
             in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Pregnant or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary&#xD;
             supplements within 28 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of IMP with the exception of contraceptives and paracetamol (applies to vaccine&#xD;
             naïve participants i.e., those who did not participate in the MVX0002 study and&#xD;

             new medical conditions which require the use of chronic medications considered as&#xD;
             permitted). If participants who participated in the MVX0002 study (either active or&#xD;
             placebo recipients) have developed new medical conditions which require the use of&#xD;
             chronic medications that do not affect the immune system, the inclusion of such&#xD;
             participants will be permitted at the discretion of the Investigator on a case-by-case&#xD;
             basis and, only if it is considered that the inclusion within the MVX0003 study will&#xD;
             not be detrimental to participant safety.&#xD;

             in the MVX0002 study and participants from the MVX0002 study (both active and placebo)&#xD;
             who have not developed new medical conditions which require the use of chronic&#xD;
             medications considered as permitted).&#xD;
