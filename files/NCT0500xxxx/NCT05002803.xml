  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls are common in older adults and may lead to disability or even death. Therefore,&#xD;
      exercise programs that focus on preventing falls by improving strength and balance are&#xD;
      important to investigate in older adults. One of the home-based exercise programs that was&#xD;
      found effective in reducing the risk of falling and the rate of subsequent falls in older&#xD;
      adults is the Otago exercise program (OEP). The OEP is an individualized home based&#xD;
      retraining program that works mainly on balance and lower extremity strength through several&#xD;
      progressive resistive exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OEP is available in English language since late 1990. However, its use in the&#xD;
      Arabic-speaking countries is limited due to the language barrier. Therefore, translating such&#xD;
      a program to the Arabic language would facilitate its use among Arabic-speaking older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To translate the Otago Exercise Program (OEP) into the Arabic language.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the feasibility of the Arabic OEP in a pilot sample of Arabic-speaking older&#xD;
           adults.&#xD;

      -  Research ethics: This study got the ethics approval from the IRB at Jordan University&#xD;
           Hospital at University of Jordan. A consent form that contains the study procedures will&#xD;
           be prepared and signed from all participants. To insure the privacy of participants,&#xD;
           every older adult will be assigned a study identification number. All results will be&#xD;
           stored in a locked cabinet/computer only accessible by the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants: Data will be collected prospectively from older adults in Jordan. Older&#xD;
           adults will be approached to complete the program via Jordan University Hospital,&#xD;
           community based organizations (e.g. Help-Age International Jordan) and social media&#xD;
           platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Translation of the Otago Exercise Program (OEP) into the Arabic language.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The permission of translating the program will be granted from its developers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  English version of the program will be translated into the Arabic language in accordance&#xD;
           with the World Health Organization (WHO) forward/backward translation protocol&#xD;
           (https://www.who.int/substance_abuse/research_tools/translation/en/ ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An Arabic booklet of the OEP will be prepared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Assessing feasibility of the OEP on a pilot sample of Arabic-speaking older adults&#xD;
      using a focus group and a pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Arabic version of the OEP will be sent to an expert panel for review. Suggested&#xD;
           changes will be considered and made.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Arabic version of the OEP will be sent to 2 groups that consist of 6-8 older adults&#xD;
           each. They will be given sufficient time to go through the exercise manual before being&#xD;
           invited to a focus group meeting to discuss the Arabic wording and feasibility of the&#xD;
           Arabic version of the OEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A topic guide will be prepared to assess the feasibility and user-friendliness of the&#xD;
           Arabic OEP manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The meeting will be recorded after taking their permission and the recording will be&#xD;
           transcribed and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there are major changes to the program, the experts will meet to make the appropriate&#xD;
           changes and another focus group will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The final version of the Arabic OEP will be implemented for 8 weeks on a pilot sample of&#xD;
           Arabic speaking older adults using pilot RCT design (N=10).&#xD;
