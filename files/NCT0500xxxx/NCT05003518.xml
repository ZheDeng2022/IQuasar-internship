  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study has two main aims. The first aim is to optimise user engagement in ParentText. The&#xD;
      goal is to identify the optimal delivery of ParentText for parents/caregivers from low- and&#xD;
      middle-income countries, using a randomised between-subjects factorial experimental design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim is to examine the preliminary effectiveness of the chatbot adaption of the&#xD;
      Parenting for Lifelong Health programme, ParentText, on the primary outcome of child&#xD;
      maltreatment and secondary outcomes of positive parenting, parental self-efficacy, parental&#xD;
      communication about sexual abuse, financial stress, parental stress, child behaviour&#xD;
      problems, and intimate partner violence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is part of a multi-phase research project. The full research project has been&#xD;
      registered to the Open Science Framework platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the first aim, the investigators will be conducting a factorial experiment which&#xD;
      will examine the impact of four components, Personalisation (High/Low), Gamification&#xD;
      (On/Off), Gender Targeting (On/Off), Frequency of message (1 per day/ 3 per day) on&#xD;
      participant engagement. The factorial experiment will be conducted in two countries, Malaysia&#xD;
      and South Africa. Within each country, the investigators have local partners who will be&#xD;
      involved in deploying the intervention and recruiting participants. Parents/caregivers will&#xD;
      be primarily recruited through country-specific UNICEF U-Report platforms and government&#xD;
      partners. RapidPro, the programme on which the chatbot is deployed, will randomly allocate&#xD;
      participants to the 16 experimental conditions. The purpose of the factorial experiment is to&#xD;
      estimate the main and interaction effects of the four components. Based on the results the&#xD;
      investigators will optimise the delivery of ParentText by selecting components or components&#xD;
      levels that promote the highest level of engagement based on effect size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim will be addressed by conducting latent growth curve models or multi-level&#xD;
      models, to examine the changes in outcome variables over time. The experiment will be&#xD;
      conducted across five countries, Malaysia, South Africa, the Philippines, Jamaica and Sri&#xD;
      Lanka. Within each country, the investigators have local partners who will be involved in&#xD;
      deploying the intervention and recruiting participants.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that the modification of parenting programmes from being held in-person to&#xD;
      being delivered digitally has been successful. Meta-analytic and systematic reviews carried&#xD;
      out in HMICs have illustrated that digital parenting interventions have similar effect sizes&#xD;
      to in-person interventions. Although these results are promising, there are few gaps within&#xD;
      the literature that have not been addressed. First, the majority of research is being&#xD;
      conducted in High-Income Countries (HICs). Therefore, results cannot be generalised to LMICs,&#xD;
      where differences in context and culture could have an impact on the effectiveness of digital&#xD;
      parenting interventions. Second, parenting interventions are deployed on a variety of&#xD;
      different technological platforms, however, a limited amount of research has focused on&#xD;
      examining emerging platforms, with the focus primarily being on app or internet-based&#xD;
      interventions. Therefore little is known in regards to the effectiveness of more novel&#xD;
      intervention platforms, such as chatbots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst the digitalisation of parenting programmes allows for the widespread dissemination and&#xD;
      utilisation of the intervention, engagement rates for digital interventions remain low.&#xD;
      Engagement with digital behaviour change interventions can be described as the extent (e.g.&#xD;
      amount, frequency, duration, depth) of usage, and as a subjective experience characterised by&#xD;
      attention, interest and affect. Low engagement compromises the effectiveness of parenting&#xD;
      programmes, as the user is required to enrol and engage with the intervention for the&#xD;
      programme to have an influence on behaviour. Intervention developers have begun employing&#xD;
      technological platforms, such as chatbots, that are designed with the intention to overcome&#xD;
      low user engagement rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parenting research investigating digital intervention components which facilitate engagement&#xD;
      remains scarce. Broadening the scope beyond the field of parenting, reviews of quantitative&#xD;
      and qualitative research examining digital behaviour change interventions, identified an&#xD;
      assortment of behaviour change techniques and persuasive system design principles which have&#xD;
      been found to facilitate and impede engagement and effectiveness. However, few consistent&#xD;
      patterns emerged regarding what techniques and principles consistently facilitate engagement&#xD;
      and effectiveness, and for whom. There is a requirement for the isolated techniques and&#xD;
      principles utilised within digital parenting interventions to be tested, to identify which&#xD;
      intervention components influence engagement and intervention effectiveness and apply this&#xD;
      research to optimise parenting interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim of this study is to optimise user engagement in ParentText and to identify the&#xD;
      optimal delivery of ParentText for parents/caregivers from low- and middle-income countries.&#xD;
      The investigators will be addressing three research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How do different component levels impact ParentText user engagement and retention in&#xD;
           terms of a) message personalisation (high/low), b) gendered targeted messages (on/off),&#xD;
           c) gamification of module completions (on/off) and d) frequency of messages (high/low)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Are there any interaction effects between different component levels of ParentText on&#xD;
           user engagement and retention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How does the effectiveness of each component or component level on user engagement vary&#xD;
           by different population characteristics (i.e., parent/child age and gender,&#xD;
           parent/caregiver marital status, parent/caregiver relationship to the child, and&#xD;
           experience of COVID-19)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The factorial experiment will be conducted across two countries, Malaysia and South Africa.&#xD;
      Within each country, the investigators have local partners who will be involved in deploying&#xD;
      the intervention and recruiting participants who take care of a child aged between 0 and 17&#xD;
      years old. Parents/caregivers will be primarily recruited through country-specific UNICEF&#xD;
      U-Report platforms and government partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following components have been selected, based on research that concluded that these&#xD;
      components have been efficient in increasing engagement with digital interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Component A: Personalisation (High/Low): Half of the participants will receive high levels of&#xD;
      personalisation, receiving messages that utilise their (nick)name and the child's (nick)name.&#xD;
      Half of the participants will not receive this type of personalisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Component B: Gendered Targeted Messages (On/Off): Half of the participants will receive&#xD;
      messages that are tailored towards either being a female or male caregiver. The other half&#xD;
      will not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Component C: Gamification of Module Completion (On/Off): Half of the participants will&#xD;
      receive a gamified progress update on what modules that they have completed. This will be&#xD;
      represented as the House of Support. As the parent completes parenting skills, the layers of&#xD;
      the house will fill in, representing their progress. The other half of the participants will&#xD;
      not be receiving gamified progress updates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Component D: Frequency of Messages (High/Low). Half of the participants will receive 3&#xD;
      interactions a day (high intensity), the other half will receive 1 interaction a day (low&#xD;
      intensity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current factorial experimental trial will randomise participants into the 16 experimental&#xD;
      conditions. Although this experiment has 16 experimental conditions, it is not a 16-arm RCT.&#xD;
      The purpose of this factorial experiment is to estimate the main and intervention effects&#xD;
      between the components and not to compare them to one another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will examine the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who receive high levels of personalisation will show higher levels of&#xD;
           engagement in ParentText, than compared to users receiving low levels of&#xD;
           personalisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who receive gender-targeted messages will show higher levels of engagement&#xD;
           in ParentText, than compared to users receiving no gender-targeted messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who receive gamified progress updates will show higher levels of engagement&#xD;
           in ParentText, than compared to users receiving non-gamified progress updates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators will explore how the frequency of messages will impact engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators will explore how the effectiveness of components on engagement will&#xD;
           vary dependent on demographic characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators will explore interaction effects between experimental components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim of the study is to examine the preliminary effectiveness of the chatbot&#xD;
      adaption of the Parenting for Lifelong Health programme, ParentText on the primary outcome of&#xD;
      child maltreatment and the secondary outcomes of positive parenting, parental self-efficacy,&#xD;
      parental communication about sexual abuse, financial stress, parental stress, child behaviour&#xD;
      problems, IPV, attitudes toward gender roles and IPV, and gender-equitable behaviours. The&#xD;
      investigators will be investigating five research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How does overall child maltreatment (primary outcome) change over time for&#xD;
           parents/caregivers engaged in the ParentText intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How do the following secondary outcomes change over time for parents/caregivers engaged&#xD;
           in the ParentText intervention: physical abuse, emotional abuse, positive parenting,&#xD;
           parental self-efficacy, parental communication about sexual abuse, financial stress,&#xD;
           parental stress, child behaviour problems, intimate partner violence (IPV) victimisation&#xD;
           and perpetration, attitudes toward intimate partner violence (IPV) and gender roles, and&#xD;
           gender-equitable behaviours?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How do changes in secondary outcomes mediate change in overall child maltreatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. How do changes in primary and secondary outcomes vary based on different population&#xD;
           characteristics (i.e., parent/child age and gender, parent/caregiver marital status,&#xD;
           parent/caregiver relationship to the child, and experience of COVID-19)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. What is the association between user engagement and change over time in primary outcomes&#xD;
           and secondary outcomes?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ParentText will have a significant impact on our primary outcome, decreasing child&#xD;
           maltreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ParentText will have a significant impact on our secondary outcomes, increasing positive&#xD;
           parenting, parental self-efficacy, parental communication about sexual abuse,&#xD;
           gender-equitable behaviours and improving attitudes toward gender roles and IPV, as well&#xD;
           as reducing financial stress, parental stress, child behaviour problems, intimate&#xD;
           partner violence (IPV) victimisation and perpetration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators will explore how the impact of ParentText will vary depending on user&#xD;
           engagement and demographic characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators will also explore interaction effects between experimental components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiment will be conducted in five countries, Malaysia, South Africa, Jamaica, the&#xD;
      Philippines and Sri Lanka. Country specific recruitment is outlined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      South Africa: Investigators will collaborate with Clowns Without Borders South Africa and the&#xD;
      Department of Social Development to deploy and recruit participants in the Northern Cape.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited by radio announcements. The investigators are also&#xD;
      collaborating with UNICEF South Africa who will assist in recruiting participants over the&#xD;
      age of 20 via their U-Report Platform (N = 79,800). UNICEF South Africa will send U-reporters&#xD;
      an unsolicited recruitment message that is accompanied by a link that takes users to the&#xD;
      landing site of ParentText.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malaysia: 20-35 participants will be recruited by our implementing partner, Generasi Gemilang&#xD;
      from their family programmes. Participants will also be recruited either by UNICEF via their&#xD;
      U-Report Platform (N = 25,200) or through the National Population and Family Development&#xD;
      Board (LPPKN), which will blast messages to individuals who have previously participated in&#xD;
      the LPPNK parenting workshops (N = 20,000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jamaica: Participants will be recruited in collaboration with UNICEF Jamaica and Parenting&#xD;
      Partners Caribbean as part of the Spotlight Initiative, a community-wide intervention aimed&#xD;
      at reducing violence against women and girls. Participants will be recruited in four parishes&#xD;
      (N = 1,000). Parents and caregivers from the Spotlight initiative will be recruited by&#xD;
      community youth activists, leaflets, radio announcements, posters, and other community-wide&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Philippines: Participants will be recruited in collaboration with the Philippine&#xD;
      Department of Social Welfare and Development. We will target families (N = 30) enrolled in a&#xD;
      conditional cash transfer programme (4Ps) who live in the Valenzuela municipality of Metro&#xD;
      Manila.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sri Lanka: Participants will be recruited in collaboration with the Health Promotion Bureau.&#xD;
      Over 492,640 people follow this channel. The population includes media personal, health care&#xD;
      service providers, community leaders, employers at all levels of industry and their&#xD;
      organisations: hotels, supermarkets, banks, Ceylon Employer's Federation and the general&#xD;
      public who uses Viber social media in Sri Lanka. The Health Promotion Bureau will select&#xD;
      randomly individuals who are over 18 to receive a recruitment message to ParentText.&#xD;

    <description>Child maltreatment will be a composite measure utilising two items adapted from the reduced version of the ISPCAN Child Abuse Screening Tool-Trial Parent Version (ICAST-TP) (Meinck et al., 2018), which is adapted from the survey instrument ICAST-Parent Version (ICAST-P) (Runyan et al., 2009). The ICAST-P was developed to be deployed multi-nationally and multi-culturally and has been successfully utilised in LMICs (Nøkleby et al., 2019). The ICAST-TP measures parental reports of incidences of abuse perpetrated against their child over the past week and asks parents/caregivers to answer a frequency score on a scale of 0 to 7 times. One item will assess physical abuse, &quot;How many days in the past week did you physically discipline your children by hitting, spanking, or slapping with your hand or an object like a stick or a belt?&quot;. The other item will assess emotional abuse, &quot;How many days in the past week did you shout, scream, or yell at your children?&quot;.</description>
