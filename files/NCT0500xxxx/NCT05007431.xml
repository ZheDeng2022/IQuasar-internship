  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asylum seekers women are particularly exposed to sexual violence. One in seven women in&#xD;
      France and one in three in the world say they have been a victim of sexual violence at least&#xD;
      once in her life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to measure the incidence of sexual violence suffered by&#xD;
      women in asylum proceedings during their first year of stay on French territory, in Marseille&#xD;
      and Nice.&#xD;

      Introduction: One in seven women in France and one in three in the world say they have been a&#xD;
      victim of sexual violence at least once in his life. They are exacerbated in vulnerable&#xD;
      populations, marginalized, in post-conflict situations or population displacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore asylum seekers women are particularly exposed to sexual violence. This is why OFPRA&#xD;
      and the Ministry of Solidarity and Health have protected these women with regard to sexual&#xD;
      violence, one of the priority issues for public health. Yet, the investigators do not know&#xD;
      the proportion of women seeking asylum who have suffered violence on French soil. In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators did not find an international study of the incidence of violence&#xD;
      sexual abuse suffered in the host country by women seeking asylum. Objective: Determine the&#xD;
      incidence of sexual violence that occurred in the year following the arrival on French soil&#xD;
      of adult women in the asylum process in Marseille and Nice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Multicentric longitudinal observational study (Marseille and Nice) based on a&#xD;
      historical cohort of sexual violence among women in the application process asylum. 1,800&#xD;
      adult women seeking asylum were registered in 2019 in Marseille and Nice. The number of&#xD;
      subjects required is 450 women (1: 4 sample of the target population).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be carried out by hetero-questionnaire carried out in the presence of&#xD;
      the questioned.&#xD;
