      The scope of this open label clinical trial is to evaluate and confirm the performance of&#xD;
      Relizema ecofoam in the improvement of the dermatitis severity, by alleviating the&#xD;
      symptomatology. The product will be applied for 42 days of treatment, 2 times per day into&#xD;
      the face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dermatologist will perform 3 clinical follow up visits to assess the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of the product&#xD;

    <description>to evaluate the eczema change through the EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index Four body regions are considered: head and neck, trunk (including genital area), upper limbs, lower limbs (including buttocks). The percentage of skin affected by eczema in each region is correlated to an area score (0 = 0: no eczema in this region; 1 = 1-9%; 2 = 10-29%; 3 = 30-49%; 4 = 50-69%; 5 = 70-89%; 6 = 90-100%: the entire region is affected by eczema).&#xD;
A severity score (0 =none, 1 = mild), 2 =moderate or 3 = severe) is then recorded for each of the four regions identified for the following four signs:&#xD;
1. Redness (erythema, inflammation);2. Thickness (induration, papulation, swelling-acute eczema); 3. Scratching (excoriation); 4. Lichenification (lined skin, prurigo nodules-chronic eczema). ) score</description>

The rating will be recorded as a distance from the left side of the scale (0 mm) to the mark made by the patient.)</description>

    <description>to evaluate change in the Quality of Life (QoL) of the subject related to his/her dermatitis, through the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index DLQI is a questionnaire used to measure the impact of skin disease on the quality of life of an affected person. There are 10 questions, covering the following topics: symptoms, embarrassment, shopping and home care, clothes, social and leisure, sport, work or study, close relationships, sex, treatment. Each question refers to the impact of the skin disease on the patient's life over the previous week.&#xD;
Each question is scored from 0 to 3, giving a possible score range from 0 (meaning no impact of skin disease on quality of life) to 30 (meaning maximum impact on quality of life).&#xD;
Global score:&#xD;
0-1 = No effect on patient's life 2-5 = Small effect 6-10 = Moderate effect 11-20 = Very large effect 21-30 = Extremely large effect. The DQLI will be compiled by the subject at each visit.) questionnaire;</description>
