      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A radiotracer (or tracer) is a radioactive substance. It is used in Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography (PET) imaging to help see specific sites in the body. Researchers want to learn if&#xD;
      a new tracer can help them better identify hepatocellular cancer (HCC) in people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if a radiotracer called 18F-DCFPyL can identify sites of HCC better than current&#xD;
      standard imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults aged 18 years and older who may have HCC based on previous standard imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests. They&#xD;
      will have a computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a whole-body PET/CT scan. The PET and CT scanners use x-rays to make&#xD;
      pictures of the inside of the body. The PET uses a tracer to help make the pictures.&#xD;
      Participants will get an intravenous (IV) injection of 18F-DCFPyL 1 hour before the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within two weeks, participants will have a 18F-FDG PET/CT scan. 18F-FDG is a commonly used&#xD;
      tracer. They will get 18F-FDG via IV 1 hour before the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a CT/MRI within 2 months of the first 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have standard treatment for their cancer (ablation therapy). During&#xD;
      treatment, they will have a tumor biopsy. If the biopsy shows they do not have HCC, they will&#xD;
      be removed from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants who have HCC and their cancer was identified in the 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT, they&#xD;
      will have a second 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up visits every 3 months for 2 years. Then they will have&#xD;
      yearly visits for 3 years....&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate specific membrane antigen is overexpressed in high-grade tumors, and increases when&#xD;
      de-differentiation, metastatic or hormone-refractory disease occur, making the expression&#xD;
      level a prognostic factor for disease outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that PSMA can be expressed not only on prostate cancer cells, but also on&#xD;
      cell lines of other malignancies, as well as tumor endothelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent publication reported that nearly 95% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) stained&#xD;
      positive for PSMA in the tumor vasculature. Research suggests that the process of endothelial&#xD;
      cell recruitment to HCC occurs early and throughout the process of hepatic tumorigenesis,&#xD;
      making an endothelial cell tracer an ideal marker to detect early disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-DCFPyL, a second generation PSMA PET agent, binds with high affinity to PSMA yet clears&#xD;
      rapidly from the blood pool and thus, whole-body PET imaging with this agent, may provide a&#xD;
      new tool in staging high risk cancers and detecting recurrent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to expand our clinical work using 18F-DCFPyL, and evaluate its usefulness for&#xD;
      detecting sites of hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the ability of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging to detect sites of hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants &gt;= 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
      High radiological suspicion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with at least one measurable&#xD;
      lesion on standard imaging modality (CT and/or MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance score of 0 to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-site imaging study enrolling participants with suspected hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma. The accrual ceiling is set to 50 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo a baseline 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scan. A standard of care CT and/or&#xD;
      MRI will be performed within 2 months of the 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT. Participants will be also&#xD;
      scanned with an 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging within approximately 2 weeks of the 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be scheduled to undergo a biopsy prior or during standard of care local&#xD;
      ablative treatment for HCC (e.g. radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, transarterial&#xD;
      embolization (TAE), stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with a baseline positive 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT imaging (i.e. with the presence of&#xD;
      DCFPyL-avid tumor/s) and biopsy confirming HCC diagnosis will undergo a post-treatment&#xD;
      18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging during the first routine follow-up period, typically within 4-8&#xD;
      weeks. Subjects with negative tumor uptake at baseline 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT will not be&#xD;
      re-scanned post-treatment but will remain in follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with a positive HCC biopsy will be followed for 5 years to assess progression&#xD;
      free survival.&#xD;
