  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seasonal allergic rhinitis has multiple consequences: sleep disturbances, fatigue, depressed&#xD;
      mood, impaired quality of life and productivity, and co-morbid conditions such as asthma,&#xD;
      which affects one third of AR patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Europe, more than 150 million people suffer from allergic rhinitis and more than 25&#xD;
      million suffer from asthma. About 30% have uncontrolled rhinitis during exposure to&#xD;
      allergens. The impact of allergic diseases on work productivity is estimated to be between 30&#xD;
      and 50 billion € per year in the EU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies show that pollution can play a role in the amplification of the response to inhaled&#xD;
      pollen allergens by inducing morphological and functional modifications of nasal and&#xD;
      bronchial epithelia, but also by inducing structural modifications of allergenic molecules.&#xD;
      However, although data show that the symptoms of AR are aggravated by exposure to air&#xD;
      pollution, this effect is not observed for all pollens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study area is very exposed to pollens (with a significant presence of cypress pollen) and&#xD;
      air pollution, and presents a prevalence of asthma of 17% while the national average is about&#xD;
      7%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to establish, if they exist, links between pollens of various&#xD;
      species, air pollution and symptoms of allergic rhinitis. The knowledge of these links will&#xD;
      allow public authorities to set up prevention actions, and patients to better manage their&#xD;
      allergic rhinitis on a daily basis.&#xD;

      For this study, the investigators will collect real life data from volunteer citizens via the&#xD;
      MASK-air® mobile application, and exposure data to air pollutants and pollens from their&#xD;
      partners. The data will be collected over one year in order to cover all pollen seasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A communication of the project will be deployed to the citizens in the study area. The&#xD;
      recruitment of participants will be done via an internet page accessible to all and&#xD;
      presenting the MISTRAL study. Interested citizens can then access the electronic consent&#xD;
      platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the participation agreement, they will receive a link to download the MASK-air®&#xD;
      mobile application (freely available via the Android and Apple stores) and a personal study&#xD;
      code, which will allow them to install the application on their smartphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will report their symptoms on the MASK-air app on a daily basis. Entry will only&#xD;
      take 1 minute/day. This real-life data will be correlated with air pollution and pollen&#xD;
      exposure data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In anticipation of the prevention actions that will be deployed by the public authorities&#xD;
      following this study, an analysis of the expectations and needs of the citizens will be&#xD;
      carried out among a part of the participants in the form of 4 questionnaires.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Through the whole 1-year data collection period, an average participation of 30 days per participant is expected.</time_frame>
    <description>A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) measuring the global discomfort and the use of medication will be completed by the participants through the MASK-air mobile app.&#xD;
The minimum value of this VAS is 0 and means &quot;no symptoms&quot;. The maximum value of the VAS is 100 and means worse outcome.</description>
