    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand how the drug rivaroxaban improves symptoms&#xD;
      associated with peripheral artery disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Primary Investigator's central hypothesis is that activation of thrombotic pathways and&#xD;
      downstream effectors of factor Xa signaling contribute to the development of PAD and its&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To assess the impact of rivaroxaban on macro- and microvascular endothelial function&#xD;
      in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover intervention in humans with PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To assess the impact of rivaroxaban on PAR-1-mediated platelet activation in addition&#xD;
      to its pleiotropic effects on thrombosis, thrombolysis, and inflammation in a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover intervention in humans with PAD.&#xD;
