      Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, multiple-dose, multiple-arm, parallel assignment study in&#xD;
      patients with mCRPC who have progressed after treatment with at least 2 prior lines of&#xD;
      anticancer therapy. It will enroll subjects into one of 5 molecularly defined cohorts based&#xD;
      on the results of acceptable, documented prior diagnostic testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort A: Aggressive variant (anaplastic) adenocarcinoma of the prostate (AVPCa)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B: Homologous recombination deficient (HRD)/cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12)&#xD;
           mutation positive tumors that have progressed on poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose&#xD;
           polymerase inhibitors (HRD/CDK12 PARP Progressors)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort C: HRD/CDK12 mutation positive tumors not previously treated with PARP inhibitors&#xD;
           (HRD/CDK12 PARP Naïve)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort D: Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (MMRD)&#xD;
           tumors (MSI-H/MMRD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort E: No Targetable Mutations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive XmAb20717 alone (Cohort D) or in combination with standard therapy&#xD;
      (XmAb20717 + carboplatin + cabazitaxel [or docetaxel if no prior treatment]: Cohorts A, B,&#xD;
      and E; XmAb20717 + olaparib: Cohort C).&#xD;
