  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has presented considerable challenges to global health services and&#xD;
      dictates almost every aspect of medical practice and policy. The menopausal transition may&#xD;
      have significant consequences for respiratory health as COVID 19 symptoms subsides, lung&#xD;
      function testing should be done to assess the consequences of this virus on lung health&#xD;
      especially in menopausal woman.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study group will consist of (40) obese menopausal women whom were recently recovered from&#xD;
      mild-moderate COVID 19 for one month. The control group will consist of (40) obese menopausal&#xD;
      women; whom will not affected by COVID 19. Using incentive spirometer, we will measure forced&#xD;
      vital capacity FVC, forced expiratory volume FEV, Tiffano index TI and peak expiratory force&#xD;
      PEF in both groups.&#xD;

    <measure>Forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>FEV1 will be measured after 1 month post COVID19 recovery.</time_frame>
    <description>is a measurement of your ability to expel air from your lungs. More specifically, and as its name suggests, it is the amount that is exhaled in the first second of purposefully trying to breathe out as much air as possible.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>forced vital capacity (FVC)</measure>
    <time_frame>FVC will be measured after 1 month post COVID19 recovery.</time_frame>
    <description>is the total amount of air exhaled during the FEV test.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>FEV1/FVC ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>FEV1/FVC ratio will be measured after 1 month post COVID19 recovery.</time_frame>
    <description>The FEV1/FVC ratio, also called Tiffeneau-Pinelli index, is a calculated ratio used in the diagnosis of obstructive and restrictive lung disease. It represents the proportion of a person's vital capacity that they are able to expire in the first second of forced expiration to the full, forced vital capacity.</description>

    <intervention_name>Spirometry</intervention_name>
    <description>Spirometry assesses the integrated mechanical function of the lung, chest wall, respiratory muscles, and airways by measuring the total volume of air exhaled from a full lung (total lung capacity [TLC]) to maximal expiration (residual volume [RV]). This volume, the forced vital capacity (FVC) and the forced expiratory volume in the first second of the forceful exhalation (FEV1), should be repeatable to within 0.15 L upon repeat efforts in the same measurement unless the largest value for either parameter is less than 1 L. In this case, the expected repeatability is to within 0.1 L of the largest value.</description>
