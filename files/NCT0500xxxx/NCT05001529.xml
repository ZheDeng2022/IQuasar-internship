  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, characterized by reversible airflow obstruction, airway&#xD;
      hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation, in which 40% of patients exhibit&#xD;
      eosinophil-driven pathobiology.The main treatment of asthma is the use of corticosteroid,&#xD;
      whose use induces a reduction in eosinophils that is considered a strong predictor of&#xD;
      response to treatment. Corticosteroids have remained the mainstay treatment of asthma and&#xD;
      reduction in eosinophils has remained the unequivocal predictor of steroid response. The&#xD;
      prevalence of asthma, which is expected to increase, it is about 300 million people&#xD;
      worldwide. About 5-10% of asthma patients have severe disease, which is defined as asthma&#xD;
      that requires high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) plus a second controller to prevent it&#xD;
      from becoming &quot;uncontrolled&quot; or which remains &quot;uncontrolled&quot; despite this therapy. Patients&#xD;
      with severe disease have worse quality of life, and disproportionately high morbidity,&#xD;
      mortality, and use of health care resources when compared with their peers with&#xD;
      well-controlled disease.The pathophysiology of asthma is complex and heterogeneous between&#xD;
      patients, as the disease itself; however, on the basis of immune system involvement, it is&#xD;
      possible to define 2 subtypes - or endotypes- of asthma. These endotypes are named T2 (for&#xD;
      type 2 cells) high or low, and are defined by the levels of expression of the T2 cytokines,&#xD;
      IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 produced by T helper 2 lymphocytes, and innate lymphoid cell-2.T2 high&#xD;
      endotype patients display an increase in the number of blood and sputum eosinophils, and have&#xD;
      a better response to the current available biological therapies , such as the administration&#xD;
      of mepolizumab (anti IL-5 antibody). Eosinophilic asthma is associated to a more severe&#xD;
      clinical phenotype,but patients with a T2 endotype respond better to biological therapies.&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the present proposal is that the activation status of these cells, analyzed&#xD;
      by the expression of activation markers, can be used to define a new, different, endotype, in&#xD;
      which eosinophils, although quantitatively low or normal, are qualitatively more active and&#xD;
      aggressive, and could therefore act as an indicator of the progression toward a T2 high&#xD;
      endotype.Moreover, the investigators will verify whether a different expression of these&#xD;
      molecules on eosinophil's surface might be associated with different clinical response to&#xD;
      biologic medications.&#xD;

      Subject satisfying eligibility criteria will be asked to participate the study; all will&#xD;
      receive a detailed explanation of the nature of the study, of the aims and objectives. After&#xD;
      having signed informed consent, patients will be divided into two groups, based on their&#xD;
      clinical status: controlled asthma group (group A) and severe asthma group (group B). Visits&#xD;
      will be planned at recruitment, after a run-in period (3-months), meant to optimize first and&#xD;
      second lines medical treatment and confirm diagnosis of severe asthma. After the run-in&#xD;
      period, patients will be re-evaluated and appropriate medical therapy will be tailored (T0).&#xD;
      To group B, therapy with Mepolizumab or Omalizumab will be given, according to standard&#xD;
      guidelines. At T0 a blood sample will be collected (3ml) to evaluate eosinophils phenotype by&#xD;
      flow cytometry (see below). After 6 months (T1/2) and12 months (T1) patients will be visited&#xD;
      again and a blood sample will be taken for flow cytometry analysis.All samples will be&#xD;
      properly stored and shipped for analysis, according to best of practice and state of art&#xD;
      criteria, within 6 hours from sample's collection. Data will be collected and stored&#xD;
      according to the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation, EU 2016/679). Biological material&#xD;
      collected will be used only for the indicated assay and excess material will be discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline evaluation (T'0) In case of acceptance, and after signing an informed consent,&#xD;
           participants will be asked to collect a complete medical history, including allergies&#xD;
           and Asthma related comorbidities; a comprehensive physical examination and respiratory&#xD;
           function tests consisting of: flow-volume spirometry plus residual volume and DLCO&#xD;
           determination. In case of a first diagnosis of asthma a bronchodilator response or a&#xD;
           methacholine challenge tests will be obtained. In case of a preexistent diagnosis of&#xD;
           asthma, previous examination confirming and proving the diagnosis will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation Tool The following data will be collected at T'0, T'1/2 (six months) and T'1&#xD;
           (twelve months): Clinical assessment: ACT, on demand or rescue therapy, acute&#xD;
           exacerbations, medical visits, working absences, hospital admissions. Functional&#xD;
           assessment: Flow volume curve, Residual volume, Ig E and eosinophils' count, FeNO, 6&#xD;
           minutes walk test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flow cytometry The investigators will evaluate, by multicolor flow cytometry, the&#xD;
           expression of molecules on eosinophils'membrane, using a whole-blood staining protocol,&#xD;
           so that blood samples will be minimally manipulated, thus reducing the possibility of&#xD;
           artifacts. Briefly, peripheral blood samples will be processed within 6 hours from&#xD;
           withdrawal. Samples will be stored at room temperature until processing. Blood samples&#xD;
           will be stained, using fluorochrome conjugates antibodies directed towards&#xD;
           eosinophils'surface molecules. In particular, the investigators will use antibodies&#xD;
           against CD45, CD66, CD15, CD16 and Siglec-8, which will be used to identify eosinophils&#xD;
           between other leukocytes; CD63, CD294 (CRTH2, prostaglandin D2 receptor), CD125 (IL-5&#xD;
           receptor), CD193 (receptor for several chemokines, as for example RANTES, Eotaxin,&#xD;
           MCP-3, MIP1α), and HLA-DR: these molecules are upregulated with eosinophils activation,&#xD;
           so they can have an altered expression in severe asthma patients. After 30 minutes&#xD;
           incubation at 4°C, FACS lysing solution (BD Bioscience) will be used to remove&#xD;
           erythrocytes, according to manufacturer's instruction. Samples will be resuspended in&#xD;
           phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and acquired on a LSRFortessa X-20 (BD Bioscience) flow&#xD;
           cytometer, equipped with four lasers.&#xD;
