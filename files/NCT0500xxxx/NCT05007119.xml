    <textblock>
      A randomized control trial will be done on diagnosed Low Back Pain patients in Fauji&#xD;
      Foundation Hospital Rawalpindi. There is a growing interest and demand in the field of&#xD;
      Complementary And Alternative Medicine(CAM), nowadays .The purpose of the study is to&#xD;
      determine the effects of cupping therapy combined with conventional physical therapy to&#xD;
      exercise to lower the pain and improve the health related quality of life of the patient&#xD;
      using the modified SF - 36 scale. The conventional physical therapy includes hot pack placed&#xD;
      on the low back region for ten minutes, interferential current therapy was used which has&#xD;
      four round electrodes measuring 2.75 inches placed on the desired area(low back) waveform&#xD;
      used was IFC- 4p , having a carrier frequency of 4000 Hz and a frequency of 80/150 Hz, vector&#xD;
      scan was off , the intensity was increased manually according to the capacity of the patient&#xD;
      and the treatment time was 15 minutes, strenghtening exercises such as william flexion were&#xD;
      done once in the rehabilition center and patient was given a home plan to follow twice daily&#xD;
      with 15 repitions each.&#xD;

      Experimental Group (A) = This group will receive cupping therapy every month combined with&#xD;
      conventional physical therapy whhich includes hot pack , interferential therapy and&#xD;
      streghtening exercises for back and their outcomes wi;; be measured at baseline and at the&#xD;
      end of 6th month treatment..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group (B) =this group will not receive cuppping therapy , only conventional Physical&#xD;
      therapy will be given and their outcomes will be observed at the baseline and then after&#xD;
      treatment of 06 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis techniques:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analyzed through SPSS 21 and Data would be analyzed based on the study&#xD;
      design chosen that is random control experimental study within the community using the VAS&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A printed questionnaire will be provided to the parents after obtaining written consent and&#xD;
      providing adequate explanation regarding the study, after which the data will be presented in&#xD;
      the form of graphs or tables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will make people become aware of their current physical fitness level, so the&#xD;
      lifestyle behaviors can be modified if needed, in order to improve their quality of life This&#xD;
      study will help create awareness among the people, it is not only economically accessible but&#xD;
      also have very little chances of side effects This study will open new doors for researchers&#xD;
      to do long term studies on different types of pain with different exercise types.&#xD;
