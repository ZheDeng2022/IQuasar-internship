  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the added value of mobile health (mHealth) to&#xD;
      detect atrial fibrillation (AF) early in the care path of cryptogenic stroke and transient&#xD;
      ischemic attack (TIA) patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of photoplethysmography (PPG)-based mHealth (with smartphone and smartwatch) is&#xD;
      compared to the guideline-recommended insertable loop recorders (ILR) in the detection of AF&#xD;
      in cryptogenic stroke or TIA patients.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Group 1 uses PPG-based mHealth with a smartphone; two times a day, a spot-check measurement is taken; and in case of symptoms, additional measurements can be taken.&#xD;
Group 2 uses PPG-based mHealth with a smartwatch, this results in semi-continuous measurements that are performed automatically.</intervention_model_description>
