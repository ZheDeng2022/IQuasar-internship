  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the most effective messages for encouraging patients&#xD;
      with chronic conditions, who have not seen their doctor in at least one year, to return to&#xD;
      the clinic. Study participants will receive postcards or letters encouraging them to make an&#xD;
      appointment. Researchers will assess whether messages increase appointment scheduling (and&#xD;
      attendance).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 18,500 Geisinger patients, Geisinger Health Plan members, and Medicaid patients with&#xD;
      chronic illness have not been seen in a clinic for at least one year, which is concerning&#xD;
      because regular appointments are necessary for chronic disease management. Geisinger is&#xD;
      therefore working to encourage those with chronic illness and overdue appointments to return&#xD;
      to the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, patients will either receive a mailer (with a message encouraging them&#xD;
      to schedule an appointment with their physician), or no mailer. The purpose of the study is&#xD;
      to compare three different mailers to assess which is most effective at encouraging patients&#xD;
      to schedule and attend an appointment. The three mailers include (1) a standard outreach&#xD;
      postcard (emphasizing that we are &quot;checking in&quot; with the patient), and, informed by&#xD;
      behavioral science research, (2) a postcard with a cartoon and humorous messages and (3) a&#xD;
      letter signed by a physician. The study will compare the effectiveness of the three&#xD;
      experimental mailer arms to each other and to a no-contact control arm.&#xD;

    <description>Proportion of appointments (from the primary outcome) that were attended. This outcome focuses on attendance at appointments that were scheduled within 30 days of the mailer drop date.&#xD;
It is possible to schedule an appointment months in advance, so the Time Frame needs to be long to capture attendance at any appointment scheduled within 30 days of the mailer. 180 days should be sufficient to capture all scheduled appointments.</description>
