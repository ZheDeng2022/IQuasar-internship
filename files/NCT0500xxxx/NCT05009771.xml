  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caesarean section is one of the most frequent surgeries causing severe postoperative pain.&#xD;
      Poor management of acute pain can contribute to postoperative complications, late recovery&#xD;
      and the development of chronic pain. Moreover, it had been demonstrated that the intensity of&#xD;
      postpartum pain is associated with depression. It is imperative to find out appropriate&#xD;
      methods of postpartum pain alleviation. Currently, a lot of analgesic drugs and methods have&#xD;
      been developed and used in clinical practice, such as patient-controlled analgesia,&#xD;
      extended-release analgesics and multimodal analgesia. This prospective cohort study is aimed&#xD;
      to investigate the outcome of each postoperative analgesic method used in caesarean section.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a prospective, observational, cohort study. Patients undergoing elective caesarean&#xD;
      section will be invited to the study. The written informed consent will be obtained prior to&#xD;
      participation. After getting the written informed consent, data will be collected from&#xD;
      medical records, questionnaires, patient diaries, visit records and telephone visit records.&#xD;
      Through telephone visits, postpartum depression scale and postpartum chronic pain will be&#xD;
      evaluated six weeks and three months after delivery. Demographic data, consumption of&#xD;
      analgesics, analgesic methods, intensity of postoperative pain, complications, recovery time,&#xD;
      score of depression scale will all be summarized. Numerical variables will be present with&#xD;
      mean and standard deviation and categorical variables will be present with number and&#xD;
      percentage.&#xD;

    <measure>Satisfaction assessed by a four-point scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks after delivery</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked to assess the satisfaction toward rate of recovery progress and pain management through 6 questions six weeks after delivery. Each question contain 4 choices: very satisfied, satisfied, dissatisfied and very dissatisfied.</description>
