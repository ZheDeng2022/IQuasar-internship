    <textblock>
      Introduction: Living with chronic pain often involves negative consequences.&#xD;
      Interdisciplinary Pain Rehabilitation Programs (IPRPs), a subset of Interdisciplinary&#xD;
      Treatment (IDT) includes physical activity and exercise and is considered superior to&#xD;
      single-treatment measures in patients with chronic pain. However, effects emerge sub-optimal&#xD;
      and as many as 30% of patients deteriorate in some outcomes. A novel intervention,&#xD;
      eVISualisation (eVIS) of physical activity and pain, has been systematically developed to&#xD;
      facilitate patients in reaching and maintaining recommended individualized physical activity&#xD;
      levels. The aim is to transparently report on methodology, outcome assessments, and processes&#xD;
      for a registry-based randomized controlled trial (R-RCT) initiated as an internal pilot&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis: The R-RCT will recruit approximately 400 patients with chronic pain who&#xD;
      are registered at primary and specialized IPRP units (n=15) in Sweden. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to either an IPRP + eVIS or the control group that will receive only IPRP&#xD;
      treatment. eVIS entails objectively measured physical activity (steps) and patient-reported&#xD;
      outcomes (pain intensity, affect on daily activities, pharmaceutical consumption) collected&#xD;
      and visualized in the web application PATRON. Data from an initial 30 participants completing&#xD;
      the study period (6 months) will be included in a pilot study designed to evaluate&#xD;
      recruitment- and randomization processes, standardized effect size, sample size,&#xD;
      characteristics of outcomes, follow-up rates of the R-RCT. Outcome variables will be&#xD;
      extracted from PATRON and from six national registries. Multivariate statistics and repeated&#xD;
      measures analyses will be performed. Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and Incremental Cost&#xD;
      Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) will be calculated for cost effectiveness evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics/dissemination: The Swedish Ethics Review Board granted approval (Dnr 2021/02109).&#xD;
      Results will be disseminated through peer-review journals.&#xD;

    <description>To facilitate individualized physical activity levels within the Swedish IPRP setting, an eVISualisation (eVIS) of physical activity and pain intervention has been systematically developed. eVIS is designed to target facilitating mechanisms for behavior change, such as outcome expectations, self-monitoring, self-evaluation, and self-efficacy, which are theoretically framed by the Social Cognitive Theory by Bandura. In eVIS, objectively measured physical activity tracking using a wrist-worn activity tracker (Fitbit Versa 2) is combined with a daily activity goal (steps/day) and daily patient reports of known important clinical outcome assessments: pain intensity and its affect on daily activities30-34 and pharmaceutical consumption. Data is collected and visualized in a purpose-developed web application, Pin And TRaining ON-line (PATRON), which can be used by the patient and the IPRP-team to follow and adjust individual physical activity levels.</description>
