  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim is to investigate whether there is a difference between methods when a&#xD;
      standardized visual analogue scale is used to measure appetite in the home-setting compared&#xD;
      to a monitored clinical setting. Furthermore, the intention is to investigate differences in&#xD;
      appetite response between diets based on rye or wheat products, as well as the effects on&#xD;
      postprandial metabolic response to such diets. Lastly, the effect of venous blood collection&#xD;
      on subjective appetite response will be evaluated.&#xD;

      A human dietary intervention study will be conducted at clinical facilities in Gothenburg.&#xD;
      The study will be a randomized crossover trial where 30 overweight, but healthy men and women&#xD;
      will be recruited. The overall aim is to investigate whether there is a difference between&#xD;
      methods when a standardized visual analogue scale (VAS) is used to measure appetite in the&#xD;
      home-setting compared to a monitored clinical setting. Furthermore, the intention is to&#xD;
      investigate difference in appetite response between diets based on rye or wheat products, as&#xD;
      well as the effects on postprandial metabolic response to such diets. Lastly, the effect of&#xD;
      venous blood collection on subjective appetite response will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be complete 3 clinic-based appetite assessments and 2 home-based appetite&#xD;
      assessments in random order. The intervention diets will include a fixed amount of rye or&#xD;
      wheat cereal products (approx. 650 kcal) as part of a hypocaloric diet with 500 kcal deficit,&#xD;
      irrespective of energy requirements of the individual. Participants will follow a&#xD;
      standardized meal plan, incorporating intervention products according to their allocation.&#xD;
      The meal plan will consist of a breakfast consisting of puffs with milk. The lunch will&#xD;
      consist of tomato soup with crisp bread and cheese/jam, and afternoon snack will consist of&#xD;
      crisp bread with cheese/jam. Finally, the dinner will consist of goulash soup with soft or&#xD;
      crisp bread and jam/cheese. The participants will be provided with all foods needed for this&#xD;
      meal plan. During the day participants will need to answer questions about their appetite&#xD;
      every 30 minutes from 8:00 to 12:00 and every 60 minutes from 13:00 to 21:00. These&#xD;
      questionnaires with VAS will provide data for the comparison of home-setting and monitored&#xD;
      clinical setting as well as appetite response between diets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One out of the three clinic-based assessment days will include continues blood sampling&#xD;
      throughout the day allowing evaluation of subjective appetite response on venous blood&#xD;
      collection. Also, blood samples will be analyzed for concentration of appetite regulating&#xD;
      hormones; glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), cholecystokinin (CCK) and ghrelin. Furthermore,&#xD;
      insulin and triglyceride concentration will be measured as well as exploratory analysis of&#xD;
      metabolome, short chain fatty acids (SCFA), epigenetics and gene expression analyses.&#xD;
      Baseline fecal samples will be collected and analyzed for composition of the gut microbiome&#xD;
      as well as short chain fatty acids (SCFA). Participants will wear a so-called continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitors CGM allowing analysis of postprandial blood glucose throughout all 5&#xD;
      appetite assessment days. Measurement of physical activity will be done using Acti-Watches&#xD;
      throughout the intervention.&#xD;
