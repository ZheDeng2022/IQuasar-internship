      The overall aim of the study is to compare the safety of simultaneous RZV (SHINGRIX®) and&#xD;
      inactivated adjuvanted influenza vaccine aIIV4 (FLUAD®) versus simultaneous RZV (SHINGRIX®)&#xD;
      and inactivated influenza HD-IIV4 (Fluzone® HD) vaccine in persons ≥65 years. A prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, blinded clinical trial that will be conducted during the 2021/2022 and 2022/2023&#xD;
      influenza seasons. Over the course of these two influenza seasons, approximately 220 older&#xD;
      adults will be enrolled at Duke University Medical Center, and 180 older adults at Johns&#xD;
      Hopkins University Medical Center. Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      simultaneous RZV/aIIV4 or RZV/HD-IIV4 vaccines. All subjects will be assessed for 7 days&#xD;
      post-injection and safety and tolerability compared between the two groups. Serious adverse&#xD;
      events and adverse events of clinical interest will be assessed 42 days post-vaccination and&#xD;
      compared between the two groups. Health-related quality of life will be assessed&#xD;
      pre-vaccination Day 1 through Day 8.&#xD;
