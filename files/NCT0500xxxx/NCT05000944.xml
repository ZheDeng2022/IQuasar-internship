  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repeated, elevated levels of glucose (sugar) within the blood after eating can lead to type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. In adults, eating breakfast lowers blood glucose responses to subsequent meals when&#xD;
      compared with skipping breakfast. Yet, adolescent girls may respond differently due to&#xD;
      differences in how their bodies use energy. This is important because around 80% of the&#xD;
      United Kingdom (UK) adolescent girls skip breakfast. As common reasons for skipping breakfast&#xD;
      in adolescent girls are 'lack of time' and 'not hungry' in the morning, eating breakfast&#xD;
      during the mid-morning may be an attractive option for them. This project will be the first&#xD;
      to compare the impact of eating breakfast in the early morning and mid-morning with skipping&#xD;
      breakfast on subsequent blood glucose levels in adolescent girls who usually skip breakfast.&#xD;
      The findings will inform recommendations tailored to an 'at risk' and under-researched&#xD;
      population for type 2 diabetes prevention, which is more effective than a cure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dietary manipulations that can moderate postprandial glycaemia and insulinaemia are at the&#xD;
      cornerstone of type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevention. Indeed, repeated glycaemic excursions cause&#xD;
      oxidative stress, inflammation, and atherosclerosis, increasing T2D risk. Adolescence is a&#xD;
      critical time to promote dietary behaviours that can be sustained across the lifespan. Among&#xD;
      the dietary factors influencing postprandial glycaemia, the decline in breakfast consumption&#xD;
      during adolescence in girls is of concern, with only ~20% of UK adolescent girls consuming&#xD;
      breakfast daily. Cross-sectional and prospective observational studies show that infrequent&#xD;
      breakfast consumption is associated with T2D risk markers (e.g., glucose, insulin) in&#xD;
      adolescents and T2D manifestation in adults. Randomised controlled trials in adults suggest&#xD;
      that improvements in glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity may be key to explaining the&#xD;
      reduced T2D risk when contrasting breakfast consumption with breakfast omission. Acutely,&#xD;
      breakfast omission exaggerates glycaemic and insulinaemic responses to subsequent meals when&#xD;
      compared to breakfast consumption, which has been termed the 'second-meal effect'. Thus, two&#xD;
      moderate glycaemic responses (with breakfast and lunch) would be potentially better for&#xD;
      reducing T2D risk than one very large glycaemic excursion (after lunch). Yet, findings based&#xD;
      on adults may not apply to the distinct hormonal and metabolic profiles of adolescent girls.&#xD;
      Specifically, it is proposed that the 'second-meal effect' occurs due to increased glucose&#xD;
      conversion into muscle glycogen in adults. Such responses may differ in adolescents due to&#xD;
      their higher reliance on exogenous glucose and fat as fuels with a lower reliance on&#xD;
      endogenous glucose and reduced capacity for muscle glycogen storage, in addition to the 32%&#xD;
      reduction in insulin sensitivity occurring from pre- to mid-puberty. Unfortunately, current&#xD;
      knowledge on breakfast and glycaemia in adolescents relies entirely on a few novel studies&#xD;
      that have pooled data from 13 to 20 year olds with little consideration of pubertal status&#xD;
      and sex. Hence, the glycaemic responses to breakfast manipulation in adolescent girls are not&#xD;
      still well understood. Common barriers to consuming breakfast among adolescent girls include&#xD;
      not being hungry and a lack of time in the morning. As such, the option to consume breakfast&#xD;
      later in the morning may be an attractive alternative for this population. In terms of&#xD;
      timing, definitions have proposed that breakfast is consumed within 2-3 hours of waking,&#xD;
      typically no later than 10:00. Yet, inconsistent definitions have been employed across the&#xD;
      literature, mainly because evidence to inform a health-based (e.g., focused on glycaemic&#xD;
      improvements) breakfast timing 'cut-off' is lacking. Thus, the unique contribution of this&#xD;
      proposal is the use of an experimental cross-over design to directly contrast the effects of&#xD;
      consuming an early-morning versus mid-morning standardised breakfast with breakfast omission&#xD;
      on postprandial glycaemia and insulinaemia in adolescent girls classified as habitual&#xD;
      breakfast skippers. By focusing on adolescent girls, breakfast timing and postprandial&#xD;
      glycaemia, this proposal is unique, topical and has potential impact for T2D prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Girls will be recruited from local schools after gaining parental informed consent and child&#xD;
      assent. These schools have expressed an interest in facilitating recruitment for the proposed&#xD;
      research by providing a platform to invite girls to participate and permission for time off&#xD;
      school to complete the measures. The participants will be invited to attend an assembly at&#xD;
      their school and those that wish to discuss their participation with a parent/primary&#xD;
      caregiver will take an information pack home that includes written details of the study. On&#xD;
      return of a contact form, students and their primary caregiver will be asked to complete the&#xD;
      consent, assent and pre-participation health screen questionnaire, before registration on the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will employ a cross-over design. Participants will complete three conditions&#xD;
      assigned according to the Latin square method: breakfast omission (BO), early-morning&#xD;
      breakfast consumption (EM-BC) and mid-morning breakfast consumption (MM-BC). The conditions&#xD;
      will be conducted ~7 days apart in girls who have not started their menses or in the&#xD;
      early-follicular phase (~28 days apart) in girls with regular menses to minimise the&#xD;
      potential confounding influence of menstrual cycle phase. In the 48 hours before the&#xD;
      conditions, dietary intakes, bed time and wake/out of bed times will be replicated, and&#xD;
      vigorous physical activity will be minimised (as confirmed via accelerometry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an overnight fast, resting metabolic rate (RMR) and substrate oxidation will be&#xD;
      estimated via expired air analysis, and a capillary blood sample for the measurement of&#xD;
      plasma glucose and insulin will be taken (~08:15 to 08:30). These measures will be collected&#xD;
      at regular intervals, with a standardised lunch consumed at 4 h (~12:30) and followed by a&#xD;
      2-h lunch postprandial period. The standardised breakfast will be provided immediately after&#xD;
      fasting measures at ~08:30 for EM-BC and 2 hours later at ~10:30 for MM-BC. Participants will&#xD;
      remain sedentary throughout. Water intake will be replicated between the conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test meals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A carbohydrate-rich, low glycaemic index (GI) breakfast providing ~70% carbohydrate, ~17% fat&#xD;
      and ~13% protein will be used. The breakfast will be provided in quantities containing 0.04 g&#xD;
      carbohydrate per kcal of individualised daily RMR. The standardised lunch providing 0.06 g of&#xD;
      carbohydrate per kcal of daily RMR will be based on high GI carbohydrate. Meal consumption&#xD;
      time will be limited to 15 minutes and replicated between the conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-lunch (2 hours) and total trial (6 hours) incremental area under the curve (IAUC) will&#xD;
      be calculated using the trapezium rule for the primary outcomes, plasma glucose and insulin.&#xD;
      and the secondary outcomes, resting energy expenditure and substrate oxidation rates. In&#xD;
      addition, peak plasma glucose concentration after lunch will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linear mixed models will be used to compare all outcome variables between the conditions.&#xD;
      Models will include fixed effects for condition (and time for the condition by time analyses)&#xD;
      and a random intercept for participants, and will be adjusted for important covariates (e.g.,&#xD;
      pubertal status). The Holm-Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons will be applied.&#xD;
      Normality will be checked using Shapiro Wilk tests. Statistical significance will be accepted&#xD;
      at p≤0.05. Cohen's effect sizes will be used to gauge the magnitude of differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on 80% power at an alpha level of p=0.05, it is estimated that 21 breakfast skipping&#xD;
      adolescent girls are required to detect a meaningful between-condition difference (Cohen's&#xD;
      f=0.36) in post-lunch plasma glucose area under the curve. Recruitment will target 27&#xD;
      participants across the two study sites to account for an expected 20% attrition rate.&#xD;
