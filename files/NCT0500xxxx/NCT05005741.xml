  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, open label, randomized controlled trial that main purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the differences of glucose control and weight loss between&#xD;
      Beinaglutide and Dulaglutide in type 2 diabetes with overweight or or Obesity.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 2/3 of patients with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese in China, several studies&#xD;
      had confirmed that overweight and obesity could cause type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 receptor agonist&#xD;
      could control diabetes meanwhile loss the patient weight. This is a multi-center, openlabel,&#xD;
      1:1 randomized controlled trial to investigate the differences of glucose control and weight&#xD;
      loss between two GLP-1 receptor agonist, Beinaglutide and Dulaglutide, in type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      with overweight or Obesity. The study comprises the 0-2 weeks of screening period and the&#xD;
      16-week intervention period. 120 patients according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria would&#xD;
      recruit from 4 sites in China, then the participant will be randomized to three times a day&#xD;
      of subcutaneous beinaglutide(dose escalate to 0.2mg), or once-weekly of 1.5mg subcutaneous&#xD;
      dulaglutide for 16-week. The primary endpoint is the change from baseline to week 16 in&#xD;
      HbA1c. The second endpoint is the change from baseline to week 16 in weight.&#xD;
