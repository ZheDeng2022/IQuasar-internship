  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent months, more and more studies suggest tele-rehabilitation as a means to be&#xD;
      exploited to reduce the risk of contagion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intent of our study is to verify the effectiveness of a tele-rehabilitation intervention&#xD;
      through the application of a respiratory rehabilitation program supported by contact with&#xD;
      physiotherapists, in patients with outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection discharged from the&#xD;
      various medical departments and taken over by physiotherapists after physiatric evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Faced with the same rehabilitation program prescribed to all patients, the primary objective&#xD;
      of our study is to detect whether patients supported by remote rehabilitation after&#xD;
      hospitalization improve both adherence to the rehabilitation program and cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      endurance and dyspnea symptoms assessed with the Six Minute Walking Test scale (6MWT). This&#xD;
      test is validated for multiple pathologies, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the&#xD;
      clinic of which could be comparable to the outcomes of coronavirus interstitial pneumonia as&#xD;
      suggested by the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives concern the assessment of the impact of physical exercise assisted&#xD;
      by tele-rehabilitation detected through: the assessment of the quality of life (Saint George&#xD;
      Respiratory Questionnaire );the assessment of autonomy in daily life activities (Barthel&#xD;
      Index Dyspnea Scale), the evaluation of the variation in thoracic expansion and lung volumes&#xD;
      (with COACH , an instrument for respiratory physiotherapy that measures the inspiratory&#xD;
      volume in ml); the evaluation of muscle strength and endurance (One Minute Sit To Stand) ;&#xD;
      the detection of dyspnea during the execution of the exercises (Modified Borg scale); the&#xD;
      assessment of the functionality of the lower limbs (Short Physical Performance Battery)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With regard to respiratory problems, there are still no precise data on the long-term&#xD;
      consequences of pulmonary fibrosis and therefore related to the insufficient functioning of&#xD;
      the lung. It is possible to hypothesize that these deficiencies can be treated with one&#xD;
      specific respiratory rehabilitation aimed at reducing dyspnea and difficulty in practicing&#xD;
      daily activities and moving around. In fact, the scientific literature indicates that&#xD;
      respiratory rehabilitation improves the quality of life and exercise tolerance of patients&#xD;
      with IPF (idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), by reducing respiratory deficits, hypotrophy and&#xD;
      muscle weakness, physical deconditioning. Respiratory rehabilitation means a&#xD;
      &quot;multidisciplinary intervention based on scientific evidence for patients with chronic&#xD;
      respiratory disorders who are symptomatic and often have a reduced quality of life, in need&#xD;
      of aerobic and respiratory muscle training, but also oxygen, nutritional, educational,&#xD;
      psychological support as well as therapeutic education. For all these reasons we have decided&#xD;
      to start our blinded, single-center randomized controlled study, the details of which will be&#xD;
      specified later.&#xD;
