  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy of a culturally adapted&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral based tele-rehabilitation program compared to usual care for&#xD;
      Hispanics/Latinos with chronic neck or low back pain. Goal Oriented Activity for Latinos with&#xD;
      Spine Pain (GOALS) is an evidence-based cognitive behavioral physical therapy program that&#xD;
      has been adapted for Hispanics/Latinos with chronic spine pain. GOALS combines 2 in-person&#xD;
      evaluation sessions with 6 telephone treatment sessions provided once a week for 8 weeks by a&#xD;
      physical therapist trained in cognitive behavioral approaches for pain management. Usual Care&#xD;
      involves 8 weeks of in-person treatment as recommended by a physical therapist at a Federally&#xD;
      Qualified Health Center (FQHC) outpatient rehabilitation clinic. The primary outcome that&#xD;
      will be evaluated is pain-related disability as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory Pain&#xD;
      Interference scale. It is hypothesized that participants in the GOALS intervention will&#xD;
      experience a greater improvement in pain-related disability than participants in the Usual&#xD;
      Care group.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      138 Hispanics/Latinos with chronic spine pain will be identified through consecutive sampling&#xD;
      of patients at a local FQHC who were referred by their primary care physician to physical&#xD;
      therapy (PT) for neck or low back pain. Participants who are deemed eligible and enroll in&#xD;
      the study will be scheduled for the first study assessment, where they will provide written&#xD;
      informed consent for participation. Participation includes 4 study assessments and 8-weeks of&#xD;
      treatment with either GOALS or Usual Care PT. Participants will be stratified by sex&#xD;
      (male/female) and diagnosis (low back pain/neck pain) and randomized into either the GOALS or&#xD;
      the Usual Care group following completion of the Baseline assessment. Study assessments will&#xD;
      be conducted 1-week before (Baseline) and 1-week (Post), 3-months (3-mo Post), and 6-months&#xD;
      (6-mo Post) after completing 8 weeks of GOALS or Usual Care PT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to determine the efficacy of a culturally adapted cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral based PT tele-rehabilitation program compared to usual care in Hispanics/Latinos&#xD;
      with chronic spine pain, based on improvement in the pain interference scale in the Brief&#xD;
      Pain Inventory after treatment (primary outcome). The 1-week post-intervention assessment&#xD;
      will be analyzed using a linear regression model. The time by condition (GOALS vs. Usual&#xD;
      Care) interaction term will be added to the models to assess for intervention effects. If the&#xD;
      interaction is not significant, the main effect for time and condition will be assessed. For&#xD;
      all outcomes, the models will be adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics&#xD;
      that may affect treatment response. Secondary outcomes of pain interference at other&#xD;
      time-points (3- and 6-mo Post) and patient reported outcomes and physical performance&#xD;
      measures at all time points will be evaluated in the same manner. It is hypothesize that&#xD;
      participation in the GOALS intervention compared to Usual Care will result in greater&#xD;
      improvements in pain interference (primary outcome), as well as secondary patient reported&#xD;
      outcomes and physical performance measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-planned secondary analyses will explore biological/physical, psychological, and&#xD;
      environmental moderators and mediators of treatment response. The dependent variable for this&#xD;
      analysis will be treatment response, whereby participants will be dichotomized into responder&#xD;
      and non-responder groups based on a ≥30% reduction in pain interference as recommended by&#xD;
      IMMPACT guidelines. An exploratory, backward selection approach using separate multivariate&#xD;
      logistic regression models will be used to identify predictors that are most strongly related&#xD;
      to treatment response. These variables will then be entered into a single combined&#xD;
      multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for sociodemographic covariates of treatment&#xD;
      response. The study will also explore potential mediators of treatment response with&#xD;
      structural equation modeling (SEM) using maximum likelihood estimation methods. Parameter&#xD;
      estimates will be evaluated and indirect effects, reflecting mediation, will be calculated&#xD;
      and examined for statistical significance and clinical meaningfulness. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that baseline indicators for high fear of movement and sedentary behavior will predict a&#xD;
      positive response to the GOALS intervention. However, the study will also collect and analyze&#xD;
      other candidate predictors of treatment response based on a conceptual model of the pain&#xD;
      experience in Hispanics/Latinos.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The primary purpose of this interventional study is to determine the efficacy of a culturally adapted cognitive behavioral based tele-rehabilitation program compared to usual care for Hispanics/Latinos with chronic neck or low back pain. The main objective of the GOALS intervention is to improve pain-related disability in Hispanics/Latinos with chronic spine pain. The interventional study model is a single site, 2-arm parallel assignment randomized clinical trial with blinded assessors. After completing the baseline assessment, enrolled participants will be stratified by sex (male, female) and diagnosis (low back pain/neck pain) and randomized into either the GOALS intervention arm or the Usual Care control arm.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The experimental arm is an 8-week cognitive-behavioral based physical therapy (PT) intervention for chronic spine pain. The manualized intervention utilizes a hybrid tele-rehabilitation delivery model. GOALS comprises an initial in-person evaluation (60 min) by a research physical therapist, followed by 6 remote treatment sessions (30-45 min each) conducted by the same physical therapist once a week by telephone. A second in-person evaluation is conducted at the midpoint of the GOALS intervention to assess progress and advance the participant's home exercise program.</description>

Participants in the Usual Care group attend an initial PT evaluation at a FQHC Physical Rehabilitation Clinic. The frequency and type of PT intervention are then determined by the treating physical therapist in accordance with standard clinical practice at the FQHC.</description>
