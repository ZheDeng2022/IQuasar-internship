  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and effects of stimulating the splenic&#xD;
      neurovascular bundle (NVB) with the Galvani System, which consists of a lead, implantable&#xD;
      pulse generator, external components and accessories. The study will consist of 4 study&#xD;
      periods, including a Randomized Control Trial period (Period 1), an Open Label period (Period&#xD;
      2), a Treat-to-target period (Period 3), and a Long-term Follow-up period (Period 4).&#xD;
      Participants eligible for implant will have active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and have an&#xD;
      inadequate response or intolerance to at least two biologic Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic&#xD;
      Drugs (DMARDs) or JAK inhibitors (JAKis). A sufficient number of participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled so that approximately 28 participants will undergo device implantation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who receive the implantable system will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive either active stimulation or sham-stimulation for 12 weeks&#xD;
      (Period 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following Period 1, all participants will enter an open label phase (Period 2) during which&#xD;
      participants who responded to stimulation will continue on stimulation; whereas participants&#xD;
      who received sham stimulation, or were stimulation non-responders, will receive a&#xD;
      market-approved RA drug for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Period 2, participants who respond to their Period 2 therapy but still exhibit&#xD;
      signs and symptoms of RA will enter the Treat-to-target period (Period 3); others will&#xD;
      proceed to Period 4 (Long-term Follow-up). During the Treat-to-Target period, participants&#xD;
      will be treated with dual therapy (stimulation in combination with the market-approved RA&#xD;
      drug) for up to 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 4 provides long term safety follow up for all study participants for a period of 5&#xD;
      years. Participants may receive stimulation in combination with other approved and standard&#xD;
      of care therapies, subject to a favorable benefit-risk assessment in the judgement of the&#xD;
      treating rheumatologist.&#xD;
