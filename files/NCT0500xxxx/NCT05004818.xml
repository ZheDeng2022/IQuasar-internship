  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      subjects with severe seasickness, who failed to habituate to sea conditions after at least&#xD;
      six month of active sailing, were enrolled to the single-blind randomized control study. The&#xD;
      intervention group was treated with rotatory chair stimulation at sinusoidal harmonic&#xD;
      acceleration protocol coupled with galvanic vestibular stimulation to the mastoid processes.&#xD;
      This unique procedure was hypothesized to promote habituation to seasickness. The control&#xD;
      group underwent a sham procedure. All study participants filled out seasickness&#xD;
      questionnaires at set time points following the intervention and underwent repeated step&#xD;
      testing to determine their vestibular time constant. The number of anti-motion sickness&#xD;
      clinic visits and scopolamine prescriptions was also recorded in the three months period&#xD;
      following the intervention.&#xD;
