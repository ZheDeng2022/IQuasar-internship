    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of ASTX727 and dasatinib in treating patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome or BCR-ABL positive chronic myeloid leukemia in&#xD;
      chronic phase. Philadelphia chromosome positive and BCR-ABL positive are types of genetic&#xD;
      mutations (changes). Chemotherapy drugs, such as ASTX727, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Dasatinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some&#xD;
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. ASTX727 and dasatinib may help to control Philadelphia&#xD;
      chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia or BCR-ABL positive chronic myeloid leukemia in&#xD;
      chronic phase.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the proportion of patients with previously-untreated chronic phase chronic&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (CML) who achieve molecular response 4 (MR4) after 6-months of the&#xD;
      combination of decitabine and cedazuridine (ASTX727) and dasatinib 50 mg daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the proportion of patients with previously-untreated chronic phase CML who&#xD;
      achieve MR4 after both the 3-months of the combination of ASTX727 and dasatinib 50 mg daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate cumulative overall rate of molecular response 4.5 (MR4.5). III. To estimate&#xD;
      the 12-months major molecular response (MMR) rate. IV. To estimate the proportion of patients&#xD;
      with MR4.5 at 6-, 12-, 18-, 24-, and 36-months of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To estimate the proportion of patients with sustained MR4.5 of 3 years and more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To estimate the treatment-free remission rate (TFR), time to progression, and overall&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To assess the safety of this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive dasatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Beginning cycle 4,&#xD;
      patients also receive decitabine and cedazuridine PO QD on days 1-3. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days for up to 3 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive dasatinib PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days for&#xD;
      up to 12 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive or BCR-ABL positive CML in early&#xD;
             chronic phase CML (i.e., time from diagnosis =&lt; 12 months). Except for hydroxyurea&#xD;
             and/or 1 to 2 doses of cytarabine patients must have received no or minimal prior&#xD;
             therapy, defined as &lt; 1 month (30 days) of prior Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
             approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clonal evolution defined as the presence of additional chromosomal abnormalities&#xD;
                  other than the Ph chromosome has historically been included as a criterion for&#xD;
                  accelerated phase. However, patients with clonal evolution as the only criterion&#xD;
                  of accelerated phase have a significantly better prognosis, and when present at&#xD;
                  diagnosis may not impact the prognosis at all. Thus, patients with clonal&#xD;
                  evolution and no other criteria for accelerated phase will be eligible for this&#xD;
                  study&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) &lt; 3 x ULN&#xD;

             cleared by Cardiology:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uncontrolled angina within 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diagnosed or suspected congenital long QT syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any history of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (such as&#xD;
                  ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or Torsades de pointes).&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Patients with active, uncontrolled psychiatric disorders include: psychosis, major&#xD;
             depression, and bipolar disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is known to be positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV testing is&#xD;
             not required)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of other clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s) including, but not&#xD;
             limited to:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women of pregnancy potential must practice an effective method of birth control during&#xD;
             the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized. Prior to&#xD;
             study enrollment, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be advised of the&#xD;
             importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk&#xD;
             factors for an unintentional pregnancy. Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for&#xD;
             at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential. Women must continue&#xD;
             birth control for the duration of the trial and at least 3 months after the last dose&#xD;
             of study drug. Pregnant or breast-feeding women are excluded. All WOCBP must have a&#xD;
             negative pregnancy test prior to first receiving investigational product. If the&#xD;
             pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive study drug and must not be&#xD;
             enrolled in the study&#xD;

             accelerated (except as noted in inclusion criteria) or blast phase are excluded. The&#xD;
             definitions of CML phases are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Early chronic phase: time from diagnosis to therapy =&lt; 12 months&#xD;

               -  Late chronic phase: time from diagnosis to therapy &gt; 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Blastic phase: presence of 30% blasts or more in the peripheral blood or bone&#xD;
                  marrow&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Peripheral or marrow blasts 15% or more&#xD;
&#xD;
