  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Commonly, families and providers have turned to internet-based resources to provide insight&#xD;
      as to the perioperative experience. Though there is a large amount of information that is&#xD;
      available on the internet, medical information on the internet is of highly variable quality&#xD;
      and the information may be conflicting or inaccurate. It is hard for even the savvy&#xD;
      well-educated patient and family to navigate and sift through all the information available.&#xD;
      Therefore, generic web-based information does not necessarily decrease patient and caregiver&#xD;
      anxiety. As an alternative, the investigators propose an interactive teaching tool utilizing&#xD;
      virtual reality that may provide a cost-efficient, content-rich supplement to the traditional&#xD;
      phone or internet-based patient education. Virtual reality (VR) will be provided to families&#xD;
      of patients undergoing ambulatory pediatric surgery. VR will provide personalized education&#xD;
      to patients and their families about the entire continuum of the child's surgical experience.&#xD;
      This will range from the hospital registration, the peri-operative experience, including the&#xD;
      separation of the child from the parent in the pre-operative area and the anesthetic&#xD;
      induction process, and the post-operative hospital ward. The virtual reality (VR) tool will&#xD;
      also review the in-hospital post-operative recovery process. The patient will be shown this&#xD;
      either via an oculus headset or using their own smartphone device. In addition to improving a&#xD;
      parent's comprehension of what their child will experience, the investigators expect that the&#xD;
      virtual reality tool may also improve patient and caregiver satisfaction with the overall&#xD;
      perioperative experience.&#xD;

    <description>Assessed using an adaptation of the English version of the Leiden Perioperative Patient Satisfaction questionnaire (LPPSq). This questionnaire assesses 4 domains of satisfaction: information provision, professional competence, patient-staff relationship, and service with a total of 24 questions. Questions will be scored on a 1-5 Likert scale (from completely dissatisfied to completely satisfied) with the total satisfaction score ranging from 24-120 possible points.</description>
