  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial consists of two parts, Part A and Part B, and will evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of a third booster injection of the multivalent vaccine BNT162b2 (B.1.1.7 +&#xD;
      B.1.617.2), and the safety and immunogenicity of a third booster injection of the monovalent&#xD;
      vaccine BNT162b2 (B.1.617.2) or BNT162b2 (B.1.1.7), in participants who have received two&#xD;
      doses of the parent vaccine BNT162b2 at 30 µg, at least 6 months after the second dose of&#xD;
      BNT162b2. In addition, it will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a two-dose regimen&#xD;
      (21-days apart) of BNT162b2 (B.1.1.7 + B.1.617.2) in participants who have not received prior&#xD;
      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination.&#xD;
