  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plain radiographs and MRI play an important role in the diagnosis of intra-articular knee&#xD;
      pathology and can be used to guide treatment decisions. These imaging modalities however have&#xD;
      several limitations which can lead to misdiagnosis, incorrect treatment decisions, and&#xD;
      suboptimal patient care. The gold standard for confirmation of intra-articular knee pathology&#xD;
      is formal diagnostic knee arthroscopy. Diagnostic knee arthroscopy must be performed in the&#xD;
      operating room under general anesthesia, which adds both risk and cost to the patient. In&#xD;
      contrast to formal diagnostic arthroscopy which uses a 4.8mm arthroscope, needle arthroscopy&#xD;
      (NA) uses a 1.9mm nano-arthroscope. NA with a nano-arthroscope is a technique which allows&#xD;
      direct high quality intra-articular visualization to be obtained without general anesthesia,&#xD;
      and can be performed either in the office or the operating room (OR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One specific application for this technology is in the evaluation of patients who are being&#xD;
      considered for either a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or a unicompartmental knee arthroplasty&#xD;
      (UKA). An essential component of the pre-operative work-up is determining if the patient has&#xD;
      isolated unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis (OA) or more widespread tricompartmental knee&#xD;
      OA. This distinction is essential as each condition is treated differently; isolated&#xD;
      unicompartmental knee OA is treated with a UKA while tricompartmental OA is treated with TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary objective is to determine if NA is an effective, safe, and cost effective tool to&#xD;
      confirm the presence of unicompartmental OA and thus guide patient management in the decision&#xD;
      to perform UKA or TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disclosure: This study is sponsored by Arthrex Inc, the manufacturer of the NanoScope™&#xD;
      operative arthroscopy imaging system which will be used in the study. Arthrex will provide&#xD;
      NanoScope™ supplies only; no direct monetary funding will be provided.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective study of patients being evaluated for UKA/TKA will be performed. The study will&#xD;
      include two groups: 1) patients who are diagnosed with isolated unicompartmental knee OA by&#xD;
      standard weight bearing radiographs and are likely indicated for UKA and 2) patients for whom&#xD;
      the standard weight bearing radiographs are equivocal for the diagnosis of unicompartmental&#xD;
      OA vs. tricompartmental OA. The preoperative radiographic evaluation prior to UKA or TKA&#xD;
      includes a series of standard weight bearing knee radiographs which historically have been&#xD;
      used to differentiate between unicompartmental OA and tricompartmental OA. This series of&#xD;
      radiographs includes weight bearing AP, lateral, skyline, Rosenberg, and valgus stress views.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, after obtaining informed consent, both groups of patients will undergo NA,&#xD;
      performing in the operating room on the day of arthroplasty, prior to surgery beginning. NA&#xD;
      will be performed with a 1.9mm nano arthroscope, as part of their diagnostic pre-arthroplasty&#xD;
      evaluation, in lieu of standard arthroscopy, which utilizes a 4.8mm arthroscope. NA will&#xD;
      directly visualize the articular cartilage in the medial, lateral, and patellofemoral&#xD;
      compartments of the knee. Cartilage will be arthroscopically graded according to the&#xD;
      Outerbridge Classification of chondral lesions. Patients with visualized Grade IV&#xD;
      full-thickness cartilage loss with exposed subchondral bone isolated to either the medial or&#xD;
      lateral compartment, with Grade 0-II lesions in the contralateral and / or patellofemoral&#xD;
      compartments, will undergo a medial or lateral UKA, respectively. Patients with a Grade IV&#xD;
      lesion in the medial or lateral compartment, with asymptomatic Grade III lesions in the&#xD;
      contralateral and / or patellofemoral compartments will undergo a medial or lateral UKA,&#xD;
      respectively. Patients with a Grade IV lesion in the medial or lateral compartment, with&#xD;
      symptomatic Grade III lesions in the contralateral and / or patellofemoral compartments will&#xD;
      undergo TKA. Patients with a Grade IV lesion in the medial or lateral compartment, with Grade&#xD;
      IV lesions in the contralateral and / or patellofemoral compartments will undergo TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative findings at the time of arthroplasty will serve at the gold standard to which&#xD;
      the NA findings will be compared. Furthermore, the diagnosis obtained from NA will be&#xD;
      compared to the diagnosis obtained from preoperative weight bearing radiographs.&#xD;
