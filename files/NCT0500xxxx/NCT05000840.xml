  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, the growing Hispanic/Latino population is at high risk for type 2&#xD;
      diabetes and associated complications, yet underserved in healthcare and underrepresented in&#xD;
      research. The purpose of this Sansum Diabetes Research Institute (SDRI) study is to create an&#xD;
      HbA1c testing and support closed-loop system for U.S. Hispanic/Latino families. This loop&#xD;
      will integrate Abbott's point-of-care (POC) technology with SDRI's Community Scientist Model&#xD;
      to contact, test, intervene, and monitor Latinos with or at risk of type 2 diabetes for HbA1c&#xD;
      levels. This study is built on prior work using specially trained Hispanic/Latino Community&#xD;
      Scientists/Especialistas to support engagement with and encourage adherence to American&#xD;
      Diabetes Association guidelines for HbA1c testing among Hispanic/Latino adults with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. The study is an unblinded, nonrandomized, two arm self-controlled single center&#xD;
      study. It is anticipated to run over 24 months and enroll 750 participants, in whom HbA1c&#xD;
      will be measured over 6 months. This study will provide unique data on the burden of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes for Hispanic/Latino adults in Santa Barbara County, CA. In addition, the closed-loop&#xD;
      approach will provide proof-of-concept evidence for scaling this approach to the larger&#xD;
      Hispanic/Latino community to reduce the risk of poor outcomes due to type 2 diabetes and now&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;

      Hypothesis: Adoption of the SDRI Community Scientist/Especialista model will improve&#xD;
      adherence to ADA recommended guidelines for HbA1c testing for Hispanic/Latino adults with&#xD;
      T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants known to have or considered to have diabetes by the Principal Investigator (PI)&#xD;
      will be offered enrollment in the study, and their HbA1c will be tested using the Afinion&#xD;
      HbA1c point-of-care analyzer. The subjects will be stratified into two groups: HbA1c &lt;7.5 and&#xD;
      HbA1c ≥7.5%. All other potential participants (unknown diabetes diagnosis) will be tested for&#xD;
      HbA1c as the site standard practice. All participants with HbA1c &lt;7.5 will be followed up at&#xD;
      6 months; those with HbA1c ≥7.5% will be followed up at 3 months and again at 6 months post&#xD;
      enrollment. Participants with HbA1c ≥7.5% will be invited to participate in SDRI's existing&#xD;
      educational programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy will be provided as per standard of care by the participant's treating physician and&#xD;
      is out of the scope of this proposal. Those with an HbA1c at or above 7.5% will be offered&#xD;
      diabetes education and support through the tele-health platform and/or in person.&#xD;
      Participants not known to have diabetes but with an HbA1c result &gt;6.4% will be referred to a&#xD;
      local provider for further evaluation and possible diagnosis of diabetes.&#xD;

        Potential subjects will be selected from Santa Barbara County and surrounding communities&#xD;
        or satellite sites, with the help of the partnering care providers. In Santa Barbara&#xD;
        County, Hispanic/Latino adults make up 46% of the population of almost 450,000. Data&#xD;
        published by SDRI based on a community screening program reported that 16% of 593&#xD;
        Hispanic/Latino adults had an HbA1c in the diabetes range. In a cohort of Hispanic/Latino&#xD;
        adults with known T2D, only 30% had an HbA1c less than 7%, with 31% having values greater&#xD;
        than 9%. Currently in our Mil Familias cohort, 46% have an HbA1c above the threshold (&gt;&#xD;
        7.5%) for increased risk for poor outcomes from COVID-19 (unpublished data).&#xD;
