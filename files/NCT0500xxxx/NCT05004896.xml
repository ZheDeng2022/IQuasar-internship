  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Growing evidence has supported rapid and robust antidepressant effects with subanesthetic&#xD;
      doses of intravenous (IV) ketamine for treatment resistant depression (TRD). However, no&#xD;
      completed or ongoing randomized control trials (RCTs) have evaluated the effects of repeated&#xD;
      doses of IV ketamine for a homogenous sample of patients with treatment-resistant bipolar&#xD;
      disorder (TRBD). The primary research goal is to determine the acute antidepressant efficacy,&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of four repeated sub-anesthetic doses of IV ketamine in moderate to&#xD;
      severe TRBD. Secondary aims include evaluating effects of IV ketamine on suicidal ideations,&#xD;
      quality of life, function and duration of effects. Herein, a two-site (University Health&#xD;
      Network and Canadian Rapid Treatment Centre of Excellence), phase II, double-blinded,&#xD;
      midazolam-controlled, two-week RCT evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of four&#xD;
      flexibly-dosed adjunctive ketamine infusions (0.5-0.75mg/kg infused over 40 minutes) for&#xD;
      acute treatment of moderate to severe TRBD (type I &amp; II) is proposed. The primary outcome&#xD;
      will be Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores, determining the between&#xD;
      group difference in change from baseline to day 14, using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA),&#xD;
      with 14-day MADRS as the outcome and baseline MADRS and stratification variables (sex,&#xD;
      bipolar type) as covariates. Secondary outcomes include evaluating response and remission&#xD;
      rates, safety, tolerability (including treatment-emergent mania), and effects on suicidality,&#xD;
      anxiety, quality of life, function and the duration of effects (to day 28).&#xD;

    <description>The MADRS is a clinician-rated scale measuring depression severity. It consists of 10 items, each scored from 0 (normal) to 6 (severe), for a total possible score of 60. A higher score is indicative of greater depressive severity Response rates are defined as ≥ 50% decrease and Remission ≤ 10 actual score.</description>
