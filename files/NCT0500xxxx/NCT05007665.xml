  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On 11 February 2020, the International Committee for the Classification of Viruses named the&#xD;
      disease caused by SAＲS-CoV-2 infection in humans as the new coronavirus pneumonia&#xD;
      (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19). Due to the characteristics of liver microcirculation&#xD;
      disturbance and immune function disorder in patients with chronic liver diseases (such as&#xD;
      immune liver disease, chronic hepatitis C, liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, etc.), those&#xD;
      patients has a higher risk of infection than the general population during the epidemic&#xD;
      period. More attention should be paid to personal protection and disease prevention.&#xD;
      Vaccination of COVID-19 vaccine can effectively prevent COVID-19 virus infection and delay or&#xD;
      prevent patients from developing into critical illness and reduce mortality. To evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine in those patients with chronic liver diseases,&#xD;
      and to guide the COVID-19 vaccination more scientifically, reasonably and effectively, this&#xD;
      study was carried out.&#xD;

      Due to the characteristics of liver microcirculation disturbance and immune function disorder&#xD;
      in patients with chronic liver diseases (such as autoimmune liver disease, chronic hepatitis&#xD;
      C, liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, etc.), those patients has a higher risk of infection than&#xD;
      the general population during the epidemic period. More attention should be paid to personal&#xD;
      protection and disease prevention. Vaccination of COVID-19 / influenza vaccine can&#xD;
      effectively prevent COVID-19 / influenza virus infection and delay or prevent patients from&#xD;
      developing into critical illness and reduce mortality. The safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      COVID-19 / influenza vaccine in this population were evaluated in order to play a scientific&#xD;
      and theoretical supporting role in guiding COVID-19 vaccination more scientifically,&#xD;
      reasonably and effectively. The samples of this study were collected and tested in the second&#xD;
      affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. Patients with contraindications for&#xD;
      vaccination will be excluded. The detected indexes included blood routine test, liver&#xD;
      function, COVID-19 antibody titer, antibody duration and other indexes of healthy people&#xD;
      (control group) and patients with chronic liver disease before and after vaccination ( 1, 3,&#xD;
      6, 12 months after vaccination). The adverse reactions related to the vaccine were recorded.&#xD;
