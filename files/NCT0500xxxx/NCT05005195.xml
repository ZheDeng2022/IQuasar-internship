  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney cancer is the 8th most common cancer in Yorkshire. It has a poor survival rate, with&#xD;
      only 6 out of 10 patients diagnosed with kidney cancer still alive after 5 years. This is&#xD;
      partly because many people with kidney cancer don't have any symptoms. In some of these&#xD;
      people, kidney cancer is only found by chance during investigations for other reasons. In&#xD;
      others, it is often not diagnosed until the disease has passed the point at which we can&#xD;
      easily cure it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for kidney cancer has the potential to pick up these cancers earlier and increase&#xD;
      the number of people who can be cured. The Yorkshire Lung Screening Trial offers people aged&#xD;
      55-80 with a history of smoking a CT scan as part of a lung health check. This group of&#xD;
      people is also at increased risk of developing kidney cancer. Our new study, the Yorkshire&#xD;
      Kidney Screening Trial, will piggyback on this trial to offer an extra CT scan for kidney&#xD;
      cancer. The extra scan will take 10 seconds. By the end of the study we will understand&#xD;
      whether it is workable to roll this out more widely and whether people take up this extra&#xD;
      scan.&#xD;

      Background to YLST and link with YKST&#xD;
&#xD;
      YKST will be offered to participants of YLST. In brief, YLST is a community-based screening&#xD;
      programme funded by Yorkshire Cancer Research which uses mobile units across Leeds through a&#xD;
      Zelen's design study, allowing assessment of the overall effect of screening Yorkshire people&#xD;
      who are current smokers or ex-smokers and therefore at high-risk for lung cancer. YLST is one&#xD;
      of the World's largest lung cancer screening trials and nesting YKST within this on-going&#xD;
      trial provides a unique opportunity to both add value to this existing trial and provide much&#xD;
      needed data relating to future RCC screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In YLST, ~45,000 people were invited to participate in the study with 6,892 eventual&#xD;
      participants estimated to attend for the first of two rounds of low-dose CT (LDCT) screening&#xD;
      (called T0 and T2 respectively). To identify eligible individuals, General Practices within&#xD;
      the Leeds CCG area provided consent for interrogation of their Primary Care databases&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first Lung Health Check (T0) relevant clinical and demographic information were&#xD;
      collected and participants were offered a LDCT scan either immediately or to return another&#xD;
      day at their preference. Two years later the participants who attended for an initial Lung&#xD;
      Health Check are invited back for a follow-up Lung Health Check (T2) which includes a second&#xD;
      LDCT scan. In YKST we are asking participants in this T2 round of YLST, from 10 May 2021 to&#xD;
      31 Oct 2022, to undergo an abdominal CT scan in addition to the repeated CT chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant pathway and detailed logistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 2 major elements to the logistics of YKST: 1) Obtaining the abdominal CT scan. From&#xD;
      invitation to completion of the CT scan, the existing YLST infrastructure will be used on the&#xD;
      YLST van. 2) Downstream processes from the scan. Reporting of the CT scan, informing&#xD;
      participants of results and dealing with anomalies. These are new YKST specific processes,&#xD;
      separate to YLST. Invitation YLST participants will receive a telephone call to book a T2&#xD;
      round appointment. Following this they will receive an appointment letter. If the participant&#xD;
      is not available after 2 attempted telephone calls, they are sent a pre-booked appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arriving on the YLST van the potential participants will watch the YLST T2 introduction&#xD;
      video. Following the YLST T2 introduction video the YKST PIS video will play, this will have&#xD;
      been mentioned to YLST participants by van staff on arrival . They will then have the YLST&#xD;
      consultation in a private consultation room. After completing the YLST components, they will&#xD;
      be asked if they wish to participate in YKST. For those wishing to take part, written consent&#xD;
      will be taken whilst in the consultation room and a small number of extra RCC specific&#xD;
      questions will be.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those not wishing to take part will also be asked to give their reasons for declining and&#xD;
      asked if they consent to be contacted by a University of Cambridge researcher to discuss&#xD;
      taking part in a qualitative interview about their reasons for declining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those wishing to have the additional scan will also be asked if they consent to be contacted&#xD;
      by a University of Cambridge researcher to discuss taking part in a qualitative research&#xD;
      interview about reasons for agreeing to participate. Participants consenting to be contacted&#xD;
      by the research team about an interview (those wishing to have the additional scan and those&#xD;
      declining the scan) will be sent a separate PIS and a consent form and asked to contact the&#xD;
      team if they would like to take part. A member of the research team will then contact them to&#xD;
      arrange a convenient time for a telephone or remote video interview. Those taking part will&#xD;
      be asked to sign the consent form and send this back to the research team in a stamped&#xD;
      addressed envelope, or sign it electronically. In case there is a delay in this process,&#xD;
      possibly due to the COVID19 pandemic, verbal consent will also be taken over the telephone at&#xD;
      the start of the interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All healthcare professionals involved in the screening process will also be invited by the&#xD;
      research team to take part in an interview about the acceptability of the combined approach&#xD;
      and the logistics. They will be provided with a PIS and consent form and consent taken as for&#xD;
      screening participants above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT scanning protocol and reporting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following confirmation that the participant has not has an abdominal CT scan within the&#xD;
      previous 6 months, scans will be ordered by the YKST nurse research team or research fellow.&#xD;
      We have designed a clear risk mitigation process to ensure that if a participant wishes to&#xD;
      continue with lung screening as part of YLST but does not want to participate in the YKST&#xD;
      component, that they do not get the abdominal CT scan. The mechanism for this is that a hard&#xD;
      copy of the Kidney Screening CT request form will only be printed once participants have&#xD;
      signed the YKST consent form. As an additional check the radiographers will be asked to sign&#xD;
      the request form to indicate that they have seen the YKST consent form before proceeding to&#xD;
      the additional kidney screening scan. This will act as an additional prompt for the&#xD;
      radiographer team to ensure that the correct screening protocols are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The abdominal CT scan will be performed immediately following the CT chest for YLST, the&#xD;
      patient will remain lying the CT scanner gantry and the abdominal CT will take a further 10&#xD;
      seconds to be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of screening results&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Lead Consultant Radiologist and the YKST Principal Investigator (a Consultant&#xD;
      Urologist)at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust have developed a series of pathways for&#xD;
      flagging in the CT report, based on: 1 - Normal; 2 - benign urological finding; 3 -&#xD;
      Indeterminate benign finding (i.e. cholecystitis/pancreatitis); 4 Possible malignancy outside&#xD;
      renal tract (2 week wait referral) or AAA (referral to vascular surgery); 5 - Possible&#xD;
      renal/urological cancer (2 week wait referral).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI will work with the nurse practitioner and administration support employed by YKST for&#xD;
      the duration of the scanning period so that they can inform the patients of results and refer&#xD;
      patients to the appropriate other specialities: e.g. vascular and HPB surgery There are no&#xD;
      further visits of assessments for participants of YKST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative interviews and ethnography&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct semi-structured qualitative telephone or remote video interviews within 3&#xD;
      months of the initial study invitation with a purposive sample of both participants who take&#xD;
      up the additional abdominal CT scan and those who decline the additional scan. The interviews&#xD;
      will explore their views on the acceptability of the combined screening approach, the consent&#xD;
      process, the information provided about the additional scan, and their reasons for accepting&#xD;
      or declining the scan. We will also explore potential psychological harms, for example,&#xD;
      increased anxiety or worry related to the additional scan or the information provided about&#xD;
      kidney cancer and other potential abdominal findings. We will draw on the principles of&#xD;
      information power when deciding when to cease data collection but anticipate interviewing up&#xD;
      to 40 participants. We will purposefully sample participants with the aim to include&#xD;
      approximately 20 who took up the additional scan and 20 who did not and to include&#xD;
      participants with a range of ages, sex, and abdominal findings. Interviews will be recorded&#xD;
      and transcribed for analysis. We expect interviews to last between 30-45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the study processes, including ordering the scans, obtaining consent, ensuring only&#xD;
      participants consenting to the additional abdominal scan receive it, performing, reporting&#xD;
      and reviewing the additional scans and feeding back the results, from the perspective of the&#xD;
      healthcare professionals we will also conduct telephone/video link interviews with key&#xD;
      individuals involved in the screening pathway. These will include CTAs, research nurses,&#xD;
      radiographers, radiologists and the triaging urologist. The interview schedule will cover&#xD;
      their views on all stages of the pathway relevant to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore in more detail the consent and scanning process on the screening vans, we will&#xD;
      also conduct an ethnographic study with a researcher spending time on the vans observing the&#xD;
      patient flow and processes. The field notes from these observations will be combined with the&#xD;
      analysis of the interview data to enable us to identify aspects that worked well and any&#xD;
      challenges or potential safety concerns within the proposed combined screening pathway in&#xD;
      order to inform a future RCT.&#xD;
