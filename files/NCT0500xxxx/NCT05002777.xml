  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single group treatment, Phase 2, open-label, study to evaluate the efficacy, safety&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetics of rilzabrutinib in adult patients with wAIHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive rilzabrutinib orally. The screening period is up to 28 days,&#xD;
      followed by a treatment period of 24 weeks for Part A. Participants who complete Part A and&#xD;
      are deemed eligible for Part B will continue to receive the study medication for 52 weeks&#xD;
      following the Last Patient In (LPI-Part B). There will be a 7-day safety follow-up period&#xD;
      after receiving the last dose of study drug either in Part A (for those not eligible for Part&#xD;
      B or early terminated) or Part B. The estimated total duration of the study is approximately&#xD;
      137 weeks (Parts A and B), including the follow-up period. For participants deemed ineligible&#xD;
      for Part B, the total length of the study will be 29 weeks (Part A only), including screening&#xD;
      and the follow-up period. In Part B, participants who temporarily stop rilzabrutinib&#xD;
      treatment and maintain a durable response from W50 to W74, will have their EOS visit at Week&#xD;
      75. In this case, participation will be for 79 weeks including the screening period.&#xD;
