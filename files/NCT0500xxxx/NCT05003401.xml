      This project will examine the effect using the Keen 2 on hair pulling styles (automatic and&#xD;
      focused), the severity of hair pulling behaviors, and related psychiatric symptoms. Given&#xD;
      that the Keen2 is anticipated to increase awareness of pulling behavior (but not necessarily&#xD;
      change pulling behavior), the investigators hypothesize that the Keen 2 will increase&#xD;
      awareness of pulling behaviors and reduce automatic pulling behavior. The investigators will&#xD;
      explore reductions in overall hair pulling severity and related psychiatric symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Novel technologies present one solution to help identify and reduce automatic pulling&#xD;
      behaviors associated with trichotillomania (TTM). The Keen 2 is one such novel technology,&#xD;
      which is a bracelet which gives the user alerts in the form of a vibration when the user is&#xD;
      engaging in hair pulling behavior. Thus, using the Keen 2 could positively increase the&#xD;
      awareness of automatic pulling behaviors, which is largely unaffected by existing&#xD;
      evidence-based treatments like HRT. This information would be advantageous for the scientific&#xD;
      community to determine the possible benefit of this approach to help individuals with TTM.&#xD;

    <measure>Milwaukee Inventory for Subtypes of Trichotillomania-Adult Version</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Milwaukee Inventory for Subtypes of Trichotillomania-Adult Version (MIST-A) is a 15-item self-report measure that assesses automatic (5-items) and focused (10-items) hair-pulling styles. Items are rated on a 10-point Likert scale from 0=not true of any of my hair pulling to 9= true for all of my hair pulling. Items are summed to produce an automatic hair pulling (range: 0 - 45) and focused hair pulling score (range: 0 - 90). Higher scores suggest greater presence of this hair pulling behavior. The MIST-A has demonstrated good reliability and validity.</description>

    <measure>Massachusetts General Hospital Hair Pulling Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Massachusetts General Hospital Hair Pulling Scale (MGH-HPS) is a 7-item self-report measure assessing urges to pull, actual pulling, perceived control, and associated distress. The items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 4, with a total score derived from the summation of all 7-items (range: 0 to 28). Higher total scores are indicative of greater hair pulling severity. The MGH-HPS exhibited good internal consistency with strong test-retest reliability between 2 and 4 weeks. Convergent validity for the MGH-HPS received support from significant correlations within measurement type. Discriminant validity was demonstrated by non-significant correlations with ratings of depression. The MGH-HPS has been used as a treatment outcome measure and appears to be sensitive to behavioral and pharmacological treatments in a sample that included both youth and adults (McGuire et al., 2012).</description>

    <description>Participants will receive an awareness bracelet to be worn on the dominant wrist over a period of 4 weeks. The bracelet device will vibrate when the participant is engaging in hair pulling behaviors. As hair pulling behaviors may occur outside of awareness (i.e., automatic pulling behaviors), this vibration and detection is anticipated to increase the participants awareness of hair pulling behaviors.</description>
