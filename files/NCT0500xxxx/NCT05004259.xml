      patients with refractory Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA) is a hematologic disorder in which the red blood cells are&#xD;
      targeted and destroyed by autoantibodies produced by the immune system, specifically B-cells&#xD;
      and plasma cells. It can be either idiopathic, or secondary to other autoimmune conditions,&#xD;
      but is commonly related to lymphoproliferative disorders such as CLL or indolent lymphomas.&#xD;
      It is a rather uncommon condition, which affects an estimated 17 people per 100,000 in their&#xD;
      lifetime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, AIHA is often difficult to treat. The goal of treatment is to achieve and&#xD;
      maintain a Hemoglobin concentration of above 10 g/dL. Treatment historically involves the use&#xD;
      of relatively high doses of steroids (i.e. 1 mg/kg), followed by a prolonged taper. According&#xD;
      to a review article, 80% of patients initially respond to corticosteroid therapy, but&#xD;
      steroids alone do not frequently &quot;cure&quot; the disorder, as steroids do not eliminate the&#xD;
      anti-RBC antibody producing clone. In fact, only 20% of patients treated with first line&#xD;
      steroid therapy are cured, and 15-20% of patients require maintenance Prednisone doses above&#xD;
      15 mg per day. This puts patients at risk of long-term steroid side effects, including&#xD;
      infections, osteoporosis, aseptic joint necrosis, diabetes and hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The discovery of rituximab improved outcomes for AIHA. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      against CD20, a marker for B-cells, that is now approved in both the first-line setting as&#xD;
      well as relapsed/ refractory AIHA. It works by depleting CD20-positive B-cells that produce&#xD;
      the autoantibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early studies have shown that adding rituximab to steroids as first line treatment improved&#xD;
      outcomes compared to steroids alone. In one study, a similar number of patients responded to&#xD;
      rituximab and steroid, compared to steroid alone, but the length of response was&#xD;
      significantly improved for the rituximab arm. Among responders, at 36 months, 70% vs 45% of&#xD;
      patients treated in the combination arm vs steroids alone were still in remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite these advances, some patients either fail to respond to the rituximab&#xD;
      (20-30%), or have to remain on unacceptably high doses of steroid to control their hemolysis.&#xD;
      In addition, many relapse after rituximab therapy. At that point, splenectomy is commonly&#xD;
      recommended, but this only has a cure rate of 20%, is invasive, and comes with long-term&#xD;
      sequelae of risks of clots and infection. After splenectomy, patients are left with a host of&#xD;
      other immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine, mycophenolate, cyclosporine, or&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, but these typically require long term usage, and have poor side effect&#xD;
      profiles (infection, liver toxicity, renal toxicity, lymphoma, etc), and are often&#xD;
      ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the need for therapeutic options for patients with refractory or relapsed AIHA who have&#xD;
      already received treatment with steroids and rituximab, this study proposes use of&#xD;
      daratumumab therapy in this patient population. Daratumumab is a CD38-directed cytolytic&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody and is approved for use in patients with multiple myeloma. CD38 is an&#xD;
      attractive target in AIHA, because it is expressed not only on B-cells, but also on plasma&#xD;
      cells, which rituximab does not target (see figure below for the evolution of CD markers in&#xD;
      B-cell maturation). CD38+ plasma cells may be an important source of resistance to rituximab,&#xD;
      as they can survive a long time and continue to produce the anti- red blood cell (RBC)&#xD;
      antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In support of the investigator hypothesis, a case report study of three post-allogeneic&#xD;
      transplant patients with AIHA refractory to steroids, rituximab, and proteosome inhibition,&#xD;
      treated with daratumumab indicated promising results. Two out of the three patients were&#xD;
      cured while the third patient had a transient response and relapsed eight months later.&#xD;
      Similar results have been reported by other institutions, again in case report form. In&#xD;
      addition, daratumumab has also been successfully utilized for refractory Immune&#xD;
      Thrombocytopenia (ITP) in the post-transplant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, here at Dartmouth clinicians have a short history of off labeled use in a 20&#xD;
      year old male with refractory Evans Syndrome, involving AIHA, ITP, and autoimmune&#xD;
      neutropenia. Over the years, he had received multiple lines of immunosuppressant agents, but&#xD;
      he was refractory to or relapsed quickly after all treatments. Based on the above literature,&#xD;
      the Hematology team tried daratumumab, which produced a dramatic improvement in all cell&#xD;
      lines within 2 weeks. He was then transferred to the National Institute of Health, where he&#xD;
      received an allogeneic stem cell transplant, which would not have been possible without first&#xD;
      gaining control over his autoimmune cytopenias with the use of daratumumab therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators of this trial have found daratumumab SC to be safe and very tolerable in&#xD;
      the treatment of Multiple Myeloma. Given the strong scientific rationale to support the use&#xD;
      of daratumumab in treating patients with relapsed/refractory AIHA, this trial aims to study&#xD;
      the safety of daratumumab in this new patient population. The investigators expect to&#xD;
      demonstrate safety of daratumumab treatment in patients with AIHA, and to observe clinical&#xD;
      response, which will support future larger-scale clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned previously, daratumumab SC has been studied and approved in multiple myeloma and&#xD;
      light chain amyloidosis. Of note, the literature reports different pharmacokinetics in each&#xD;
      disease; this is thought to perhaps be reflective of a varying burden of plasma cells between&#xD;
      the diseases. The half-life associated with the linear clearance of daratumumab is 20 days in&#xD;
      patients with multiple myeloma and 28 days in patients with light chain amyloidosis,&#xD;
      according to the Darsalex Faspro product label. The pharmacokinetics of daratumumab in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed/refractory AIHA is unknown and may differ from other indications where&#xD;
      daratumumab is used. To study this, the investigators will measure daratumumab levels at&#xD;
      baseline, weekly before treatments, and then at time points 14 and 28 days after the last&#xD;
      dose. The serum Cmin (Ctrough) concentrations of daratumumb will be measured in the Clinical&#xD;
      Pharmacology Shared Resource using the commercially available the ELISA assay (Eagle&#xD;
      Biosciences). Appropriate modeling using WinNonLn pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD)&#xD;
      software will be used to determine primary pharmacokinetic parameter and explore PK-PD using&#xD;
      non-linear models such as the Sigmoid Emax model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, because the investigator hypothesis is based on the investigator expectation that&#xD;
      daratumumab will kill the plasma cells responsible for producing the anti-RBC antibodies, the&#xD;
      investigators will also measure the anti-RBC antibody levels at baseline, at week 6 of&#xD;
      treatment, and then at 3 months after the last dose; RBC antibody levels will be compared to&#xD;
      clinical response to evaluate potential correlation. The investigators do appreciate that&#xD;
      daratumumab does bind to RBCs via low expression of CD38 on RBCs. However, the&#xD;
      Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center Blood Bank Director believes that by pretreating the test&#xD;
      cells to remove CD38, the investigators can effectively remove the daratumumab from the&#xD;
      specimen, and therefore proceed to use dilutional methods to quantify the anti-RBC level.&#xD;
