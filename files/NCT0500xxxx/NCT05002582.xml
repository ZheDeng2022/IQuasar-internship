  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carbapenem-resistant Organisms (CRO) include Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE),&#xD;
      Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) and Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter&#xD;
      baumannii (CRAB). Due to the high fatality rate of CRO infection, and its potential for wide&#xD;
      spread, it is currently one of the issues that seriously affect the global public health&#xD;
      safety. In 2019, CDC of the United States listed CRE and CRAB as the highest level of&#xD;
      &quot;antibiotic-resistant bacteria with urgent threat&quot;, while CRPA was listed as&#xD;
      &quot;antibiotic-resistant bacteria with serious threat&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies show that in China, patients with hematological disease are at high-risk of&#xD;
      CRE colonization and infection, but there still lack the data of colonization rate of CRPA&#xD;
      and CRAB in patients with hematological disease. Intestinal flora is not only an important&#xD;
      micro-ecological environment for the human body, but also an important place for the&#xD;
      habitation of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The colonization of these bacteria can not only&#xD;
      lead to the spread of bacteria in hospital, but also may lead to the translocation infection&#xD;
      of carriers. Patients with hematological diseases are often in a state of neutropenia after&#xD;
      chemotherapy. At the same time, chemotherapy drugs and various factors can cause intestinal&#xD;
      mucosa damage, which is prone to induce intestinal microflora translocation, causing serious&#xD;
      infections such as sepsis, and posing a serious threat to the prognosis of patients. Early&#xD;
      detection of CRO carriers is not only beneficial to the control of nosocomial infection, but&#xD;
      also beneficial to early precise anti-infection treatments, reducing the probability of&#xD;
      infection and improving the prognosis of infected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is designed to clarify the intestinal carriage rate of carbapenem-resistant&#xD;
      Organisms (CRO) in patients with hematological diseases, and the risk factors of intestinal&#xD;
      CRO colonization in patients with hematological diseases and its correlation with subsequent&#xD;
      infections. 5000 patients diagnosed with hematological diseases will be enrolled, and rectal&#xD;
      swabs or feces will be collected to detect the CRE intestinal colonization. Subsequently, the&#xD;
      last 6 months clinical data of CRO-colonized patients and matched non CRO-colonized patients&#xD;
      (1:1) will be collected. Then, the randomly selected 200 CRO-colonized patients and matched&#xD;
      200 non CRO-colonized patients (1:1) are followed up for 12 months, a total of 400 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled. Every month, rectal swabs and relevant clinical data will be collected.&#xD;

        The study focused on the colonization rate of Carbapenem-resistant Organisms (CRO) in the&#xD;
        intestine of Chinese patients with hematological malignancies diseases, who are at&#xD;
        high-risk of CRE colonization and infection, but there still lack the data of colonization&#xD;
        rate of CRPA and CRAB in patients with hematological disease.&#xD;
