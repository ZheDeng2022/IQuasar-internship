  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proper functioning of the ankle musculature, specifically peroneal muscles, is crucial for&#xD;
      maintaining balance and reducing the risk for falls. Evidence suggests that a decrease in&#xD;
      aspects of neuromuscular control already starts at midlife (45-65 years). However, there is&#xD;
      almost no information regarding the function of the ankle muscles at the middle-age as most&#xD;
      experiments have compared young (&lt;35 years) and older subjects (&gt;65 years). Moreover,&#xD;
      neuromuscular training can improve the function of ankle muscle in response to perturbation;&#xD;
      yet, no previous study has compared the level of effectiveness between middle-aged and young&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;

    <description>The exercise will be performed with the subject sitting in front of a computer monitor, on an elevated chair, and his feet will be in the air. The examiner will ask the subject to perform a maximum contraction of the paronal muscles, in an open kinematic chain. After reference, the subject will begin a five-minute practice. The practice will be divided into rounds of: eight seconds of muscle work and 15 seconds rest.</description>
