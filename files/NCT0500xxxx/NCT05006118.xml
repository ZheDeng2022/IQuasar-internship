      This is an open-label study to evaluate the PK and excretion of a single oral dose of&#xD;
      [14C]-rodatristat ethyl. The study will consist of: Screening evaluations (within 29 days&#xD;
      prior to dosing); a treatment phase (from dosing until discharge from the unit, a minimum of&#xD;
      7 days and a maximum of 14 days); and discharge procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After meeting eligibility criteria, approximately 6 healthy male subjects will check into the&#xD;
      clinical unit (Day -1), and the following morning, receive a single oral suspension of&#xD;
      rodatristat ethyl 600 mg containing a mixture of [12C]-rodatristat ethyl and&#xD;
      [14C]-rodatristat ethyl to contain approximately 600 microcuries (μCi) of radioactivity (Day&#xD;
      1). After fasting 10 hours overnight, the dose will be administered with a standard-calorie&#xD;
      meal. Following dosing, serial whole blood and plasma PK samples, and urine and feces will be&#xD;
      collected until discharge. Subjects will stay in the clinic until at least Day 7. Subjects&#xD;
      will be discharged if total recovery (urine and feces combined) of the administered&#xD;
      radioactive dose is ≥90% and the total daily recovery of radioactive dose is ≤1% on 2&#xD;
      consecutive days in which a fecal sample is collected. If not, subjects will remain in the&#xD;
      clinic until these criteria are met but not longer than 15 days (which includes Day -1).&#xD;
      Plasma and urine samples will be analyzed for total radioactivity, rodatristat ethyl,&#xD;
      rodatristat, M15, and any other identified metabolites (if applicable). Blood and fecal&#xD;
      samples will be analyzed for total radioactivity, rodatristat ethyl, rodatristat, and&#xD;
      metabolite(s).&#xD;
