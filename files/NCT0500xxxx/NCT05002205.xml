    <textblock>
      This study is a longitudinal cohort study which investigates the effect of COVID-19 in&#xD;
      ambulatory care. This study aims to assess the effect of COVID-19 beyond the acute phase,&#xD;
      i.e. on long-term symptoms, respiratory and cardiovascular health, use of health services,&#xD;
      and quality of life.&#xD;

      This study is a longitudinal cohort study comparing two cohorts. One cohort tested positive&#xD;
      for SARS-CoV-2 and the other tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 matched by the timing of testing&#xD;
      in the past 6 months. Participants will be observed for two years after their test for&#xD;
      COVID-19 with online surveys at different time intervals and face-to-face follow-up visits.&#xD;

    <measure>Fatigue severity 6 months after diagnosis of COVID-19.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-COVID</time_frame>
    <description>Data for this endpoint are collected with a questionnaire during the first study visit at 6 months. The severity of fatigue will be assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). This is a 9-item scale which measures the severity of fatigue and how it affects a person's activities and lifestyle.&#xD;
The score ranges from 7 to 63, with higher values indicating more fatigue.</description>
