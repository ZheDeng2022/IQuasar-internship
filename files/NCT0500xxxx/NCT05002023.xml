    <textblock>
      In the PRINCE study we recruit healthy but also diseased pregnant women into a cohort study,&#xD;
      followed by the assessment of children´s health and immunity at birth and during the first 10&#xD;
      years of life. This unique cohort allows for testing the impact of prenatal challenges on&#xD;
      children´s health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children´s Health is critically dependent of the prenatal well-being of the mother, and a&#xD;
      number of observational studies have identified an impaired immunity in children upon&#xD;
      prenatal challenges, such as stress perception, medication, nutrition or infection. However,&#xD;
      concerted, in-depth studies assessing how such prenatal challenges may alter fetal&#xD;
      development and subsequently children´s health in humans are largely lacking. In the present&#xD;
      project, we address this limitation by recruiting healthy, but also diseased pregnant women&#xD;
      into a cohort study, followed up by the assessment of children´s health and immunity at birth&#xD;
      and during the first ten years of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants are recruited early in the first trimester (12-15 weeks of gestation). By&#xD;
      means of data security all participants receive a study number. Data processing into the data&#xD;
      base (Redcap) is performed under this pseudonym.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first visit, the study team explains the enrollment conditions and the&#xD;
      participants are asked to give their consent. Study visits include the documentation of&#xD;
      clinically important conditions, sonographic examination of the fetus, assessment of mother´s&#xD;
      height and weight as well as blood collection (21 ml) of the mother. Additionally we document&#xD;
      any kind of medication-intake and nutrition data, and the participants are asked to fill in a&#xD;
      psychometric questionnaire. Study visits are scheduled according to the week of gestation,&#xD;
      i.e. around 13th, 20th (ultrasound only), 24th, 28th, 34th week. If women give birth in our&#xD;
      clinic, we are able to collect cord blood after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are processed immediately and stored in our laboratory under&#xD;
      Biobank-conditions.&#xD;
