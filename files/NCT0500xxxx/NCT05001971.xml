  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor in domestic research and&#xD;
      development. It can inhibit the angiogenesis related kinase, such as VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, and&#xD;
      tumor cell proliferation related kinase -c-Kit kinase. In the phase II ALTER1202 trial,&#xD;
      patients who failed at least two kinds of systemic chemotherapy regimens (third line or&#xD;
      beyond) or drug intolerance were treated with anlotinib or placebo, the anlotinib group PFS&#xD;
      and OS were 4.1 months and 7.3 months, the placebo group PFS and OS were 0.7 months and 4.9&#xD;
      months. Therefore, the combination of Anlotinib and Penpulimab (a new PD-1 inhibitor) is&#xD;
      attempted for the treatment of sensitive relapsed small-cell lung cancer patients who were&#xD;
      failure in the first-line treatment of chemotherapy with platinum containing drugs, to&#xD;
      further improve the patient's PFS or OS.&#xD;

      This is a multicenter, single-arm, explorative clinical trial conducted in China to&#xD;
      investigate the effectiveness and safety of Anlotinib Plus Penpulimab in patients of&#xD;
      sensitive relapsed small-cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive Anlotinib plus Penpulimab:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anlotinib: 10mg orally daily on day 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle. Penpulimab: 200mg by&#xD;
      intravenous drip on day 1 of a 21-day cycle.&#xD;
