      To determine if the use of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Computer&#xD;
      Tomography (PSMA PET/CT) as a selection tool for performing extended lymph node dissection&#xD;
      (ePLND) for prostate cancer (PCa) in the primary staging setting results in fewer ePLND&#xD;
      procedures and therefore lower overall healthcare costs, lower patient burden in terms of&#xD;
      intervention-related complications and morbidity, with comparable disease prognosis, compared&#xD;
      to the current European Guideline-recommended standard practice which includes performing&#xD;
      ePLND in PCa patients who are candidates for active treatment with a nomogram-calculated&#xD;
      lymph node involvement (LNI) risk &gt;5%.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Use of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET) - computer tomography (CT) has drastically improved the ability to detect and exclude&#xD;
      presence of pelvic lymph node invasion (LNI) compared to conventional imaging. However,&#xD;
      current standard of care still includes performing extended pelvic lymph node dissection&#xD;
      (ePLND) in all patients with primary prostate cancer and a nomogram-based risk of LNI &gt;5%. It&#xD;
      is unclear if use of PSMA PET/CT as a triage test can safely reduce the number of ePLND and&#xD;
      hence reduce the associated morbidity and costs, without negatively influencing disease&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess whether PSMA PET/CT can be safely used as a triage test for selecting&#xD;
      primary prostate cancer patients for ePLND. We will additionally assess cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      the PSMA PET/ CT triage strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design, setting and Participants: THE PSMA-SELECT trial includes patients with&#xD;
      biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer, without evidence of distant metastasis (M0) on PSMA PET/CT,&#xD;
      opting for treatment with radical prostatectomy (RP), with a nomogram-calculated risk of LNI&#xD;
      &gt;5%. Patients will be randomized 1:1. In the intervention arm patients will only undergo&#xD;
      ePLND in addition to robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) in case of suspected LNI on&#xD;
      PSMA PET/CT (miN1), whereas ePLND will be omitted in those without PSMA positive lymph nodes&#xD;
      (miN0). In the control arm, all patients will undergo ePLND in addition to RARP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The primary endpoint of this study is&#xD;
      biochemical recurrence rate at two years post-surgery. Secondary outcome measures are number&#xD;
      of ePLNDs indicated and performed, treatment-related adverse events, initiation of salvage&#xD;
      treatment, metastasis-free survival, patient-reported outcome measures and individual and&#xD;
      cumulative healthcare costs.&#xD;
