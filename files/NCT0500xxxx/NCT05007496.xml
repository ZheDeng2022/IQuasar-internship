  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 randomized, double-blind clinical trial testing an anti-SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccine (AV-COVID-19) made on site using PT AIVITA Biomedika Indonesia's vaccine-enabling kit&#xD;
      for the prevention of COVID-19 infection. The product is a subject-specific personal vaccine&#xD;
      that consists of autologous dendritic cells and lymphocytes (DCL) previously incubated with a&#xD;
      quantity of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-protein) which was shown to be safe in a phase 1&#xD;
      study also conducted in Indonesia. In this phase 2 study, efficacy is assessed via enhanced&#xD;
      S-protein-specific T-cell response by comparing results before and after vaccination. Safety&#xD;
      is confirmed via laboratory values, observation and regular patient reporting.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this phase 2 study, a single dose of AV-COVID-19 DCL vaccine is injected subcutaneously in&#xD;
      the forearm (left or right) at week 0 (day-0), to facilitate inspection and avoid confusion&#xD;
      of local post-injection reactions or shoulder pain. Follow-up visits to assess safety are&#xD;
      performed at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after vaccination, with laboratory safety tests performed at&#xD;
      weeks 1 and 4, and only at week 2 if any clinically significant changes at screening up to&#xD;
      week 1. At each visit, the injection site is assessed, and the subject is asked about&#xD;
      symptoms, and at weeks 0 (baseline before injection), 2 and 4, blood is drawn for&#xD;
      immunogenicity testing. Reaction data at the injection site and safety profile are obtained&#xD;
      by telephone to subjects on days 1, 2, and 3 after vaccine injection. Subjects are asked&#xD;
      specifically about local injection site reactions and systemic flu-like symptoms (fever,&#xD;
      chills, muscle aches, joint pain) for 7 days after injection. Adverse events (AE) are&#xD;
      collected for 28 days after injection. Evaluation of laboratory tests for clinical safety&#xD;
      parameters are carried out at screening as well as immediately before vaccination and on day&#xD;
      7 and day 28 post-vaccination. Serious adverse events (SAE), recent medical conditions, and&#xD;
      other events requiring medical intervention are recorded for 2 months after vaccination.&#xD;
      Vaccine enabling kits are made by PT AIVITA Biomedika Indonesia. All vaccines are made in&#xD;
      Indonesia on site at participating hospitals and clinical sites.&#xD;
