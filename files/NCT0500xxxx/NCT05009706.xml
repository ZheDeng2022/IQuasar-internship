  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of the randomized controlled study is to evaluate the effects of physical&#xD;
      exercise, nutrition and symptom management on physical capacity in older, frail persons with&#xD;
      heart failure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The randomized controlled study will be conducted in order to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      individual needs of physical exercise, nutrition, and symptom management in patients with&#xD;
      heart failure who are frail and older. Patients discharged from a geriatric hospital will be&#xD;
      recruited and included after informed consent. Two weeks after hospital discharge patients&#xD;
      are randomized to intervention or control group. The intervention period is 3 months. With&#xD;
      support from a physioterapeut, dietician and a registered nurse, the intervention will be&#xD;
      performed in the participants´ home. Once a week participants will come to the hospital for&#xD;
      physical exercise led by a physiotherapist. Once a week or every other week participants will&#xD;
      meet a dietician and a nurse. Data will be collected at baseline, and 3 and 6 months after&#xD;
      baseline. Data consist of e.g. study flow description, number of eligible patients, number of&#xD;
      drop-outs, patients sociodemographic- and clinical data, physical function and performance,&#xD;
      nutritional status, symptom burden, self-care, appetite, thirst, health-related quality of&#xD;
      life. At 12 months after baseline, data will be collected on hospital admissions, reasons for&#xD;
      hospital admissions, length of stay and mortality.&#xD;

    <measure>Symptom burden</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by the questionnaire titled &quot;The Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale- Heart Failure&quot;, that evaluates symptoms experienced by the patient in the last week (a total of 36 symptoms, for example pain, nausea, tiredness). A score of 0 is given to a symptom if it is absent. If the symptom is present, it is rated using a four-point rating scale (1-4) for frequency and severity, and a five-point rating scale (0-4) for distress of the symptom with higher scores indicating greater frequency, more severity and higher distress. For each symptom, the average of the frequency, severity and distress will be calculated to produce the outcome symptom burden (total scores ranging from minimum 0 to maximum 4, with higher scores indicating greater symptom burden).</description>

    <description>Patients who are randomized to the Self Care group will receive oral and written information, advice and support on following activities: excercise (from physiotherapist), nutrition (dietician) and symptom management (nurse), based on patient´s individual needs and abilities.
