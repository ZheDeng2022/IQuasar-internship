  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A physically active life with adequate and balanced nutrition is essential for a healthy&#xD;
      life. Unhealthy diet and being physically inactive are among the common risk factors that&#xD;
      need to be corrected in order to maintain and improve health. The Mediterranean diet, first&#xD;
      described by Angel Keys, is rich in plant foods such as grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes,&#xD;
      oilseeds and olives; The main source of added oils is olive oil; moderate-high consumption of&#xD;
      fish and seafood, moderate-level consumption of eggs, poultry and dairy products, and&#xD;
      low-level red meat; It is a nutrition model with moderate intake of wine / fermented&#xD;
      beverages (such as turnip, grape juice). Preferring vegetable oils instead of animal fats,&#xD;
      preferring fish instead of red meat consumption, preferring low-fat / fat-free milk and dairy&#xD;
      products, limiting the intake of simple sugar and refined carbohydrates, fruit rich in fiber&#xD;
      and antioxidants in the Mediterranean diet, which is shown as an example of healthy nutrition&#xD;
      today. It is thought that this type of nutrition can prevent the formation of chronic&#xD;
      diseases due to features such as increasing vegetable consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determining the nutritional status and physical activity levels of individuals and their&#xD;
      associated health outcomes; It is very important in terms of determining the current&#xD;
      situation and determining the priority problems that need to be solved.&#xD;

      A physically active life with adequate and balanced nutrition is essential for a healthy&#xD;
      life. Unhealthy diet and being physically inactive are among the common risk factors that&#xD;
      need to be corrected in order to maintain and improve health. In a cohort study of seven&#xD;
      countries (USA, Finland, the Netherlands, Italy, the former Yugoslavia, Greece, and Japan)&#xD;
      based on 25 years of follow-up and examining the relationship between dietary behaviors and&#xD;
      mortality due to coronary heart disease, lower cardiovascular mortality rates were observed&#xD;
      among participating countries in the Mediterranean region. . This has been attributed to&#xD;
      traditional dietary behaviors such as high olive oil consumption in Greece, high fish&#xD;
      consumption in Dalmatia (Croatia) and high vegetable consumption in Italy. Preferring&#xD;
      vegetable oils instead of animal fats, preferring fish instead of red meat consumption,&#xD;
      preferring low-fat/fat-free milk and dairy products, limiting simple sugar and refined&#xD;
      carbohydrate intake, fruit rich in fiber and antioxidants in the Mediterranean diet, which is&#xD;
      shown as an example of healthy nutrition today. It is thought that this type of nutrition can&#xD;
      prevent the formation of chronic diseases due to the features such as increasing vegetable&#xD;
      consumption. It is reported that low physical activity levels increase the risk of chronic&#xD;
      diseases. Studies have shown that adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with&#xD;
      lower BMI, total fat, and abdominal adiposity. It is also known that a decrease in body total&#xD;
      fat rate is observed with physical activity. In addition, BMI values decrease with physical&#xD;
      activity. With the changes in lifestyle habits in recent years, societies are moving away&#xD;
      from the Mediterranean type of diet and becoming more and more sedentary. For this reason, it&#xD;
      is very important to determine the current situation regarding the health outcomes related to&#xD;
      the nutritional status and physical activity levels of the individuals, to determine the&#xD;
      priority problems that need to be solved, and to raise the awareness of the society on this&#xD;
      issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the adherence to the Mediterranean diet, physical&#xD;
      activity status and related health outcomes of adult individuals who applied to the physical&#xD;
      therapy outpatient clinic of a private hospital.&#xD;

    <description>The 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adaptation Scale (MEDAS) will be used to determine the adaptation status of individuals to the Mediterranean diet. In the scale of adaptation to the Mediterranean diet, there are a total of 14 questions, 12 of which are about food consumption frequency and 2 are about food consumption habits. The score given for each question is 0 or 1 point. Then the scores are summed and the score is evaluated as ≤5 (low agreement), 6-9 (moderate agreement) and ≥10 (high agreement).</description>

    <description>The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) will be used to examine physical activity status. According to the IPAQ form, in which daily activities are evaluated as sitting, walking, moderate and vigorous activities and questioning the activity status in the past week, individuals are grouped as inactive (&lt;600met), minimally active (600-3000met) and active (&gt;3000met) according to their IPAQ scores.</description>
