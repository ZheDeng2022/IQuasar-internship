  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no specific treatment available for COVID-19 disease. There is an urgent&#xD;
      need for affordable, worldwide available and safe agents for treatment of COVID-19. Dietary&#xD;
      supplements Curcumin, Quercetin and Vitamin D are widely used to boost the body's immune&#xD;
      system against infections. In the present study, the combination of dietary supplements&#xD;
      curcumin, quercetin and vitamin D, all contained in one soft capsule (Nasafytol), will be&#xD;
      investigated for early COVID-19 symptoms improvement and viral clearance in outpatients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 has taken the lives of 4.3 million people worldwide and&#xD;
      continues to take further lives. There is currently no specific treatment available for&#xD;
      COVID-19. Reported scientific evidence suggest that it is highly unlikely that a single agent&#xD;
      will be able to treat COVID-19, but a combination of different agents targeting different&#xD;
      pathways appears to be required to treat COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary supplements curcumin and quercetin have demonstrated strong antioxidant,&#xD;
      broad-spectrum anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties including against the respiratory&#xD;
      tract infections. They are widely used to boost the immunity against infections and keeping&#xD;
      healthy life-style. Results from recent clinical trials also suggest that people with vitamin&#xD;
      D deficiency are possibly at higher risk of getting COVID-19 infection than those with&#xD;
      sufficient vitamin D levels. A number of studies also reported significantly lower vitamin D&#xD;
      levels in patients who developed severe COVID-19 disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to investigate the potential clinical benefits of&#xD;
      combination of curcumin, quercetin and vitamin D (all contained in a single soft capsule,&#xD;
      Nasafytol) as adjunct treatment with standard for care, for early symptoms improvement and&#xD;
      viral clearance in COVID-19 in non-hospitalised patients.&#xD;
