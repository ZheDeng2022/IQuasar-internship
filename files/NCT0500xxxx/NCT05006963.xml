  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular disorder or TMD is characterized by a set of symptoms such as: pain,&#xD;
      decreased range of motion and joint noise. It's origin is multifactorial, which may be&#xD;
      related to biological aspects, environmental and psychosocial. The multimodal approach has&#xD;
      been widely used in physiotherapy for the treatment of TMDs. Physiotherapy has been walking&#xD;
      together with technology so that telerehabilitation can be a reality, contributing so that&#xD;
      quality care reaches the patient, in the impossibility office-to-face service. The objective&#xD;
      of this study is to verify the effect of telerehabilitation on pain outcomes, range of&#xD;
      motion, functionality and biopsychosocial aspects in individuals with temporomandibular&#xD;
      disorders. Will be a randomized, controlled and blinded clinical trial was carried out. The&#xD;
      study will be divided into two moments: evaluation and intervention. Evaluations will be&#xD;
      carried out using the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders: Clinical Protocol&#xD;
      and Assessment Instruments (DC/TMD), the Fonseca Anamnesis Index (IAF), the Numerical Pain&#xD;
      Scale (END) and the Functional Limitation Questionnaire (MFIQ). Individuals will be&#xD;
      randomized into 2 groups: Group A (in person) Group B (telerehabilitation). Both groups will&#xD;
      receive treatment physical therapy for 12 weeks. After collecting the data, they will be&#xD;
      tabulated and analyzed using a 5% significance level.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Two researchers will be part of the protocol. One will be responsible for pre and post intervention assessments and will be blind to the type of intervention. The other will be responsible for the treatment phase: face-to-face and telerehabilitation. A third party collaborator will process and statistically analyze the collected data. Individuals will be randomized using the statistical program present at www.randomization.com , in two groups. Randomization and concealment of allocation will be made by a fourth external employee, not research participant, who will organize the allocation in individual opaque envelopesand keep it confidential. There will be 2 blocks of 25 envelopes: face-to-face (GA) and telerehabilitation (GB). With this process, participants will have the same probability of being allocated to one of the two treatment groups. Blinding of the evaluator will be maintained until the end of the research and data tabulation.</masking_description>

    <description>The patient will be submitted to multimodal treatment, twice a week, for twelve weeks, totaling 24 face-to-face consultations lasting 40 minutes each. In the first session, the patient will be explained what is TMD, what is the correct placement of the tongue and teeth, influence of parafunctional and sleep habits in TMD signs and symptoms.Techniques of manual therapy and therapy by exercise. In general, extra-oral and intraoral massage, myofascial release in the cranio-cervical musculature, mobilization of the hyoid bone and may also receive unspecific joint mobilization. Will be mouth opening exercise will be also performed with the tongue on the palate, proprioceptive exercises with hyperboloid. In addition to these, additional exercises may be performed, according to the patient's need. The conducts will be adapted according to the needs of each patient. The use of post its may be indicated to help maintain the correct posture of the tongue and jaw, as well as sleep hygiene.</description>
