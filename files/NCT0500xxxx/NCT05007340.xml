    <textblock>
      A complex interaction between demographic, environmental and genetic mechanisms impact the&#xD;
      onset, severity and outcome of ILD-SARDs through dysregulation of the immune system and lung&#xD;
      pro-biotic pathways. Comorbidity and genetic risk indicate that there are overlapping&#xD;
      pathogenic mechanisms among SARDs, some of which underlie ILD in different SARDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this biobank is to study the clinical, pathological, laboratory, and imaging&#xD;
      characteristics of SARDs patients with lung involvement. This will help identify as unique&#xD;
      features underlying lung involvement in SARDs. In addition, this may lead to the discovery of&#xD;
      novel mechanisms of disease and potentially novel targets of treatment for SARDs patients&#xD;
      with lung disease.&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND AND STUDY RATIONALE: Characterized by immune dysregulation with disrupted&#xD;
      self-tolerance, systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs) result in inflammation and&#xD;
      auto-antibody formation that cause multi-tissue damage. The prototypic SARDs are rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc) and autoimmune&#xD;
      myositis (AIM). The lung is a frequent target of autoimmune-mediated injury in patients with&#xD;
      SARDs, and interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      patients with SARDs. Among patients with SARDs, ILD varies widely in terms of its&#xD;
      morphological pattern, time course, severity and the specific immune cells and cytokines that&#xD;
      are most responsible for lung damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fundamental clinical questions remain unanswered for understanding diagnosis and management&#xD;
      of ILD-SARDs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ILD-SARDs prediction: Which patients with SARDs are likely to develop ILD? In&#xD;
           retrospective cohorts of patients with RA, a patient's risk of developing ILD can be&#xD;
           predicted by their age, sex and presence of auto-antibodies. How these clinical features&#xD;
           interact with possible genetic and environmental risk factors needs to be better&#xD;
           established to identify SARDs patients most at risk of developing ILD and to design and&#xD;
           test interventions that reduce that risk or delay the onset of clinical manifestations&#xD;
           in high-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ILD-SARDs pathogenesis in humans and preclinical models: Why is there considerable&#xD;
           heterogeneity in ILD progression and severity in patients with ILD-SARDs? The&#xD;
           fundamental changes that occur in the immune system and lungs of patients with ILD-SARDs&#xD;
           are still poorly understood. This is in part due to a lack of appropriate pre-clinical&#xD;
           models of ILD-SARDs and lung biopsies from patients with ILD-SARDs. Identifying the&#xD;
           biologic processes that promote development of ILD in SARDs patients will let the&#xD;
           Investigators use drugs for other ILDs to specific patients with ILD-SARDs and promote&#xD;
           the development of new targeted therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ILD-SARDs treatment: Which are the best therapies for patients with ILD-SARDs? Few&#xD;
           proven treatments for patients with ILD-SARDs exist. Many are proposed based only on&#xD;
           case reports in specific SARDs. Positive results from studies of anti-fibrotic agents&#xD;
           patients show it is possible to reverse the fibrotic process; yet it is unclear whether&#xD;
           some patients with ILD-SARDs could also benefit from this approach as it may interact&#xD;
           with the immunosuppressive agents the participants already receive. Addressing this&#xD;
           issue is critical to changing the natural course of ILD-SARDs, particularly the symptoms&#xD;
           and outcomes most important to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conduct of many of the related future studies will require access to genetic material,&#xD;
      fresh peripheral blood cells, serum and tissue from a phenotypically well characterized group&#xD;
      of patients with ILD-SARDs. Access to patients is required for future clinical research&#xD;
      projects and participation in potential clinical trials. Furthermore, the ILD-SARDs Registry&#xD;
      and Biorepository is similar to registries and biorepositories that have been developed or&#xD;
      are being developed in Germany, Australia, the United States and elsewhere in Canada. These&#xD;
      similarities will facilitate national and international collaboration and allow establishment&#xD;
      of a global collaborative network that is essential for further advancement of ILD-SARDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aforementioned future studies that will benefit from the contributions of this Bank&#xD;
      include the identification of cell types, immune modulators and genetic pathways dysregulated&#xD;
      in ILD-SARDs patients; pre-clinical in vivo and ex vivo models to assess disease pathobiology&#xD;
      and targeted interventions, such as mouse models to assess mechanisms in the initiation and&#xD;
      progression of ILD in SARDs, as well as a human ILD-SARDs lung-on-a-chip model to assess and&#xD;
      predict treatment effect by evaluation mechanical evolution of the tissue; the ILD-SARDs&#xD;
      Patient Preferences study, which consists of the facilitation of focus groups to characterize&#xD;
      ILD-SARDs patients' experiences, needs and preferences; and the existing open-label, single&#xD;
      arm pilot study of the safety and tolerability of nintedanib in patients with ILD and&#xD;
      autoimmune inflammatory myopathy, to assess the effect of nintedanib on the state of&#xD;
      activation of AIM patients' blood cells and to define its effect on the immunophenotype of&#xD;
      circulating blood cells in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. OBJECTIVES, HYPOTHESIS AND STUDY QUESTIONS A complex interplay between demographic,&#xD;
      environmental and genetic mechanisms impact the onset, severity and outcome of ILD-SARDs&#xD;
      through dysregulation of the immune system and lung pro-biotic pathways. Co-morbidity and&#xD;
      extensive sharing of genetic risk indicate that there are overlapping pathogenic mechanisms&#xD;
      among SARDs, some of which underlie ILD in different SARDs. The multidisciplinary team will&#xD;
      examine this hypothesis through the establishment of a prospective registry of patients with&#xD;
      ILD-SARDs to be enrolled and followed longitudinally, combined with a biorepository.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. STUDY METHODS The Investigators will develop a longitudinal clinical registry and&#xD;
      biorepository of ILD-SARDs patients. Patient recruitment, informed consent, management,&#xD;
      storage of data/samples and all other research activities will be done in accordance with the&#xD;
      ILD-SARDs Biobank Management Framework. The ILD-SARDs informed consent forms will be used to&#xD;
      obtain participant consent. To estimate recruitment in this cohort, the Investigators&#xD;
      reviewed the number of patients seen in the multispecialty ILD-SARDs clinic at the McGill&#xD;
      University Health Centre (MUHC) over the last year. The Investigators will recruit an&#xD;
      inception cohort for biobanking with annual collection of structured clinical data. Clinical&#xD;
      data - including clinical rheumatologic and pulmonary assessment, serology, pulmonary&#xD;
      function tests, CT imaging, pathology, current treatments - will be collected at every visit.&#xD;
      A biorepository will store biological specimens such as blood cells, serum and DNA/RNA for&#xD;
      the cohort members. More specifically, the Investigators will collect whole blood samples at&#xD;
      visits as defined above. Those belonging to treatment-naive patients will be sent to Dr.&#xD;
      David Langlais' lab at the Inflammation Genomics Lab of the McGill University Genome Centre&#xD;
      for single cell RNA sequencing and immunophenotyping. A Standard Operating Process (SOP) for&#xD;
      blood sampling, shipping and storage has been developed to detail this process. As for whole&#xD;
      blood samples coming from non-treatment-naive-patients, those will be sent to Dr. Gregory&#xD;
      Fonseca's lab at the Meakins-Christie Lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital to be processed, and&#xD;
      the resulting serum will be biobanked. Moreover, patients with an available bronchoalveolar&#xD;
      lavage, lung, skin or muscle biopsy, as well as blood samples will be asked for consent for&#xD;
      the study staff to access those samples for the purpose of this research. These samples are&#xD;
      essential for the mechanisms established in future studies and will help enable them. The&#xD;
      PIs, working under different disciplines, will all equally contribute to the study by&#xD;
      identifying eligible participants, having medical oversight and study conduct, having written&#xD;
      confirmation of inclusion/exclusion criteria, conducting a physical exam, assessing and&#xD;
      signing adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), providing medical care and&#xD;
      follow-up to the participant and reviewing, interpreting and signing lab and other test&#xD;
      results. Together, this will allow for a larger number of participants to be identified and&#xD;
      followed up in this study.&#xD;
