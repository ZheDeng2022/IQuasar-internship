  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Risk of rehospitalization within 30 days of discharge is higher than 20% in patients with&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and up to 20% for patients with community&#xD;
      acquired pneumonia (CAP). This pre-post intervention study aims to quantify the impact of&#xD;
      continuous remote patient monitoring (RPM) on rates of hospital readmission for patients&#xD;
      presenting with CAP or exacerbation of COPD and compare the intervention group to historical&#xD;
      controls that did not have access to the intervention. We hypothesize that an intervention&#xD;
      combining remote patient monitoring with the remote clinical services and escalation pathways&#xD;
      available at SSH (including the Mobile Integrated Health (MIH) program) will reduce hospital&#xD;
      readmission within the 30 days following hospital discharge compared to standard of care in&#xD;
      this population.&#xD;
