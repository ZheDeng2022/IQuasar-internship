    <textblock>
      In this prospective study, 68Ga-PSMA integrated PET/MR imaging was applied for the diagnosis&#xD;
      and staging of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The detection and diagnostic performance of&#xD;
      68Ga-PSMA PET/MR for HCC was evaluated in comparison with the gold standard of puncture&#xD;
      biopsy or postoperative pathology. The aim is to make up for the deficiency in FDG PET&#xD;
      imaging in the diagnosis and staging of HCC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most dangerous malignancies in human health,&#xD;
      with the sixth highest incidence of malignant tumors. However, early diagnosis of HCC is&#xD;
      difficult. The currently used glucose metabolism imaging agent, 18F-FDG, also accumulates in&#xD;
      large amounts in normal liver tissue, which affects the diagnosis of HCC lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a type II transmembrane glycoprotein encoded by&#xD;
      the FOLH1 gene, is highly expressed in prostate epithelial cells and has been widely used in&#xD;
      the study of prostate cancer. Further studies have found that it is involved in tumor&#xD;
      angiogenesis in a variety of solid tumors of non-prostate tissue origin. It is also&#xD;
      overexpressed in neovascular endothelial cells of hepatocellular carcinoma, which is&#xD;
      significantly associated with tumor grading, staging and prognosis. Moreover, PSMA also has&#xD;
      great potential as a target for anti-vascular therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The integrated PET/MR is currently the most advanced imaging device, combining the advantages&#xD;
      of PET and MR, with the high sensitivity of PET and the high soft tissue contrast of MR. It&#xD;
      has significant advantages over PET/CT in head and neck, abdominopelvic lesions. And MR&#xD;
      imaging has no additional radiation and a higher biosafety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the potential of 68Ga-PSMA for HCC imaging, this prospective study proposes to&#xD;
      apply 68Ga-PSMA integrated PET/MR imaging for diagnosis and staging of HCC. The detection and&#xD;
      diagnostic performance of 68Ga-PSMA PET/MR for HCC was evaluated in comparison with the gold&#xD;
      standard of biopsy or postoperative pathology. The aim is to make up for the deficiency in&#xD;
      FDG PET imaging in the diagnosis and staging of HCC.&#xD;
