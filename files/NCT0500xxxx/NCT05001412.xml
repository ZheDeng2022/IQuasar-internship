  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 combined with chemotherapy in the treatment of extensive&#xD;
      small-cell lung cancer is still unsatisfactory. PD-1/PD-L1 combined with chemotherapy and&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic drugs may achieve better efficacy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Camrelizumab is a humanized PD-1 monoclonal antibody. Camrelizumab combined with the&#xD;
      antiangiogenic drug apatinib has achieved good efficacy in extensive small-cell lung cancer.&#xD;
      Median OS is 8.4 months. In our study, subjects with extensive stage small cell lung cancers&#xD;
      receive 2 cycles of chemotherapy followed by carrizumab combined with apatinib and&#xD;
      chemotherapy. we hope to achieve a better outcome.&#xD;
