  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The TIDE project aims to establish personal indicators for initial treatment choice for youth&#xD;
      with first episode depression. Specifically, 100 adolescents and young adults (age 12 to 25)&#xD;
      with untreated major depressive disorder of recent onset will be randomly allocated in 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to one of two evidence-based regimens for youth depression: (A) Individual&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioural therapy; and (B) Optimized pharmacological treatment with an&#xD;
      antidepressant. All participants will be offered active treatment for up to 1 year and&#xD;
      follow-up for 2 years to establish short- and long-term outcomes, including change in&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, maintenance of remission, core role functioning, achievement of&#xD;
      educational, occupational and social milestones, and quality of life. Baseline&#xD;
      characteristics including duration of untreated depression, pre-existing anxiety,&#xD;
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, substance use, symptoms of reduced interest and&#xD;
      activity, sleep, rhythm and melody of speech, brain function, history of childhood adversity,&#xD;
      coping style, repetitive thinking, and family history of depression and bipolar disorder will&#xD;
      be tested as potential moderators of outcome. Characteristics that differentially predict&#xD;
      outcomes in those allocated to initial cognitive-behavioural therapy and those allocated to&#xD;
      initial treatment with antidepressants will be combined into a personalized allocation&#xD;
      algorithm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Design: TIDE is an open-label randomized trial with two parallel arms and long-term&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Youth and young adults with major depressive disorder will participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Young people aged 12 to 25 will be recruited through family physicians, child&#xD;
      and adolescent mental health services (NSHA, IWK Central referral), student health,&#xD;
      traditional advertisement (posters), and social media advertisement (Instagram, Facebook,&#xD;
      Reddit, and Twitter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random allocation: Consenting eligible participants will be randomly allocated in 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      to intervention A (cognitive-behavioral therapy) or intervention B (optimized antidepressant&#xD;
      treatment), by an independent statistician using random blocks (block size 4 to 8),&#xD;
      stratified by participant age (&lt;18; ≥18). The allocation sequence will be held by a&#xD;
      statistician at a separate location (the Research Methods Unit) and will remain concealed&#xD;
      from the assessment and treatment team until the baseline assessment is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: It is our aim to personalize the choice between established active treatments,&#xD;
      not to test an active treatment against an inactive control. Therefore, the investigator will&#xD;
      offer every participant entering the study an intervention that is established as safe and&#xD;
      effective. Within the established interventions, the investigator chose two that have the&#xD;
      largest amount of evidence for efficacy: cognitive-behavioural therapy and the antidepressant&#xD;
      fluoxetine. These two interventions are at equipoise, meaning that the investigator has&#xD;
      equally high expectation of treatment success from both approaches. Yet the two treatment&#xD;
      strategies represent distinct choices, with intervention A relying on intensive psychological&#xD;
      treatment and intervention B on optimized delivery of the best-established medication&#xD;
      treatment for depression in youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the first episode of depression is a dynamic state with a variety of outcomes, the&#xD;
      intervention will proceed in stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 0: Lead in. Participants may enter the study at different stages of the first episode&#xD;
      onset, with some starting at a point where the indications for treatment or eligibility&#xD;
      criteria are uncertain or at a time when the participant is undecided on whether they need or&#xD;
      want to start active treatment. To accommodate these early stages, there is a lead-in of 1-4&#xD;
      weeks to establish the diagnosis, assess severity and support the participant while deciding&#xD;
      on whether they want to start active treatment. This stage will include up to four weekly&#xD;
      meeting with a clinician (psychiatrist, psychologist, or CBT therapist) that may involve&#xD;
      information gathering, information provision, risk monitoring and supportive contact, but no&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioural therapy or pharmacotherapy. If the participant and the clinician agree&#xD;
      that treatment is indicated, the participant can transition to Stage 1 (active intervention).&#xD;
      Stage 0 is not randomized. If the participant recovers and no longer meets inclusion criteria&#xD;
      or decides that they do not need active treatment, they may transition directly to Stage 3&#xD;
      (Follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage1: Active interventions. At this stage, all participants will be offered active&#xD;
      treatment for depression. Radom allocation will occur at the beginning of Stage 1 and will&#xD;
      determine whether the participant is offered Intervention A or Intervention B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention A: Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). This intervention starts with a course&#xD;
      of 20 sessions of individual CBT, offered over 16 weeks. The sessions will be conducted&#xD;
      one-on-one, with a trained and supervised CBT therapist giving full attention to one&#xD;
      participant at a time. Over the course of treatment participants will develop an&#xD;
      understanding of the cognitive, behavioural, emotional, and environmental factors which&#xD;
      contribute to maintaining their depression. They will learn and apply skills to interrupt&#xD;
      unhelpful cognitive and behavioural patterns and engage in guided exploration to improve&#xD;
      self-understanding. CBT is a structured and collaborative treatment and, as such, each&#xD;
      session will follow a similar pattern and commence with a collaboratively set agenda. Weekly&#xD;
      &quot;homework&quot; will be used to maximize opportunities for practice and consolidation of new&#xD;
      skills with the aim of the participant being able to apply these skills well beyond the&#xD;
      termination of therapy. The individual sessions can be combined with optional&#xD;
      family/parent/partner sessions, depending on the situation and preferences of the&#xD;
      participant. All sessions will be video-recorded to allow high-quality supervision, fidelity-&#xD;
      and quality-assurance. This way of delivery corresponds to the best evidence available for&#xD;
      CBT for adolescents and young adults that is established as the best practice through&#xD;
      rigorous trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention B: Antidepressant pharmacotherapy. The choice of antidepressants follows the&#xD;
      best established evidence for treating depression in adolescents and young adults. The&#xD;
      investigator will initially offer treatment with fluoxetine, starting at 10mg once daily and&#xD;
      increasing to 20mg once daily after one week if tolerated, a protocol established as safe and&#xD;
      effective in both adolescents and adults across multiple trials. Additional dose increases to&#xD;
      40 or 60mg will be possible based on balance of positive effects and side-effects and&#xD;
      clinical judgement, consistent with recommendations in this age group. In cases of&#xD;
      intolerance or adverse reaction to fluoxetine, the investigator will switch to sertraline (25&#xD;
      to 200mg) or escitalopram (5 to 20mg), the other two antidepressants licensed by the Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration for major depressive disorder in adolescents. The treatment with&#xD;
      fluoxetine (or sertraline, or escitalopram) will be optimized over 16 weeks, a time-frame&#xD;
      comparable to the CBT intervention. The investigator expects that most participants will only&#xD;
      use the antidepressant for as long as required to minimized overall exposure to&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy. Pharmacotherapy will be managed and prescribed by qualified psychiatrists,&#xD;
      referred to as pharmacotherapists through this protocol. The pharmacotherapist will hold&#xD;
      appointments when starting the treatment, after 1 week, two weeks and then in two-weekly&#xD;
      intervals for the reminder of the 16 weeks acute treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2. Continuation treatment and cross-over options: After completion of a course of CBT&#xD;
      or antidepressant, further decisions depend on the outcome of the initial treatment and will&#xD;
      be personalized, based on a discussion between the participant and a clinician. If a full&#xD;
      remission of depression is achieved, the next stage may involve continuation of the same&#xD;
      treatment (up to 4 booster sessions of CBT, continued treatment with an antidepressant). If a&#xD;
      remission is not achieved, the best recommended next step is the cross-over to (or the&#xD;
      addition of) the other established treatment. Therefore, participants who received CBT in&#xD;
      Stage 1 and did not reach remission will be offered treatment with an antidepressant, and&#xD;
      participants who received the antidepressant in Stage 1 will be offered CBT. The decision of&#xD;
      whether to continue Stage 1 treatment will be based on the balance of benefits and adverse&#xD;
      effects for the participant. Participants who started antidepressant in Stage 1 and did not&#xD;
      achieve full remission may decide to continue the antidepressant while also receiving CBT or&#xD;
      to stop the antidepressant with coordinated support from the pharmacotherapist and the CBT&#xD;
      therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3: Follow-up. The investigators will follow participants once every 3 months for up to&#xD;
      2 years. The purpose of this follow-up stage is to monitor the stability of remission and&#xD;
      functional outcomes. If the investigators identify re-emergence of depressive symptoms, the&#xD;
      investigators will offer Stage 2 interventions or appropriate clinical referral as&#xD;
      appropriate based on consultation with the principal investigator or other qualified&#xD;
      psychiatrist. For participants who do not achieve remission in stages 1 and 2, the clinically&#xD;
      advisable next steps may involve augmentation with additional treatment. Such augmentation&#xD;
      treatment is beyond the scope of the present protocol. Participants will be allowed to remain&#xD;
      in the follow-up stage even if they receive additional treatment through regular clinical&#xD;
      services or additional studies.&#xD;

             hypnotics, anxiolytics) or receipt of 4 of more sessions of cognitive-behavioural&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding. If participants become pregnant or learn of pregnancies&#xD;
             during the study, we will consult with Dr. Tanya Tulipan and jointly make the best&#xD;
             decision for the participant with the option to either continue or end study&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
