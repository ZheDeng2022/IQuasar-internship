    <textblock>
      The traditional method of tracheal intubation requires the insertion of a laryngoscope into&#xD;
      the oral cavity and directly visualisation of the glottis. The traditional head position&#xD;
      called the sniffing the morning air position; consisting of lower cervical flexion and&#xD;
      extension of the atlanto-occipital joint is commonly used to facilitate tracheal intubation&#xD;
      in this manner by aligning the oral axes and providing the operator a view of the glottis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the advancement of technology, has seen videolaryngoscopes (VL) developed to ease&#xD;
      tracheal intubation. With VL, the glottis is seen through a camera connected to a viewing&#xD;
      screen either attached to the top of the laryngoscope or connected to a camera screen by&#xD;
      cable. One of the main drawbacks with VL is that a good view of the glottis is seen on the&#xD;
      screen, but it can be difficult to pass the tracheal tube through the glottis in comparison&#xD;
      to the traditional intubation technique described above. One of the main factors the authors&#xD;
      suggest is that VL-assisted intubation requires a head and neck position that is different to&#xD;
      the sniffing the morning air position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the oral axes in three different head and neck positions under MRI&#xD;
      to assess which positions improve axial alignment the most.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The traditional method of tracheal intubation requires the insertion of a laryngoscope with&#xD;
      the left hand into the oral cavity to displace the tongue and directly visualise the glottis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sniffing the morning air (or sniffing) position has been traditionally used for tracheal&#xD;
      intubation using direct laryngoscopy. This comprises of flexion of the lower cervical spine,&#xD;
      extension at the atlanto-occiptal joint and a horizontal level between the tragus of the ear&#xD;
      and sternum. The theoretical purpose of this position is to improve the glottic visualisation&#xD;
      by aligning the oral, pharyngeal and tracheal axes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years with the advancement of technology, videolaryngoscopy has become popular and&#xD;
      many centres are now using only videolaryngoscopes for tracheal intubation. Visualisation&#xD;
      occurs indirectly through fibreoptic or digital channels. Most videolaryngoscopes use two&#xD;
      types of blades. The Macintosh type for normal airway and hyper-angulated blade for difficult&#xD;
      airway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperangulated blades such as the Glidescope LoPro (Verathon Inc, Bothwell, WA, USA), McGrath&#xD;
      Series 5 X blade (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and Storz C-Mac D-blade (Karl Storz&#xD;
      Endoscoke, Tuttlingen, Germany) are more curved than the traditional standard geometry used&#xD;
      with direct laryngoscopy and are thought to improve glottis visualisation without significant&#xD;
      change in head position. However, visualisation of glottis is one of the three steps involved&#xD;
      in videolaryngoscopy assisted tracheal intubation. The other two steps include aligning the&#xD;
      tube with the glottic inlet and advancing the tube through the glottis into the trachea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main drawbacks in videolaryngoscopy is that despite good view of glottis on the&#xD;
      screen, it can be difficult to successfully advance the tracheal tube into the trachea.&#xD;
      Anterior impingement of the tracheal tube at the sub-glottic region is a recognised problem&#xD;
      with hyperangulated and channelled videolaryngoscopes. VL directs the pre-formed tracheal&#xD;
      tube anteriorly but the trachea descends posteriorly into the thorax creating an acute angle&#xD;
      impeding passage of the tube. This can result in difficult intubation or a failed intubation.&#xD;
      Manoeuvres such as tube rotation and rotation of bougie can rectify this problem to some&#xD;
      extent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous study found that laryngoscopy was more difficult with hyper-angulated blades in&#xD;
      the sniffing position as compared to neutral position, contradictory to traditional&#xD;
      laryngoscopy teaching. Intermediary positions between sniffing and supine should be studied&#xD;
      as these may balance the needs of maintaining sufficient mouth opening and not hindering&#xD;
      angles affecting the axial alignment. Both studies recommend the benefits of a ramped&#xD;
      position as it does reduce the time to desaturation and reduces aspiration risk compared to&#xD;
      supine neutral positions and should be considered when using hyperangulated blades. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using magnetic resonance imaging in awake and healthy patients, Adnet, et al. measured the&#xD;
      oral, pharyngeal and tracheal axes using the neutral position, sniffing position and simple&#xD;
      head extension and found neither position resulted in perfect alignment of the 3 axes.&#xD;
      However, they did not study the effect of position on angle between tracheal and laryngeal&#xD;
      axes. The search for further evidence is necessary for VL as there is a paucity of research&#xD;
      in with regard to best head and neck position for videolaryngoscopy.&#xD;

    <description>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows measurement of the axes described to suggest which head and neck position would provide best anatomical alignment to reduce anterior impingement.&#xD;
All the MRI scans will be conducted using 3.0 Tesla (Optima 750w, GE Medical, Milwaukee, WI, USA) using the cervical spine section of the coil. T2-weighted images in the sagittal plane will be acquired using a fast recovery fast spin echo (FRFSE) technique. The scans will take around two and half minutes and a member of the anaesthetic investigator team will be present to facilitate positional changes and maintain consistency. MRI scanning will be performed in following 3 head and neck positions:&#xD;
Neutral position, Sniffing position and the Extension position.</description>
