  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MaHeVi is a multicenter, cross-sectional, population-based study which will include 2500&#xD;
      adults in the health care centers / missions located on the 2 sides of the Maroni River. All&#xD;
      major inhabitants of the river border between French Guiana and Suriname may participate,&#xD;
      after an extensive communication campaign.The main objective is to estimate the prevalence&#xD;
      and status of infection with hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), D (VHD) and HIV in the&#xD;
      general adult population of the Maroni River, border between French Guiana and Suriname.&#xD;
      After signing the informed consent and pre-test counseling, capillary blood will be collected&#xD;
      on blotting paper. Participants will be interviewed on infection risk factors. Positivity for&#xD;
      HBsAg, total anti-HBcAb, anti-HCV Ab, total anti-HDV Ab(for HBsAg positive) and HIV p24 Ag or&#xD;
      anti-HIV Ab (confirmed by molecular biology for hepatitis and Western Blot for HIV) will&#xD;
      inform respectively on the HBV, HCV, HDV and HIV infection status.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HBV, HCV and HDV are viruses with parenteral, sexual and mother-to-child transmission,&#xD;
      associated with high morbidity and mortality. They are responsible for the majority of hepato&#xD;
      cellular carcinoma. More than 1.4 million people die each year of complications associated&#xD;
      with these infections. Most people do not know their chronic viral hepatitis status which&#xD;
      leads to frequent late stage diagnosis of the disease. Treatments allow viral control or&#xD;
      suppression of HBV and HCV. The knowledge of the status can reduce transmission,early&#xD;
      effective treatment and avoid or delay late complications. In South America, the prevalence&#xD;
      of HBV varies widely but is high (&gt; 8%) in the Amazon basin. In some areas a third of HBsAg&#xD;
      carriers are also infected with HDV, a major co morbidity factor. French Guiana and Suriname&#xD;
      are part of the Amazon biome and are populated by a mosaic of communities. The few available&#xD;
      data suggest high variability in hepatitis B and C prevalence in the different communities.&#xD;
      The Maroni River is inhabited by Maroon (descendants of slaves of African origin who escaped&#xD;
      from Surinamese plantations) and Amerindian communities (indigenous). Reliable data&#xD;
      prevalence of HBV, HCV and HIV are lacking in these remote, mobile and vulnerable&#xD;
      populations. The infection risk is high, due to low vaccination coverage against HBV, low&#xD;
      screening rate and delayed access to care and treatment. There are no data on HDV in this&#xD;
      region. In terms of public health, it is of great importance to explore the epidemic of viral&#xD;
      hepatitis in the Maroni population pool because the lack of data is an obstacle to the&#xD;
      planning of adapted and efficient health interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicenter, cross-sectional, population-based study will include 2500 adults in the&#xD;
      health care centers / missions located on the 2 sides of the Maroni River. All major&#xD;
      inhabitants of the river may participate, after an extensive communication campaign. After&#xD;
      signing the informed consent and pre-test counseling, capillary blood will be collected on&#xD;
      blotting paper. Participants will be interviewed on infection risk factors. Positivity for&#xD;
      HBsAg, total anti-HBcAb, anti-HCV Ab, total anti-HDV Ab(for HBsAg positive) and HIV p24 Ag or&#xD;
      anti-HIV Ab (confirmed by molecular biology for hepatitis and Western Blot for HIV) will&#xD;
      inform respectively on the HBV, HCV, HDV and HIV infection status. Positive participants will&#xD;
      be analyzed in molecular biology (viral load and genotyping). The results will be provided&#xD;
      individually and confidentially to participants; positive patients will receive standard care&#xD;
      following national guidelines.&#xD;

    <description>After answering the questionnaire, the nurse or the doctor will take a sample of capillary blood from the fingertip on the side of the distal phalanx of a middle or ring finger. The puncture site will be prepared by warming and massage to optimize blood flow and disinfected with a disposable 70% alcohol wipe. After drying, the puncture will be performed using a single use safety lancet. A total of 7 capillary blood spotswill be collected and deposited on the filter paper (each spot is about 50µL of capillary blood), 5 for the study and 2 for the biological collection.</description>

All positive participants will be contacted if they do not spontaneously come to retrieve their results (within approximately 1 month after result's availability), and invited to come to the health centre to retrieve their results individually and be oriented towards the heathcare circuit.</description>
