    <textblock>
      Logica Mirror femoral stem is a CE marked medical device, and within this clinical trial it&#xD;
      is used according to its intended use. This is a Post Marketing Clinical Follow Up trial,&#xD;
      with the main aim to collect additional evidences on the outcome data on this product, by&#xD;
      analysing clinical scoring systems, radiographs and adverse event records within three years&#xD;
      after the surgery, and thus to assess the short-term performance and safety of this implant.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The trial is open-label, not randomized, prospective and longitudinal cohort clinical study.

    <measure>Harris Hip Score - Functional change between preop and 3 years FU</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Functional change in Harris Hip Score (HHS) from preoperative (baseline) to 3 years after surgery.&#xD;
The maximum score of HHS is 100 points. Pain domain contributes 44 points, function 47, ROM 5 and absence of deformity 4 points.&#xD;
Results can be interpreted with the following: Less than 60= failed result; 60 to 69= poor result; 70 to 79= fair; 80 to 90= good; 90 to 100= excellent;</description>

    <description>Functional change in Oxford Hip Score between preoperative (baseline) and 6 weeks FU, 3 months FU, 1 year FU, 3 years FU. The OHS is a short 12-item survey. It comprises two domains (pain and function), with six items or questions in each, using the following scoring: each question has been scored between 0 and 4, with 4 being the best outcome, producing overall scores running from 0 to 48, with 48 being the best outcome.&#xD;
The calculation of the total score of OHS is based on this scoring system and the resulted score can be interpreted as follows: less than 27 points= poor; 27 to 33 points= fair; 34 to 41 points= good; 41 to 48 points= excellent</description>

    <description>Functional evaluation of VAS satisfaction at 6 weeks FU, 3 months FU, 1 year FU, 3 years FU;&#xD;
Patient is asked to rate his satisfaction by making a vertical mark on the 100-mm line. The measurement in millimetres is eventually converted to the same number of points ranging from 0 to 100 points</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiographic implant evaluation and stability assessment of Logica Mirror stem</measure>
    <time_frame>At discharge, 6 weeks, 3 months, 1 year, 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Stability assessment of Logica Mirror stem (through radiographic implant evaluation) at the following timepoints: at discharge, 6 weeks, 3 months, 1 year, 3 years.&#xD;
For assessing the stability of the femoral component in a cemented configuration, the presence of radiolucent lines should be recorded both at stem-cement interface and at cement-bone interface.&#xD;
At each postoperative time-point the radiolucencies will be measured in every Gruen zone and graded in accordance to the following classification:&#xD;
None: No evidence of radiolucency&#xD;
mm: Presence of 1 mm-width radiolucent lines&#xD;
mm: Presence of 2 mm-width radiolucent lines &gt; 2 mm: Presence of radiolucent lines wider than 2 mm</description>
