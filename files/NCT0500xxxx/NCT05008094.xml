  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, which affects&#xD;
      2-3% of the general population above 65 years. There are significant differences in incidence&#xD;
      depending on geographical location, race, and ethnicity. The exact cause of the disease is&#xD;
      still unknown, but the role of genetic and environmental factors has already been&#xD;
      established. Certain genetic forms of the disease make up for a small percentage, so it is&#xD;
      thought that environmental factors have a more significant impact on the development of the&#xD;
      disease. The incidence of PD is higher in people exposed to significant quantities of&#xD;
      pesticides and traumatic brain injury, while there is a smaller incidence in smokers and&#xD;
      people consuming more significant quantities of caffeine. The project will finish in four&#xD;
      years, with the first 20 months dedicated to the first phase (genetic-epidemiological&#xD;
      research), and the entirety of the 48 months for the second phase of the project (prospective&#xD;
      clinical research).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of the first phase of the project is to determine which genetic mutations are&#xD;
      the ones most represented in the Croatian population afflicted with the familial form of PD.&#xD;
      In the second phase the main goal is to determine the influence of genetic factors and&#xD;
      microbiological factors on the disease's progression as well as on the treatment outcomes.&#xD;
      Specific goals of this part of the project are to determine how many patients in the general&#xD;
      population of PD patients present with a genetic disorder and which genes have a role in that&#xD;
      disorder, as well as determine the composition of intestinal and oral microbiota both in the&#xD;
      patient test group and the healthy control group. Furthermore, specific goals are to evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of standard PD treatment on the composition of microbiota, neurodegeneration&#xD;
      progression and the activity of neuroinflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) and to&#xD;
      examine whether there is a link between the physiological and the pathophysiological function&#xD;
      of microbiota, using markers of disease progression and glial activity. Last specific goal is&#xD;
      to analyze potential pathological conformation protein forms that could be used as a&#xD;
      biomarker in early stages of the disease and a biomarker of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase of the study will provide the first epidemiologic data on the familial form&#xD;
      of PD, as well as the mutations most represented in patients with PD in Croatia.&#xD;
      Additionally, the prospective clinical study will contribute to enlightening the intertwined&#xD;
      effects of genetic and environmental factors in the emergence and progression of the disease,&#xD;
      as well as their effect on treatment outcome. Intestinal and oral microbiota composition&#xD;
      analysis will determine whether there is a difference between PD and the healthy population&#xD;
      while using the short-chain fatty acid profile will determine the metabolic differences&#xD;
      between the two groups. Analyzing the markers of CNS homeostasis, inflammation, and&#xD;
      neuroglial function will determine the progression of the disease and also correlate them to&#xD;
      genetic factors as well as the microbiota function and composition. Analyzing the&#xD;
      pathological conformation forms of alpha-synuclein could lead to the discovery of novel&#xD;
      biomarkers in the early stages of the disease, as well as to follow the progression of the&#xD;
      disease&#xD;

      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, which affects&#xD;
      2-3% of the general population above 65 years. There are significant differences in incidence&#xD;
      depending on geographical location, race, and ethnicity. The exact cause of the disease is&#xD;
      still unknown, but the role of genetic and environmental factors has already been&#xD;
      established. Certain genetic forms of the disease make up for a small percentage, so it is&#xD;
      thought that environmental factors have a more significant impact on the development of the&#xD;
      disease. The incidence of PD is higher in people exposed to significant quantities of&#xD;
      pesticides and traumatic brain injury, while there is a smaller incidence in smokers and&#xD;
      people consuming more significant quantities of caffeine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, intestinal and oral microbiota is regarded as a significant factor in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of the disease, due to the discovered floral imbalance in people suffering from&#xD;
      PD. At this point, it is unknown whether the dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota precedes&#xD;
      the disease or it is the result of the disturbed neuronal communication of the liver-brain&#xD;
      axis. Since there has not been a proper epidemiological study conducted in Croatia so far,&#xD;
      there is no knowledge of the number of cases of PD linked with genetic and environmental&#xD;
      factors, doing this project that more scientifically and socially impactful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A specific pathophysiological event in PD is the loss of neurons in the substantia nigra,&#xD;
      along with the accumulation of the intracellular protein α-synuclein in the entire central&#xD;
      nervous system. It is important to note that PD is asymptomatic for an extended period since&#xD;
      the symptoms start manifesting only when there is a loss of more than 70-80% of dopaminergic&#xD;
      neurons. Dysfunction of glial cells, cells that are usually in charge of keeping homeostatic&#xD;
      conditions in the central nervous system accompanies PD. The dysfunction leads to&#xD;
      neuroinflammation and microglial activation, phagocytosis and the destruction of neurons. On&#xD;
      the other hand, there is a lack of a proper nutritive and reparative reaction from&#xD;
      astrocytes, glial cells involved in neuroprotection and injury repair in the CNS.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, there is still no specific biomarker known for PD, however alterations of&#xD;
      neurodegenerative, nutritive, and immunological markers in these disorders enable&#xD;
      experimental monitoring of disease progression. Recent research proposed a link between&#xD;
      intestinal microflora and glial cells in physiological conditions, but also in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders. It is currently thought that the first&#xD;
      pathophysiological changes, occur inside the intestinal nervous system, which is in direct&#xD;
      contact with the intestinal microflora. This way the intestinal microbiota could modulate the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of PD and contribute to the interindividual variability of the clinical&#xD;
      presentation. Even though a small number of studies did focus on this part of the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of the disease, the real effect of the intestinal and oral microflora dysbiosis&#xD;
      on the pathogenesis of PD is not established. Also, there have been no studies which explore&#xD;
      the relationship between genetic and environmental factors, making prospective studies with&#xD;
      de novo PD patients necessary in shedding light on the mean effects of the dysbiosis on the&#xD;
      disease progression and treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will finish in four years, with the first 20 months dedicated to the first phase&#xD;
      (genetic-epidemiological research), and the entirety of the 48 months for the second phase of&#xD;
      the project (prospective clinical research) Participants: The research group in the first&#xD;
      phase of the research includes patients with PD throughout the Republic of Croatia. The&#xD;
      population would include all the available afflicted currently residing in Croatia, which are&#xD;
      members or work with the Croatian PD patient's association. The estimated response is 10% of&#xD;
      the PD population (500-750 patients) The patients will fill the epidemiologic questionnaires&#xD;
      and patients with familial PD will be selected. The expected emergence of the hereditary form&#xD;
      of the disease in the PD population is around 10-15% (50-75). The second phase of the&#xD;
      research (prospective clinical trial) includes two subject groups. The first will be made up&#xD;
      from patients from the Clinical Hospital Centers in Rijeka, which have not been actively&#xD;
      treated yet (drug-naive), while the second will consist of healthy controls in the same age&#xD;
      range. The target number of subjects in both of these two groups is 50. Inclusion criteria&#xD;
      for participation of drug-naïve patients is a confirmed PD diagnosis according to the&#xD;
      Movement Disorder Society Clinical Diagnostic criteria. The healthy control group will&#xD;
      consist of participants from the same age group with the same nutritional status (body mass&#xD;
      index), as well as living in the same geographical area as the test group. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      for participation include unique diet plans, chronic bowel disease, any autoimmune disorder,&#xD;
      acute infectious diseases, acute active inflammation, patient history positive for&#xD;
      significant gastrointestinal surgical procedures and an active antibiotic, probiotic,&#xD;
      nutritive supplement, corticosteroid, and immunosuppressive drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase - genetic-epidemiological study (20 months): In the first nine months,&#xD;
      throughout Croatia, participants who are members or work with the Croatian PD patient's&#xD;
      association will be recruited. At the end of the first year of the research, the participants&#xD;
      will have their whole exomes sequenced with the help of next-generation sequencing (NGS), to&#xD;
      find genetic variants in Croatian patients. Through the second year of research, result&#xD;
      analysis and dissemination are planned, as well as counseling in participants with a&#xD;
      confirmed familial variant of the disease. For this purpose, the participants will give blood&#xD;
      samples for genetic analysis. The target number of subjects in this phase of the research is&#xD;
      50. The participants will also be asked to fill out several structured study forms, which&#xD;
      should provide an estimation of the genetic background of the participant, along with&#xD;
      information on their biorhythm, sleep patterns, diet, life goals, and general stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase - a prospective clinical study (48 months): Participant selection will be&#xD;
      conducted throughout the first year of the clinical study. The following time intervals are&#xD;
      selected for control visits: baseline; 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 30 months. The&#xD;
      result analysis and dissemination are planned in the last two years of research. Every&#xD;
      participant in the study will have their exome sequenced with NGS, with the focus mostly&#xD;
      being on parts that have a known impact on the pathogenesis of PD. Both the patients and&#xD;
      healthy control population will also have their microbiota composition determined with NGS,&#xD;
      as well as their functional state through the analysis of the short-chain fatty acid&#xD;
      composition, known metabolic products of the microbiota. ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent&#xD;
      Assay) will be used to assess the inflammatory state, glial functions, and disease&#xD;
      progression will also be determined through specific markers in the participant's serum and&#xD;
      plasma samples. Fluorescent correlation spectroscopy (FCS), more specifically, Thioflavin T&#xD;
      (ThT) fluctuating intensity fluorescent analysis (FIFA) will be used to determine the&#xD;
      existence of pathological conformation protein forms and their relation to the disease's&#xD;
      grade and therapy. It is for these methods that the participants will be asked to give a&#xD;
      blood, stool, and saliva sample. The disease progression will also be monitored with&#xD;
      transcranial B-mod sonography and magnetic brain resonance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exome sequencing will be conducted at baseline, while the analysis of the composition and&#xD;
      function of microbiota will be performed on the first and last control visit. Biomarker&#xD;
      analysis, protein conformation analysis and neuro-radiological methods will be conducted at&#xD;
      every control examination. From the first visit, the participants will be asked to fill out&#xD;
      several structured study questionnaires, which will provide an estimation of the genetic&#xD;
      background of the participant, along with information on their biorhythm, sleep patterns,&#xD;
      diet, life goals, and general stress. Moreover, the cognitive state of the participants will&#xD;
      be evaluated through validated tests like the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the&#xD;
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), while the general non-motoric symptoms will be&#xD;
      evaluated with the help of the Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMSQ) and the Non-Motor&#xD;
      Symptoms Scale (NMSS). Patients will also be evaluated with the help of the UPDRS (Unified&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease rating scale), the most prominently scale in PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of the first phase of the project is to determine which genetic mutations are&#xD;
      the ones most represented in the Croatian population afflicted with the familial form of PD.&#xD;
      In the second phase the main goal is to determine the influence of genetic factors and&#xD;
      microbiological factors on the disease's progression as well as on the treatment outcomes.&#xD;
      Specific goals of this part of the project are to determine how many patients in the general&#xD;
      population of PD patients present with a genetic disorder and which genes have a role in that&#xD;
      disorder, as well as determine the composition of intestinal and oral microbiota both in the&#xD;
      patient test group and the healthy control group. Furthermore, specific goals are to evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of standard PD treatment on the composition of microbiota, neurodegeneration&#xD;
      progression and the activity of neuroinflammation in the CNS and to examine whether there is&#xD;
      a link between the physiological and the pathophysiological function of microbiota, using&#xD;
      markers of disease progression and glial activity. Last specific goal is to analyze potential&#xD;
      pathological conformation protein forms that could be used as a biomarker in early stages of&#xD;
      the disease and a biomarker of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase of the study will provide the first epidemiologic data on the familial form&#xD;
      of PD, as well as the mutations most represented in patients with PD in Croatia.&#xD;
      Additionally, the prospective clinical study will contribute to enlightening the intertwined&#xD;
      effects of genetic and environmental factors in the emergence and progression of the disease,&#xD;
      as well as their effect on treatment outcome. Intestinal and oral microbiota composition&#xD;
      analysis will determine whether there is a difference between PD and the healthy population&#xD;
      while using the short-chain fatty acid profile will determine the metabolic differences&#xD;
      between the two groups. Analyzing the markers of CNS homeostasis, inflammation, and&#xD;
      neuroglial function will determine the progression of the disease and also correlate them to&#xD;
      genetic factors as well as the microbiota function and composition. Analyzing the&#xD;
      pathological conformation forms of alpha-synuclein could lead to the discovery of novel&#xD;
      biomarkers in the early stages of the disease, as well as to follow the progression of the&#xD;
      disease&#xD;
