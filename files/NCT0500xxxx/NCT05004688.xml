      A study of the effects of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunization on cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      and blood-based biomarkers in older with mild cognitive impairment and mild-to-moderate to&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

      This single-site, randomized, controlled trial will investigate the effects of BCG&#xD;
      vaccination on IIR and AD biofluid biomarkers, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers,&#xD;
      and neurocognitive/behavioral functioning over a one year period in older adults with mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment (MCI) to mild-to-moderate dementia due to AD. This study will also&#xD;
      gather data on tolerability and safety.&#xD;
