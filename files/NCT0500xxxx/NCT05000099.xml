  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Starting from December 2019, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2&#xD;
      (SARS-COV-2) disease spread rapidly from China into the world, with about two Mio cases&#xD;
      confirmed around the world. In Switzerland, more than 26'000 cases have been confirmed so&#xD;
      far, and health authorities declared in March the needs for social isolation and have banned&#xD;
      visits to hospitalized patients and to nursing home residents. Loneliness and isolation is a&#xD;
      significant concern for the elderly patients as well as for their families that may&#xD;
      significantly affect physical and mental health in both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SILVER aims to evaluate the role of programmed video calls with families:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  on mood, anxiety, fear of death and pain perception in patients hospitalized or in&#xD;
           nursing homes during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in relieving the familiar caregiver anxiety and fear of death of others&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in relieving the professional caregiver anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SILVER is an international study involving both acute, rehabilitation geriatric units and&#xD;
      nursing homes; we will enroll all the patients present in the participating centers. Patients&#xD;
      will be allowed to chose between video and phone calls, the following dimensions will be&#xD;
      evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Delirium risk: using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mood: using the 5-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anxiety: using the Clinical Anxiety Scale (GAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fear of death (self and others): using the Collett-Lester scale. In parallel, health&#xD;
           professionals and family caregivers will be evaluated for anxiety at baseline and every&#xD;
           week after intervention set-up by the Clinical Anxiety Scale (CAS). Family caregivers&#xD;
           will also be evaluated with the fear of death scale (sub-scale fear of death of others).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, to evaluate the appreciation for video call communication in patients and caregivers&#xD;
      we will use a Likert scale.&#xD;

      Aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the role of video calls with families on mood, anxiety, fear of death and&#xD;
           pain perception in patients hospitalized or in nursing homes during the SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
           pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the role of video calls in relieving family caregivers' anxiety and fear of&#xD;
           death of their loved one.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the role of video calls in relieving health professionals' anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. In order to reduce social isolation from their relatives and friends patients will&#xD;
      be helped in joining them through video-calls thanks to the use of dedicated tablets and to&#xD;
      the assistance provided by nurses, assistant-nurses, occupational therapists or&#xD;
      neuropsychologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population selection. All the patients in the participating centers fulfilling&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in SILVER.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to chose between video and phone call, phone call will be allowed&#xD;
      without any restriction to both video and usual care groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      standardization of video calls: Two video-calls of maximum 15' will be administered every&#xD;
      week; in addition, patients will be allowed to do video-call upon request. Video-calls will&#xD;
      be performed using Skype or WhatsApp video or Face-time, the use of others app will be&#xD;
      evaluated upon family's request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection for primary and secondary outcomes. Patients will be evaluated at baseline&#xD;
      and every week with standardized scales to assess their mood, anxiety and delirium symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and at the end of the intervention we will evaluate the overall appreciation of&#xD;
      the video call by the patients, their family caregiver, and the health professionals using a&#xD;
      Likert scale and Anxiety: using the Geriatric Anxiety Scale (GAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to clarify the role of social connection through video calls on the patients'&#xD;
      health, we will evaluate at baseline and after one week :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mood: using the 5-items Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fear of death (self and others): using the Collett-Lester scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Delirium risk: using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) will be evaluated every day&#xD;
           and will be analyzed ad day of delirium weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the effect of video calls in professionals and in family caregivers will be&#xD;
      evaluated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      family and professional caregivers will be evaluated for anxiety at baseline and the end of&#xD;
      intervention set-up by the Clinical anxiety (CAS). Familiar care-givers will also be&#xD;
      evaluated with the fear of death scale (sub-scale fear of death of others) at the baseline&#xD;
      and after one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of other data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to correct the statistical analyses for possible confounding variables the following&#xD;
      data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age, gender, years of school, duration of hospitalization , type of hospital discharge, Mini&#xD;
      Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, Cumulative Illness&#xD;
      Rating Scale (CIRS) index, Activity of Daily Living (ADL), Instrumental Activities of Daily&#xD;
      Living (IADL).&#xD;
