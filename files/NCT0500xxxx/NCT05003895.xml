      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new cancer treatment takes a person s own T cells, modifies them in a laboratory so they&#xD;
      can better fight cancer cells, and then gives them back to the person. Researchers want to&#xD;
      see if this treatment can help people with a certain type of liver cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if a personalized immune treatment, anti-GPC3 CAR-T cells, is safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults aged 18 years and older who have Glypican-3 (GPC3) positive HCC, a type of liver&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of their symptoms and their ability to perform their normal activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have leukapheresis. They may have an IV (intravenous catheter, a small tube&#xD;
      put into an arm vein) inserted into each arm or get a central line. Blood will be removed. A&#xD;
      machine will separate the white blood cells from their blood. The rest of their blood will be&#xD;
      returned to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the hospital for about 2 weeks. They will get the&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs fludarabine and cyclophosphamide by IV for 3 days. Then they will receive&#xD;
      the modified white blood cells by IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have frequent blood draws. They will give blood and tumor samples for&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up visits for the next 15 years. Then they will be contacted by&#xD;
      email or phone for the rest of their life. If their disease does not get worse after 5 years,&#xD;
      they will continue to be invited to do imaging studies every 6 months.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the second&#xD;
      leading cause of cancer-associated mortality with an average life expectancy of 6-9 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the success of several studies showing efficacy in treating HCC, most clinical trials&#xD;
      have failed to prove a survival advantage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adoptive T-cell therapy exploits the natural ability of T-cells to recognize and eliminate&#xD;
      their target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GPC3 is a cell surface protein that is expressed in nearly all HCC yet is undetectable in&#xD;
      normal adult hepatic tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to evaluate the role of GPC3 targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells in&#xD;
      advanced GPC3 expressing HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety and feasibility of T-cells, expressing a novel humanized anti-GPC3&#xD;
      chimeric antigen receptor, in participants with advanced HCC, expressing GPC3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologically confirmed diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      GPC3 positivity of &gt;= 25% by immunohistochemistry&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 1 measurable lesion by RECIST v 1.1 criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age &gt;= 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to conduct a phase I dose escalation designed clinical trial using CAR (hYP7)-T cells&#xD;
      in participants with GPC3 expressing advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo leukapheresis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a lymphocyte depleting chemotherapy conditioning regimen with the&#xD;
      intent of enhancing the activity of the infused CAR-expressing T cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the T cell infusion, there is a mandatory 9-day inpatient hospitalization to&#xD;
      monitor for toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be closely monitored during the first year after cell infusion and&#xD;
      followed for life.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior systemic therapy, an investigational therapy, radiation, and/or surgery within 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior administration of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies or other agents that in the&#xD;
             opinion of the PI can stimulate immune activity and interfere with an infusion of&#xD;
             CAR-T cells within 8 weeks prior to treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child-Pugh class B or C liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Participants with a history of abnormal pulmonary function tests but stable&#xD;
        obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease may be eligible per PI discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Participants who require anticoagulation (e.g. warfarin) or anti-platelet therapy (e.g.&#xD;
        aspirin&#xD;
&#xD;
        &gt; 325 mg/day or clopidogrel).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any form of primary immunodeficiency (e.g. severe combined immunodeficiency).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive participants are excluded because HIV causes complicated immune&#xD;
             deficiency and study treatment can pose more risks for these participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that&#xD;
             might recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive&#xD;
             treatment including systemic corticosteroids. These include but are not limited to&#xD;
             participants with a history of immune-related neurologic disease, multiple sclerosis,&#xD;
             autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome or CIDP, myasthenia&#xD;
             gravis; systemic autoimmune diseases such as SLE, connective tissue diseases,&#xD;
             scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn s, ulcerative colitis, hepatitis;&#xD;
             and participants with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson&#xD;
             syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
             --NOTE: participants with vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies including thyroiditis&#xD;
             managed with replacement hormones including physiologic corticosteroids are eligible.&#xD;
             Participants with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, Sjogren s syndrome,&#xD;
             and psoriasis controlled with topical medication and participants with positive&#xD;
             serology, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-thyroid antibodies should be&#xD;
             evaluated for the presence of target organ involvement and the potential need for&#xD;
             systemic treatment but should otherwise be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to cyclophosphamide or&#xD;
             fludarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Systemic corticosteroid therapy of any dose within 14 days prior to the treatment&#xD;
             initiation. Corticosteroid creams, ointments, and eye drops are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known central nervous system metastases are excluded because of&#xD;
             their poor prognosis and progressive neurologic dysfunction, secondary to metastases,&#xD;
             that would confound the evaluation of adverse events, especially neurologic toxicity,&#xD;
             which is common with CAR-T cells, used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because study therapy can cause fetal&#xD;
             harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because there is a potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
        treatment of the mother with study therapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
        mother is treated with study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who received live or attenuated vaccine or virus-based vaccine within 30 days&#xD;
             before initiation of study therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of seizure disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with an expected life expectancy of less than 3 months before initiation of&#xD;
             study therapy.&#xD;
