  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open label, prospective, multi-center, comparative, interventional study to&#xD;
      evaluate safety and efficacy of Artemisinin 500 mg in subjects with mild to moderate&#xD;
      COVID-19. Initially subjects having mild to moderate COVID-19 will be screened as per&#xD;
      predefined eligibility criteria for the study. Eligible 120 subjects will be enrolled to&#xD;
      receive treatment with Artemisinin and SOC (Standard of Care as per CLINICAL MANAGEMENT&#xD;
      PROTOCOL: COVID-19, Government of India Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Directorate&#xD;
      General of Health Services (EMR Division)) or SOC. Subjects will be randomized in 2:1 ratio.&#xD;
      Group 1 will have 80 subjects and Group 2 will have 40 subjects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study will involve screening (Day 1), treatment period of up to maximum 28 days till end&#xD;
      of study. The investigator shall make every effort to follow the schedule of study&#xD;
      assessments and procedures. A window period of 1 day will be allowed for assessments post&#xD;
      randomization. Screening Upon obtaining the written informed consent the subjects will be&#xD;
      screened to confirm the eligibility for participating in this study. If RT PCR result is&#xD;
      available for the subject then screening and baseline (randomization) activity will be on the&#xD;
      same day. As per the Investigator discretion, the subjects meeting the criteria will be&#xD;
      hospitalized for the first cycle of treatment Treatment period Subjects will receive&#xD;
      investigational product and SOC after randomization as per protocol. Subject's compliance&#xD;
      with the study treatment regimen of Artemisinin one (1) capsule a day for five (5) days, will&#xD;
      be assessed during treatment period. Subjects receiving at least one dose of study treatment&#xD;
      will be included in the safety analysis. Efficacy analysis will be conducted in completers&#xD;
      (subjects who have completed at least 5 consecutive days of dosing in either arm) The first&#xD;
      cycle of the study drug treatment will be given in the hospital, for which the subjects have&#xD;
      to be hospitalized till Day 5, unless prolongation of hospital stay is necessary as per the&#xD;
      investigator. On day 14, telephonic follow up is done for subjects discharged after Day 5.&#xD;
      For Day 28 visit all subjects will visit the hospital to complete the End of Study&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
