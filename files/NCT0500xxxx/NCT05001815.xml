  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine if continuous subcutaneous insulin&#xD;
      infusion (CSII) can improve glycemic control in women with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who are&#xD;
      pregnant.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In women with diabetes, hyperglycemia is associated with increased rates of maternal and&#xD;
      fetal adverse outcomes. Mothers are at increased risk of preeclampsia, deterioration of&#xD;
      proteinuria and caesarean sections. Infants of mothers with diabetes have increased rates of&#xD;
      congenital anomalies, premature delivery, macrosomia, stillbirth and NICU admissions, as well&#xD;
      as increased risks of shoulder dystocia, birth injury, hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia,&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome, asphyxia and death in the neonatal period. Several studies&#xD;
      have shown that pregnancy outcomes can be improved along with better glycemic control.&#xD;
      Theoretically CSII could achieve better glycemic control due to its flexibility in adjusting&#xD;
      both basal rate and bolus insulin infusion. Several randomized controlled studies have&#xD;
      compared the ability of CSII with multiple daily injection (MDI) in glycemic control and&#xD;
      improvement of pregnancy outcomes in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, there is a&#xD;
      lack of similar studies in women with T2D. We hypothesize that CSII will assist women with&#xD;
      T2D achieve better glycemic control during pregnancy compared to MDI users.&#xD;

SDSCA, compiled by Toobert in 2000, is an 8-likert scale containing 11 items belongs to 6 dimensions, could estimate general diet, special diet, physical activity, glucose monitoring, foot care and medicine compliance of patients with T2DM. The total scores range from 0 to 77, higher score means better diabetes self- care behaviors.</description>

The average score is 1-5 points, and the higher the average score, the higher the self-efficacy level of participants. The effectiveness and internal consistency of the Chinese version of SED are reliable, and the load factors of each factor are between 0.579-0.922.</description>

    <description>The score of Self-rated Anxiety Scale (SAS) acquired from patients. Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) is used to measure the degree of anxiety in patients. There are 20 items in total. The scores are divided into 4 levels, including 5 (items 5, 9, 13, 17, 19) reverse scoring items and 15 positive scoring items. Add the scores of the 20 items to get the rough score, then multiply it by 1.25 and take the integer part to get the standard score. The higher the standard score, the more serious the degree of anxiety.</description>

There are 20 items in total, including 10 (items 2, 5, 6, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, and 20) reverse scoring items, and 15 positive scoring items. The depression severity index can be calculated by the cumulative score of each item divided by 80, which could reflect the degree of depression. The index range is 0.25-1.0, and the higher the index, the more severe the degree of depression.</description>
