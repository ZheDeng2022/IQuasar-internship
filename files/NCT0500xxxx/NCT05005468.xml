      This is a phase II, open-label, multi-cohort study, aiming to investigate safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of Camrelizumab combined with famitinib for adjuvant treatment of stage II-IIIA non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer with high-risk for relapse and no driver gene mutation.&#xD;

      Immunotherapy has shown good efficacy in advanced NSCLC. The IMpower010 study has found that&#xD;
      immune adjuvant therapy after postoperative chemotherapy can significantly prolong&#xD;
      disease-free survival. A number of basic and clinical studies have found that anti-vascular&#xD;
      drugs can improve the tumor immune microenvironment, and the combination of anti-vascular and&#xD;
      immunotherapy may further improve the efficacy. In this study, postoperative NSCLC with a&#xD;
      high risk of recurrence was screened out through ctDNA detection, and received Camrelizumab&#xD;
      combined with famitinib or observation to observe the efficacy and safety.&#xD;
