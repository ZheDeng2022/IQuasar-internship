  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of a remote&#xD;
      interdisciplinary PR program that is delivered using two exercise approaches on the recovery&#xD;
      of long-term post-COVD-19 outcomes. The specific aims are i) to evaluate the effect of the&#xD;
      program and ii) each of the approaches on patients': 1) lung capacity, 2) dyspnea and&#xD;
      fatigue, 3) exercise capacity, 4) physical function, 5) participation, and 5) HRQoL.&#xD;

      This pilot study uses a two-arm randomized pre- and post-trial design to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of a remote interdisciplinary PR program, delivered using two exercise approaches, on the&#xD;
      recovery of long-term post-COVD-19 outcomes (≥ 3 months after infection). Group one: will be&#xD;
      asked to follow the exercise program with a small group of peers (2 groups/6 participants&#xD;
      each) in a zoom meeting 3 times a week/45 min each {including 5 min before and 10 min after&#xD;
      the meeting for free talk-chat between the participants e.g. questions, perceptions, etc.).&#xD;
      The therapist will lead the first three meetings, gradually encourage participants to take&#xD;
      turns leading the exercises with the goal of identifying /empowering potential patient&#xD;
      leaders. Beginning with the fourth meeting, participants will be encouraged to connect to the&#xD;
      meeting and follow their exercise program on their own, taking into account their&#xD;
      individualized recommendations. The RA will organize and attend the zoom meetings to resolve&#xD;
      general questions (e.g. equipment, platforms, etc.) and will act as a direct point of contact&#xD;
      between the therapist and the participants. Group two: will be asked to follow the exercise&#xD;
      program 3 times a week/30 min each while watching a pre-recorded YouTube video. D)&#xD;
      Self-monitoring: patients will be asked to wear the finger pulse oximeter at all times while&#xD;
      exercising, so that they can control their pace while avoiding exceeding target values (HR,&#xD;
      Sp02). They will be asked to record in their HR and Sp02 values before and after&#xD;
      participation in every session of the exercise program in a diary. E) Support: participants&#xD;
      will be able to contact the therapist at any time during the study if they have questions or&#xD;
      concerns. Otherwise, they will receive a follow-up phone call once a week from the RA.&#xD;

    <description>It will be assessed using a SpiroBank Smart F/V multi parameter spirometer (MIR) at pre-post intervention and once a week in between to monitor changes. This portable spirometer, which is MDSAP approved and complaint with ATS/ERS guidelines, connects automatically via Bluetooth to an iOS &amp; Android compatible App (MIR Spirobank). It provides real time feedback through messages and animation on smartphone, to improve personal compliance during the test. The app can generate test results PDF printout with information regarding 19 parameters of lung capacity.</description>
