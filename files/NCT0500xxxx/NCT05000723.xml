  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) of a Total Hip Replacement (THR) is a disastrous&#xD;
      complication of an otherwise extremely successful surgical procedure. It is associated with a&#xD;
      burdensome treatment for the patient, significant challenges for the medical team and high&#xD;
      costs for society. As more joint replacements are being performed each year, due to an ageing&#xD;
      population and lower thresholds for surgery, the number of PJIs is on the rise. Many of these&#xD;
      patients will be referred to University Hospitals Leuven as the physicians have extensive&#xD;
      experience with this particular pathology and can offer a multidisciplinary and&#xD;
      patient-tailored treatment. Many controversies exist in the field of PJI treatment, both with&#xD;
      regard to the surgical aspects as well as the antibiotic treatment. Setting up randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials to answer these questions has been proven to be very difficult due to large&#xD;
      variations in patients, implants, germs, soft and hard tissues, antibiotic resistance&#xD;
      patterns, and so on. Also, surgery for PJIs is usually non-elective / semi-urgent and&#xD;
      therefore time to include patients into different trials is limited. Therefore the&#xD;
      investigators will prospectively collect data on patients with PJI treated at University&#xD;
      Hospitals Leuven, starting 01/01/2022, in order to have knowledge of own results and inform&#xD;
      patients about chances of success prior to treatment; perform internal audits and quality&#xD;
      checks; answer questions in the field of PJI treatment not suitable for RCTs.&#xD;

      Prosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) of a Total Hip Replacement (THR) is a disastrous&#xD;
      complication of an otherwise extremely successful surgical procedure. It is associated with a&#xD;
      burdensome treatment for the patient, significant challenges for the medical team and high&#xD;
      costs for society. As more joint replacements are being performed each year, due to an ageing&#xD;
      population and lower thresholds for surgery, the number of PJIs is on the rise. Many of these&#xD;
      patients will be referred to University Hospitals Leuven as the physicians have extensive&#xD;
      experience with this particular pathology and can offer a multidisciplinary and&#xD;
      patient-tailored treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many controversies exist in the field of PJI treatment, both with regard to the surgical&#xD;
      aspects as well as the antibiotic treatment. Setting up randomized controlled trials to&#xD;
      answer these questions has been proven to be very difficult due to large variations in&#xD;
      patients, implants, germs, soft and hard tissues, antibiotic resistance patterns, and so on.&#xD;
      Also, surgery for PJIs is usually non-elective / semi-urgent and therefore time to include&#xD;
      patients into different trials is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, prospectively collecting data on patients with PJI who are not involved in RCTs&#xD;
      can already be helpful. It would allow the investigators to provide the patients with&#xD;
      percentages of success of certain interventions based on historical results. At the moment&#xD;
      the investigators have to rely on results reported by other groups, who might use different&#xD;
      techniques or a facing a different germ spectrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, prospectively collecting data on this cohort of patients, would make it possible&#xD;
      for the investigators to do internal audits for quality control. Being able to perform simple&#xD;
      checks, for example is every patient discussed in the multi-disciplinary team meeting, or is&#xD;
      the hospital switching to targeted antibiotics soon enough, would already add to the quality&#xD;
      of the service and could lead to adjustments in the protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, certain scientific questions, which do not lend themselves to RCTs, such as the rate of&#xD;
      success of treatment of PJI caused by rare germs (e.g. fungi) or in a specific population&#xD;
      (e.g. octogenarians, transplant patients), could be answered by maintaining a prospective&#xD;
      database&#xD;
