  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2, randomized, double-blind, multi-center study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and preliminary clinical efficacy of STMC-103H in neonates and infants at risk&#xD;
      for developing allergic disease (Type 1 hypersensitivity). Subjects will be enrolled in a&#xD;
      three-part sequential approach. Participants in the safety-run portion of the study (Part A1:&#xD;
      1 year to &lt;6 years of age and A2: 1 month to &lt;12 months of age) will receive 28 days of&#xD;
      treatment with STMC-103H or placebo, followed by 28 days of follow-up. A Data and Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review safety data after all patients in each part complete&#xD;
      28 days of therapy prior to enrolling the next part. After A2, Part B will enroll 224&#xD;
      patients for 336 days of treatment with STMC-103H or placebo, followed by 336 days of&#xD;
      follow-up. Stool, blood, and optional samples will be collected in Parts A2 and part B.&#xD;
      Primary safety endpoints are frequency, type and severity of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious&#xD;
      Adverse Events (SAEs), as well as findings on physical exams, vitals, and safety&#xD;
      laboratories. The primary efficacy endpoint is incidence of physician-diagnosed atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis at day 336.&#xD;
