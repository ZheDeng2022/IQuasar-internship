    <textblock>
      Discourse impairments are breakdowns in meaningful communication beyond the level of single&#xD;
      sentences and have a functional impact on the lives of Veterans with TBI, disrupting return&#xD;
      to work, communication re integration, socialization, and quality of life. The few prior&#xD;
      attempts to treat discourse impairments have been small case studies and resulted in no&#xD;
      change or limited gains. The proposed study evaluates the feasibility of a novel narrative&#xD;
      discourse treatment that builds upon these prior attempts by addressing breakdowns in both&#xD;
      story content and story organization using a theoretically-driven approach. If feasible, as&#xD;
      demonstrated by tolerability and acceptability to participants, and later shown to be&#xD;
      effective, the proposed discourse treatment has the potential to improve daily communication,&#xD;
      which provides a gateway for Veterans with TBI to increase meaningful participation and&#xD;
      improve functioning in major life domains.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Discourse intervention in TBI is a nascent area of research, and, to date, there have been&#xD;
      only a few studies that have attempted to improve discourse ability in TBI. These prior&#xD;
      attempts have been small case studies, produced no change or limited gains, and did not&#xD;
      include Veterans with TBI. The proposed project is an early stage discourse treatment&#xD;
      development study that will evaluate the feasibility of a novel narrative discourse treatment&#xD;
      protocol that builds upon these prior attempts with an all-Veteran participant sample. The&#xD;
      first part of the study will consist of initial manual development for the discourse&#xD;
      treatment protocol and refinement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part will involve a treatment feasibility trial to obtain information regarding&#xD;
      the tolerability, acceptability, and fidelity of the proposed discourse treatment and&#xD;
      preliminary data on treatment delivery and assessment methods as well as preliminary&#xD;
      information about treatment effects. Forty participants will be randomized to either the&#xD;
      discourse treatment group or Treatment as Usual control. Assessments will be conducted at&#xD;
      baseline, post-treatment, and at 1-month follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>The protocol will incorporate elements from prior treatment studies that showed some promise: 1) hierarchical training, 2) variety of discourse stimuli, 3) development of skills and strategies for discourse processing, 4) structured training prompts, 5) meta-cognitive and meta-linguistic strategies, and 6) integration of learning principles. Novel treatment elements will include: 1) targeting both story content and story organization, 2) use of a discourse model to guide treatment, and 3) functional communication training. Treatment will be delivered twice a week over 8 weeks. There will be four treatment phases: education, story organization, story content, and integration of story organization and content.</description>
