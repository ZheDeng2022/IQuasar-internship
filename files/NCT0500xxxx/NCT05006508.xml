  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study participants will be randomized to use a digital lifestyle tool over three&#xD;
      years or to a control group without access to the tool. The investigators will prospectively&#xD;
      via clinical registries follow the incidence and development of type 2 diabetes over three&#xD;
      years in those using the tool regularly and those in the control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Considerable evidence suggest that lifestyle changes can prevent or delay the onset of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes, and self-care behaviors largely determine HbA1c. Modifiable lifestyle factors have&#xD;
      been established as key drivers of disease onset, progression, and prognosis, motivating the&#xD;
      use of &quot;lifestyle as medicine&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital health tools are increasingly incorporated into diabetes care, and have the potential&#xD;
      to improve both behavioral and clinical outcomes on a broad basis. However, low levels of&#xD;
      uptake, reduced user engagement over time, and low acceptance among patients, raise concerns&#xD;
      about their effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective or this study is to evaluate a new web-based tool, developed at the University&#xD;
      Gothenburg, Sweden, that aims to support patient autonomy and motivation to make sustainable&#xD;
      lifestyle changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that individuals who have access to the tool get&#xD;
      lower incidence of type 2 diabetes or in case they already have diabetes develop improved&#xD;
      glucose control compared with control individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an investigator-initiated single-center study conducted over three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tool is web-based and used via a computer or mobile phone. It is used at each&#xD;
      individual's preferred pace but participants are recommended to login at least every other&#xD;
      week. Every round the participants choose a themes (out of appr. 80 possible covering e.g.&#xD;
      food, exercise, stress, self-reflection aspects), which takes appr. 15-30 minutes to&#xD;
      complete. Participants then reflect on the content and how it could be implemented in daily&#xD;
      life. When returning for next round participants are asked to reflect on any changes done&#xD;
      since last time. There is no interaction between individual participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Incidence of type 2 diabetes as measured in non-diabetic participants (controls vs.&#xD;
           those using the tool regularly)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Change of HbA1c, reflecting long-term blood glucose control, from baseline to end of&#xD;
           follow-up in participants who have type 2 diabetes (controls vs. those using the tool&#xD;
           regularly).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ratio of participants randomized to control and accessing the tool is 1:4.&#xD;
