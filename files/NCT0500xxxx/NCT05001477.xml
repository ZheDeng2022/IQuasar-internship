    <textblock>
      This patient registry will capture data from patients who have been or who are undergoing the&#xD;
      transurethral ultrasound ablation (TULSA) procedure as part of their routine clinical care.&#xD;
      The registry will shed light on real-world outcomes of safety and efficacy of the procedure&#xD;
      and understand how a patient's quality of life is affected throughout their follow-up and&#xD;
      lifetime.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This registry will capture data on patients undergoing customized transurethral ultrasound&#xD;
      ablation (TULSA) as part of their routine clinical care. The aim of collecting such data is&#xD;
      to further evaluate real-world outcomes of safety and efficacy of this treatment. The&#xD;
      collection of this data is intended to form an evidence-base from which conclusions can be&#xD;
      drawn on how to optimize outcomes to improve patient care and QOL, and further expand on&#xD;
      knowledge of practice trends and treatment costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary safety objective is to estimate the rate of complications attributable to the&#xD;
      TULSA Procedure. The primary efficacy objective is estimating the proportion of patients who&#xD;
      are free from primary treatment failure after the TULSA Procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients being offered TULSA Procedure will be invited to participate in the registry.&#xD;
      Patients who have already undergone TULSA will also be allowed to join the registry. Hundreds&#xD;
      to thousands of patients across sites in US, Canada and Europe will be followed as per&#xD;
      routine clinical care at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years&#xD;
      and annually lifelong thereafter. Patients will remain active in the registry until they&#xD;
      voluntarily withdraw or die. At each visit, patients will complete a set of questionnaires&#xD;
      that is sent to them by email.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent will be collected prior to enrolling the patient into the Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial baseline information will be collected (eg. demographics, medical history,&#xD;
           concomitant medication, prostate MRI, prostate biopsy, PSA, and QOL Questionnaires)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TULSA Procedure treatment assessment and complications will be collected from clinic&#xD;
           records from treatment day. Optional financial tracking information may also be&#xD;
           collected if patient consents to this portion of the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At follow-up visits, a set of data points will be collected (eg. PSA, complications, QoL&#xD;
           Questionnaires, survival assessments, and optional financial tracking information)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Registry data will be collected and stored in an electronic database capture system&#xD;
      called Castor. Castor is validated and compliant with all applicable laws and regulations,&#xD;
      including ICH E6 GCP, 21 CFR Part 11, EU annex II, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),&#xD;
      HIPAA (US), ISO 9001 and ISO 27001. Only sites and sponsor personnel will have access to the&#xD;
      database. On site and/or remote study monitoring will be undertaken to check source documents&#xD;
      and accuracy of data entry. All reasonable methods will be used to try to minimize missing&#xD;
      data, however, some missing data is expected to occur. No interpolation of missing data will&#xD;
      occur. Standard descriptive statistics, including the mean, standard deviation, median,&#xD;
      range, proportion and frequency, will be used throughout to summarize results. Measures will&#xD;
      be presented, and 95% confidence intervals will be constructed for selected measures, such as&#xD;
      efficacy and safety. As a primarily descriptive study, analyses will be performed at the&#xD;
      p=0.05 level of significance and exact analyses will be used wherever possible.&#xD;
