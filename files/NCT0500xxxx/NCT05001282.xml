  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, ELU- FRα-1, is focused on adult subjects who have advanced, recurrent or&#xD;
      refractory folate receptor alpha (FRα) overexpressing tumors considered to be topoisomerase 1&#xD;
      inhibitor-sensitive based on scientific literature, and, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
      have no other meaningful life-prolonging therapy options available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELU001 is a new chemical entity described as a C'Dot drug conjugate (CDC), consisting of&#xD;
      payloads (exatecans) and targeting moieties (folic acid analogs) covalently bound by linkers&#xD;
      to the C'Dot particle carrier. ELU001 will be the first drug-conjugate of its kind to be&#xD;
      introduced into the clinic, a first in class, and a novel molecular entity.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has two parts: Part 1 Dose Escalation Safety Study to identify the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and Part 2 Tumor Group&#xD;
      Expansion Cohort(s) where specific cancer types will be evaluated for efficacy and safety at&#xD;
      the RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1, subjects with cancer types with a high likelihood of having FRα overexpressing tumors&#xD;
      based on historical data, specifically, ovarian, endometrial, colorectal, gastric,&#xD;
      gastroesophageal junction, triple negative breast, or non-small cell lung cancers, or&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma, will be enrolled in a basket clinical study. Retrospective analysis of&#xD;
      folate receptor alpha (FRα) expression status will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 Stage 1 of a Simon's Two-Stage design, tumor group expansion cohorts, each consisting&#xD;
      of subjects with cancer types studied as part of the basket in Part 1.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 1 Dose Escalation: The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of ELU001 for IV infusion in patients with over-expressing Folate Receptor Alpha tumors.</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the MTD and/or RP2D of ELU001 in patients with over-expressing Folate Receptor Alpha tumors. When at least 2 out of 6 patients in a given dose-level experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), the dose is considered to have exceeded the MTD. The MTD, therefore, is defined as the previous highest tested dose of ELU001 that did not cause a DLT in the first cycle of treatment. In the event of emerging data during Part 1, the Sponsor may, in consultation with a dose-level safety review group, decide to define a recommended dose for expansion (in for Part 2) (RP2D) instead of the MTD. DLTs are defined as a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) or abnormal laboratory value related to ELU001 treatment that result in a failure to meet the criteria for re-treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 2 Dose Expansion: To determine overall response rate (ORR) (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) of ELU001 for IV infusion in patients with over-expressing Folate Receptor Alpha tumors, per RECIST v1.1.</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose of study drug until responses of CR or PR, assessed up to 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of Participants with confirmed objective response as assessed by the investigator and per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 CR is defined as the disappearance of all target or non-target lesions. PR is defined as at least 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (SoD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SoD.</description>

    <measure>Part 1 and Part 2: To determine Duration of Response (DOR) of ELU001 for IV infusion in patients with over-expressing Folate Receptor Alpha tumors.</measure>
    <time_frame>Date of first response (CR or PR) until the date of disease progression or up to 12 months, whichever occurs first.</time_frame>
    <description>Time Measurement: DOR will begin at the date that a response has been identified (stable disease, partial response, or complete response) until the date of progressive disease (PD). PD is defined of at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of the target lesions from data of initial response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 1 and Part 2: Number of participants with adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0 Safety Evaluations.</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose of study drug up to 28 days after the last dose of study drug or up to 12 months, whichever occurs first.</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants Frequency/severity of abnormalities in vital signs measurements, physical examination findings, changes in clinical laboratory parameters, and incidence of adverse events after taking ELU001.</description>
