    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of emapalumab in&#xD;
      children and adults with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) in Still's disease (including&#xD;
      systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and adult onset Still's disease) or with MAS in&#xD;
      systemic lupus erythematous, resenting an inadequate response to high dose glucocorticoid&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      Study NI-0501-14 is a two-cohort trial that enrolls subjects who are diagnosed with MAS and&#xD;
      who are presenting an inadequate response to high doses of GCs. These subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled in 2 cohorts as per their background disease. The cohorts are defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: MAS in the context of sJIA and AOSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: MAS in the context of pediatric and adult SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has the objectives to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability, for 8&#xD;
      weeks, and PK and PD, QoL and immunogenicity in these 2 cohorts for up to 1 year after last&#xD;
      dose of of emapalumab.&#xD;
