    <textblock>
      Objectives: The main objective is to analyze the efficacy of an intervention based on the&#xD;
      algorithm proposed by the Spanish Healtcare Ministry (see figure in annex 1) at Primary Care&#xD;
      level to reduce Frailty status in community-dwelling older adults. Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
      1. To analyze if the intervention is cost-effective; 2. To analyze if the intervention&#xD;
      reduces hospitalizations and emergency department visits, incident disability, falls,&#xD;
      institutionalization, mortality, Primary Care visits and Drug use, and improves quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MethodologOy: Multicentric Randomized Clinical Trial in 164 Prefrail or Frail&#xD;
      community-dwelling women and men with an age equal or greater to 70 years, attended in&#xD;
      selected Primary Care centers of Spain (Albacete, Oviedo, Getafe and Madrid). Randomization&#xD;
      will be made by clusters, being every cluster a different Primary Care center in order to&#xD;
      avoid contamination. Randomization on a 1:1 relationship between groups. The main outcome&#xD;
      variable will be Frailty status change at one year follow-up measured with the Frailty&#xD;
      Phenotype. All instrumentation will follow the guidelines of the Spanish Healthcare Ministry&#xD;
      algorithm for frailty, and gait speed will be measured with the Walkway Speed-Age.&#xD;
      Intervention will consist on a groupal multicomponent physical exercise program and a&#xD;
      nutritional intervention. The exercise program and nutrition will be delivered by trained&#xD;
      experts in groups of 6 participants, and will be based on the recommendations of the Spanish&#xD;
      Healthcare Ministry document.&#xD;

      Hypothesis an intervention based on the algorithm proposed by the Spanish Healtcare Ministry&#xD;
      (see figure in annex 1) at Primary Care level will be effective in reducing Frailty status in&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze the efficacy of an intervention based on the algorithm proposed by the Spanish&#xD;
      Healtcare Ministry (see figure in annex 1) at Primary Care level to reduce Frailty status in&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To analyze if the intervention is cost-effective 2. To analyze if the intervention reduces&#xD;
      hospitalizations and emergency department visits 3. To analyze if the intervention reduces&#xD;
      incident disability 4. To analyze if the intervention reduces falls 5. To analyze if the&#xD;
      intervention reduces institutionalization 6. To analyze if the intervention improves quality&#xD;
      of life 7. To analize if the intervention decreases mortality 8. To analyze if the&#xD;
      intervention reduces Primary Care visits and Drug use&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Design Multicentric Randomized Clinical Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study subjects Prefrail or Frail community-dwelling women and men with an age equal or&#xD;
           greater to 70 years, attended in selected Primary Care centers of Spain (Albacete,&#xD;
           Oviedo, Toledo and Madrid).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size The sample size was calculated to find a difference between groups of 15% in&#xD;
           the percentage of respondents (reduction in at least one frailty criteria); 25% in the&#xD;
           intervention group (algorithm implementation) and 5% in the control group, alpha &lt; 0.05&#xD;
           and power 80%. A 15% of loses will be assumed. Using the program GRANMO&#xD;
           (https://www.imim.cat/ofertadeserveis/es_granmo.html), the number of participants per&#xD;
           group is 82, for a total of 164 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Randomization Randomization will be made by clusters, being every cluster a different&#xD;
           Primary Care center, in order to avoid contamination. Randomization will be&#xD;
           computer-based with a 1:1 relationship between groups. Every Primary Care center will&#xD;
           include at least 12 participants, because exercise groups will be composed of 6&#xD;
           participants. For these reasons, 14 Primary Care centers will be needed, 7 with&#xD;
           intervention and 7 control&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Instrumentation All instrumentation will follow the guidelines of the Spanish Healthcare&#xD;
           Ministry algorithm for frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
           First, older adults attending the selected Primary Care centers (Albacetre, Oviedo,&#xD;
           Getafe and Madrid) will receive a Barthel index assessment and they will walk on an&#xD;
           electronic automatic Walkway system that will be incorporated in every Primary Care&#xD;
           center. If patients present a Barthel index greater than 85 and a walking speed lower&#xD;
           than 0,8 m/s, they will be offered to entry the trial by the Primary Care Physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to warrant the independence of recruitment, randomization of the Primary Care&#xD;
           centers will be undertaken when a center arrives the 12 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the center is considered &quot;usual care&quot;, physicians will realize a baseline visit to&#xD;
           participants, collecting all study variables, and will make healthy lifestyles&#xD;
           recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the center is considered &quot;intervention&quot;, physicians will realize a basal visit to&#xD;
           participants collecting determined variables, and they will receive the intervention&#xD;
           described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow-up visits to analyze results will be conducted at 6 and 12 months. Adverse events&#xD;
           will be monitored and communicated on presentation. Monitoring will be conducted&#xD;
           throughout the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Data collection and analysis For this project we will use the tool &quot;Research Electronic&#xD;
           Data Capture&quot; (REDCap) for Electronic Data Capture (EDC), designed for creating surveys&#xD;
           and questions using branching logic and stop actions. Some of the question will be&#xD;
           created as a data collection instrument, and other will be selected from the data&#xD;
           collection instruments in REDCap shared library, a repository for data collection&#xD;
           instruments and forms. REDCap is a web-based application developed by Vanderbilt&#xD;
           University to capture data for clinical research. REDCap uses instruments such as&#xD;
           surveys and forms as research capture tools and is designed to provide a secure&#xD;
           environment so that research teams can collect and store highly sensitive information.&#xD;
           They are workflow-based and focus on collecting data and exporting it to statistical&#xD;
           programs and other data analysis software. More information can be viewed at:&#xD;
           https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5764586/. INVESTEN, participating in the&#xD;
           Project will provide this tool for free.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data will be stored for up to 15 years by the investigators. All data will be anonimyzed&#xD;
           and stored in a secure manner. Analysis will be maid on an intention-to-treat basis by&#xD;
           the principal investigator that will be blinded to group assignment. Risk reduction will&#xD;
           be presented for the principal variable. Differences in secondary objectives will be&#xD;
           analyzed with risk reductions, difference of means or proportions when convenient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Economic models In order to collect information on the health and non-health resources&#xD;
           consumption, specific questionnaires would be designed, for both, for patients as well&#xD;
           as for caregivers. For the economic evaluation, we will perform two different analyses,&#xD;
           a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and a cost-utility analysis (CUA). The CEA will be&#xD;
           carried out comparing both outcomes and monetary valuation of the resources used in the&#xD;
           group of patients who receive the intervention with the control group (usual care).&#xD;
           Thereby, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) reveals the cost per unit of&#xD;
           benefit of switching from usual care to the intervention group. The health results&#xD;
           measured by the ICER would be the following: Frailty status change, hospitalization,&#xD;
           incident disability, and falls. Furthermore, CUA is a special type of cost-effectiveness&#xD;
           analysis that uses the Quality-Adjusted Life-Year (QALY) as outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Both CEA and CUA would be conducted separately considering both the societal perspective&#xD;
           (that is, all costs included) and the National Health System perspective (taking into&#xD;
           consideration healthcare costs and costs related to the intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Additionally, several univariate sensitivity analysis as well as probabilistic&#xD;
           sensitivity analysis will be carried out in order to test how sensitive the results&#xD;
           obtained from the ICER and the ICUR are when varying both costs and health results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Ethics The Study has been approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Albacete (February&#xD;
           meeting), and will be presented to the rest of local Ethics Committees. The information&#xD;
           form for participants and informed consent is presented in the annexes.&#xD;
