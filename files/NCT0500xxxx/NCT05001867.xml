  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSD) among sonographers/radiographers are prevalent&#xD;
      in the healthcare industry. This pilot study will evaluate the use of a robotic assisted&#xD;
      ultrasonography system (ROBUST) against the conventional abdominal ultrasound scanning&#xD;
      procedure. The ROBUST will be developed to provide 6 degrees of freedom to allow&#xD;
      radiographers to perform abdominal scanning without having to reach over patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 sonographers with at least 5 years of experience will be recruited from SGH and SKH, to&#xD;
      perform abdominal ultrasound scans on healthy volunteers. Each sonographer will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to scan a volunteer using conventional abdominal ultrasound scanning procedure and&#xD;
      with ROBUST respectively. The study will be done in 2 phases, separated by at least a 1-month&#xD;
      interval between scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Scanning of volunteer using conventional abdominal ultrasound scanning procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Scanning of volunteer using ROBUST. Outcome measures will include ultrasound image&#xD;
      quality, sonographer feedback and comfort level as well as satisfaction feedback from healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. A panel of 4 reviewers, consisting of 2 radiologists and 2 senior radiographers&#xD;
      will be invited to grade the images, using a 3-point Likert scale. The duration of each&#xD;
      scanning will be recorded. The comfort level reported by sonographers will be assessed using&#xD;
      the SGH Comfort Level Survey. In addition, the comfort level of healthy volunteers will also&#xD;
      be assessed using a satisfaction questionnaire.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  10 participating sonographers will be recruited from SGH and SKH to perform abdominal&#xD;
           ultrasound scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 healthy volunteers of average body habitus with BMI &lt;30, abdominal circumference&#xD;
           &lt;102cm will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each sonographer will be randomly assigned to scan 1 healthy volunteer. The same&#xD;
           volunteer will be scanned twice with an interval of at least 1 month between two scans:&#xD;
           once using conventional abdominal ultrasound scanning procedure and once using ROBUST.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the session, markers coated with a retroreflective material to reflect light to&#xD;
           the motion capture camera will be pasted on participating sonographers on various parts&#xD;
           of the upper limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surface electromyography (sEMG) electrodes will be affixed on sonographers' upper&#xD;
           trapezius, deltoid, biceps, triceps, wrist extensors and flexors to monitor muscle&#xD;
           activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The healthy volunteer will lie on a plinth with the participating sonographer seated&#xD;
           next to him/her. The sonographer will then perform scanning on various abdominal organs&#xD;
           following the point of reference and scanning approach as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The same ultrasound scanner and probe type will be used on all volunteers by all&#xD;
           sonographers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Static bilateral grip strength of participating sonographers will be measured using a&#xD;
           dynamometer before and after each scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of both scans, participating sonographers will be required to complete a&#xD;
           survey on comfort level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of both scans, healthy volunteers will be required to complete a survey on&#xD;
           satisfaction level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The quality of the images from both scans will be rated by 4 readers: 2 consultant&#xD;
           radiologists and 2 senior radiographers. A photometer will be used to ensure all readers&#xD;
           interpret images directly from a designated monitor under consistent lighting condition.&#xD;
