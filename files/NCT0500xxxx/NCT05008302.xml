      The aim of the study was to analyze the importance of the position of the body and the&#xD;
      examined upper limb on the parameters of movement coordination and hand grip strength in&#xD;

      The aim of this experiment was to analyze the parameters of motor coordination and handshake&#xD;
      strength in stroke patients and healthy volunteers in various age groups and selected torso&#xD;
      and upper limb positions. Both patients and healthy volunteers were prospectively divided&#xD;
      into three age groups: 18-45, 46-60 and 61 and above. Thus, the maximum range of motion&#xD;
      (ROM), frequency of wrist and finger movements, and grip strength (dependent variables) were&#xD;
      valued in three age groups and different starting positions (independent variables). The Hand&#xD;
      Tutor device (MediTouch, Israel) and the electronic manual dynamometer EH 101 (Camry, China)&#xD;
      for grip strength measurement (error of measurement, 0.5 kg/lb) were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hand Tutor allows measurements of the frequency of movement (i.e., the number of cycles&#xD;
      per second, where one cycle represents the movement from flexion to contraction) and the&#xD;
      maximum range of movement, which is automatically measured during the frequency test, were&#xD;
      performed over time 10 seconds (sensitivity: 0,05 [mm] of wrist and fingers Ext./Flex), the&#xD;
      frequency of movement (motion capture speed: up to 1 [m/sec]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test consisted of two motor tasks, carried out in two different starting positions:&#xD;
      sitting and lying down (supine). During the first examination, the subject sat on the&#xD;
      therapeutic table (without back support), feet resting on the floor. The upper limb was to be&#xD;
      examined in adduction, with the elbow bent in the intermediate position between pronation and&#xD;
      supination of the forearm. In the supine position, the upper limb was stabilized at the&#xD;
      subject's body (adduction in the humeral joint, elbow flexion in the intermediate position).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each of the starting positions, after putting the glove on, the subject was asked to make&#xD;
      moves as quickly and in as full a range as possible. Finally, the measurement of grip&#xD;
      strength with a dynamometer was performed in both analyzed starting positions, after&#xD;
      completing the range of motion and speed or frequency tests. The upper extremity tested in&#xD;
      stroke patients was the paretic extremity. In healthy subjects, the dominant hand was tested.&#xD;
