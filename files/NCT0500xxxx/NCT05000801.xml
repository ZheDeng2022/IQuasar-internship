  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this innovative immunotherapy using WT1/hTERT/Survivin-loaded DCs is to&#xD;
      determine whether this novel DC vaccination is safe and can significantly prevent clinical&#xD;
      relapse and increase survival of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients by eradicating minimal&#xD;
      residual disease, while maintaining its safety profile in this phase I trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      we will conduct a single-arm phase I clinical study in 20 patients with acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML) at the stage of minimal residual disease (MRD) following standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy, and these patients are not the subjects of stem cell transplantation. Adult&#xD;
      patients between18 and 70 years old with AML who have entered morphological remission after&#xD;
      induction, consolidation or intensive chemotherapy with molecular signature of increased WT1&#xD;
      molecule levels and pathological characteristics of bone marrow biopsy, together with&#xD;
      fulfilling all other eligibility criteria, will be vaccinated with dendritic cells loaded&#xD;
      with tri-antigens (WT1/TERT/survivin) in the absence of any additional therapeutic&#xD;
      measurements. The primary aim of this innovative immunotherapy study is to determine whether&#xD;
      the anti-leukemic effects seen in our preclinical study can be confirmed in patients and&#xD;
      whether such DC vaccination can significantly prevent relapse and increase survival of AML&#xD;
      patients by eradicating minimal residual disease. Patients will be recruited at 307 Hospital&#xD;
      in Beijing. Recruitment will start in the second half of 2021 and will last for two years or&#xD;
      until 20 safety and efficacy-evaluable AML patients are included. This is a single-arm trial.&#xD;
      The patients who present MRD after complete chemotherapy will receive a conditioning regimen&#xD;
      of cyclophosphamide, followed by six infusions of autologous or HLA-matched donor-derived DCs&#xD;
      loaded with tri-antigens including WT1/TERT/survivin. The dendritic cell therapy product will&#xD;
      be administered in the stem cell transplantation center at 307 Hospital headed by Dr.&#xD;
      Liang-Ding Hu. After inclusion of 20 safety/feasibility-evaluable patients, relapse rate,&#xD;
      relapse-free survival and overall survival analysis will be performed. Tumor marker levels&#xD;
      and immune signature molecules will also be monitored at molecular and immunological levels,&#xD;
      and general and disease-specific quality of life will be evaluated using quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaires at various time points.&#xD;
