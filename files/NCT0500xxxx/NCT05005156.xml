    <intervention_model_description>This Phase IIb study is a double-blind, randomized, multi-centre, placebo-controlled, clinical trial; approximately 876 participants 18 years of age and older, living with HIV, on stable treatment, and virologically suppressed for at least 6 months will be enrolled. All participants will receive a single dose of either the study vaccine or a placebo vaccine on First Injection Visit (2:1 allocation ratio of vaccine: placebo), and a second dose of Ad5-nCoV at Day 56 (Second Injection Visit) and will be followed to monitor vaccine candidate safety, immunogenicity (antibody response), and efficacy for a duration of 52 weeks. A subset of participants will also have cellular immunity measured after receiving the 5×1010 vp Ad5-nCoV vaccine (≥ 4 x1010 vp).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>This is double-blinded clinical trial. The sponsor will provide investigational product and identical appearing placebo to investigators responsible for vaccine administration according to the prompts in the IWRS system.&#xD;
Emergency unblinding decisions are expected to be rare and could be justified only when that information is needed for the future clinical management of that participant. The decision of emergency unblinding must be approved by the PI, the global Co-PI and the sponsor after sufficient evaluation.&#xD;
Individuals will remain blinded to the first dose of the injection (First Injection Visit) until the end of the study. All individuals will receive active vaccine at Day 56 (Second Injection Visit).</masking_description>

        basal cell carcinoma of the skin and cervical carcinoma in situ) 13. History of serious&#xD;
        psychiatric condition likely to affect participation in the study 14. Bleeding disorder&#xD;
