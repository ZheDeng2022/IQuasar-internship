  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial to assess an intervention to facilitate patient&#xD;
      self-collection of dried blood samples at home for therapeutic drug monitoring of tacrolimus&#xD;
      and mycophenolate in kidney transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, text messages will be sent to mobile devices to remind kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients to perform therapeutic drug monitoring at home using a special lancet device to&#xD;
      collect blood samples from the upper arm. The primary objective is to evaluate if more&#xD;
      intensive, bidirectional text messages improve the quality of sample collection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Optimal immunosuppression therapy, most commonly with tacrolimus and mycophenolate, is&#xD;
      critical for kidney transplantation success. While graft and patient survival are&#xD;
      multifaceted phenomena, they are commonly attributed to chronic, subclinical immune-mediated&#xD;
      damage, tacrolimus nephrotoxicity, or premature death secondary to complications amplified by&#xD;
      immunosuppression such as infection, malignancy, and cardiovascular disease. New approaches&#xD;
      are required to explore ways to optimize the precision dosing of immunosuppression to reduce&#xD;
      the associated significant long-term side effects with the potential to improve kidney&#xD;
      transplantation outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, immunosuppressant dose adjustments empirically balance efficacy and toxicity in&#xD;
      conjunction with limited tacrolimus blood concentrations. However, both tacrolimus and&#xD;
      mycophenolate possess interpatient variability in drug exposure and response with&#xD;
      considerable overlap between therapeutic and adverse effects. Only tacrolimus is routinely&#xD;
      monitored as mycophenolate trough concentration is not correlated with drug exposure or&#xD;
      outcomes. The pharmacokinetic parameter area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) offers&#xD;
      a greater understanding of total drug exposure and has been associated with improved outcomes&#xD;
      for both tacrolimus and mycophenolate. Yet, AUC is not routinely determined because it is&#xD;
      impractical due to the need for multiple repeated samples in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a prospective, single-center pilot study to evaluate the ability of&#xD;
      a text messaging intervention coupled with a novel lancet device, the Tasso-M20, to&#xD;
      facilitate the collection of dried blood samples by the patient at home for AUC estimation.&#xD;
      The goal of the project is to develop a patient-centric strategy to allow frequent,&#xD;
      longitudinal, minimally invasive sample collection which allows for more detailed assessments&#xD;
      of immunosuppression exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare the effect of bidirectional text communication on&#xD;
      adherence to and accuracy of home-based AUC collection versus unidirectional text reminders&#xD;
      in kidney transplant recipients receiving tacrolimus and mycophenolate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to assess the bioanalytical agreement of two sample collection&#xD;
      methods (dried blood spot and venipuncture) as measured by Liquid Chromatography with tandem&#xD;
      mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).&#xD;
