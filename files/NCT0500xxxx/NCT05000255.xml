      Aim of the study is to investigate possible predictors and factors that may be associated&#xD;
      with the development and maintenance of mental and physical health constrains including&#xD;
      depression and anxiety symptomatology as well as loneliness in hospitalized post-COVID&#xD;
      patients and non-COVID patients in Germany. Furthermore, it will be investigated whether&#xD;
      psychological interventions have an effect on anxiety and depression symptomatology, on&#xD;
      loneliness values, self-efficacy and perceived social support values. Specifically, the&#xD;
      research aim is to examine the relationships between loneliness, self-efficacy, and social&#xD;
      support and to address the question of what factors increase the risk of post covid&#xD;
      depression/anxiety, and to test the buffering effect of physical and social activities. For&#xD;
      this purpose an experimental group comparison will be applied, in which two interventions&#xD;
      will be performed on post-COVID patients and non-COVID patients in the unit of Physical&#xD;
      Medicine and Geriatrics in Medical Rehabilitation. (PhD Project by Annika Roskoschinski,&#xD;

      Background: Increased depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms have been observed in about&#xD;
      23% of all post-COVID patients, also called post-COVID depression (Huang et al., 2021).&#xD;
      However, what a) promotes post-COVID depression after the disease and whether it is b) even&#xD;
      post-Covid specific has not yet been conclusively understood and will be investigated in this&#xD;
      proposed research. The theoretical basis of the proposed work is Cacioppo, Peplau, and&#xD;
      Perlman's theory of loneliness, Bandura's self-efficacy theory, and Schwarzer's HAPA model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The aim of the study is to investigate possible predictors and factors that may&#xD;
      be associated with the development and maintenance of mental and physical health constrains&#xD;
      including depression and anxiety symptomatology as well as loneliness in hospitalized&#xD;
      post-COVID patients and non-COVID patients in Germany. Furthermore, it will be investigated&#xD;
      whether psychological interventions have an effect on anxiety and depression symptomatology,&#xD;
      on loneliness values, self-efficacy and perceived social support values. Specifically, the&#xD;
      research aim is to examine the relationships between loneliness, self-efficacy, and social&#xD;
      support and to address the question of what factors increase the risk of post covid&#xD;
      depression/anxiety, and to test the buffering effect of physical and social activities. For&#xD;
      this purpose, a correlational study and an experimental group comparison will be applied, in&#xD;
      which two interventions will be performed on post-COVID patients and non-COVID patients.&#xD;
      These two data collections will serve as the basis for a later longitudinal study, which is&#xD;
      still in the planning stage, as follow-up questions still need to be elaborated. Methods:&#xD;
      Around 300 patients should be included in the study. The correlation study at the first&#xD;
      measurement point also includes a regression analysis (moderated mediation analysis).&#xD;
      Furthermore, an experimental group comparison is performed. For the first group, a&#xD;
      psychological intervention for psychoeducational measures and psychosocial support, was&#xD;
      designed according to the recommendations of the DGP - Deutsche Gesellschaft für Pneumologie&#xD;
      und Beatmungsmedizin e.V. for the rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients (DGP, 2020). The second&#xD;
      intervention was designed after Cacioppo's intervention EASE, for processing loneliness. In&#xD;
      this experiment, the psychological interventions will be applied to both groups of patients&#xD;
      (non-Covid/Covid patients). The interventions start approximately two days after data&#xD;
      collection at T0. The second measurement time point (T1) is scheduled at the time of patient&#xD;
      discharge after the interventions have been implemented. Only patients who scored 8 or higher&#xD;
      on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at admission will participate in the&#xD;
      interventions. Patients will be asked to complete the questionnaire again six months after&#xD;
      discharge to include a third measurement point and to conduct the aforementioned longitudinal&#xD;
      study. Patients who refuse to participate in one of the interventions but nevertheless agree&#xD;
      to complete the questionnaires at the measurement time points are treated according to the&#xD;
      standards of the complex treatment in early rehabilitation in which a twice psychological&#xD;
      contact and screening by means of HADS is obligatory. They form a third group. The following&#xD;
      instruments will be used: Items from the UCLA Loneliness Scale (Russel, 1980, German&#xD;
      version), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Snaith &amp; Zigmond, 2010), Perceived&#xD;
      Social Support Questionnaire (F-SozU K-6, Fydrich et al., 2009); SWE - General Self-Efficacy&#xD;
      Expectancy Scale (Schwarzer et al., 1999); various self-efficacy instruments, such as staging&#xD;
      and Activities Against Loneliness (Lippke, 2007, adapted from Godin &amp; Shepard, 1985). It is&#xD;
      expected that self-efficacy and social support play a role as mediator variables and&#xD;
      moderator variables and that the symptomatology of depression and anxiety improves after an&#xD;
      intervention in COVID and non-COVID patients alike. The findings of this research will&#xD;
      contribute to a better understanding of the experience and behavior of patients with and&#xD;
      without an infection with COVID-19 in early rehabilitation and identify opportunities for&#xD;
      psychological intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ethics committee of Jacobs University Bremen, where Prof. Dr. Lippke supervises the PhD&#xD;
      project, has already approved the research project. Therefore, the project is already in the&#xD;
      recruitment phase in order to be able to use data from the third wave from the first quarter&#xD;
      of 2021, as this is a special situation in the pandemic and the data would not be&#xD;
      reproducible in this way.&#xD;

    <description>The first intervention is designed according to a current recommendation of the Deutsche Pneumologen Gesellschaft e.V. Its approach is resource-oriented, psychoeducational and is expected to have a positive effect on the symptomatology of depression and anxiety in the short and medium term. An additional focus was added to the intervention: planning more physical activity in daily life after discharge. The DPG intervention focuses more on the current state and aims to activate patients' resources in the short and long term. To ensure randomization of study participants, interventions will alternate weekly.</description>

    <description>The second intervention, &quot;E. A. S. E.&quot; according to Cacioppo and Patrick (2008), addresses the social action radius of patients (here assuming that loneliness is a predictor of depression). This intervention is about planning social activities against loneliness. Cacioppo's intervention aims to encourage more social activity in the long term.</description>
