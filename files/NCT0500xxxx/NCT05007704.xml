    <textblock>
      Critical Care Medicine (CCM) has emerged as an independent specialty over the last few&#xD;
      decades. Anesthesiologists being perioperative physicians, often practice CCM full time or&#xD;
      part-time. Deficiencies have been noted by experts in the Anesthesiology training in certain&#xD;
      competencies required for the management of critically ill medical and surgical patients in&#xD;
      the Intensive care unit (ICU). This is often compounded by considerable variation in the&#xD;
      training curriculum of the Anesthesiologists based on the geographical region and base&#xD;
      specialty. The Intensive &amp; Critical Care Medicine Committee of the World Federation of&#xD;
      Societies of Anesthesiologists (WFSA), has developed a preliminary survey of recently&#xD;
      qualified Anesthesiologists, to review the existing competencies for CCM in the&#xD;
      Anesthesiology curriculum across the globe. The results of this survey will be used to&#xD;
      identify the gaps and additional competencies required for Anesthesiologists to practice&#xD;
      Critical Care in ICU through expert consensus, using a Delphi process.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CCM has emerged as an independent specialty over the last few decades. Anesthesiologists&#xD;
      being perioperative physicians are an integral part of this progress, with many of them&#xD;
      opting for CCM as a full-time career. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has&#xD;
      brought unprecedented challenges to the health care system. Anesthesiologists working in the&#xD;
      operating room (OR) and those working in the ICU have been the frontline workers along with&#xD;
      other Critical Care professionals in the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
      Though a few countries have recognized CCM as a separate specialty of medicine, in most&#xD;
      countries, it is considered as a sub-specialty of broad specialties like Anesthesiology,&#xD;
      Pulmonary Medicine or Internal Medicine. Some professional bodies have developed a formal&#xD;
      curriculum for training in CCM. The Competency-Based Training programme in Intensive Care&#xD;
      Medicine (CoBaTrICE) from the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) is a widely&#xD;
      accepted formal structured training curriculum in CCM. Most curricula are designed only for&#xD;
      high-income, well-resourced training and practice environments and do not account for&#xD;
      additional skills and competencies that may be required to practice in resource variable&#xD;
      settings, something the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated needs to be universal. The&#xD;
      transition of Anesthesiologists working in OR or managing critically ill surgical/ polytrauma&#xD;
      patients into working in ICU has largely been smooth. Nevertheless, experts have noted&#xD;
      deficiencies in the Anesthesiology training in certain competencies required for the&#xD;
      management of critically ill medical and surgical patients in the ICU. This is often&#xD;
      compounded by considerable variation in the training curriculum of the Anesthesiologists&#xD;
      based on the geographical region and type of institution. There is a need to identify these&#xD;
      competencies so that Anesthesiologists who wish to practice full time or part-time Critical&#xD;
      Care can acquire these competencies to improve their ability to manage critically ill&#xD;
      patients in ICU in different World Health Organization defined healthcare facilities levels.&#xD;
      This may also help provide guidance to educators worldwide regarding the competencies to be&#xD;
      included in Anesthesiology training that may help Anesthesiologists work better with&#xD;
      critically ill patients in ICU. These competencies have never been formally identified or&#xD;
      published. The investigators plan to review the existing competencies for CCM in the&#xD;
      Anesthesiology curriculum across the globe through a preliminary survey. Thereafter, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to identify the additional competencies required through consensus among&#xD;
      Experts, using a Delphi method. These additional competencies, classified as mandatory,&#xD;
      desirable, and optional, may serve as a guide for Anesthesiologists to practice Critical Care&#xD;
      in ICU in different levels of health care facilities worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The investigators aim to review/identify the existing competencies for CCM in the&#xD;
           Anesthesiology curriculum across the globe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The investigators aim to generate expert consensus on the additional competencies&#xD;
           (mandatory desirable and optional) required for Anesthesiologists to practice Critical&#xD;
           Care in the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Provide guidance to educators worldwide regarding the competencies to be included in the&#xD;
           Anesthesiology curriculum that may help Anesthesiologists work better with critically&#xD;
           ill patients in ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steering Committee:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Steering Committee comprising of Anesthesiologists with experience in CCM will be formed&#xD;
      under the auspices of the Intensive and Critical Care Medicine Committee (ICCCM) of the World&#xD;
      Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists (WFSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary survey:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Steering Committee will develop a preliminary survey to assess the knowledge and skills&#xD;
      of Anesthesiologists across the globe following Anesthesiology training, which is required to&#xD;
      achieve the various Critical Care competencies. A literature review on the existing Critical&#xD;
      Care competencies from various professional bodies will be conducted to develop a list of&#xD;
      Critical Care competencies, using CoBaTrICE as a base. The preliminary survey will be sent to&#xD;
      approximately 500 Anesthesiologists across the globe by the Experts. The competencies of&#xD;
      participants in CCM will be assessed under six domains in the survey (Disease diagnosis and&#xD;
      management, Procedures, Monitoring and therapeutic interventions, Resuscitation,&#xD;
      Communication and End-of-life care, Patient safety and Crisis Resource Management) using a&#xD;
      5-point Likert scale (never seen, have observed, can manage under supervision, can manage&#xD;
      with minimal assistance, and can manage independently).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first section of this survey will include the participant demographics, country of origin&#xD;
      and training, year of completing training, and a few training characteristics. The results of&#xD;
      the survey will be used to draft competencies for inclusion in Round one of the Delphi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delphi process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Delphi process is a well-established methodology to generate consensus on a particular&#xD;
      topic using the &quot;collective intelligence&quot; of panel members. The steering committee members&#xD;
      will perform a literature search on the available evidence, draft the initial statements and&#xD;
      conduct iterative Delphi rounds to generate consensus among the experts. The Steering&#xD;
      Committee members will not participate in the Delphi surveys themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steps of the Delphi process&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: Establishing a preliminary list of competencies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A literature review on the existing Critical Care competencies from various professional&#xD;
      bodies will be conducted to develop a list of Critical Care competencies, using CoBaTrICE as&#xD;
      a base and categorized under the six core domains (disease diagnosis and management,&#xD;
      procedures, monitoring and therapeutic interventions, resuscitation, communication and&#xD;
      end-of-life care, patient safety and crisis resource management). The results of the&#xD;
      preliminary survey will be used to draft statements for Round one of Delphi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: Preparation of the Delphi Round one survey:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The list of the competencies will be sent to the Experts as a Delphi questionnaire. The&#xD;
      anonymity of the participating experts will be maintained during the Delphi rounds. The&#xD;
      participant will be asked to score each of the competencies listed on a 5-point Likert scale&#xD;
      (non-essential, optional, optional but desirable, desirable, and mandatory). The&#xD;
      participating expert will be invited to provide feedback regarding omission, addition, or&#xD;
      modification of the items on the questionnaire. The response and feedback of experts will be&#xD;
      collated during the analysis of results and shared in the following survey as controlled&#xD;
      feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3: Subsequent Delphi Rounds:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The steering committee will review the results of round one. The competencies listed will be&#xD;
      modified, deleted, or added if found ambiguous based on the feedback and comments of the&#xD;
      results. Competencies deemed &quot;non-essential&quot; by more than 50% of the respondents will be&#xD;
      eliminated. The remaining competencies will be continued in the subsequent rounds until&#xD;
      consensus is achieved (&gt;80% of respondents). Lower-rated items identified for removal may be&#xD;
      retained in the second round if more than 20% of participating experts considered them&#xD;
      &quot;mandatory&quot;. The summary results of Round two will be presented to Experts, and the survey&#xD;
      process will be repeated with the modified questionnaire. The Delphi rounds will be continued&#xD;
      till desired consensus and stability is achieved for competencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 4: Final Consensus on Competencies to be included:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The summary results of the last stable round will be used to issue the consensus on the&#xD;
      additional competencies to be included. These competencies will also be classified as those&#xD;
      mandatory, desirable, and optional, which may serve as a guide to decide which competencies&#xD;
      are required for working in different levels of health care facilities worldwide. The results&#xD;
      of the final survey, consensus competencies, and the manuscript will be circulated among the&#xD;
      experts for approval before submission for publication.&#xD;
