  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives are to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify avocatin b (C17 lipid) in plasma of individuals that consumed 1 avocado.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirm no avocation b present in the plasma of individuals that avoided avocado intake&#xD;
           for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effect of an overnight fast on avocation b detection.&#xD;

      The proposed study will be conducted in humans according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP)&#xD;
      guidelines. All subjects will review and sign an Informed Consent Form approved by the&#xD;
      Illinois Institute of Technology's Institutional Review Boards (IRB) prior to screening.&#xD;
      SCREENING To learn more about the study and to pre-qualify, potential subjects can call the&#xD;
      CNRC or visit the website posted on recruitment flyers or from other recruitment materials.&#xD;
      If they call the CNRC, a staff member will provide a brief background on the study and ask a&#xD;
      series of questions from a screening questionnaire to see if they may be eligible to&#xD;
      participate. The same questionnaire is available on the website and can be filled out by&#xD;
      potential subjects online. The screening questionnaire includes self-reported information&#xD;
      about health status and lifestyle factors that can be used to determine if someone is not&#xD;
      eligible for the study (i.e.: has diabetes, cardiovascular disease, on interfering meds,&#xD;
      etcâ€¦).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results of the questionnaires, BMI calculation, and health evaluation, subjects&#xD;
      who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be trained on &quot;how to prepare for study visit&quot;. This will include&#xD;
      instructions for avoiding avocados for at least 7 days prior to the study Visit, fasting&#xD;
      overnight (10-12 hours), avoidance of vigorous physical activity, alcoholic and caffeinated&#xD;
      beverage consumption for at least 24 hours preceding a study day, maintain regular sleep&#xD;
      pattern. If the subject did not get enough sleep during the night preceding a study day, the&#xD;
      investigators will reschedule their study day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DAY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Day visit will last about 1.5 hours with a 30 minutes follow-up visit 24 h after the&#xD;
      start of the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On a Study Day visit, subjects will arrive at the clinic after fasting for at least 10 hours&#xD;
      and in a well-hydrated and well-rested state. Subjects will be inquired for compliance to&#xD;
      avocado-free food at least 7 days prior to study day and details of food intake in the&#xD;
      24-hour period prior to the visit to ensure consistency and compliance with the protocol&#xD;
      requirements. After confirming compliance with the [ protocol, anthropometric measurements,&#xD;
      vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and ear temperature) will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A finger prick for fasting blood glucose will be done to confirm the fasting status. A&#xD;
      licensed healthcare professional (LHCP) will draw a baseline blood sample using a butterfly&#xD;
      needle (Timepoint t=0). After completing a baseline blood draw, subjects will receive an&#xD;
      avocado and crackers to eat onsite. After consuming the avocado and crackers, subjects will&#xD;
      be given a take-home snack and be discharged and scheduled to come to CNR the following day&#xD;
      for an additional blood sample. The subject will be instructed to fast overnight (10-12&#xD;
      hours), and the blood collection time will be anchored to 24 h after the start of the study&#xD;
      treatment (avocado).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood collection: Blood will be collected a total of 2 times during the entire study period.&#xD;
      The investigators will collect 4 mL of blood each time. Over the course of the whole study,&#xD;
      the total amount of blood collected will be 8 mL, which is way less than what is allowed for&#xD;
      a one-time blood donation (~550 mL).&#xD;
