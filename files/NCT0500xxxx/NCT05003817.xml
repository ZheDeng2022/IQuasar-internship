  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 100,000 coronary stent procedures, where small balloons are used to stretch open a&#xD;
      narrowed blood vessel, are performed every year in the United Kingdom to treat people who&#xD;
      have conditions such as angina or have suffered a heart attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For most patients the risk of complications is low, but for some, there is a higher risk of&#xD;
      their heart failing during the procedure. Heart failure is a serious complication which can&#xD;
      need treatment with a life support machine and lead to major damage to the heart muscle or&#xD;
      even death. These risks are greatest in patients with severely diseased heart arteries and&#xD;
      those who already have weakened heart muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new technology may be able to help with this problem. It consists of a small heart pump&#xD;
      which is placed in the heart's main pumping chamber (the left ventricle, LV). This pump is&#xD;
      known as a LV unloading device. The LV unloading device is inserted into the heart through a&#xD;
      blood vessel in the leg and supports the heart muscle. It is removed at the end of the&#xD;
      procedure or when the heart can pump safely on its own. Whilst this heart pump is promising,&#xD;
      it comes with some risks of its own. These include bleeding and damage to the arteries in the&#xD;
      legs. It is also expensive, costing £8,000 per operation. Currently, there is no strong&#xD;
      evidence to guide the use of this device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CHIP-BCIS3 study aims to determine whether these heart pumps are beneficial and&#xD;
      cost-effective in patients receiving a stenting procedure who are at high-risk of&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
