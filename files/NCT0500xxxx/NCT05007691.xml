  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the purpose of this study is to clarify the rationale for the choice of the upper or lower&#xD;
      jaw for positioning the occlusal splint&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients are giving written&#xD;
      informed consent. Occlusal splints for the upper and lower jaws are made for each of the&#xD;
      patients. An assessment is made of the relative values and distribution of chewing forces in&#xD;
      two cases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &quot;maxillary occlusal splint - lower dentition&quot;;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. &quot;mandibular occlusal splint - upper dentition&quot;. The obtained values are used in the&#xD;
           final elemental analysis of the stress-strain state and the degree of displacement of&#xD;
           the dentition in both indicated cases.&#xD;
