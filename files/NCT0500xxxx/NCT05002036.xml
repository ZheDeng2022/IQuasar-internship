  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cataract surgery is one of the main causes of Dry Eye Disease (DED). This paper aimed at&#xD;
      evaluating the prevalence of iatrogenic DED on a population of patients without DED receiving&#xD;
      cataract surgery, and the impact of an eyedrop containing hyaluronic acid and gingko biloba&#xD;
      (HA-GB, Trium free eyedrops, Sooft srl, Italy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this phase-IV trial we enrolled 40 patients with no DED. Patients were seen at baseline,&#xD;
      day 1, week 1 and week 4. At each visit patients received Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)&#xD;
      questionnaire, Anterior segment ophthalmoscopy with grading of conjunctival hyperemia,&#xD;
      fluorescein tear break-up time (TBUT), grading of fluorescein corneal staining (epithelial&#xD;
      damage); adherence and tolerability using a visual analogue scale were checked at week 1 and&#xD;
      4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At day 0 patients underwent cataract surgery (2.4 mm temporal incision) and were randomized&#xD;
      to standard postoperative care (control group) or standard postoperative care + HA-GB given&#xD;
      three times a day for 4 weeks (HA-GB group).&#xD;
