      The effect of vitamin C supplementation on GCF total oxidant capacity in smoker patients with&#xD;
      periodontitis following non-surgical periodontal therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects were screened by comprehensive periodontal examination and full periodontal&#xD;
      charts were obtained and full-mouth periapical radiographs were taken using the long cone&#xD;
      parallel technique at the time of the initial examination to confirm the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups (smokers with stage III-IV grade B periodontitis) received full mouth scaling and&#xD;
      root planing using ultrasonic scaler and hand instruments under local anesthesia, completed&#xD;
      over 2 visits. Patients were given careful instruction in self performed plaque control&#xD;
      measures: twice daily tooth brushing with a brush and tooth paste and once daily interdental&#xD;
      cleaning using triangular wooden tooth picks and/or interdental brushes rinsing with 0.125%&#xD;
      Chlorhexidine HCL mouthwash (Hexitol® ) to be used twice daily for 2 weeks. Group II received&#xD;
      antioxidant vit C 2 grams / day for four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, GCF samples were collected at the initial visit and collected again 3 months&#xD;
      after non-surgical treatment as follows : at the selected area (the most periodontally&#xD;
      affected site), all clinically detected supragingival plaque were removed carefully to&#xD;
      minimize contamination of the paper strips by the plaque . The teeth selected were then&#xD;
      gently washed with water, and the sites under study were isolated with cotton rolls to&#xD;
      prevent contamination with saliva and gently dried with an air syringe . Filter paper strips&#xD;
      were placed at the entrance of the crevice and were left in place for 30 secs ) and then&#xD;
      placed in plastic eppendorf. Strips with any plaque, saliva, or blood contamination were&#xD;
      discarded .The sample from the individual site was stored at -80°C for later processing . GCF&#xD;
      was then extracted and assayed for the content of total oxidant capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitation of TOC in GCF:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GCF samples of both groups were assayed using ELISA technique for estimation of the level of&#xD;
      total oxidant capacity (TOC) in GCF as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TOC was extracted from the paper strip by adding 100 μl of phosphate buffer saline to the&#xD;
      eppendorf tube then mixed by vortex followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 3000Xg. The&#xD;
      supernatant was used for estimation of TOC. For the quantitative determination of human TOC&#xD;
      concentrations in GCF, PerOx (TOS/TOC) Immun-diagnostik Assay (ELISA) Kit was used. ELISA is&#xD;
      intended for the quantitative determination of the total oxidative status/capacity (TOS/TOC)&#xD;
      in Ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-plasma, serum and cell culture supernatants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The determination of the peroxides is performed by the reaction of a peroxidase with&#xD;
      peroxides in the sample followed by the conversion of TMB (Tetra-methylbenzidine) to a&#xD;
      colored product. After addition of a stop solution the samples were measured at 450 nm in a&#xD;
      microtiter plate reader. The quantification is performed by the delivered calibrator&#xD;
