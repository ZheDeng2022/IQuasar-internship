  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reported incidence of uveitis is 52 persons per year per 100,000 population, with a&#xD;
      greater incidence estimated in developing countries, including Indonesia. Uveitis has&#xD;
      challenges in diagnosis and therapy, due to the existence of an immunological privilege&#xD;
      mechanism, so it is not easy to obtain diagnostic markers or provide appropriate therapy. In&#xD;
      uveitis, a work-up examination looking for signs in the entire body or systemic disease is&#xD;
      often conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up until today, establishing the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB)-associated uveitis is still a&#xD;
      challenge. From histopathological studies, TB germs are difficult to find. Wreblowski et al.&#xD;
      found that paucibacillary conditions also made TB bacteria difficult to find by PCR and&#xD;
      tuberculin test results were also not completely reliable. The development of IGRA&#xD;
      (Interferon-Gamma Release Assay) assays, such as QuantiFERON-Gold TB (QFT) has been&#xD;
      investigated. Our previous study found that IGRA-positive uveitis patients with type 1 IFN&#xD;
      gene expression score &gt;5.61 were more likely to have active TB uveitis. In addition, serum&#xD;
      C1q examination also showed an inverse correlation with this score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding therapy, until now corticosteroids and cycloplegics are the mainstay treatment for&#xD;
      uveitis. However, appropriate administration of anti-infective drugs is necessary in cases of&#xD;
      infection. Inflammation in TB-associated uveitis is thought to be the result of the immune&#xD;
      response that occurs as a result of paucibacillary TB infection. Examinations can be&#xD;
      redundant and problematic. Determination of therapy is also a dilemma because it is difficult&#xD;
      to determine the right patient candidate for administration of anti-tuberculosis therapy&#xD;
      (ATT). The protocol of ATT administration itself has not been standardized so it often&#xD;
      follows the extra pulmonary TB protocol and there has been no reliable clinical trial&#xD;
      research on ATT administration in patients with suspected TB uveitis yet no TB microorganisms&#xD;
      are found directly in the eyes or other organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this basis, the investigators planned a prospective randomized clinical trial study that&#xD;
      involve idiopathic uveitis patients with positive IGRA test, to assess the effectivity of ATT&#xD;
      compared to oral steroids. In addition, this study can also be used as a basis for validation&#xD;
      of type 1 IFN scores and serum C1q as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers in cases of&#xD;
      TB-associated uveitis.&#xD;
