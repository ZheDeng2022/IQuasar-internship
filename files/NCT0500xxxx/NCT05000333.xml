      The covid-19 pandemic has had an important impact in the world, in France, it has put our&#xD;
      health system under tension. We know that a health crisis of this magnitude can induce&#xD;
      psychological and physical disorders, particularly in exposed caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systematic occupational medicine consultations of all medical and paramedical personnel,&#xD;
      whether tenured or not, working at the Villeneuve Saint Georges Hospital (CHIV) who presented&#xD;
      a Covid-19 between February 1 and June 30, 2020, allowed us to note the presence of multiple&#xD;
      after-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study evaluates the consequences of the disease on the physical and psychological&#xD;
      health of these caregivers and on their professional activity.&#xD;
