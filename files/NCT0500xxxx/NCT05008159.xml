  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical mobility and social participation are needed to maintain independence and quality of&#xD;
      life for adults over 55 years of age. Despite the known benefits of physical activity and&#xD;
      dietary change programs for older adults, the best ways to deliver these interventions are&#xD;
      not well understood. The goal of the EMBOLDEN study is to promote physical and community&#xD;
      mobility in older adults who experience difficulties taking up community programs and reside&#xD;
      in areas of high health inequity. Building on existing best practices, the investigators will&#xD;
      implement and evaluate an innovative co-designed community-based program to promote physical&#xD;
      activity, healthy eating, social participation, and system navigation. The potential for&#xD;
      spreading this program throughout Hamilton and adapted to other Canadian communities will&#xD;
      also be explored&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial employing a type II hybrid implementation-effectiveness&#xD;
      design. This will enable the investigators to evaluate both clinical outcomes and important&#xD;
      processes that impact the implementation of the co-designed intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will consist of i) weekly interactive group-based health education sessions&#xD;
      focused on: increasing knowledge, skills, and behaviours related to physical activity,&#xD;
      healthy eating, and available community supports for older adults; this will include&#xD;
      facilitated physical activity delivered by a certified exercise physiologist or certified&#xD;
      personal trainer with experience and expertise working with older adults and interactive&#xD;
      nutrition sessions; socialization to foster peer and community connections, co-learning, and&#xD;
      decrease social isolation; and skill-building to support independence and quality of life;&#xD;
      and ii) tailored system navigation support to increase access to and use of health and social&#xD;
      services systems and address barriers or unmet needs&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will place equal weight on our primary effectiveness outcome (physical&#xD;
      mobility) and implementation outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Effectiveness: quantitative, two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) using&#xD;
           accelerometers and questionnaires completed by study participants at baseline,&#xD;
           immediately following the program, and 6 months after baseline to measure primary and&#xD;
           secondary effectiveness outcomes. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with&#xD;
           interventionists and a subset of participants to explore perceived effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Implementation: quantitative surveys, document analysis (e.g., meeting notes), and&#xD;
           qualitative interviews will be conducted with participants, interventionists, and&#xD;
           Community Advisory Board members to evaluate implementation outcomes, and understand&#xD;
           implementation barriers and facilitators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial has a pragmatic design in the following ways: i) recruiting a population with&#xD;
      broad inclusion criteria, reflective of the general population of older adults; ii)&#xD;
      conducting the study in existing community settings (when in-person delivery is feasible) and&#xD;
      virtually, in partnership with organizations already delivering virtual supports due to the&#xD;
      pandemic; iii) leveraging existing resources, staff, and service delivery organizations in&#xD;
      the intervention arm that are available in usual care; iv) supporting flexibility delivery of&#xD;
      the intervention (e.g., tailoring to participant group needs), as would be done through other&#xD;
      community programs in usual care; v) flexibility in adherence to the intervention, in ways&#xD;
      that are consistent with usual care; vi) selecting primary and secondary outcomes that are&#xD;
      participant-relevant; and vii) using intention to treat analyses based on all available data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Effectiveness Question: Does the 3-month EMBOLDEN intervention increase physical&#xD;
      mobility compared to usual care in community-dwelling older adults (55+ years) residing in&#xD;
      areas of high health inequity?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Implementation Question: How is the EMBOLDEN intervention implemented and adapted&#xD;
      across diverse neighbourhoods?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be delivered in community settings in nine urban neighbourhoods identified as&#xD;
      areas of health inequities (using Statistics Canada census tract data, 2016) in the cities of&#xD;
      Hamilton and Toronto, Ontario.&#xD;

PASE assesses the types of activities typically chosen by older adults (walking, recreational activities, exercise, housework, yard work, and caring for others. It uses frequency, duration, and intensity level of activity over the previous week to assign a score, ranging from 0 to 793, with higher scores indicating greater physical activity.</description>

The instrument also includes a visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) which provides a single global rating of self-perceived health and is scored on a 0 to 100 mm scale representing &quot;the worst…&quot; and &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot;, respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Between baseline and 3-months. An additional comparison will be made at 6-months to examine whether potential changes are maintained in the post-intervention phase.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in depression as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 score can range from 0 to 27, since each of the 9 items can be scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day).&#xD;
Major depression is diagnosed if 5 or more of the 9 depressive symptom criteria have been present at least &quot;more than half the days&quot; in the past 2 weeks, and 1 of the symptoms is depressed mood or anhedonia. Other depression is diagnosed if 2, 3, or 4 depressive symptoms have been present at least &quot;more than half the days&quot; in the past 2 weeks, and 1 of the symptoms is depressed mood or anhedonia. One of the 9 symptom criteria (&quot;thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way&quot;) counts if present at all, regardless of duration. As with the original PRIME-MD, before making a final diagnosis, the clinician is expected to rule out physical causes of depression, normal bereavement, and history of a manic episode.</description>

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Community-dwelling older adults (55 years of age and older) living in a neighbourhood&#xD;
        selected for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to speak or understand English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to walk 10 meters without physical assistance from another person (assistive&#xD;
             devices permitted)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        As a pragmatic trial, we have chosen broad inclusion criteria to reflect the&#xD;
        characteristics of individuals who may join a program such as this outside of a research&#xD;
        study. Thus, we will not exclude individuals based on the presence of existing chronic&#xD;
        disease, comorbidities, or other factors that may impact attendance.&#xD;
