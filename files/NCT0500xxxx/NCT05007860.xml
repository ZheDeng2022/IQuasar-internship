    <measure>Effective immune response (EIR) to PCV13 vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>35 days (+/- 14 days) after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>EIR is defined as a &gt;2-fold increase or conversion from a nonprotective to a protective titer for &gt;50% of specific S. pneumonia IgG titers (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F) vs baseline.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Effective immune response (EIR) to COVID19 vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>35 days (+/- 14 days) after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>EIR is defined as a &gt;4-fold increase from baseline, or seroconversion defined as change from negative to within the measuring interval, for specific SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers (spike protein). For patients without pre-COVID-19 vaccination.&#xD;
serology, a negative post-COVID-19 vaccination nucleocapsid antibody titer will be used as a surrogate for no prior infection and in this case a post-COVID-19 vaccination spike antibody titer within the measuring interval will be interpreted as an EIR.</description>

We excluded patients with known HIV or primary immune deficiency disorder, known active progression of CLL/SLL, prior cytotoxic chemotherapy within ≤1 year, CD20 monoclonal Ab within ≤6 months, or any prior bendamustine or fludarabine. We excluded patients who received PCV13 within ≤2 years, or within 2-5 years with nonprotective titers for ≥50% of PCV13-specific S. pneumonia IgG titers.</description>

We excluded patients with known HIV or primary immune deficiency disorder, known active progression of CLL/SLL, prior cytotoxic chemotherapy within ≤1 year, CD20 monoclonal Ab within ≤6 months, or any prior bendamustine or fludarabine. We excluded patients who received PCV13 within ≤2 years, or within 2-5 years with nonprotective titers for ≥50% of PCV13-specific S. pneumonia IgG titers.</description>

        Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of CLL or SLL according to WHO criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients receiving BTK inhibitor (Cohorts 1 and 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient must have no history of cytotoxic chemotherapy within 1 year (no prior&#xD;
                  history of bendamustine or fludarabine is permitted) and no history of CD20&#xD;
                  monoclonal antibody within 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient must have no known clinical or radiographic evidence of CLL progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients not on active therapy (Cohort 3):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient must have no history of cytotoxic chemotherapy within 1 year (no prior&#xD;
                  history of bendamustine or fludarabine is permitted) and no history of CD20&#xD;
                  monoclonal antibody within 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The treating investigator must have no intention to initiate CLL therapy within 2&#xD;
                  months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have not received PCV13 within 2 years. For patients with PCV13 within 5&#xD;
             years, S. pneumonia IgG antibody concentrations must be less than the reference value&#xD;
             for at least 50% of S. pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C,&#xD;
             19A,19F and 23F. Patients can have received prior PPV23 within any time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have no known history of HIV or primary immune deficiency disorder, nor&#xD;
             be taking a concurrent immune suppressing medication (e.g. steroids, methotrexate,&#xD;
             etc.).&#xD;
