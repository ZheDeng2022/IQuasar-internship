    <textblock>
      Primary objective of this study is the construction and validation of an experimental&#xD;
      environment for the simulation of a variety of near- and intermediate-vision activities of&#xD;
      daily living (ADLs) in different combinations of light temperature and light intensity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among the objectives of the study is to validate a framework of ADLs that require near and&#xD;
      intermediate vision and better reflect visual capacity, in a special experimental environment&#xD;
      of 9 different combinations of light temperature and light intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final list consists of the following ten basic ADL tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Phone Book Search (PBS), 2. Supermarket receipt (SupRe), 3. Book reading (BR), 4. Cellular&#xD;
      message (CM), 5. Cellular entry search (CES), 6. Reading computer screen (RCS), 7. Drops&#xD;
      bottle reading (DR), 8. Subtitles reading (SubRe), 9. Open door test (ODT), and, 10.&#xD;
      Screwdriver test (ST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 9 light combinations are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3000 K - 25 fc, 3000 K - 50 fc, 3000 K - 75 fc 4000 K - 25 fc, 4000 K - 50 fc, 4000 K - 75 fc&#xD;
      6000 K - 25 fc, 6000 K - 50 fc, 6000 K - 75 fc&#xD;
