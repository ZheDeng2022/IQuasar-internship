  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the biological response in vivo to challenge&#xD;
      agents (vaccines, antigen, drug, or mechanical challenges); to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of the challenge agent and to characterize the immune response in skin elicited&#xD;
      in vivo in healthy volunteers using an ultraviolet B (UVB) challenge.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative highly sensitive serum&#xD;
             (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-HCG]) at screening and a negative urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test prior to study intervention administration on Day -4&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have Fitzpatrick skin type II or III (10 participants) or type IV or higher (2&#xD;
             participants)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Otherwise healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, and vital&#xD;
             signs, and, if required by the applicable Intervention Specific Appendix (ISA), a&#xD;
             12-lead Electrocardiography (ECG) performed at screening. Any abnormalities must be&#xD;
             considered not clinically significant or consistent with the underlying illness in the&#xD;
             study population and this determination must be recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Otherwise healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If&#xD;
             the results of the serum chemistry panel, hematology, or urinalysis are outside the&#xD;
             normal reference ranges, the participant may be included only if the investigator&#xD;
             judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant or&#xD;
             to be appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This determination&#xD;
             must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by the&#xD;
             investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be a non-smoker (not smoked for at least 6 months prior to screening) and has not&#xD;
             used nicotine-containing products (example, nicotine patch) for 3 months prior to&#xD;
             screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of dysplastic melanocytic nevi or skin cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity, intolerance to UV/sunlight exposure, or any condition&#xD;
             associated with photosensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has Fitzpatrick skin type I, as determined by the investigator. A person with&#xD;
             Fitzpatrick skin type I typically has unexposed skin that is bright white with&#xD;
             frequent freckling, has blue/green eyes, and is of Northern European/British descent.&#xD;
             They typically burn, peel, and don't tan in response to ultraviolet B (UVB)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of chronic skin conditions, such as vitiligo, psoriasis, rosacea, severe&#xD;
             eczema, or atopic dermatitis, and/or severe acne that would complicate or preclude&#xD;
             evaluation of the minimal erythema dose (MED) testing and UVB challenge sites&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has used topical antibiotics or topical corticosteroids within 1 month prior to study&#xD;
             intervention administration and/or has a history of extensive and prolonged use&#xD;
             (greater than [&gt;] 3 months) of topical antibiotics or topical corticosteroids&#xD;
