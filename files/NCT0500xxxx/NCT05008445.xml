      This is an open label Phase I/II trial of LM-102 injection, a recombinant humanized&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody targeting Claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2). It is being tested in advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors including gastric cancer/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, Pancreatic Cancer,&#xD;

      This study includes phase I dose escalation and phase II dose expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I dose escalation consists of LM-102 monotherapy dose escalation (Part Ia) and LM-102&#xD;
      combination dose escalation (Part Ib):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part Ia is LM-102 monotherapy dose escalation, will be conducted among the subjects with&#xD;
      recurrent or refractory advanced solid tumors to determine the RP2D of LM-102&#xD;
      monotherapy;Statistical designs include an initial accelerated titration at the first dose&#xD;
      level followed by the i3+3 design at other four dose levels ; Part Ib is the dose escalation&#xD;
      of LM-102 combined with SOC, will be conducted in the subjects with advanced gastric and&#xD;
      gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma(GC/GEJ), pancreatic cancer (PC)and biliary tract&#xD;
      carcinoma(BTC), respectively in first setting or second setting, to explore the recommended&#xD;
      dose of LM-102 in combination SOC for dose expansion, 4 cohorts are planned;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II dose expansion consists of LM-102 monotherapy dose escalation (Part IIa) and LM-102&#xD;
      combination dose escalation (Part IIb):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part IIa is the dose expansion of LM-102 monotherapy, 3 cohorts are planned in the subjects&#xD;
      with CLDN18.2 positive, recurrent or refractory advanced GC/GEJ , PC , BTC , to explore the&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of LM-102 monotherapy in the target tumor types； Part IIb is the dose&#xD;
      expansion of LM-102 in combination with SOC, 4 cohorts are planned in the subjects with&#xD;
      advanced, CLDN18.2 positive, treatment naïve GC/GEJ, PC, BTC, and in the subjects with GC/GEJ&#xD;
      who have progressed on first line treatment, with the aim to to explore the preliminary&#xD;
