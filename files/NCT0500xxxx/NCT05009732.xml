  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an adaptive Phase III randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Proxalutamide (GT0918) in hospitalized adults diagnosed&#xD;
      with COVID-19. The study is a multicenter trial that will be conducted at approximately 80&#xD;
      sites globally. The study will compare GT0918 plus standard of care (SOC) with the placebo&#xD;
      plus SOC. Approximately 1030 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either GT0918 plus&#xD;
      SOC or placebo plus SOC group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in late 2019 and spread rapidly, resulting in a&#xD;
      global pandemic.SARS-CoV-2 encodes nonstructural and structural proteins required for its&#xD;
      viral life cycle. Among them, the spike glycoprotein plays a pivotal role in SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection by recognizing and attaching to ACE2 transmembrane protein on host cells. Kintor&#xD;
      protocol has been designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of GT0918 in hospitalized subjects&#xD;
      with COVID-19 illness. The target population of this study are hospitalized subjects with&#xD;
      COVID-19 illness with positive SARS-CoV-2 virus test within 72 hours of randomization. The&#xD;
      study will evaluate anti-androgen therapy may effectively prevent progression to the more&#xD;
      severe form of COVID-19 illness and death, shorten the time to sustained recovery and&#xD;
      decrease the mortality rate. This study plans to have around 1030 subjects in the US and&#xD;
      other countries/regions will be randomized for GT0918 and the placebo groups, the&#xD;
      randomization rate is 1:1. Subject will receive either GT0918 plus standard of care or&#xD;
      matched placebo plus standard of care. GT0918/placebo will be given 300mg orally once a day&#xD;
      around 30 minutes after meal for 14 days or until discharge per investigators' discretion&#xD;
      whichever occurs later, the safety follow up will be until Day 60 ± 3 days. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is time to sustained recovery by Day 30 and the key secondary endpoint is 30-day&#xD;
      mortality&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Total Abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;

                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal&#xD;
                       suppository;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had prior surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or&#xD;
                  without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study&#xD;
                  treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of&#xD;
                  the woman has been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on&#xD;
                  the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that&#xD;
                  subject;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable for a minimum&#xD;
                  of 3 months before taking study treatment. Women are considered post-menopausal&#xD;
                  and not of childbearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural&#xD;
                  (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age&#xD;
                  appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
                  oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks&#xD;
                  ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the&#xD;
                  woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment, is she considered&#xD;
                  not of childbearing potential;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Regardless of their fertility status, male subjects must agree to either remain&#xD;
             abstinent (if this is their preferred and usual lifestyle) or use condoms as well as&#xD;
             one additional highly effective method of contraception (less than 1% failure rate) or&#xD;
             effective method of contraception with nonpregnant women of childbearing potential&#xD;
             partners for the duration of the study and until 90 days after the last dose. A condom&#xD;
             is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the&#xD;
             drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Agree not to participate in another clinical trial for the treatment of COVID-19&#xD;
             through Day 60 after first dose.&#xD;
