  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, retrospective and prospective, non-controlled post market surveillance&#xD;
      study. The objectives of this study are to confirm safety, performance and clinical benefits&#xD;
      of the T.E.S.S.® Version 3 Anatomic and Reverse Modular Total shoulder prosthesis and its&#xD;
      instrumentation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The T.E.S.S.® (Total Evolutive Shoulder System) was developed to provide, with one&#xD;
      instrumentation, a complete solution for all indications for shoulder arthroplasty: centered&#xD;
      and eccentric rheumatoid osteoarthritis, necrosis, proximal fracture and mal-union of the&#xD;
      humeral head. The T.E.S.S.® Modular system can be used in anatomic or reverse configurations&#xD;
      with or without the use of a stem, providing a solution for hemi-arthroplasty, total shoulder&#xD;
      arthroplasty and revision. The same instrumentation allows implantation of all versions of&#xD;
      the T.E.S.S.®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 5 study centers will be involved in Europe. A total number of 146 implants, 73&#xD;
      T.E.S.S.® anatomic and 73 T.E.S.S.® reverse, will be included into the study. Each clinical&#xD;
      site will be allowed to enroll a maximum 88 patients (60% of the total study cohort). Ethics&#xD;
      Committee (EC) approval has to be obtained prior to conducting this study. All potential&#xD;
      subjects will be required to participate in an informed consent process and sign the EC&#xD;
      approved written informed consent prior to study enrollment.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Implant survival at 10 years</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The functional performance and clinical benefits will be determined by assessing the survival of the implant at 10 years using the Kaplan-Meier method. The survivorship of the implanted device will be recorded from the date of implantation to the date of revision or intended revision up to 10 years post-operatively.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency and incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The safety will be assessed by monitoring the frequency and incidence of adverse events.&#xD;
Adverse events will be collected in an Adverse Event Form, which gathers information on the date of occurrence, the nature of the adverse event, whether the device was involved, which treatment was used and the treatment outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Constant and Murley score</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The functional performance and clinical benefits will be assessed by the Constant and Murley score.&#xD;
The Constant Murley score is a 100-points scale composed of a number of individual parameters. These parameters define the level of pain and the ability to carry out the normal daily activities of the patient. The test is divided into four subscales: pain (15 points), activities of daily living (20 points), strength (25 points) and range of motion: forward elevation, external rotation, abduction and internal rotation of the shoulder (40 points). The higher the score, the higher the quality of the function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EQ-5D-5L questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The functional performance and clinical benefits will be evaluated by collecting the patient-filled EQ-5D-5L questionnaire.&#xD;
EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument for measuring the health-related quality of life, which assesses health status in terms of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each question has five levels of response (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems/unable to), which are singularly rated and then combined into a health status score, with higher scores indicating higher health utility. The second part of the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire consists of a visual analogue scale (VAS) on which the patient rates his/her perceived health from 0 (the worst imaginable health) to 100 (the best imaginable health).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiographic Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The functional performance and clinical benefit will be evaluated by analyzing the post-operative radiographic parameters (radiolucency, osteolysis, osteophytes, component migration and heterotopic ossification). At each post-operative follow-up visit, the radiographies will be evaluated and any finding will be collected in a Radiographic Evaluation Form.</description>
