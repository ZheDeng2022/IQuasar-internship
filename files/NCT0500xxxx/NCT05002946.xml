  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, 3-period, 3-treatment, randomized study will characterize the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and safety and tolerability of SP-104 under fasting and fed conditions as&#xD;
      compared to the pharmacokinetics of Naltrexone Hydrochloride Tablets, USP, 50 mg in healthy&#xD;
      adult subjects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will characterize the single-dose pharmacokinetics of naltrexone and metabolite (6&#xD;
      Beta-naltrexol) following administration of SP-104 compared to Naltrexone Hydrochloride&#xD;
      Tablets, USP, 50 mg in healthy adult subjects under fasting conditions. The study will also&#xD;
      characterize the effect of food intake on the pharmacokinetics of SP-104 in healthy adult&#xD;
      subjects. Additionally, the safety and tolerability of single doses of SP-104 under fed and&#xD;
      fasting conditions will be characterized.&#xD;

Subjects randomized to Treatment B will be fed a high-fat breakfast 30 minutes prior to dosing, SP-104 will be administered 30 minutes after start of the meal. No food will be allowed for at least 4 hours after the dose. Subjects randomized to Treatment C will fast at least 10 hours prior to and for at least 4 hours following dosing and will be treated with a single dose of Naltrexone Hydrochloride Tablet.
