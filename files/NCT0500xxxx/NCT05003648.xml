  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators recently observed that up to 25% of women with X-linked&#xD;
      adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) have moderate to severe Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS). In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators aim to estimate the prevalence of RLS among women with ALD and to&#xD;
      assess whether pramipexole improves RLS symptoms as well as sleep and gait measures in women&#xD;
      with ALD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the&#xD;
      ABCD1 peroxisomal half-transporter gene, resulting in accumulation of very long chain fatty&#xD;
      acids (VLCFAs). As ALD is an X-linked disease, women were previously considered asymptomatic&#xD;
      carriers. It is now known that even though adrenal insufficiency and cerebral disease occur&#xD;
      in less than 1% of women, more than 80% eventually develop progressive spinal cord disease.&#xD;
      Recently, the investigators observed that women are more frequently affected by movement&#xD;
      disorders independent of the demyelinating brain disease seen in men. In a pilot study, the&#xD;
      investigators found that up to 25% of women with ALD have moderate to severe Restless Leg&#xD;
      Syndrome (RLS). RLS is a movement disorder characterized by a powerful urge to move the legs,&#xD;
      usually accompanied by unpleasant dysesthesias, that is precipitated by rest, relieved by&#xD;
      movement, and most pronounced in the evening or at night. Dopamine agonists such as&#xD;
      pramipexole are efficacious and first-line FDA-approved treatments in low doses for primary&#xD;
      (i.e., idiopathic) RLS and have been shown to improve both the primary symptoms of RLS&#xD;
      (sensory discomfort, motor restlessness) as well as the associated sleep and quality of life&#xD;
      impairments in RLS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first phase of the study, the investigators will enroll 100 women with ALD at the two&#xD;
      participating sites (Massachusetts General Hospital and University Medical Center Amsterdam).&#xD;
      Participants will undergo structured phone interviews with both an expert in ALD and RLS to&#xD;
      assess the presence of probable or definite RLS. Participants with probable or definite RLS&#xD;
      will then undergo an additional phone call to determine RLS severity and assess eligibility&#xD;
      for the second phase of the study. The objective of the first phase of the study is to&#xD;
      determine the prevalence of RLS in women with ALD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase of the study will consist of a 4-month randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled cross over study to assess whether pramipexole improves RLS symptoms as&#xD;
      well as sleep and gait measures in women with ALD. The investigators will enroll 24 women&#xD;
      with ALD and moderate to severe RLS. Participants will first be randomized 1:1 to 0.125-0.5&#xD;
      mg pramipexole or placebo. After the first two months, a switch-over visit will take place&#xD;
      and include a battery of neurological assessments, walking measures, polysomnography, and&#xD;
      questionnaires. At this visit, the crossover from pramipexole to placebo and from placebo to&#xD;
      pramipexole will occur. The final study visit will occur 2 months after the switch-over visit&#xD;
      and all study assessments will be repeated.&#xD;
