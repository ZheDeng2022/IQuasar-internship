    <textblock>
      A hundred asymptomatic molar teeth with periapical lesions were treated in single versus&#xD;
      multiple visit root canal treatment. Half of the teeth were randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      one-visit (OV) group and received an additional final rinse with 2% CHX before obturation.&#xD;
      The other teeth were treated in two visits (TV) with calcium hydroxide dressing. All patients&#xD;
      were recalled and investigated clinically and radiographically for 48 months&#xD;

      The aim of the study was to evaluate the radiographic evidence of periapical healing in teeth&#xD;
      with apical periodontitis treated in a single visit with an additional final irrigation using&#xD;
      2% chlorhexidine and to compare the results with conventional multiple-visit root canal&#xD;
      treatment (RCT) with an intracanal calcium hydroxide dressing as a control group. 100&#xD;
      asymptomatic molar teeth with periapical lesions were treated using engine-driven&#xD;
      nickel-titanium (NiTi) instrumentation with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and 5%&#xD;
      ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as irrigants. Half of the teeth were randomly assigned&#xD;
      to the one-visit (OV) group and received an additional final rinse with 2% chlorhexidine&#xD;
      (CHX) before obturation. The other teeth were treated in two visits (TV), after completion of&#xD;
      root canal instrumentation calcium hydroxide paste was placed into the root canal and root&#xD;
      canal obturation was performed in second visit. All patients were recalled and investigated&#xD;
      clinically and radiographically for 48 months. Changes in apical bone density indicating&#xD;
      radiographic healing were evaluated.&#xD;
