  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 4 in the weekly average of the daily average Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain intensity scores.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 0-10 NRS consists in a single 11-point numeric scale, with 0 indicating no pain at all and 10 reflecting the worst pain imaginable.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) at Week 4 with reference to baseline status.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PGIC is a 7-point scale depicting a subject's rating of overall improvement. Subjects rate their change as &quot;very much improved,&quot; &quot;much improved,&quot; &quot;minimally improved,&quot; &quot;no change,&quot; &quot;minimally worse,&quot; &quot;much worse,&quot; or &quot;very much worse&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 4 in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) total score and individual subscale scores for pain, stiffness, and physical function.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis in knee joint during past 48 hours. Score range is 0 (no pain) to 20 (worst pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain.&#xD;
WOMAC physical function subscale is a 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to osteoarthritis in knee joint during past 48 hours. Score range is 0 to 68, where higher scores indicate worse function.&#xD;
WOMAC stiffness subscale is a 2-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of stiffness experienced due to osteoarthritis in knee joint during past 48 hours. Score range is 0 (minimum stiffness) to 8 (maximum stiffness).&#xD;
WOMAC Total score is the mean of WOMAC pain, physical function and stiffness subscale scores and ranges from 0 (no pain) to 96 (worst possible pain), where higher score indicates worse response.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of subjects who are responders as defined by 30% and 50% reduction from Baseline to Week 4 in the weekly average of the daily average NRS pain intensity scores</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 4 in weekly average of the daily worst NRS pain intensity scores.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 0-10 NRS consists in a single 11-point numeric scale, with 0 indicating no pain at all and 10 reflecting the worst pain imaginable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 4 in Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-sf).</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI-SF is a self-administered, validated tool for the assessment of severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions, location of pain, pain medications, and amount of pain relief in the last week. The BPI-SF uses a numeric rating scale (NRS) from 0 to 10, lower score denotes less severity and impact, higher score denotes more severity and impact.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 4 in 12-item Short Form Survey (SF-12).</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 is a 12-item health survey instrument that is used to evaluate the subject's physical, social, and mental well-being. Results are expressed in terms of 2 composite scores: the Physical Component Scale (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). PCS and MCS values can range from 0 to 100. Lowest scores mean very much below and highest scores mean very much above the general population average.</description>
