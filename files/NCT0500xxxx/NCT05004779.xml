      The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of combined treatment using nonablative&#xD;
      laser and human stem cell media (HSCM) on the regeneration of hypertrophic scars that&#xD;
      occurred after burns. Nonablative laser treatment was performed on 30 patients with&#xD;
      hypertrophic scars on both sides of the same part of the body. Immediately after the laser&#xD;
      treatment, the hypertrophic scars of right side to which HSCM was applied and the left side&#xD;
      with the same body position were defined as a control scar, and normal saline was applied.&#xD;
      Over the next 6 days, HSCM and moisturizer were applied on the scars of right side, and only&#xD;
      moisturizer was applied on the control scar of left side. Laser treatment was performed three&#xD;
      times on the hypertrophic scar at 4 weeks intervals. The skin test on hypertrophic scar was&#xD;
      evaluated before laser treatment and re-evaluated on the 7the day after the 3rd laser&#xD;
      treatment. The thickness was measured with a ultrasonic wave equipment (128 BW1 Medison,&#xD;
      Korea). Mexameter® (MX18, Courage-Khazaka Electronics GmbH, Germany) was used to measure&#xD;
      melanin levels and the severity of erythema. The higher values indicating a darker and redder&#xD;
      skin. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured with a Tewameter® (Courage-Khazaka&#xD;
      Electronic GmbH, Germany), which is used for evaluating water evaporation. Sebum in the scars&#xD;
      was measured with the Sebumeter® (Courage-Khazaka Electronic GmbH, Germany). The measurement&#xD;
      is based on the principle of grease-spot photometry using a cassette with its special tape. A&#xD;
      microprocessor calculates the result, which is shown on the display in μg/cm2. Elasticity was&#xD;
      measured using Cutometer SEM 580® (Courage-Khazaka Electronic GmbH, Cologne, Germany), which&#xD;
      applies negative pressure (450 mbar) on the skin. The numeric values (mm) of the skin's&#xD;
      distortion is presented as the elasticity (Table 1). Two seconds of negative pressure of 450&#xD;
      mbar is followed by 2 s of recess, and this consists of a complete cycle. Three measurement&#xD;
      cycles were conducted, and the average values were obtained. To evaluate the effect of HSCM,&#xD;
      investigators compared the skin test results (thickness, melanin, erythema, TEWL, sebum, and&#xD;
      skin elasticity levels) between the right side and control side, from baseline measures&#xD;
      immediately before the laser treatment and measures on the 7the day after the 3rd laser&#xD;
      treatment. Outcome measurements and data analyses were performed by a trained and blinded&#xD;
      outcome assessor who was not involved in the intervention. Possible complications (pain,&#xD;
      ecchymosis, skin abrasion, and swelling) were observed.&#xD;
