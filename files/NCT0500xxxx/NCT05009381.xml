  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of STYLAGE® XXL in augmenting&#xD;
      the chin volume among Chinese adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized either to the treatment group or the control group in a 4:1 ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
      The superiority of STYLAGE® XXL against no-treatment control in chin volume augmentation will&#xD;
      be verified together with assessments of the safety profiles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a no-treatment controlled, prospective, randomized, multi-center,&#xD;
      evaluator-blinded study, in Chinese subjects seeking for chin volume augmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      150 subjects will be randomized either to the treatment group or the control group in a 4:1&#xD;
      ratio (120 subjects in the treatment group and 30 subjects in the control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjets assigned to the treatment group will receive STYLAGE® XXL at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects assigned to the control group will not receive treatment at enrollment; however, at&#xD;
      6 month visit, subjects who are still eligible for chin augmentation with STYLAGE® XXL will&#xD;
      be treated&#xD;
&#xD;
      STYLAGE® XXL superiority will be demonstrated against no-treatment control in augmenting the&#xD;
      chin volume, as measured by blinded evaluator at 6-month&#xD;
