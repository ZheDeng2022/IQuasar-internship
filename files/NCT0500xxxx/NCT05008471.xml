  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will present an advanced equipment of tumor nutrition diagnosis and assesment for&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal cancer(NPC) radiotherapy patients in nutritional risk screening, evaluation,&#xD;
      diagnosis and directing nutritional intervention, aiming to explore the advantages of the&#xD;
      whole nutritional management in acute radiation reaction rate, completion rate of&#xD;
      radiotherapy, nutritional status, and quality of life for NPC patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, nutrition intervention was performed in one group of nasopharyngeal carcinoma&#xD;
      patients with no nutritional risk during the periperiod of radiotherapy , and the other group&#xD;
      with no additional intervention when without nutritional risks, for evaluating the value of&#xD;
      overall nutritional management in the periperiod radiotherapy.&#xD;

    <measure>Incidence of acute radiation reactions</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This study mainly includes oral mucosa mucositis, salivary glands injury induced by radiotherapy, laryngoesophageal mucositis referring to The 2020 Expert Consensus on the Standardized Management of Radiation Oncology for nutrition-related radiation injury responses.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of decline in quality of life scores（QOL）</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is measured by a standard QOL table,including 12 questions.Each question is 5 points,so there are 60 points and 5 grades(51-60 points, 41-50 points, 31-40 points, 21-30 points,&lt;20 points).A higher score is a better life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-rating Anxiety screening Scale（GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A GAD-7 table would estimate one's anxiety according to the emotion of the past two weeks,including 9 questions and 27 points totally.There are 4 grades of anxiety, a LOWER score means a normal mind state. Actually,0-4 points is/are no anxiety.5-9 points represent slight anxiety .10-14 are in moderate anxiety.15-27 are severe anxiety,respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-rating Scale for Depression Screening (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A PHQ-9 table is a simplified Scale for Depression Screening,it would estimate one's depression emotion according to the mind of the past two weeks,including 9 questions and 27 points totally.There are 4 grades of depression, a LOWER score is equal to a GOOD mind.Actually,0-4 points is/are no depression.5-9 are depressed but not obvious.10-14 are in obvious depression.15-27 are severe depression,respectively.</description>

    <description>The target energy of radiotherapy patients is recommended to be 25-30kcal/(kg·d), and the target energy of the intervention group should be increased by an additional 50% daily from the beginning of radiotherapy. Specifically, under the condition of ensuring the daily target energy 14kcal/(kg·d), formula nutrition should be added daily.</description>
