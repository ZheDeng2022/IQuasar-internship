  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Prolonged mechanical ventilation (MV) exposes patients to increased risk of&#xD;
      infection and mortality. A weaning protocol (WP) reduces the duration of MV. However, these&#xD;
      protocols remain complicated to implement in clinical practice. These considerations led to&#xD;
      the development of automated weaning systems (AWS) which are expensive and limited to expert&#xD;
      centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scope of the problem: AWS are not yet the standard care because evidence of AWS benefit is&#xD;
      weak and several unanswered questions remain regarding their roles in weaning. There is a&#xD;
      need for building new ways to improve WP. Indeed, medical staff's compliance with a daily&#xD;
      screening of patients to wean is low. Moreover, modifications in ventilator settings require&#xD;
      the availability of physicians at bedside and are rarely modified on a daily basis. This&#xD;
      leads to impaired weaning process and prolonged MV for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acknowledge gap: Capnography (CAP) has been validated for intubation procedures and&#xD;
      integrated into AWS. Some studies encouraging use of CAP have shown an optimization of MV, a&#xD;
      decrease of unnecessary arterial blood gas without impacting patients' prognosis. However,&#xD;
      the role of CAP in WP in intensive care units (ICU) has not been assessed so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A nurse driven WP based on CAP may improve accuracy of weaning procedures at&#xD;
      bedside. Such protocol might be easy to apply in daily practice and could reduce both the&#xD;
      duration of MV and its related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a prospective, bi-center, pilot study to assess the feasibility of a new&#xD;
      nurses managed WP based on capnography among patients requiring more of 48 hours of MV.&#xD;
      Enrollment of 100 consecutive patients in two ICU of the universitary hospital in Reims. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint is the protocol compliance. Secondary endpoints are: capacity to performed a&#xD;
      weaning (time to first extubation, total duration of MV...) caregivers' acceptance and&#xD;
      feelings regarding the protocol, a safety evaluation with report of hospital mortality,&#xD;
      ventilator associated-pneumonia, autoextubation, length of stay and the number of&#xD;
      ABG/patient/day during the study period. Inclusion critera: all patients on MV for more than&#xD;
      48 hours and stabilization of the ICU entry pathology. Exclusion critera: Patients with&#xD;
      severe neuropathy, cardiopathy or pulmonary disease. Weaning protocol begins when the&#xD;
      following criteria are present: PEEP ≤ 8 cmH2O, PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≥150 (mmHg) or SaO2 ≥ 90%&#xD;
      with FiO2 ≤ 0.5. The final criterion for study entry is successful completion of a 30-min&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing test (SBT) using pressure support (PS) (max 30 cmH2O). After a&#xD;
      successful test, nurse reduces PS by 2 mmHg every 3 hours and the FIO2 as long as the patient&#xD;
      remains in his comfort zone defined as: FR 12-30/min, VT ≥ 6ml/kg and ETCO2 ≤ 55 mmHg (≤65&#xD;
      mmHg for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients). A scale allows FIO2 and PEEP&#xD;
      to be titrated with an oxygen saturation between 90% and 98% (92% for COPD). Nurses recorded&#xD;
      every 3 hours ventilatory, hemodynamic, sedation parameters and modifications. At any time&#xD;
      physicians can return to the previous settings if the patient is leaving the comfort zone.&#xD;
      SBT are conducted when a minimum level of PS and PEEP is reached, 7cmH20 and 5cmH20&#xD;
      respectively. SBT performed using a T piece with or no oxygen for 30-120 min. If a patient&#xD;
      passes a successful SBT and meets extubation criteria, he is extubed. Extubation and SBT&#xD;
      protocols are performed according to French guidelines SFAR/SRLF. Nevertheless, extubation&#xD;
      always remains the decision of the attending physician. Protocols continue until successful&#xD;
      extubation (at least 48 hours of unassisted spontaneous breathing), ICU death, ICU discharge&#xD;
      or until day 90 after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interests and Scientific impacts: For patients, a potential reduction of VM duration and its&#xD;
      associated-complications. For caregivers, a more efficient WP and a better optimization of&#xD;
      workload. This pilot study will be a step before to investigate larger studies to compare our&#xD;
      WP to standard care.&#xD;
