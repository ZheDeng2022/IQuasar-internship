    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, phase II study of irinotecan liposome injection in patients with&#xD;
      advanced biliary tract cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetics of irinotecan liposome injection in patients with advanced biliary tract&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, parallel, multicentre, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of irinotecan liposome injection. Eligible patients will be divided into two cohorts&#xD;
      according to the criteria for the corresponding cohort. The patients in cohort 1 will receive&#xD;
      irinotecan liposome injection combined with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and Leucovorin (LV). The&#xD;
      patients in cohort 2 will receive irinotecan liposome injection combined with a PD-1&#xD;
      inhibitor, 5-Fluorouracil and Leucovorin.&#xD;
