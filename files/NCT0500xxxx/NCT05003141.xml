      Product: PSB202 is a novel biological entity consisting of two engineered monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, an Fc-enhanced humanized type II anti-CD20 IgG1 (PSB102) and a humanized&#xD;
      anti-CD37 IgG1 (PSB107), that target B-cells. PSB202 is manufactured to work as a single&#xD;
      product with the two components of PSB202 enabling a distinct dual target-specific antibody&#xD;
      directed cell killing of B-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study: Multi-center-, International Phase 1a/1b (Escalation/Expansion) study in patients with&#xD;
      indolent-, relapsed-, B-cell malignancies. The Phase 1a (Dose Escalation) part of study&#xD;
      follows a 3+3 design.&#xD;

      Study: Multi-center-, International Phase 1a/1b (Escalation/Expansion) study in patients with&#xD;
      indolent-, relapsed-, CD20+ and CD37+ expressing B-cell malignancies. Phase 1a (Dose&#xD;
      Escalation) portion of study follows 3+3 design. Phase 1b (Expansion) enrolls with up to 20&#xD;
      patients in each one of 3 disease-specific cohorts: (1) FL; (2) CLL/SLL, and (3) a mixed&#xD;
      indolent B-cell histology cohort comprising WM, indolent phenotype MCL, and MZL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives for Phase 1a are Safety (DLT) and establishing a recommended Phase 1b&#xD;
      dose. Primary objective for Phase 1b is establishing preliminary evidence of an anti-lymphoma&#xD;
      response in each of the 3 Expansion cohorts, as determined by ORR.&#xD;

             failed or intolerant to standard of care therapies;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Relapsed/refractory following at least 2 prior lines of standard of care treatment.&#xD;
             Prior treatments received must be documented on the enrollment request form. For FL,&#xD;

&#xD;
             Phase 1b - Dose Expansion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Histologically confirmed CD20+ expression. For CD37+, if unavailable from the chart at&#xD;
             screening, CD37+ expression may be documented from a new or archived blood specimen&#xD;
             after enrollment.&#xD;

             morbidity from accelerated disease progression or &quot;flare&quot; when treatment is&#xD;
             discontinued prior to the initiation of subsequent effective therapy. Absent residual&#xD;
             toxicity and with documented Medical Monitor approval, such patients may receive study&#xD;

             for anti-cytokine therapy, residual symptoms of neurotoxicity &gt; Grade 1, or ongoing&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Active graft versus host disease (GVHD, including resultant from any prior solid organ&#xD;
             transplants, if received), or ongoing immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;

             treatment for CNS involvement who are neurologically stable and without evidence of&#xD;
             active CNS-disease may be eligible if a clinical rationale is provided by the&#xD;
             Investigator and with documented Sponsor approval&#xD;

             to Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt; 450 milliseconds (ms) (males) or &gt; 470 ms (females)&#xD;
             obtained from three ECGs; uncontrolled arrhythmia &lt; 3 months of study screening.&#xD;
             Patients with rate-controlled arrhythmias may be eligible for study entry at&#xD;
             discretion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         31. Active uncontrolled systemic bacterial, viral, fungal or parasitic infection (except&#xD;
             for fungal nail infection), or other clinically significant active disease process&#xD;
             which in the opinion of the Investigator and the Sponsor makes it undesirable for the&#xD;
             patient to participate in the trial. Screening for chronic conditions is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
         32. Tested positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is excluded (due to potential&#xD;
             drug-drug interactions between anti-retroviral medications and PSB202 and risk of&#xD;

             anti-HBs/HBcAb (+) without detectable HBV-DNA are eligible. Subjects with a history of&#xD;
             Hepatitis C and have received successful curative treatment are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;

             &lt; 2 years prior to screening except hypothyroidism, vitiligo, Grave's disease,&#xD;
             Hashimoto's disease, or Type I diabetes. Patients with childhood asthma or atopy that&#xD;
             has not been active in the 2 years prior to study screening are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         36. History of drug-induced liver injury or cirrhosis&#xD;
&#xD;
         37. History of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease&#xD;
&#xD;
         38. Patients with significant medical diseases or conditions, as assessed by the&#xD;
             Investigator and Sponsor, that would substantially increase the risk-benefit ratio of&#xD;
