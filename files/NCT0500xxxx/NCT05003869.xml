    <textblock>
      TCRA is an important surgical method to restore normal menstrual cycle and improve the&#xD;
      outcome of pregnancy.However, postoperative intrauterine adhesion, uterine cavity deformation&#xD;
      and difficulty in normal intimal growth seriously affect the efficacy of surgery. A large&#xD;
      number of existing studies have shown that even after surgical treatment, women with a&#xD;
      history of IUA are still at a reproductive disadvantage.Whether scar tissue plays a role in&#xD;
      these influencing factors? At present, there is a variety of surgical methods, and there is&#xD;
      no clear guideline consensus on how to deal with intrauterine scar tissue during surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Intrauterine adhesions (IUA) are pathological symptoms of endometrial basal layer damage,&#xD;
      fibrous tissue formation and tissue bridge between uterine walls caused by a variety of&#xD;
      reasons.In recent years, with the increase of uterine operations such as hysterotomy and&#xD;
      cesarean section, the incidence of IUA has been increasing year by year.IUA is mainly&#xD;
      manifested by reduced menstrual volume, amenorrhea, recurrent abortion, infertility and&#xD;
      abnormal implantation of embryos, etc., which poses a great threat to the health and quality&#xD;
      of life of patients.Transcervieal resection of adhesions (TCRA) is a targeted method to&#xD;
      separate intrauterine adhesions under direct vision and basically restore the morphology of&#xD;
      the intrauterine cavity. It is an important surgical method to improve the pregnancy&#xD;
      outcome.However, a large number of existing studies have shown that women with a history of&#xD;
      IUA remain at a reproductive disadvantage even after surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the current situation, the investigators have designed this topic, to conduct a&#xD;
      study on TCRA intraoperative scar tissue to remove the necessity of clinical and basic&#xD;
      research, explore the scar tissue resection or not for the clinical curative effect and the&#xD;
      effect of combined tissue morphology, molecular biology research, for TCRA intraoperative how&#xD;
      to deal with the scar tissue provide a certain amount of practice and theory basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estrogen receptor (e-r) and progesterone receptor (P - R) is located in the nucleus, when the&#xD;
      receptor and hormones to form complexes, again in the form of activation combined into&#xD;
      specific areas of the chromosome, gene activation, synthesis of new DNA transcription, and&#xD;
      synthesis of new proteins, through the biological function of protein regulating cell growth&#xD;
      and metabolism.Specifically, they participate in the reconstruction and regeneration of&#xD;
      endometrial blood vessels and cells.The number and functional status of hormone receptors&#xD;
      determine the local levels of estrogen and progesterone that can exert biological effects. If&#xD;
      the expression of E-R and P-R is reduced or the function is abnormal, the sensitivity and&#xD;
      reactivity of endometrium to hormones will be directly reduced, and the endometrial growth&#xD;
      will be affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of IUA is mainly based on direct separation of the adhesive tissue,&#xD;
      supplemented by the corresponding hormone or cytokine therapy.Among them, estrogen is widely&#xD;
      used.On the one hand, it plays a corresponding role by binding with receptors; on the other&#xD;
      hand, it affects the fibrinogen and extracellular matrix deposition by regulating the&#xD;
      expression of TGF-β or MMP-9, thus participating in the occurrence of intrauterine adhesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have found that there is a certain correlation between transforming growth factor-β1&#xD;
      (TGF-β1) and the pathogenesis of IUA. TGF-β1 is a kind of cytokine that is synthesized and&#xD;
      secreted by lymphocytes, macrophages, platelets and other cells and can regulate cell growth&#xD;
      and differentiation, belonging to the TGF family.It can promote tissue fibrosis and&#xD;
      extracellular matrix production, and can increase the amount of fibronectin and&#xD;
      collagen.However, a number of studies have confirmed that inhibiting the expression of TGF-β1&#xD;
      or reducing its activity can effectively reduce the degree of fibrosis in liver, kidney and&#xD;
      other tissues.&#xD;
