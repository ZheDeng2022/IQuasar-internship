      This study is a multi-centered, pragmatic clinical trial that compares the comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatment and pharmacological treatment for non-acute&#xD;
      lumbar disc herniation. The participants who voluntarily signed informed consent will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned in 1:2 ratio to non-pharmacological group and pharmacological group and&#xD;
      will receive the 8 weeks of intervention.&#xD;
