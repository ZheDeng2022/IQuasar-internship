&#xD;
          1. Provision of signed and dated written informed consent prior to any study-specific&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Patients who have previously received a BTK inhibitor in any line of therapy must have&#xD;
             received only 1 BTK inhibitor-containing regimen and must have received treatment with&#xD;

             inhibitor as monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer agents are eligible&#xD;
             for the study if they meet any of the following criteria: discontinued the previous&#xD;
             BTK inhibitor due to disease progression, experienced disease progression after&#xD;

             toxicity or intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Measurable disease by radiographic assessment or serum IgM level (WM only)&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior malignancy (other than the disease under study) within the past 2 years, except&#xD;

             carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast, or localized Gleason score ≤ 6 prostate&#xD;
             cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Requires ongoing systemic treatment for any other malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Requires ongoing systemic (defined as ≥ 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent)&#xD;
             corticosteroid treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Current or history of central nervous system involvement including the brain, spinal&#xD;
             cord, leptomeninges, and cerebrospinal fluid (as documented by imaging, cytology, or&#xD;
             biopsy) by B-cell malignancy, regardless of whether patient had received treatment for&#xD;
             central nervous system disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known active plasma cell neoplasm, prolymphocytic leukemia, blastoid-variant MCL,&#xD;
             T-cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related&#xD;
