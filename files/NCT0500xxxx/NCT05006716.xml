             inhibitor as monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer agents are eligible&#xD;
             for the study if they meet any of the following criteria: discontinued the previous&#xD;
             BTK inhibitor due to disease progression, experienced disease progression after&#xD;

             carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast, or localized Gleason score ‚â§ 6 prostate&#xD;
             cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Requires ongoing systemic treatment for any other malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Requires ongoing systemic (defined as ‚â• 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent)&#xD;
             corticosteroid treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Current or history of central nervous system involvement including the brain, spinal&#xD;
             cord, leptomeninges, and cerebrospinal fluid (as documented by imaging, cytology, or&#xD;
             biopsy) by B-cell malignancy, regardless of whether patient had received treatment for&#xD;
             central nervous system disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known active plasma cell neoplasm, prolymphocytic leukemia, blastoid-variant MCL,&#xD;
             T-cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related&#xD;
