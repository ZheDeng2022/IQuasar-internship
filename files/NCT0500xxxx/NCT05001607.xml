  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dr. Purdy has developed a novel bronchial blocker device that has multiple applications. In&#xD;
      this project, a simulation model of massive pulmonary hemorrhage in an adolescent intubating&#xD;
      manikin will be used to compare the novel method against 3 published methods of lung&#xD;
      isolation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To compare a novel airway device in a realistic adolescent airway model of massive&#xD;
      pulmonary hemorrhage to three standard methods of lung isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The novel method will be as fast or faster than traditional methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: Lung isolation in massive pulmonary hemorrhage is associated with mortality&#xD;
      rates as high as 40%. Current methods of lung isolation are challenging and have a number of&#xD;
      limitations. The development of this novel device was a response to the limitations of&#xD;
      current solutions and could significantly increase the speed and ease of placing a bronchial&#xD;
      blocker under these circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: (1) To determine the length of time required for successful lung isolation in&#xD;
      each of the four methods trialed. (2) To determine the length of time required for intubation&#xD;
      in each of the four methods trialed. (3) To describe challenges in each method within the&#xD;
      scenario of massive pulmonary hemorrhage. (4) To assess the utility of the model of massive&#xD;
      pulmonary hemorrhage in future simulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design: We propose a within-subject randomized procedure evaluation study comparing&#xD;
      the placement of a novel bronchial blocker with three standard methods of lung isolation in a&#xD;
      massive pulmonary hemorrhage simulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Mixed effects model will be used to test the difference in total time to lung&#xD;
      isolation between the novel method and the other three methods, with the subject as the&#xD;
      random variable. If normality and homogeneity assumptions of the mixed-effects model are not&#xD;
      fulfilled, then the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test would be used to compare the&#xD;
      novel method to each of the other methods. Time constraints are placed on completion of a&#xD;
      task, as such, we will complete sensitivity analysis where we include all participants in the&#xD;
      analysis compared to excluding those that were unable to complete at least 1 method.&#xD;

    <description>Responses on post-study questionnaire for future utility of the model in simulations, based on the Lung Isolation Techniques Simulation Training Evaluation Questionnaire (LITSTEQ) developed by Failor and colleagues (2014) https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jvca.2013.07.015, modified to specify training for massive pulmonary hemorrhage.&#xD;
Graded on a Likert scale of 1-5; 1 - Strongly disagree, 2 - Disagree, 3 - Neutral, 4 - Agree, 5 - Strongly Agree. Higher scores relate to a more positive outcome in assessing the utility of using the simulation model for massive pulmonary hemorrhage training.</description>
