    <textblock>
      Aging of the population is dramatically increasing the number of hospitalized patients, with&#xD;
      the consequent challenges of limited medical personnel and resources in hospitals. Wireless&#xD;
      technologies that create highly connected healthcare environments are developed to help&#xD;
      hospitals address these issues, once these technologies are perfectly integrated in the&#xD;
      hospital environment with respect to IT infrastructure for big data storage. Such devices&#xD;
      have proven remarkable efficiencies in monitoring patients with high patient safety, data&#xD;
      accuracy and security, which are essential to provide high quality patient care, reduce&#xD;
      health-related costs and optimize the management of high numbers of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cough is the most common condition that results in a visit to the physician. Often coughs are&#xD;
      benign, but sometimes can be the sign of exacerbations of a chronic respiratory disease.&#xD;
      Exacerbations are defined in the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease&#xD;
      (GOLD) document &quot;as an acute event characterised by a worsening of the patient's respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms that is beyond normal day-to-day variations and leads to a change in medication&quot;. It&#xD;
      is assumed that, if coughs were remotely monitored, hospitals might be unburdened, patients&#xD;
      would be empowered to self-manage their health, and that prevention of serious respiratory&#xD;
      diseases might be facilitated, thus improving health outcomes. Unfortunately, remote&#xD;
      monitoring for cough that rely on self-reporting is impractical, as patients do not record&#xD;
      data very reliably. On the contrary, a microphone on the bedside table connected to a medical&#xD;
      data analysis platform might monitor patients' cough exacerbations at night and alert the&#xD;
      medical staff immediately.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical study is designed as a prospective observational pilot study to evaluate the&#xD;
      reliability of a microphone and data analysis platform to monitor coughs in hospitalized&#xD;
      patients with respiratory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Calibration phase: to determine the degree of coughs' homogeneity between patients. The&#xD;
           control source of data will be a polygraph to record cough events and movements.&#xD;
           Polygraphy is the conventional method currently used to analyse night coughing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the end of the calibration period, the data generated by the device will be analysed&#xD;
           to determine if the coughs are homogeneous or heterogeneous, according to patient&#xD;
           follow-up and polygragh outcomes. The degree of homogeneity will allow establishing the&#xD;
           correct number of patients to be followed in the interventional phase (estimated 20&#xD;
           patients) and to set a threshold to define when there is an exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Observational phase: to collect data in about 20 patients from sources, namely the&#xD;
           microphone and the polygraph in the patient's room. Data will be collected in parallel&#xD;
           by the two systems during two consecutive nights for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data analysis phase: to correlate microphone and polygraph signals. These results will&#xD;
           be reported in a format provided by the device supplier. Subsequently, specialized&#xD;
           engineers will correlate the polygraph results with the microphone's signals. .&#xD;

    <measure>Measurement of the clinical performance and accuracy of the microphone and of the analysis platform to detect coughs</measure>
    <time_frame>2 nights</time_frame>
    <description>The microphone signal is recorded by a micro-computer and treated by the algorithm of the analysis platform developped by the company VNV. The aim of this algorithm is to discriminate events of cough in the signal.&#xD;
To measure the accuracy of the algorithm, we will compare the results obtained by the analysis plateform with a polygraph which is the classical way to measure night cough. The microphone of the polygraph placed on the patient chest will control if the events are due to patients coughs or patient movements.&#xD;
The 2 devices (microphone and polygraph) will be recording patients during 2 consecutive nights.&#xD;
Unit of measurement will be the number of cough events.</description>
