      Zinc deficiency in children is a major problem which leads to compromised immunity and&#xD;
      accordingly repeated infections. This study aims to investigate the effect of supplementing&#xD;
      zinc to decrease the incidence of diarrhea and respiratory illness in children between 6&#xD;
      months and 5 years in Paediatric Outpatient Clinic in Ain Shams University Hospital.&#xD;

      Zinc is a trace element that plays essential roles in protein and lipid metabolism, cell&#xD;
      growth and differentiation, and the immune system; either cellular or humoral immunity. There&#xD;
      is no specialized zinc storage system in the body, accordingly, a daily intake of zinc is&#xD;
      required to maintain a steady state. Zinc deficiency can cause compromised immune function,&#xD;
      accordingly this can lead to infections and growth defects among young children According to&#xD;
      literature review search, there is lack of studies on the preventive effect of zinc&#xD;
      supplementation on Egyptian children less than five years old; the age group which is known&#xD;
      by the suboptimal nutritional status and the high prevalence of infection. Accordingly, the&#xD;
      present study is aiming to evaluate the impact of 4 months of daily zinc supplementation on&#xD;
      the incidence of diarrhea and respiratory illness and to detect the frequency of daily&#xD;
      dietary intake of zinc-rich food children between 6 months and 5 years in Paediatric&#xD;
      Outpatient Clinic in Ain Shams University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the impact of 4 months of daily zinc supplementation on:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - the incidence and the severity of diarrheal morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - the incidence of acute respiratory infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure the level of serum zinc in children between 6 months and 5 years attending&#xD;
           Paediatric Outpatient Clinic in Ain Shams University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare between children who had initially low serum zinc level with those with&#xD;
           normal level as regard the reduction in the incidence of diarrhea and respiratory&#xD;
           illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To measure the frequency of daily dietary intake of zinc-rich food in children between 6&#xD;
           months and 5 years attending Paediatric Outpatient Clinic in Ain Shams University&#xD;
           Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Study type: a single blinded, randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Study setting: Paediatric Outpatient Clinic in Ain Shams University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sampling method:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A convenience sample of children between 6 months and 5 years was recruited from the&#xD;
           Paediatric Outpatient Clinic in Ain Shams University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Study population: Eligible children aged between 6 months and 5 years attending&#xD;
           Paediatric Outpatient Clinic in Ain Shams University Hospital was included.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization and allocation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Random assignment of the sampled children to either the study group receiving zinc or&#xD;
           the control group receiving placebo was done. The study was single-blinded, where the&#xD;
           children's mothers won't know either their children are enrolled in the study group or&#xD;
           the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Study tool:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Baseline questionnaire: Structured interview questionnaire was used at the first&#xD;
           meeting with the mother to collect baseline data. The questionnaire includes baseline&#xD;
           characteristics, such as child age, child sex, family size, child rank, child feeding&#xD;
           practices (breastfeeding), maternal literacy, vaccination history and birth weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Also, the baseline questionnaire assessed the occurrence and duration of diarrhea and&#xD;
           respiratory illness in the past month before the start of zinc supplementation.&#xD;
           Questions are adopted from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) questionnaire&#xD;
           (Ministry of Health and Population/Egypt, 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Questionnaire for Zinc-Rich Food Intake Pattern:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The questionnaire, a dietary history recall instrument, was used to elicit and capture&#xD;
           information on frequency of daily dietary intake over previous 1 month of two categories&#xD;
           of zinc-rich foods namely:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Foods of animal origin devoid of zinc antinutritional factor (liver, fish, milk,&#xD;
                eggs)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Food of vegetable origin including those known to contain a zinc antinutritional&#xD;
                factor (cereals, beans)&#xD;
&#xD;
                - Serum zinc: A blood sample was collected from all included children at the&#xD;
                beginning of the study to estimate the baseline serum zinc level. Venous blood&#xD;
                samples (about 4 milliliters) were collected in heparinised tubes and transported&#xD;
                to the laboratory for centrifugation and serum zinc estimation using atomic&#xD;
                absorption spectrophotometer graphites.&#xD;
&#xD;
                - Intervention: The children were randomized to receive daily zinc sulphate or&#xD;
                placebo. The elemental zinc dose was 3 mg/ day to children whose weight is less&#xD;
                than 10 kg and 7 mg/ day to children whose weight is 10 kg or more. This dose is&#xD;
                more than the recommended dietary allowance for supplementation so as to allow for&#xD;
                possible impairment in absorption of ingested zinc among children as a result of&#xD;
                consumption of a predominantly phytate-rich cereal-based diet, bacterial&#xD;
                overgrowth, and protozoal or parasitic infestations. At the same time the dose&#xD;
                won't exceed the upper tolerable level for zinc (World Health Organization and Food&#xD;
                and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
           One bottle that contained 150 mL was kept in the child's home and replaced monthly. The&#xD;
           placebo was non-nutritious and vitamin-free, designed to be identical to the zinc syrup&#xD;
           in colour, odour, and taste.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Follow up: Each month, during the child visit to the Paediatric Outpatient Clinic, or&#xD;
           through a telephone call, the mother was asked certain questions regarding the&#xD;
           occurrence and duration of diarrhea and respiratory illness in the past month. Questions&#xD;
           are adopted from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) questionnaire (Ministry of&#xD;
           Health and Population/Egypt, 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Pre- and posttreatment anthropometric parameters (weight and length\ height&#xD;
           measurements) were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Nutritional status was assessed by measuring weight and height using standard methods&#xD;
           and calculating weight for-age and weight-for-height Z scores. Weight was measured to&#xD;
           nearest 100 gm using an electronic scale.&#xD;
