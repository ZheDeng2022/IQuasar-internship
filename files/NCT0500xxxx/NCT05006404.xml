  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, single-arm, multi-center study to evaluate safety and preliminary effectiveness&#xD;
      of the Autus Size-Adjustable Valve in pediatric patients aged 2 to 10 years (± 6 months)&#xD;
      requiring surgical pulmonary valve replacement. The Autus Valve may be expanded pre-implant&#xD;
      to match the subject's body size. Subjects will be evaluated prior to the Autus Valve implant&#xD;
      procedure, immediately post-implant, at hospital discharge, 30 days, 6 and 12 months, and&#xD;
      annually through 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Autus Valve may be expanded post-implant via transcatheter balloon dilation to&#xD;
      accommodate growth of the subject. In subjects who undergo a post-implant valve expansion,&#xD;
      follow-up will continue for a minimum of 1 year after the post-implant valve expansion&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
