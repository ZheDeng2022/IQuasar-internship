  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous patients are addressed to the Emergency Department for unspecific symptoms which can&#xD;
      evoke a stroke, such as vertigo, isolated motor deficit, behavior disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these patients, when they arrive out of time for specific treatments such as thrombolysis&#xD;
      and thrombectomy, the cerebral imagery is not an emergency, but necessary to confirm or&#xD;
      invalidate the diagnostic of stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a biomarker could exclude the diagnostic of stroke, we could avoid an imagery for these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PS100B is a biomarker whose blood level increases in case of stroke. It has already proven a&#xD;
      prognostic value. Until now, it hasn't proven a diagnostic value because it take a few hours&#xD;
      to increase in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It could have in prognostic value for patients who have the symptoms for more than 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STROkE is a diagnostic, prospective, monocentric study, conducted at University Hospital&#xD;
      Center of Poitiers (France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to determine the value of PS100B to exclude the diagnostic of a stroke in case of&#xD;
      evocative symptoms, for patients who are out of delay for a thrombolysis or a thrombectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients eligible are the ones who present to the emergency department with symptoms&#xD;
      evocative of stroke for more than 24 hours and less than 4 days. Patients included have a&#xD;
      sample of blood withdrawn, in order to measure PS100B blood level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic of stroke is than confirmed or excluded by an adjudication comity, who are&#xD;
      unaware of the result of PS100B blood level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic value of PS100B is determined with the help of a ROC curve.&#xD;

analogic scale from 0 to 100 (0 = worst health perception ; 100 = best health perception)</description>
