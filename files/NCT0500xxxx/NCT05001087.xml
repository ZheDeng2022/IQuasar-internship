  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this observational study is the creation of a national multiple myeloma registry&#xD;
      to monitor the current routine clinical practice in Italy and describe the standard of care&#xD;
      adopted for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with multiple myeloma in the different&#xD;
      Italian hematology centers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Italy, myeloma accounts for 1.3% of all tumour diagnoses in males and for 1.2% of all&#xD;
      tumour diagnoses in women. The incidence is 9.5 new cases per 100,000 males and 8.1 cases per&#xD;
      100,000 females. Median age at diagnosis is 68 years and approximately 2% of patients&#xD;
      experience onset before the age of 4011. Therefore is to establish a national disease&#xD;
      registry to monitor current routine clinical practice in Italy and to describe the standard&#xD;
      of care adopted for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with myeloma. National registries&#xD;
      have already been established in some countries and a recently-published meta-analysis&#xD;
      highlighted certain differences in treatment, survival and the demographic characteristics of&#xD;
      patients. An Italian national registry is important for analysing the current situation, in&#xD;
      order to deal with the changes that lie ahead. In addition to the standard epidemiological&#xD;
      registry - as described in the statistical methods section - a patientpowered registry (PPR)&#xD;
      will also be established to encourage patient participation.&#xD;

    <description>Non-interventional, multicentre, retrospective and prospective registry. In order to increase the sample size and the validity of the Registry, patients who were diagnosed with myeloma since 1st January 2019 will also be included retrospectively, once their informed consent has been obtained by the enrolling centre. Being a registry, patients will be enrolled consecutively according to their appointments at the centre, at the discretion of their doctor and only once the patient has signed the informed consent form.&#xD;
Also patients participating in interventional or other observational studies can be enrolled. In case of patients enrolled in interventional trials, only baseline and survival data can be collected for the period in with the patient is in interventional trial.&#xD;
The data will be collected using an electronic data capture (EDC) platform. Hospital visits are planned every 6 months.</description>

        The registry will include approximately 30 Italian haematology facilities. On the basis of&#xD;
        the centres' enrolment capacity and incidence and epidemiology data it is reasonable to&#xD;
        presume that at least 1900 patients will be enrolled in 3 years. Only patients who meet the&#xD;
        eligibility criteria will be included in the registry.&#xD;
