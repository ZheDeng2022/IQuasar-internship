  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are different microbial communities on the surface of human body (skin, hair, nails,&#xD;
      etc.) and in the cavity connected with the outside world. The human microbiota is the general&#xD;
      term of the genetic information of microorganisms that coexist with human beings and cause&#xD;
      various diseases under certain conditions. The results of human microbial genome analysis&#xD;
      show that the microbial communities in different parts of the human body and different&#xD;
      individuals have amazing diversity, some of which play an important role in human health, and&#xD;
      some are closely related to diseases. Female lower genital tract infection is often&#xD;
      associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and bacterial vaginosis (BV), such as&#xD;
      cervical and vaginal precancerous lesions, cancer, condyloma acuminatum and other sexually&#xD;
      transmitted diseases (STD). Persistent infection of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV)&#xD;
      is closely related to the occurrence of invasive cervical cancer. New evidence suggests that&#xD;
      vaginal microbiota composition is different in women with HR-HPV infection and high-grade&#xD;
      cervical lesions. The increase of the severity of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is&#xD;
      related to the decrease of the relative abundance of vaginal Lactobacillus. In addition to&#xD;
      vaginal microbes, the powerful intestinal flora is considered to be the &quot;invisible organ&quot; of&#xD;
      the human body. There is a dynamic and balanced interaction network between intestinal&#xD;
      microorganisms and human immune cells. Once the intestinal flora is out of balance, the&#xD;
      changes in species, quantity, proportion, location and biological characteristics will cause&#xD;
      a series of inflammatory reactions and immune system diseases, and even lead to cancer. Some&#xD;
      studies have shown that there is a potential relationship between intestinal microorganisms&#xD;
      and vaginal microorganisms. Recent research evidence suggests that the mutually beneficial&#xD;
      relationship between oral bacteria and other vaginal bacteria supports the colonization of&#xD;
      pathogens and may help maintain the characteristics of vaginal flora imbalance.&#xD;

      Based on the clinical practice, this study carried out a multi center cohort study in Fujian&#xD;
      Province, China. In this study, five research including Fujian Maternity and Child Health&#xD;
      Hospital, Mindong Hospital of Ningde City, Zhangzhou affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical&#xD;
      University, Quanzhou First Hospital Afflicated to Fujian Medical University and Xiamen&#xD;
      Maternity and Child Health Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University were included, each of&#xD;
      which included 600 individuals, with a total of 3000 women with potential cervical lesions&#xD;
      were enrolled. Blood samples were tested for immunology, stool swabs and vaginal secretions&#xD;
      were collected for microecological evaluation. At the same time, 21 kinds of common HPV virus&#xD;
      types, cervical exfoliative cytology and 10 kinds of common STDs pathogens were detected. The&#xD;
      included population will be tested with the same samples at 6, 12 and 24 months of follow-up&#xD;
      to explore the relationship between vaginal, intestinal microorganisms and cervical HPV&#xD;
      infection and the development of cervical lesions and its potential impact, so as to further&#xD;
      explore the key factors affecting the persistent infection and clearance of HPV in female&#xD;
      reproductive tract and the potential impact factors of the occurrence and development of&#xD;
      cervical lesions. This prospective observational the characteristics of vaginal and&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota in women with different cervical HPV infection, to evaluate the&#xD;
      relationship and the underlying effect in the developoing of cervical lessions.&#xD;
