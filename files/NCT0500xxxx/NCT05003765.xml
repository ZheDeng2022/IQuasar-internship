    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the addition of the superficial parasternal&#xD;
      intercostal plane (SPIP) block alone (30cc of 0.25% bupivacaine) or plus Magnesium (200mg of&#xD;
      magnesium sulfate) or plus Magnesium + Buprenorphine (300mcg) as adjuvants can improve&#xD;
      post-operative pain in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery, specifically, coronary&#xD;
      artery bypass grafting (CABG)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain management remains an important clinical challenge in cardiothoracic&#xD;
      surgery. Inadequate postoperative pain control can have adverse pathophysiologic&#xD;
      consequences, including increased myocardial oxygen demand, hypoventilation, suboptimal&#xD;
      clearance of pulmonary secretions, acute respiratory failure, and decreased mobility, with&#xD;
      associated increased risks for formation of clots in a blood vessels (thromboembolism). These&#xD;
      adverse events may result in greater perioperative morbidity and mortality. Despite several&#xD;
      multimodal approaches to postoperative pain control, optimal pain management after&#xD;
      cardiothoracic procedures remains an issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional anesthesia is used to block sensation in a specific part of body during and after&#xD;
      surgery. It offers numerous advantages over conventional general anesthesia, including faster&#xD;
      recovery time, fewer side effects, no need for an airway device during surgery, and a&#xD;
      dramatic reduction in post-surgical pain and reduction in opioid use following surgery. The&#xD;
      use of local anesthetic peripheral nerve blocks for surgical anesthesia and postoperative&#xD;
      pain management has increased significantly with the advent of ultrasound-guided techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound has revolutionized regional anesthesia by allowing real-time visualization of&#xD;
      anatomical structures, needle advancement and local anesthetic (LA) spread. This has led not&#xD;
      only to refinement of existing techniques, but also the introduction of new ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, ultrasound has been critical in the development of fascial plane blocks, in&#xD;
      which local anesthetic (LA) is injected into a tissue plane rather than directly around&#xD;
      nerves. These blocks are believed to work via passive spread of LA to nerves traveling within&#xD;
      that tissue plane, or to adjacent tissue compartments containing nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although research into these techniques is still at an early stage, the available evidence&#xD;
      indicates that they are effective in reducing opioid requirements and improving the pain&#xD;
      experience in a wide range of clinical settings. They are best employed as part of multimodal&#xD;
      analgesia with other systemic analgesics, rather than as sole anesthetic techniques.&#xD;
      Catheters may be beneficial in situations where moderate-severe pain is expected for &gt;12&#xD;
      hours, although the optimal dosing regimen requires further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will focus on the superficial parasternal-intercostal plane&#xD;
      (SPIP) block, which is among the anteromedial chest wall (near sternum) blocks and was first&#xD;
      performed by Raza et al. and Ohgoshi et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be assessing whether the addition of SPIP block (alone or plus&#xD;
      adjuvants) will decrease the visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores in the first 24 hours&#xD;
      after surgery, decrease post-operative total opioid consumption (oral morphine equivalents),&#xD;
      decrease total acetaminophen and ketorolac consumption, decrease post-operative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting (PONV), decrease length of the ICU stay, decrease time to extubation, and decrease&#xD;
      length of hospital stay in comparison to when SPIP block is not administered.&#xD;
