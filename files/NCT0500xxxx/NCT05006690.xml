  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spondyloarthritis (SpA) refers to a group of rheumatic diseases with common clinical,&#xD;
      genetic, and imaging features. In addition to the pain caused by sacroiliitis and&#xD;
      spondylitis, which are the main complaints, patients often experience joint stiffness,&#xD;
      fatigue, mood disorders, and various degrees of functional limitations, and their quality of&#xD;
      life can be significantly affected. On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic reduces the&#xD;
      level of physical activity in this patient group and negatively affects individuals&#xD;
      psychologically. For this reason, telerehabilitation has come to the fore all over the world&#xD;
      and rheumatology associations have also recommended these services. Although there is&#xD;
      consensus about the positive effects of exercise in SpA, no exercise regimen has been shown&#xD;
      to be superior to the other. There is no study examining the effects of exercise training&#xD;
      applied with telerehabilitation on individuals with SpA. The aim of this study is to compare&#xD;
      the effects of telerehabilitation and face-to-face and home-based spinal stabilization&#xD;
      exercise training in individuals with SpA. Volunteers meeting the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      randomly divided into 3 groups: 'telerehabilitation training group', 'face-to-face training&#xD;
      group' and 'home-based training group'. The individualized rehabilitation program will be&#xD;
      applied to each group for 1 hour, 3 days a week, for 8 weeks. Patient-reported scales&#xD;
      assessing patients' disease activity, functionality, mood, physical activity, quality of&#xD;
      life, fear-avoidance, central sensitization levels, and perceptions of the disease will be&#xD;
      administered to individuals at baseline, after the 8-week rehabilitation program, and 6&#xD;
      months after the second evaluation.&#xD;

    <description>Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI): The index consists of 10 questions in total. For each item, the patient marks the VAS consisting of a 100 mm line. The score range is 0-100. The Turkish version study was conducted by Karatepe et al. made by. A high score indicates a bad result.</description>

    <time_frame>10 minutes, through study completion, an average of 8 weeks, change from baseline spinal mobility and hip function at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI): The index, which consists of five clinical measurements, namely cervical rotation, tragus-wall distance, lumbar lateral flexion, modified Schober's test, and intermalleolar distance, is accepted as the most valid method for evaluating the axial skeleton. The higher the BASMI score the more severe the patient's limitation of movement.</description>

    <description>Short Form-36 (SF-36): SF-36, which is one of the most commonly used general scales to measure the quality of life, consists of eight sub-dimensions: physical function, social function, role limitations due to physical problems, role limitations due to emotional status, pain, vitality, mental health, and general health perception. Each sub-dimension is scored between 0-100 in itself. A high score indicates good health. The Turkish version study was conducted by Koçyiğit et al. made by.</description>

    <description>BETY-Biopsychosocial Questionnaire (BETY-BQ): Each of the questions in this scale, which consists of 30 different cognitive belief statements, is scored between 0-4. The total score ranges from 0 to 120. A high score indicates a poor biopsychosocial level. It is a scale developed by Ünal et al.</description>

    <time_frame>7 minutes, through study completion, an average of 8 weeks, change from baseline depression and anxiety levels at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>This scale consisting of 14 questions, odd-numbered questions question anxiety and even questions question depression. The options take values between 0-3, with a high score indicating a bad emotional state. The cut-off values of the scale were determined as 10 for the anxiety subscale and 7 for the depression subscale. The Turkish version study was done by Aydemir et al.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of Physical Activity Level</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes, through study completion, an average of 8 weeks, change from baseline physical activity level at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)-Short Form:&#xD;
There are eight versions of the questionnaire in total, but the short form &quot;last 7 days&quot; will be used in this study. The short form (7 questions) provides information about the time spent in walking, moderate-to-vigorous and vigorous activities. The time spent sitting is considered a separate question. It is classified as low, medium, and high level by calculating the activity level of the person in terms of METs according to the duration, frequency, and intensity level of the movement. The Turkish version study was done by Sağlam et al.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of Kinesiophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes, through study completion, an average of 8 weeks, change from baseline kinesiophobia at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tampa Kinesophobia Scale (TCS): It is a 17-question scale that evaluates injury avoidance and fear of movement, and Kori et al. developed by. The Turkish version is from Tunca-Yılmaz et al. Made by. Its scoring is scored with &quot;1 = Strongly disagree, 4 = Strongly agree&quot;. The score is calculated by reversing items 4, 8, 12, and 16. The total score is between 17 and 68. It is understood that the higher the score, the higher the kinesophobia. A total score of more than 37 is considered to be a high degree of kinesophobia.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of Illness Perception</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes, through study completion, an average of 8 weeks, change from baseline illness perception at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Brief Illness Perception Scale (BIPQ):&#xD;
In this scale, which consists of 9 questions, each question evaluates a component of the perception of illness. The first eight questions take values between 0-10. A high score indicates an increased level of perception of the disease as worrisome. The total score ranges from 0 to 80. The ninth question is an open-ended question that questions the patient's opinion about the possible causes of the disease. Turkish validity and reliability study was done by Karataş et al.</description>
