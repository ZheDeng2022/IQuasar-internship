  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the addition of magnesium to bupivacaine&#xD;
      for the post-operative adductor canal blocks (ACB) can decrease opioid consumption and&#xD;
      improve pain management for patients after same-day discharge total knee arthroplasty (TKA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess whether the addition of magnesium will decrease visual analog&#xD;
      scale (VAS) pain scores, decrease post-operative total opioid consumption (oral morphine&#xD;
      equivalents), decrease the incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and&#xD;
      improve patient satisfaction in comparison to when magnesium is not administered.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most common elective surgical procedures in the&#xD;
      United States . The number of TKA procedures has doubled in each of the past two decades and&#xD;
      is expected to top 3.4 million per year in the United States by 2030.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the last 10-15 years significant changes have taken place in the anesthetic management&#xD;
      of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). In the past, the majority of patients&#xD;
      underwent general anesthesia and were managed post-operatively with a PCA (patient controlled&#xD;
      analgesia) pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently anesthesiologists have begun to use neuraxial anesthesia (spinal anesthesia)&#xD;
      combined with regional anesthesia (peripheral nerve block (PNB)) techniques combined with&#xD;
      monitored anesthesia care (MAC) for many of these surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional anesthesia is used to block the sensation in a specific part of body during and&#xD;
      after surgery. It offers numerous advantages over conventional general anesthesia, including&#xD;
      faster recovery time, fewer side effects, no need for an airway device during surgery, and a&#xD;
      dramatic reduction in post-surgical pain and reduction in opioid use following surgery. The&#xD;
      use of local anesthetic peripheral nerve blocks for surgical anesthesia and postoperative&#xD;
      pain management has increased significantly with the advent of ultrasound-guided techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the duration of traditional amide-based and ester-based regional anesthesia is&#xD;
      normally limited to only a few hours. Techniques including continuous catheter placement or&#xD;
      serial injections can be used to enhance the duration and effect of regional anesthesia for&#xD;
      postoperative pain control. But these approaches can increase the risk of infection,&#xD;
      toxicity, and cost. Therefore, alternative methods of extending the clinical duration of&#xD;
      nerve blocks have been a topic of significant interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnesium sulfate, an NMDA receptor antagonist, exerts it analgesic effects by at least two&#xD;
      mechanisms: it acts as a physiological calcium antagonist by blocking NMDA receptors and it&#xD;
      inhibits the inflammatory response through the reduction of inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnesium has also been shown to decrease peripheral nerve excitability. Addition of&#xD;
      magnesium to intravenous regional anesthesia for chronic limb pain management has&#xD;
      demonstrated improvement in quality of blockade and prolonged the duration of analgesia.&#xD;
      Magnesium decreased intraoperative opioid consumption and tourniquet pain. Magnesium improved&#xD;
      the quality of anesthesia and prolonged the time for first postoperative analgesic&#xD;
      requirement. Overall, the addition of magnesium to local anesthetic is effective both for&#xD;
      perineural (nerve blocks) and intravenous regional anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, Li et al. evaluated seven trials&#xD;
      involving 493 patients. Investigators concluded that the addition of magnesium as an adjuvant&#xD;
      to PNB prolonged the postoperative duration time of analgesia, sensory, and motor block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have consistently shown that addition of magnesium to local anesthetic significantly&#xD;
      prolongs peripheral nerve blocks, including femoral nerve blocks with bupivacaine,&#xD;
      interscalene blocks with bupivacaine, and axillary blocks with prilocaine and&#xD;
      levobupivacaine. All of these papers denied adjuvant-related toxicity or side effects;&#xD;
      however, nausea was two to three times more likely in the first 12 hours after interscalene&#xD;
      blocks with 200mg magnesium in the study by Lee et al. This side effect was not reported in&#xD;
      studies using 150mg magnesium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the addition of magnesium to bupivacaine&#xD;
      for the post-operative adductor canal blocks can decrease opioid consumption and improve pain&#xD;
      management for patients after total knee arthroplasty (TKA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess whether the addition of magnesium will decrease visual analog&#xD;
      scale (VAS) pain scores, decrease post-operative total opioid consumption (oral morphine&#xD;
      equivalents), decrease the incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and&#xD;
      improve patient satisfaction in comparison to when magnesium is not administered.&#xD;
