      Background: Significant sex differences exist in regard to alcohol use disorder (AUD) and&#xD;
      alcoholic liver disease (ALD). To date, no studies have examined the brain-gut-microbiome&#xD;
      (BGM) axis (which is the relationship between the gut, brain, and the bacteria within the&#xD;
      gut) and sex-differences in AUD and ALD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: 1) Demonstrate baseline sex differences in the microbiome and metatranscriptome of AUD&#xD;
      and ALD and correlate those differences to severity, 2) determine if these baseline sex&#xD;
      differences predicts abstinence or ALD related outcomes, and 3) show how altering the&#xD;
      microbiome can decrease the severity of AUD and ALD in a sexdependent manner. Hypothesis: Our&#xD;
      project is aimed to explore the hypothesis that sex-related differences of the BGM axis in&#xD;
      AUD and ALD explains the variation in patient severity and outcome by sex, and that&#xD;
      alterations of the BGM axis can decrease the severity of AUD and ALD in a sex-dependent&#xD;
      manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A pilot randomized placebo (VSL#3 vs placebo) control trial will be performed in&#xD;
      patients with AUD and ALD for 6 months. Questionnaire data, clinical labs, serum, and feces&#xD;
      for shotgun metagenomics will be collected at baseline, 3-months, and 6-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Results: Patients with severe AUD/ALD will have more microbes and microbial genes&#xD;
      associated with inflammation. These differences will predict outcomes at 6-months and that&#xD;
      changes of this baseline microbiome with VSL#3 will lead to more positive outcomes than&#xD;
      placebo, with men having greater benefit from VSL#3 than women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications and Future Studies: The discovery of the mechanisms underlying sex-related&#xD;
      differences in AUD/ALD is needed for the development of personalized recommendations for&#xD;
      prevention and treatment in men and women&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of AUD and ALD is on the rise and the burden of disease is affecting men and&#xD;
      women differently. Research has shown that the prevalence AUD and alcoholic liver disease&#xD;
      (ALD) has grown significantly higher for women than for man over the last decade (80% vs 30%&#xD;
      for alcohol use disorder and 50% vs 30% for ALD). Research has also found that women, as&#xD;
      compared to men, are more likely to succumb to the negative effects of alcohol. Studies have&#xD;
      shown there is variability in alcohol absorption, distribution and metabolism between men and&#xD;
      women, as a result of hormonal, genetic and environmental factors. While women tend to drink&#xD;
      less than men, women who do have AUD are more likely to have ALD, cardiovascular disease, and&#xD;
      cancer. Sex differences exist for how women and men consume alcohol but sex differences also&#xD;
      exist for how likely they are to abstain, with married women having a higher rate of relapse&#xD;
      than married men. But despite recent efforts, the sex disparity in alcohol abuse and&#xD;
      alcoholic complications has not been clearly elucidated. There is a bidirectionality between&#xD;
      the gut microbiome and AUD and ALD. Heavy alcohol use has been associated with a decrease in&#xD;
      intestinal barrier function, increase bacterial translocation, and a shift in the intestinal&#xD;
      microbiome to a more inflammatory phenotype. Conversely, recent research have shown&#xD;
      probiotics to be beneficial in ALD, and in a recent phase 1 clinical trial, researcher showed&#xD;
      that fecal microbial transplant was able to significantly reduce alcohol use disorder in a&#xD;
      male population of veterans. Specifically VSL#3, a probiotic mixture, has been shown to be&#xD;
      safe and protective against intestinal barrier dysfunction, alcohol-related liver disease,&#xD;
      and even re-hospitalization. Therefore, there is mounting data to suggest that the&#xD;
      brain-gut-microbiome axis (BGM) may be important in alcohol use disorder and ALD. Yet to&#xD;
      date, there is no studies examining the role of the BGM axis in sex differences of alcohol&#xD;
      use disorder or ALD. Sex-based differences in the microbiome is related to other metabolic&#xD;
      diseases. In both human and animal models, studies have shown that the gut microbiome&#xD;
      composition and effects can vary between sexes based on the disease. Our group for example,&#xD;
      was able to show a sex-based difference in the BGM axis in relationship to obesity and food&#xD;
      addiction. Whether there is a sex difference in the BGM axis that affects disease progression&#xD;
      and outcome of AUD and ALD will be the key purpose of this pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH AND TIMELINE We hypothesize that sex-related differences of the BGM&#xD;
      axis in AUD and ALD explains the variation in patient outcome by sex, and that alterations of&#xD;
      the BGM axis can decrease the severity of alcohol-use disorder and ALD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of Aim 1: Demonstrate baseline sex differences in the gut microbiome and&#xD;
      metatranscriptome of patients with AUD and ALD and correlate those differences to the&#xD;
      severity of AUD and ALD. Utilizing fecal collection and shotgun metagenomics, we will&#xD;
      identify key bacterial markers and metatranscriptome signatures related to AUD and ALD as&#xD;
      compared to healthy controls. We will then determine if these markers are associated with AUD&#xD;
      and ALD severity in a sex-related manner. Patients will be recruited from Santa Monica UCLA&#xD;
      hospital and Ronald Reagan UCLA Hospital. Potentially eligible patients will be asked by&#xD;
      their provider if they can be contacted by the research team. Afterwards, the team will do a&#xD;
      preliminary chart review looking at past medical history, problem list, and current inpatient&#xD;
      notes to determine if the patient is eligible based on inclusion and exclusion criteria's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of Baseline AUD and ALD characteristics. In addition to patient demographic&#xD;
      information, we will also collect questionnaire data to assess the severity of their AUD and&#xD;
      clinical lab parameters to assess the severity of their ALD. To assess the severity of their&#xD;
      AUD, we will use the DSM-V criteria for severity, the AUDIT score, Timeline Followback (TLFB)&#xD;
      alcohol assessment, Quality of Life (QOL) scale, and the Alcohol craving questionnaire-Short&#xD;
      form (ACQ-SF). To assess the patient's ALD severity, clinical laboratory data will be&#xD;
      collected to measure the patients Maddrey's Discriminant Function score, MELD-Na score,&#xD;
      Glasgow Alcoholic Hepatitis Score, and baseline transaminases. To assess for other&#xD;
      comorbities we will ask Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS). DSM-V criteria for&#xD;
      severity, the AUDIT score, Timeline Followback (TLFB) alcohol assessment, Quality of Life&#xD;
      (QOL) scale, the Alcohol craving questionnaire-Short form (ACQ-SF) and the HADS are&#xD;
      questionnaires administered for research purposes. As such the HADS questionnaire will be&#xD;
      scored at a later date. Maddrey's Discriminant Function score, MELD-Na score, Glasgow&#xD;
      Alcoholic Hepatitis Score, and baseline transaminases are based on clinical labs and medical&#xD;
      chart review. Specimen Collection and Microbiome Sequencing. While patients are hospitalized,&#xD;
      both ethanol preserved and fresh stool will be collected at baseline along with serum for&#xD;
      future analysis similar to our previous works. Stool will be collected in a provided&#xD;
      container, the patient will then take a provided para pak vial which contains a spoon and&#xD;
      take a small spoon full and place it in the para pak vial which also contains 95% ethanol.&#xD;
      These samples will then be stored at -80oC and then processed as a single batch. DNA will be&#xD;
      extracted from fecal samples using bead beating in conjunction with the ZymoBiomics DNA&#xD;
      Miniprep kit (Zymo Research). DNA extracted from fecal samples will be fragmented and&#xD;
      barcoded using a commercial kit (Illumina Nextera Flex). Shotgun libraries will undergo&#xD;
      sequencing using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (S4 flowcells) with a target depth of 20 million&#xD;
      paired-end sequences per sample. Sequence data will then be inputted into MetaPhlAn2 for&#xD;
      taxonomic identification of species for compositional analysis equivalent to that performed&#xD;
      with 16S rRNA sequence data. The shotgun metagenomics data will also be used to perform&#xD;
      strain-level microbiome analysis with the ConStrains algorithm, which identifies single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphisms in metagenomics sequence data that can be used to track strains&#xD;
      across samples. In addition, metagenomics data will be processed in HUMAnN2 for annotation of&#xD;
      gene families and identification of the microbial source of these genes. Bacterial gene&#xD;
      abundances will be aggregated into pathways based upon KEGG and MetaCyc classifications.&#xD;
      Serum processing: Blood will be collected at each study visit (about 3-5 ml). Blood will be&#xD;
      centrifuged and serum will be collected. Serum will then be stored at -80C for future use for&#xD;
      metabolomics. Deidentified serum samples will be sent to Metabolon for metabolite processing&#xD;
      and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of Aim 2: Determine if baseline sex differences in the gut microbiome and&#xD;
      metatranscriptome predicts continued abstinence, recidivism, or ALD-related outcomes.&#xD;
      Patients recruited as above will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either a placebo or VSL#3&#xD;
      for 6-months. They will take take one VSL#3 pill once a day while they are in the study&#xD;
      (112.5 billion CFU per capsule) or a placebo pill with 100 mg of sugar once a day. VSL#3 At&#xD;
      3- months and 6-months patient will return for a visit and the same questionnaires and&#xD;
      clinical scores as their baseline visit will be obtained again. Patient will also provide&#xD;
      ethanol persevered stool and mail it back to us in a self-addressed paid envelope, and a&#xD;
      serum blood sample will be collected at the visit for future analysis . A total of 3-5 ml of&#xD;
      blood will be collected at each collection. Prospective outcomes. In addition to the&#xD;
      questionnaire and scores listed above measured at 3-months and 6- months, we will also&#xD;
      examine the rate of recidivism, re-hospitalization for alcohol-related causes, all-cause&#xD;
      rehospitalization, mortality, and liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview Aim 3. Show how altering the gut-microbiome can decrease the severity of AUD and ALD&#xD;
      in a sexdependent manner. As mentioned above, patients recruited will be randomized in a 1:1&#xD;
      fashion to either a placebo or VSL#3 for 6-months. They will take one VSL#3 pill once a day&#xD;
      (112.5 billion CFU per capsule) or a placebo pill with 100 mg of sugar once a day. VSL#3 was&#xD;
      chosen as the probiotic of choice because prior published literature has shown its safety in&#xD;
      ALD and animal models have shown it to be effective against inflammation of gut barrier&#xD;
      dysfunction in models of AUD and ALD. By power calculation based on previous works on VSL#3,&#xD;
      we have determined that we will need about 20 patients per group to determine a difference&#xD;
      (Male-Placebo, Male-VSL#3, Female-Placebo, Female-VSL#3, total=80). Both patient and study&#xD;
      personnel will be blinded to the patient's randomization. The study coordinator will be the&#xD;
      only person who is not blinded to the patient randomization while the PI and Co-investigators&#xD;
      will be blinded throughout the study including the data analysis. Primary Outcomes and&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes. Several previously published trials on VSL#3 have shown no significant&#xD;
      adverse events as compared to placebo. Therefore, the primary outcome of the prospective&#xD;
      randomized placebo-control study will be sex differences in the rate abstinence and the&#xD;
      proportion of resolution of ALD as measured by the Maddrey's Discriminant Function score,&#xD;
      MELD-Na score, Glasgow Alcoholic Hepatitis Score, and transaminases. Secondary outcomes will&#xD;
      be sex differences regarding microbiome changes, alcohol consumption, QOL, and alcohol&#xD;
      craving. Specimen Collection and Microbiome Sequencing. Similar collection and microbiome&#xD;
      sequencing will be done as mentioned above. But instead of shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we&#xD;
      will perform full 16S sequencing for the samples collected at 6-months to reduce cost. Full&#xD;
      16S sequencing is less expensive but is able to give us similar strain profiles as shotgun&#xD;
      metagenomic sequencing.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Adult patients admitted to Santa Monica UCLA hospital or Ronald Reagan&#xD;
        UCLA Hospital with a diagnosis of AUD and ALD will be screened and potentially recruited.&#xD;
        ALD patients will be identified based on the recent American Association of the Study of&#xD;
        Liver Disease (AASLD) guidelines: onset of jaundice within 8 weeks, 2) ongoing consumption&#xD;
        of ethanol of &gt;40 for women or &gt;60 in men for 6 months or &lt;60 days of abstinence before&#xD;
        onset of jaundice, AST&gt;50, AST:ALT&gt;1.5 and both &lt;400 IU/L, total bilirubin &gt;3, or liver&#xD;
        biopsy showing histologic features of ALD. AUD will be defined based on the current DSM-V&#xD;
        definition&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria: To avoid any confounders to the gut microbiome analysis, patients will&#xD;
        be excluded if they have been on antibiotics within 3 months or probiotics within 1 month&#xD;
        of enrollment, have a history of inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome,&#xD;
        gastrointestinal malignancy, or gastrointestinal surgery. If patients are started on&#xD;
        antibiotics while in the study, they will be withdrawn from the study to avoid confounders&#xD;
        of antibiotic use on microbiome analysis. To avoid any cofounders of advanced liver&#xD;
        fibrosis on the microbiome analysis, we will also exclude patients with underlying&#xD;
        cirrhosis and/or overt hepatic encephalopathy (West Haven criteria &gt;3). Patients with acute&#xD;
        pancreatitis or history of chronic pancreatitis will also be excluded. The diagnosis of&#xD;
        acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis will be ascertained from their history and&#xD;
        physical. Cirrhosis will be determined by a review of their medical charts and Fib4&#xD;
        calculation. If their medical charts do not mention any history of cirrhosis and their Fib4&#xD;
        score is less than or equal to 1.35 then they will be deemed as being non-cirrhotic.&#xD;
        Subjects will be provided their Fib4 score if it is greater than 1.35 and instructed to&#xD;
        follow up with their primary care physician for further evaluation if warranted. Fib4 is&#xD;
        based on their clinical blood work and age which will be abstracted from their chart and is&#xD;
        validated at ruling out advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.&#xD;
