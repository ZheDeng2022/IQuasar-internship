      GERD is common in Indian population and the normative data which is used to diagnose &amp; manage&#xD;
      GERD and its complications are based on western data which is not validated in the Indian&#xD;
      population. Although normative data is available for commonly used twenty-four impedance-pH&#xD;
      parameters, their global application has limitations, stemming from use of small healthy&#xD;
      volunteer cohorts from few countries for normative data. At present, there is no normative&#xD;
      data for twenty-four hours impedance-pH monitoring in Indian population. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to obtain a new set of normal values specific for the Indian population.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION Ambulatory impedance-pH monitoring is well established in the investigation&#xD;
           of oesophageal symptoms suspicious of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and may&#xD;
           be of particular value where symptoms persist or do not improve with empiric GERD&#xD;
           treatment trials or GERD management, or where the diagnosis of GERD is inconclusive.&#xD;
           Although normal values are available for commonly used impedance-pH parameters, their&#xD;
           global application has limitations, stemming from use of small healthy volunteer cohorts&#xD;
           from one or two countries for normative data. Further, significant technical limitations&#xD;
           in analysis exist, such as inclusion of pH drops from meals/artefacts and inconsistent&#xD;
           rules for identification of impedance reflux events, leading to large inter-reviewer&#xD;
           variability. Several measurement systems are used for impedance-pH monitoring worldwide.&#xD;
           Despite regional differences in prevalence of GERD phenotypes, symptomatic profiles and&#xD;
           GERD complications, the same impedance-pH threshold values are used to define normality&#xD;
           by these measurement systems. It remains unclear if measurements obtained using&#xD;
           different systems or across world regions are comparable, especially since automated&#xD;
           analysis provided by impedance-pH systems suffers from significant overcall of reflux&#xD;
           episodes. Accurate identification and quantification of acid and non-acid reflux&#xD;
           episodes on impedance-pH monitoring is important for precise calculation of oesophageal&#xD;
           acid exposure time (AET), for reflux-symptom association analysis, and for evaluation of&#xD;
           clearance mechanisms such as the postreflux swallow induced peristaltic wave (PSPW).&#xD;
           Both reflux episodes and PSPW need to be reliably identified and recorded, for correct&#xD;
           calculation of the PSPW index. Baseline impedance from impedance-pH monitoring can&#xD;
           provide a measure of oesophageal mucosal integrity. Baseline impedance during the&#xD;
           nocturnal supine period has been shown to be higher in healthy subjects and patients&#xD;
           with functional heartburn and lower in patients with reflux disease. We aimed to obtain&#xD;
           a new set of normal values for impedance- pH monitoring based on consensus analysis of&#xD;
           impedance pH studies performed using different hardware/software systems from a large&#xD;
           worldwide cohort of healthy asymptomatic subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. RATIONALE Although normal values are available for commonly used impedance-pH&#xD;
           parameters, their global application has limitations, stemming from use of small healthy&#xD;
           volunteer cohorts from one or two countries for normative data. At present, there is no&#xD;
           normative data for impedance-pH monitoring in Indian population. The aim of this study&#xD;
           is to obtain a new set of normal values specific for the Indian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY OBJECTIVES 3a. Primary objective - To establish normative data for impedance-pH&#xD;
           monitoring in Indian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. STUDY POPULATION- 50 healthy asymptomatic subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. DESIGN AND DURATION OF THE STUDY- It will be a observational prospective study. The&#xD;
           study duration will be till completion of data collection for 50 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6a. SUBJECT RECRUITMENT - Healthy volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      6b. RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING- Not applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
      6c. STUDY METHODS- This observational study will be conducted among 50 patients of both sexes&#xD;
      after obtaining ethical clearance from institutional human ethical committee. Study&#xD;
      participants will be of the age more than 18 years. Exclusion criteria will consist of&#xD;
      thoracic or digestive foregut surgery, alcohol consumption &gt;40 g/day, use of medications that&#xD;
      alter intragastric acidity or oesophageal motility, as well as history of diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      neurological disorders or other chronic gastrointestinal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6d. STUDY PROCEDURE- After at least 6 hours of fasting, a catheter will be placed through the&#xD;
      nasal passage, and then swallowed into the esophagus with drinks of water. The other end of&#xD;
      the catheter will be taped to cheek, wrapped over ear, and attached to a small data recorder&#xD;
      that the subject will wear at waist level, held by a strap over the shoulder. Subject will be&#xD;
      able to swallow, talk, and breathe without any difficulty during the test. Placement of the&#xD;
      catheter will take about 10 minutes. One pH electrode will be positioned 5 cm proximal to the&#xD;
      manometrically identified lower oesophageal sphincter (LES), and six impedance channels with&#xD;
      their midpoint located 3, 5, 7, 9, 15 and 17 cm proximal to the LES. During the recording&#xD;
      period, subjects will be encouraged to continue with their usual daily activities and meals.&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to keep a diary during the testing, including every time you eat,&#xD;
      drink, or take medicines, and how long that lasts, when you lie down and get up, and each and&#xD;
      every time you have a symptom of interest (like heartburn, regurgitation, cough, sore throat,&#xD;
      etc.). Subject cannot take a shower or bath while wearing the monitor. Suject will return&#xD;
      next day to have the catheter removed and to turn in the diary. Removing the catheter takes&#xD;
      less than one minute. The total duration of catheter placement will be 24 hours. The&#xD;
      equipment used will be pH monitoring catheter (Alacer, Brazil).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6e. METHODS OF ASSESSMENT- All tracings will be initially checked, and excluded if they had&#xD;
      technical artefacts, marked oesophageal symptoms or antireflux medication intake. During the&#xD;
      subsequent analysis process, tracings will be excluded if they fulfilled criteria for&#xD;
      behavioural disorders (aerophagia, supragastric belching and rumination), low mean nocturnal&#xD;
      baseline impedance (MNBI) in all impedance channels suspicious for eosinophilic oesophagitis&#xD;
      (EoE) and hiatal hernia larger than 2 cm (in those with available HRM). All tracings will be&#xD;
      analysed by four individuals, each with experience in reviewing &gt;300 impedance-pH studies&#xD;
      annually. Reviewers will initially apply automated analysis, followed by manual review of&#xD;
      each identified reflux episode and PSPW for accuracy, as well as manual addition of missed&#xD;
      events identified within the time window of 3 min used to edit the reflux events detected by&#xD;
      automated analysis, with two reviewer consensus for each retained episode. The analysis&#xD;
      process will consist of: (1) editing of pH drops (to exclude artefacts and meal/drink induced&#xD;
      pH drops). Slow pH drifts without impedance reflux were included for calculation of total AET&#xD;
      but were not considered separate reflux episodes. (2) Identification of impedance reflux&#xD;
      events and PSPW using strict pre-established criteria and (3) measurement of distal MNBI.&#xD;
      After manual editing, the following parameters will be considered for normative data: total,&#xD;
      upright and supine AET, number of reflux events (total, acid and non-acid), PSPW index and&#xD;
      MNBI at 3 and 5 cm above the LES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6f. STOPPING OR DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA- Not applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. OUTCOME MEASURES 7a. Primary - To establish normative data for impedance-pH monitoring in&#xD;
      Indian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no secondary objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS- Data will be expressed as median and percentile values (5th, 25th,&#xD;
      75th and 95th percentiles). Depending on normality of distribution, we will use either paired&#xD;
      Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test for paired comparison. Likewise, we will use one way&#xD;
      analysis of variance with Tukey test or Kruskal-Wallis, followed by Dunn's test as&#xD;
      appropriate. Upper limit of normal will be defined as the 95th percentile of normal values.&#xD;
      For PSPW index and MNBI thresholds, we will use the 5th and 25th percentile values. P≤0.05&#xD;
      will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
