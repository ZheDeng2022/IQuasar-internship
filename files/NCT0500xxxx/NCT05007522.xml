      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ketotifen and&#xD;
      indomethacin taken together to improve symptoms related with COVID-19. Ketotifen and&#xD;
      indomethacin are medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat&#xD;
      diseases other than COVID-19. Their use in this study is investigational, meaning they have&#xD;
      not been approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome&#xD;
      Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is a recently emerged coronavirus that has resulted in an&#xD;
      ongoing global pandemic. Fever and cough are most commonly experienced at disease&#xD;
      presentation and complications involving the vascular system also occur as potential&#xD;
      manifestations of severe disease. In human autopsy studies, infiltration of mononuclear cells&#xD;
      in the lung tissue concurrent with edema and hemorrhage are frequently noted5. Other than&#xD;
      lung epithelial cells, infection is also observed in endothelial cells, possibly augmenting&#xD;
      endothelial activation and vascular permeability6. It is believed that lung pathology during&#xD;
      COVID-19 is immune-mediated and compounded by the infiltration of monocytes, neutrophils and&#xD;
      subsets of T cells7. Interestingly, perturbations in the numbers of granulocytes in the&#xD;
      blood, such as neutrophils and eosinophils have also been shown to be associated with severe&#xD;
      disease1, 8, 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mast cells (MCs) are long-lived granulated immune cells that are present in both connective&#xD;
      and mucosal tissues10. Our data in animal models support that MCs are strongly activated&#xD;
      during infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus. Animal studies suggested that drugs in the class of MC&#xD;
      &quot;stabilizers&quot; can effectively limit vascular leakage in mouse models of viral infection, such&#xD;
      as caused by dengue virus (DENV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketotifen is an oral drug currently used to prevent asthma. It is used to treat irritation&#xD;
      and reduce vascular leakage, such as in the eye. It is a MC stabilizing agent that prevents&#xD;
      degranulation of MCs, as well as the production of additional mediators that are not&#xD;
      contained within MC granules, including leukotrienes and platelet activating factor 32.&#xD;
      Indomethacin is an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX) 1 and 2 receptors and, therefore, its&#xD;
      primary mechanism of action is through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. It is used to&#xD;
      treat inflammatory disorders and pain including rheumatoid arthritis, tendinitis, gout, and&#xD;
      nephrogenic diabetes insipidus due to its antipyretic and analgesic properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, clinical study of ketotifen and&#xD;
      indomethacin in adults 18 to 75 years of age, who meet at least two symptoms indicating&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection, and who test positive for COVID-19 infection by a PCR based assay or&#xD;
      rapid detection assay. Patients meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Eligible patients who present at or are referred to trial sites will undergo&#xD;
      screening. Trained research staff will obtain informed consent from participants. Patients&#xD;
      meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria and who agree to participate will be enrolled&#xD;
      for the duration of the study.The study will be conducted as an outpatient study. One hundred&#xD;
      and fifty (150) patients will be randomized 2:1 to ketotifen/indomethacin or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety ketotifen and indomethacin, in combination, in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: This drug combination will be safe in COVID-19 patients, with no increase in&#xD;
      adverse events, and no increased severity of COVID-19 disease. (clinical endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the effectiveness of ketotifen and indomethacin for improving clinical&#xD;
      measures of respiratory function and/or resolution of COVID-19 symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Combination treatment of COVID-19 patients with ketotifen and indomethacin will&#xD;
      improve patient measures of shortness of breath and/or promote the resolution of COVID-19&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms, shortening the duration of those symptoms. (clinical endpoint)&#xD;
