  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      causing focal lesions of demyelination and diffuse neurodegeneration in the grey and white&#xD;
      matter of the brain and spinal cord, leading to physical and cognitive disability. The&#xD;
      scientific community and patients are in need for new and more reliable biomarkers,&#xD;
      especially biomarkers of disease progression in order to adapt therapeutic approaches on an&#xD;
      individual level. Digital biomarkers have the potential to fill this gap allowing for&#xD;
      quasi-continuous measures that might be more informative than episodically collected&#xD;
      conventional data concerning the impact of the disease on activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using app-based challenges, continuous monitoring and surveys the Investigators aim to obtain&#xD;
      data that can be used as digital biomarkers (DB). These digital biomarkers will provide more&#xD;
      granular and precise assessments, thus complementing traditional diagnostic measures and&#xD;
      techniques. After a first feasibility study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04413032) a number of&#xD;
      digital biomarkers have been identified as reliable, reproducible and meaningful to PwMS and&#xD;
      are therefore being validated in a bigger cohort of PwMS with a longer follow-up within this&#xD;
      validation study 1. Those digital biomarkers will be compared to state-of-the-Art clinical,&#xD;
      imaging and body fluid assessment.&#xD;

      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      causing focal lesions of demyelination and diffuse neurodegeneration in the grey and white&#xD;
      matter of the brain and spinal cord, leading to physical and cognitive disability. Currently&#xD;
      there is a limited number of relevant biomarkers available in persons with MS (PwMS), such as&#xD;
      clinical, imaging or biological measures. Patient history and neurologic examination in&#xD;
      combination with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), evoked potentials and analysis of serum&#xD;
      and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are the gold standard of diagnosis and mainly patient history,&#xD;
      neurologic examination and MRI are used for patient monitoring. However, their prognostic&#xD;
      value on a patient level is still very limited. Therefore, the scientific community and&#xD;
      patients are in need for new and more reliable biomarkers, especially biomarkers of disease&#xD;
      progression in order to adapt therapeutic approaches on an individual level. Digital&#xD;
      biomarkers have the potential to fill this gap allowing for quasi-continuous measures that&#xD;
      might be more informative than episodically collected conventional data concerning the impact&#xD;
      of the disease on activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators have developed the dreaMS App, a data collection, communication and&#xD;
      management platform using data collected through the patients' mobile devices (smartphone and&#xD;
      wearables). Using app-based challenges, continuous monitoring and surveys the Investigators&#xD;
      aim to obtain data that can be used as digital biomarkers (DB). These digital biomarkers will&#xD;
      provide more granular and precise assessments, thus complementing traditional diagnostic&#xD;
      measures and techniques. After a first feasibility study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04413032) a&#xD;
      number of digital biomarkers have been identified as reliable, reproducible and meaningful to&#xD;
      PwMS and are therefore being validated in a bigger cohort of PwMS with a longer follow-up&#xD;
      within this validation study 1. Those digital biomarkers will be compared to state-of-the-Art&#xD;
      clinical, imaging and body fluid assessment.&#xD;

    <description>Spearman correlation coefficients higher than 0.4 (lower bound of 95% confidence interval) are considered relevant. All scheduled pairs of measurements collected during the study will be used. As the yearly observations of a patient are not independent, standard conﬁdence intervals cannot be used. Therefore, a bootstrap approach will be used to determine a 95% conﬁdence interval for the Spearman correlations (where data will be resampled on the patient level).</description>

    <description>The change of the digital biomarker over two years allows to distinguish patients experiencing a relevant worsening in the corresponding reference test over the same period from those who do not with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) larger than 0.6 (lower bound of 95% confidence interval).</description>
