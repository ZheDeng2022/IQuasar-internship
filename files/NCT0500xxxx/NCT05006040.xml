      The overall objective of this pilot study is to determine the safety and feasibility of a&#xD;
      hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery system for children and young adults with high risk acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia, during the induction chemotherapy phase while they are exposed to&#xD;
      steroids and asparaginase that cause hyperglycemia. Insulin therapy would be beneficial in&#xD;
      reducing hyperglycemia-associated complications in this period and thereby could improve&#xD;
      other outcomes. The primary objective of the current pilot proposal is to demonstrate that&#xD;
      hybrid closed loop pump therapy is a safe to be used in children and young adults with high&#xD;
      risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia. If successful, the results of this study will be used to&#xD;
      plan and support a larger, multi-center clinical trial and a grant proposal.&#xD;

    <measure>Efficacy of glycemic control with HCL insulin delivery assessed by Time in Ranges (TIR)</measure>
    <time_frame>35 days</time_frame>
    <description>Time in Ranges (TIRs) refers to percent of the time spent in a specific range of blood glucose levels, adding valuable information to assess the level of glycemic control. Usually a range of 70-180 mg/dL is used, but occasionally a more stringent 70-140 mg/dL is used. In this study, we will obtain %CGM TIRs in both ranges.</description>

    <intervention_type>Device</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Hybrid Closed Loop System</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will utilize the Tandem Control-IQ Professional Hybrid Closed Loop artificial pancreas system [25, 26]. This device consists of the Dexcom G6 Continuous glucose monitor (or a more recent interoperable CGM), the Tandem t:slim X2 continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump, and the Control-IQ professional hybrid closed loop control algorithm. The CGM is generally replaced by parents or patients and then replaced after sensor expiration or if it falls off. This CGM, like all future iCGMs, is factory calibrated and approved for direct dosing of insulin. In addition, while the system is in use, patients will conduct blood glucose level checks at least four times a day with a fingerstick and calibrate the CGM if the measurements differ by more than 20 mg/dL of fingerstick blood glucose level. The t:slim X2 insulin pump delivers rapid acting insulin via a subcutaneous cannula which is placed by parents or patients and then replaced every 3 days [30].</description>
