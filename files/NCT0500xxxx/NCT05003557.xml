  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monocentric retrospective observational cohort study, using a consecutive series of patients&#xD;
      hospitalized for FND from 2012 to 2015 in the neurology department A of the Grenoble Alpes&#xD;
      University Hospital. During the discharge staff, an estimation of different prognostic&#xD;
      factors had been performed in a consensual way by the medical team for all subjects. It is&#xD;
      possible to calculate a score (POS) retrospectively from the data collected during the staff.&#xD;
      The following items were evaluated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5: quality of adherence to the&#xD;
      diagnosis, presence of a current medical treatment, presence of a similar history, duration&#xD;
      of evolution of the disorders presented, ability to verbalize, presence of a social&#xD;
      adaptation to the disorders, access to psychiatric care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study will be to study the properties of the calculated score according to the&#xD;
      evolution of the patients. The investigators will retrospectively collect information from&#xD;
      the medical records. In addition, the evolution of the disorder since the initial&#xD;
      hospitalization will be analyzed via a self-evaluation by the subjects and the study of the&#xD;
      current medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also collect information on the quality of life of the patients in the&#xD;
      cohort and their perception of the disease at present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a Clinical Global Impression (CGI-I) scale on FNDstatus, subjects will be classified&#xD;
      into two groups by the two principal investigators (Dr. Vercueil, M. Bratanov): the first&#xD;
      with a favorable evolution (disappearance of symptoms at the last follow-up, low health care&#xD;
      consumption, favorable self-assessment of health status, persistence of symptoms at a low&#xD;
      level of disability, satisfactory social and professional integration), and the second with&#xD;
      an unfavorable evolution (persistence of symptoms at a disabling level, high health care&#xD;
      consumption, unfavorable self-assessment of health status, lack of social and professional&#xD;
      integration, multiple medical consultations). The prognostic properties of the POS score will&#xD;
      be then studied in order to establish an ROC curve that will allow to classify patients in&#xD;
      the two groups.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life of each patient</measure>
    <time_frame>continuously through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>using the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) Each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved.All items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state.</description>

    <measure>Illness perception as reported by each patient</measure>
    <time_frame>continuously through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire(IPQ-R)&#xD;
Coding:&#xD;
for identity scale yes = 1; no = 0 for other items: strongly disagree =1, disagree =2, neither agree or disagree = 3, agree = 4, strongly agree = 5&#xD;
High scores on the identity, timeline, consequences, and cyclical dimensions represent strongly held beliefs about the number of symptoms attributed to the illness, the chronicity of the condition, the negative consequences of the illness, and the cyclical nature of the condition.&#xD;
High scores on the personal control, treatment control and coherence dimensions, represent positive beliefs about the controllability of the illness and a personal understanding of the condition.</description>
