  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with spastic bilateral cerebral palsy are late developers. delayed gross and fine&#xD;
      motor development require early intervention to improve the child performance and avoid&#xD;
      secondary impairments.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      increased tone of lower extremity muscles interfere with the child sitting posture and trunk&#xD;
      control. delayed sitting and lack of trunk control contribute to the impairments of upper&#xD;
      extremity functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      selective dorsal rhizotomy is a surgical procedure to control increased tone of the lower&#xD;
      extremities. Therefore, the current study is carried out to investigate the effects of&#xD;
      selective dorsal rhizotomy on trunk control, selectivity and upper extremity function of&#xD;
      non-ambulant children with bilateral spastic cerebral palsy&#xD;

    <masking_description>Random allocation of participants will be completed using a random number generator, with the allocation to either the control or selective dorsal rhizotomy group being concealed. The random numbers are generated by the principle physical therapists with every alternate number being marked either &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2.&quot; However, the receptionist was blinded to the interventions assigned to group 1 (control group) and group 2 (SDR group). During allocation, every parent/legal guardian is asked to pick up one enclosed envelope from a box containing numbers from 1 to 30. Then, they are allocated to either group 1 or group 2 to minimize the risk of allocation bias.</masking_description>

    <measure>Segmental trunk control</measure>
    <time_frame>period of the treatment was 4 successive months</time_frame>
    <description>The Segmental Assessment of Trunk Control is applied to assess upright trunk postural control in sitting position based on subdividing the trunk into 6 segments. The head/trunk control is acquired segment by segment if upright sitting posture can be maintained under three conditions including: static control at static position, active control while the child moves the head and/or arm and reactive control after external perturbation.The trunk segments according to the scale include: head/neck, thoracic (upper, mid and lower) and lumbar (upper and lower) segments. It is an ordinal scale with a grade 1 to 7 is assigned for each segment with the score 7 indicates that the infant can't retain independent sitting (no hand support). A score of 8 is given as full trunk control is gained.</description>

    <description>Test of arm selective control is a valid and reliable tool to measure selectivity of upper extremity of shoulder; elbow; wrist; fingers movements and thumb extension (key grip). With the shoulder in mid rotation: 1) elbow, wrist, and Ô¨Ångers in extension; 2) 90o elbow flexion, forearm in mid position with the wrist and fingers in extension. For each movement, the examiner passively moved the tested upper extremity to assess the full range of motion and demonstrate the desired movement. Then, he/she was instructed to actively move the test upper extremity using a three-second verbal count. Each position was scored as unable (0); impaired (1) or intact selectivity (2) with total score for each upper extremity is 16 and 32 for both tested upper extremities.</description>

    <description>The quality of upper extremity skill test is a reliable and valid tool used to measure the motor function in children with CP ages of 18 months to 8 years. The assessment procedures were conducted according to the instruction manual to assess the movement patterns in four basic domains representing dissociated movement; grasp; protective extension; and weight bearing. The total scores for each domain percentage score are calculated as total score which range from zero to 100% with higher score reflects better performance.</description>

    <intervention_name>sequenced trunk co-activation exercises</intervention_name>
    <description>Sequenced trunk co-activation exercises were basically used for facilitation of functional activities through trunk musculature dynamic co-activation of in the lateral plane which is required for basic developmental milestones. In the frontal plane, encourage the child to actively shift his/her weight to maintain the weight-bearing side straight while keeping proper active co-activation of trunk musculature. Efficient trunk rotation is essential for acquiring of equilibrium reactions and balance. Enhancement of efficient active trunk rotation as the child could achieve active trunk musculature co-activation while maintaining the weight-bearing side straight (Arndt et al., 2008).&#xD;

    <description>A custom-made articulating ankle foot orthosis with a hinge at the level of the medial malleolus of the ankle is fabricated for each child from the same copolymer thermoplastic mold after casting with the subtalar joint in neutral position. The orthosis extended distally to the tip of the toes and proximally on the posterior surface of the leg to about 5 cm below the knee and secured to the foot by three straps across the forefoot, the front of the ankle, and to the anterior upper tibial portion. It is fabricated to permit free ankle dorsiflexion and lock the plantar flexion at 0 dorsiflexion. The splinting schedule started gradually for 2 h/day in the first month, 4 h/day in the second month to the entire wake-up time of the day in the third and fourth months to accommodate children to the orthosis.</description>

    <description>All SDRs were performed by a single neurosurgeon through an osteoplastic laminotomy from L2 to L5 that left the facet joints intact. After opening the dura, the posterior nerve roots of L2 to S1 were identified and divided into 3 to 6 rootlets. At L2, from 30% to 50% of the posterior nerve rootlets were sectioned without selective stimulation. Selective electric stimulation of each nerve rootlet was performed from L3 to S1. The percentage of rootlets sectioned at each level (table 3) was determined by the surgical team based on the electromyographic results obtained intrasurgically and knowledge of the presurgical assessment results. The laminae were replaced on the completion of the rootlet stimulation and secured with sutures in the yellow ligament and the supraspinous ligament.</description>
