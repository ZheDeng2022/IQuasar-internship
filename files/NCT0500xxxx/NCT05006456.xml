  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this registry is to obtain real-world clinical experience for the&#xD;
      latest and future ablation technologies when used in conjunction with the Carto system in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in Asian countries. The ablation&#xD;
      technologies include THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH® SF (STSF) catheter with Ablation Index (AI)&#xD;
      /Visitag SURPOINT, QDOT catheter, and HELIOSTAR catheter. Additional new ablation and/or&#xD;
      mapping technologies may be included in future when they become available in local markets.&#xD;
