  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients who require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are the&#xD;
      sickest in the hospital. More patients are surviving but survivors have compromised&#xD;
      functional recovery for months or years. This registry-embedded randomised trial aims to&#xD;
      determine if early rehabilitation commenced within 72 hours of ECMO is feasible and improves&#xD;
      muscle strength and functional status in patients compared to standard practice in a&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial of 100 ICU patients. The effect of the intervention on mortality,&#xD;
      health status, and function at 180 days will be evaluated, as well as cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
      ECMO-Rehab trial is a registry embedded trial and will be utilising EXCEL data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is a 100-patient, multicentre, randomised, controlled, parallel-group, two-sided&#xD;
      superiority trial that will randomly allocate eligible patients to early rehabilitation or&#xD;
      standard care in a 1:1 ratio to determine if early rehabilitation of critically ill patients&#xD;
      receiving ECMO reduces disability when compared with standard care. ECMO-Rehab trial is a&#xD;
      registry embedded trial and will be utilising EXCEL data.&#xD;

    <description>ECMO early rehabilitation is led by a senior physiotherapist who has specialised training in ECMO care and coordinates individualised early physical training from randomisation to day 28 in ICU and liaises with the patient through to hospital discharge. The early rehabilitation intervention involves physical activity, functional retraining, strengthening exercises and mobilisation based on a reproducible, physiological approach.</description>

    <description>The intervention involves a progression of rehabilitation exercises with the objective of rehabilitating the patient at the highest level of exercise possible for the patient for the longest period of time that can be tolerated (up to 60 mins) at each session. The intervention will be administered 5 days per week (weekdays) while the patient remains in ICU, censored at 28 days after randomisation.</description>
