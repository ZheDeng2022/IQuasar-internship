  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is a life threatening condition and is defined by 1) a&#xD;
      weight-for-height Z-score more than three standard deviations (SD) below the median based on&#xD;
      the 2006 World Health Organization (WHO) growth standards, 2) a mid-upper arm circumference&#xD;
      (MUAC) of less than 115 mm or 3) by the presence of nutritional edema. Signs such as edema,&#xD;
      mucocutaneous changes, hepatomegaly, lethargy, anorexia, anemia, severe immune deficiency and&#xD;
      rapid progression to mortality characterize a state commonly coined as &quot;complicated SAM&quot;.&#xD;
      Kwashiorkor is one of the forms of complicated SAM commonly distinguished by the unmistakable&#xD;
      presence of bipedal edema. SAM results in high mortality rates of up to half a million child&#xD;
      deaths annually. Undernourished children are at higher risk of mortality ranging from&#xD;
      three-times more risk among children with moderate malnutrition to 10-times in SAM children&#xD;
      compared to well-nourished children. Children with complicated SAM require inpatient&#xD;
      treatment in specialized centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Rehabilitation and Nutritional Education Center&quot; (CREN) is a specialized center in&#xD;
      Burkina Faso receiving on average 10 SAM children per day. Recovery rate is lower than&#xD;
      international standards; and adverse events and mortality remain strikingly high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to assess the underlying risk factors affecting the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the nutritional therapeutic treatment protocol for complicated SAM children&#xD;
      under 5 years of age who have been referred to the CREN, at the Centre Hôspitalier&#xD;
      Universitaire Souro, Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objective of this study is to better understand underlying risk factors&#xD;
      associated with a lower recovery rate and high mortality in complicated SAM children referred&#xD;
      to CREN for inpatient care. Risk factors associated with poor response to a standard dietary&#xD;
      treatment at any phase will be assessed retrospectively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute malnutrition (SAM), defined as severe wasting [weight-to-height Z-score &lt; -3&#xD;
      standard deviations (SD), based on the WHO Child Growth Standards] and / or the presence of&#xD;
      nutritional edema, and / or mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) &lt;115 mm, is a condition that&#xD;
      requires urgent attention and appropriate management to reduce mortality and promote recovery&#xD;
      among children. Management of SAM children without complications is provided at the community&#xD;
      level. Hospitalization in specialized care centers is necessary for SAM children with&#xD;
      complications. SAM children with comorbidities have a greater risk of mortality and treatment&#xD;
      failure. The knowledge of the specific adequate nutritional needs of SAM is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the treatment of SAM in hospital, the WHO recommends the use of therapeutic milk low in&#xD;
      protein 'F75' in the stabilization phase; and more protein-rich F100 or F75 combined with&#xD;
      ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTF) in the transition phase. The WHO also recommends using&#xD;
      as an alternative formula made of cereal flour, skimmed milk powder, oil, sugar, and a&#xD;
      therapeutic vitamin and mineral complex (CMV), in case of shortage of the standard&#xD;
      therapeutic milk F75 / F100 or in case of signs of intolerance (vomiting, diarrhea).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Refeeding Center - Centre de Récupération et d'Education Nutritionnelle (CREN) of the&#xD;
      Sourô Sanou University Hospital Center (CHUSS) in Burkina Faso specializes in the care of SAM&#xD;
      children with complications. In 2018, out of 500 children aged 6-59 months admitted for SAM&#xD;
      with complications, the CHUSS CREN registered 86.8% full recovery, 8.2% dropout and 5% death.&#xD;
      Although the recovery rate is higher than international standards (greater than 75%), the&#xD;
      mortality rate remains higher than the recommended 3% by international standards; in addition&#xD;
      to the challenges that are faced locally in maintaining high standards of care. At the CREN,&#xD;
      the investigators and the nurses observed that some SAM children with complications can have&#xD;
      severe diarrhea and vomiting after taking F75 (first phase of the nutritional treatment). It&#xD;
      was also observed that other SAM children with edema, whose edema resolved in the first phase&#xD;
      of treatment under F75, redeveloped edema when they received RUTF (Plumpy Nut®) in the&#xD;
      transition phase according to the WHO 2013 protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project, which will be subdivided into a retrospective study and two&#xD;
      prospective clinical trials aims to assess the risk factors affecting the response to dietary&#xD;
      treatment in this center (the CREN, Burkina Faso) and to compare alternatives for treatment&#xD;
      during the nutritional rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retrospective study assesses the factors of failure of dietary treatment in the three&#xD;
      phases of nutritional rehabilitation to better understand underlying risk factors associated&#xD;
      with a lower recovery rate and high mortality in complicated SAM children referred to CREN&#xD;
      for inpatient care. Risk factors associated with poor response to a standard dietary&#xD;
      treatment at any phase will be assessed retrospectively and include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Errors in the treatment (feeding) dosage that can be due to errors in anthropometric&#xD;
           measurement and/or in reading the feeding regimen table by the CREN team;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Low adherence of children to the therapeutic dietary regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Comorbidities associated with malnutrition that can have an effect on the dietary&#xD;
           treatment effectiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Types of dietary regimen selected during the first phase of treatment [F75 vs.&#xD;
           alternative F75 (cereal flour, oil, sugar, powdered milk) with OR without CMV)] and&#xD;
           during the transition phase [F75 + RUTF ( Plumpy-Nut®), F100, alternative F75 (with and&#xD;
           without CMV) + RUTF (Plumpy Nut®)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use data collected during admission and follow-up of SAM children with&#xD;
      complications admitted at the CREN of the CHUSS from January 2014 to December 2018.&#xD;
