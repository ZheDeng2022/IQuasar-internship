  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transvaginal pelvic mesh implantation（TVM） is a foreign body implantation operation with&#xD;
      intraoperative colonization of vaginal bacteria. However, the vaginal microbiome-host&#xD;
      interaction and its influence in the mechanism of mesh exposure after TVM remains unclear.&#xD;
      This study will enroll post-TVM patients with and without mesh exposure and use their vaginal&#xD;
      swabs to perform TRACE-seq and cytokine analysis. The microbiome-host interactions related&#xD;
      with mesh exposure and the changes in protein expression will be analyzed.&#xD;

    <description>During the physical examination, a speculum was inserted into the vagina to observe the vaginal epithelium for mesh exposure. If the mesh is not seen on surface of the vaginal mucosa, bimanual examination will be performed to confirm no foreign body can be feeled on surface of the vaginal mucosa. Then the patient belong to this group.</description>
