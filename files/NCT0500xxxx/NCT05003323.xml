  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This case-control study in patients with knee osteoarthritis and pain-free control&#xD;
      individuals aims to develop a brain biomarker of endogenous analgesia that may be used in&#xD;
      subsequent clinical trials. Deficits in central nervous system (CNS) pain inhibition may&#xD;
      contribute to chronic pain intensity, but quantitative sensory testing (QST) methods are&#xD;
      limited. Incorporating brain imaging to assessments of CNS pain inhibition, by examining&#xD;
      activity in relevant brain networks, would allow for an objective, physiologic measure of CNS&#xD;
      pain inhibition. Preliminary data in pain-free volunteers implicate cortical activity&#xD;
      measured with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during CNS pain inhibition.&#xD;
      Broadly, the investigators hypothesize that variability in CNS pain inhibition contributes to&#xD;
      variability in clinical pain intensity.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to identify the neural correlates of central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS) pain inhibition in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and determine how the&#xD;
      correlates relate to clinical chronic (i.e., greater than 6 months) knee pain. To attain this&#xD;
      objective, the investigators will test the following working hypotheses: (H1) in knee OA&#xD;
      patients with moderate osteoarthritis but severe knee pain, cortical correlates of CNS pain&#xD;
      inhibition are diminished compared to patients with less knee pain and (H2) provocation of&#xD;
      clinical knee pain with ambulation produces greater pain-related cortical activation in&#xD;
      patients with greater clinical knee pain at baseline. The study will also compare patients&#xD;
      with knee OA to a control group to test the hypothesis (H3) that CNS pain inhibition&#xD;
      behavioral and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) brain imaging measures are&#xD;
      diminished in knee OA. Finally, in exploratory analysis, the investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      cortical functional connectivity is altered in patients with greater knee pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study approach is to measure brain activity in patients with knee osteoarthritis, divided&#xD;
      into high pain intensity and low pain intensity groups, and in pain-free controls with fNIRS&#xD;
      scanning during rest, quantitative sensory testing (QST) measures of CNS pain inhibition&#xD;
      (conditioned pain modulation and offset analgesia), and walking and stair climbing tasks. The&#xD;
      rationale is that successful completion of this study will determine whether fNIRS measures&#xD;
      relate to QST measures of CNS pain inhibition and clinical pain intensity both at rest and&#xD;
      during activity. This fundamental knowledge, in combination with prior studies of conditioned&#xD;
      pain modulation (CPM), will be important to understanding how CNS pain inhibition may&#xD;
      contribute to a range of chronic pain syndromes.&#xD;
