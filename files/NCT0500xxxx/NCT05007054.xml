      The long-term outcome of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI), and medical therapy (MT) alone for triple-vessel disease (TVD) patients&#xD;
      is controversial. The aim of this study is to evaluate the long-term outcome of TVD patients&#xD;
      among these three treatment strategies, to find out the most appropriate treatment methods&#xD;
      for these patients.&#xD;

      The present study was a retrospective observational study. Patients who underwent diagnostic&#xD;
      coronary angiography from January 2013 to December 2018 were eligible for this study if they&#xD;
      had three-vessel disease, which was defined as more than 50% stenosis in three major&#xD;
      epicardial coronary arteries, left anterior descending, left circumﬂex, and right coronary&#xD;
      artery. There were no pre-specified exclusion criteria. The choice of PCI, CABG, or MT was&#xD;
      mainly followed the guidelines and based on clinical and angiographic features, physical&#xD;
      condition (comorbidities, malignant tumor, frailty, etc.), complexity, and was discussed by&#xD;
      physicians and surgeons, combined with the choice of patients. The PCI strategy and stent&#xD;
      type were left to the physician's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint were major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), which&#xD;
      were a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), repeat revascularization, or&#xD;
      stroke. Clinical information of in-hospital outcome was obtained by reviewing medical&#xD;
      records. Follow-up was completed by survey via telephone, letter, or hospital visit. All&#xD;
      patients had at least one follow-up visit.&#xD;

    <description>Cardiac death was considered to be of cardiac origin cause could be established. MI was defined as recurrent symptoms with new electrocardiographic changes compatible with MI or cardiac markers at least twice the upper limit of normal. Repeat revascularization was defined as either PCI or CABG in the vessel for any reasons. Stroke was defined as ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke either occurring during hospitalization or requiring hospitalization for symptoms. Hospitalization for angina pectoris or heart failure heart failure was defined as hospitalization because of worsening angina pectoris or heart failure requiring intravenous drug therapy.</description>

Dual-antiplatelet medication was administered to the patients after PCI for at least 12 months.</description>
