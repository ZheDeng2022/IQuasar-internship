  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to provide 68Ga Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen-11 (68Ga&#xD;
      PSMA-11) for clinical use in the diagnosis, staging and restaging of prostate cancer using&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography with Computed Tomography (PET/CT) prior to its full local&#xD;
      Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Extensive research has shown that 68Ga PSMA-11&#xD;
      PET/CT offers higher detection rate of metastatic disease in prostate cancer than the current&#xD;
      standard of care usually used in staging and restaging prostate cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      68Ga PSMA-11 PET/CT offers higher detection rate of metastatic disease in prostate cancer&#xD;
      than the current standard of care of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI), and bone scintigraphy usually used in staging and restaging prostate cancer.&#xD;
      Furthermore, 68Ga PSMA-11 PET/CT offers a higher detection rate of primary and metastatic&#xD;
      prostate cancer compared to other available radiotracers used for prostate cancer. It&#xD;
      additionally offers enhanced imaging characteristics of greater sensitivity at lower prostate&#xD;
      specific antigen (PSA) values and higher target to background ratios than currently available&#xD;
      radiotracers. For these reasons, we feel that expanded access to 68Ga PSMA-11 offers better&#xD;
      patient care at comparable cost to standard imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population to be treated consists of men in whom metastatic or recurrent prostate cancer&#xD;
      is suspected. Patients will be recruited primarily from the clinical practices of the&#xD;
      University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) and Parkland Health and Hospital&#xD;
      System. Additional patients may be referred for recruitment from physicians outside UTSW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will receive an IV injection of 68Ga PSMA-11 as a bolus intravenous injection.&#xD;
      Depending on patient medical history and Radiology physician preference, the patient may also&#xD;
      be injected with 20 milligrams (mg) of furosemide to encourage urination, and the patient&#xD;
      will void immediately prior to getting on the scan table. Patients will be scanned on a&#xD;
      PET/CT scanner. The patient will be positioned with arms elevated above the head.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients with suspected recurrence based on elevated serum prostate specific&#xD;
                  antigen (PSA) level.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients with suspected metastasis who are candidates for initial definitive&#xD;
                  therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to lie still for approximately 20 - 40 minutes for the PET/CT&#xD;
             scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be deemed medically stable by their treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have the ability and willingness to sign a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not weigh more than the maximum weight limit for the PET/CT scanner&#xD;
             table (&gt; 225 kilograms or 500 pounds).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of&#xD;
             similar chemical or biologic composition to 68Ga PSMA-11.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be claustrophobic.&#xD;
