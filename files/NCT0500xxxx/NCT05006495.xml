    <textblock>
      Investigators performed a prospective randomized controlled trial for comparing postoperative&#xD;
      clinical and radiological outcomes between C3 laminectomy with laminoplasty and C3-6&#xD;
      laminoplasty.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical laminoplasty is widely performed surgical techniques to cervical myelopathy&#xD;
      patients. But it is well known that C3-6 Cervical laminoplasty often results in injury of the&#xD;
      semispinalis cervicis inserted into the axis, which possibly causes postoperative cervical&#xD;
      kyphosis and neck pain. C3 laminectomy with cervical laminoplasty is the modified technique&#xD;
      preserving the semispinalis cervicis to reduce such complications of conventional C3-6&#xD;
      laminoplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been a number of retrospective studies comparing C3 laminectomy with laminoplasty&#xD;
      and C3-6 laminoplasty, however, there's no prospective randomized controlled study yet.&#xD;
      Investigators performed a prospective randomized controlled trial for comparing postoperative&#xD;
      clinical and radiological outcomes between C3 laminectomy with laminoplasty and C3-6&#xD;
      laminoplasty. Primary end points include the Neck Disability Index(NDI), the Visual Analog&#xD;
      Scale(VAS) of neck pain, and the C2-7 Spine Cobb angle at postoperative 1 year.&#xD;
