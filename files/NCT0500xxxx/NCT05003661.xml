  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-risk neonates are forced to be separated from their parents due to hospitalization, and&#xD;
      clinical medical treatment often causes pain and physical stress in high-risk newborns. Many&#xD;
      literatures have confirmed that the mother's voice is positively helpful to the physiology of&#xD;
      high-risk newborns, but few studies have been conducted on the father's voice. However, the&#xD;
      parenting process is not only a link between the mother-child relationship, but also the&#xD;
      impact of parental voice on high-risk newborns infants. Parent roles are expecting. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to explore the effectiveness of parental voice intervention in&#xD;
      high-risk newborns' heel puncture in reducing pain, and to further compare the mother and&#xD;
      father's voice characteristics to the analysis of the pain degree of high-risk newborns.&#xD;

      This study is a kind of experimental research design. The subjects are 105 infants with&#xD;
      gestational weeks of more than 32 weeks. Randomly allocated are divided into one group of 35&#xD;
      in control group and 35 in each experimental group. On the third day after the birth of the&#xD;
      high-risk newborns infant, the heel puncture times is lasted three minutes before the heel&#xD;
      puncture to ten minutes after the puncture. The control groups only received general routine&#xD;
      care, while the two parental experimental groups received the intervention that recording of&#xD;
      parents voice of reading children's book. In the three groups, the pain of high-risk newborns&#xD;
      was measured with the Heartbeat, Respiration and Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) in three&#xD;
      minutes before the heel puncture, during the puncture, and the first, fifth and tenth minutes&#xD;
      after the puncture. It is hoped that the results of this study can help high-risk newborns to&#xD;
      reduce pain with non-drug measures, and understand the influence of different voice&#xD;
      characteristics on the development of infants, so as to provide future care personnel&#xD;
      assisting parental role expectation and reference of clinical care.&#xD;
