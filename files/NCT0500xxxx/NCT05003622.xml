  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study to investigate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of encorafenib 300 mg once daily (QD) monotherapy in adult Chinese participants&#xD;
      with B-RAF Proto-oncogene, Serine/threonine Kinase V600E (BRAF V600E) mutant advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors (unresectable metastatic melanoma or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)),&#xD;
      who are BRAF-inhibitor treatment-naïve and have failed the previous therapy(ies) in the&#xD;
      metastatic setting or are not eligible to standard therapy. Participants will be eligible for&#xD;
      the study based on identification of a BRAF V600E mutation in tumor tissue by a local&#xD;
      National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) approved assay obtained prior to screening.&#xD;
