      The course of AMN-related disabilities over time is poorly or incompletely understood due to&#xD;
      a limited number of patients and lack of treatments. This study will help obtain a better&#xD;
      understanding of the progression of disease with AMN and facilitate efficient clinical&#xD;
      development of future interventional medications.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Progressive weakness and spasticity of the legs are characteristics of numerous disorders and&#xD;
      conditions, including those that are inherited neurological disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) is an example of an inherited form of spastic paraplegia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation&#xD;
      in the ABCD1 gene localized to the X-chromosome (Xq28). The ABCD1 gene encodes a peroxisomal&#xD;
      adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding cassette transporter responsible for transport of very&#xD;
      long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) from the cytosol into the peroxisome for degradation. A&#xD;
      mutation in ABCD1 results in reduction in the degradation of the VLCFA by peroxisomal&#xD;
      β-oxidation, and saturated VLCFA, in particular C26:0, accumulate in tissues and body fluids&#xD;
      (i.e., brain, nervous system, adrenal glands). One of the key clinical symptoms during aging&#xD;
      of ALD patients is a slowly progressive axonopathy affecting sensory ascending and motor&#xD;
      descending spinal cord tracts with 100% penetrance in men, an ALD phenotype known as AMN.&#xD;
      There are no treatment options available, which leaves AMN patients with a progressive&#xD;
      disorder that leads to lifelong physical disability. The progressive dying-back axonopathy&#xD;
      represents the core clinical feature of AMN, with onset usually between 20 and 30 years of&#xD;
      age in male participants. The initial symptoms include progressive stiffness and weakness of&#xD;
      the legs, impaired vibration and position senses in the lower limbs, falls, sphincter&#xD;
      disturbances and impotence, as well as scarce scalp hair (alopecia). About 66% of male AMN&#xD;
      patients have adrenocortical insufficiency (Addison disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The course of AMN-related disabilities over time is poorly or incompletely understood due to&#xD;
      a limited number of patients and lack of treatments. This study will help obtain a better&#xD;
      understanding of the progression of disease with AMN and facilitate efficient clinical&#xD;
      development of future SwanBio interventional medications.&#xD;
