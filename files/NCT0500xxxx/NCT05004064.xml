  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, multicentre, single arm, open label pilot study to assess the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of acalabrutinib in combination with rituximab for previously untreated elderly&#xD;
      frail mantle cell lymphoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      26 patients will be recruited from 12 UK centres over 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive acalabrutinib and rituximab for up to six cycles. The cycle length is&#xD;
      28 days. Specifically, patients will receive acalabrutinib, orally, at a dose of 100 mg twice&#xD;
      daily for 28 days and rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 (+/-3) of each cycle.*&#xD;
      Patients with any degree of response at the Week 12 (end of cycle 3) and Week 24 assessments&#xD;
      (end of cycle 6) will continue with acalabrutinib monotherapy at a dose of 100 mg twice daily&#xD;
      until disease progression, the development of unacceptable toxicity or any other reason&#xD;
      (whichever occurs sooner).&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Note: Acalabrutinib may be administered at a dose of 100 mg od po for cycle 1 day 1-7 at&#xD;
      the local investigator's discretion. The dose should be escalated to full dose (100 mg bd) by&#xD;
      day 8, cycle 1 if no toxicity (see dose modification section). Rituximab may be administered&#xD;
      subcutaneously at a flat dose of 1400 mg from cycle 2 onwards following an intravenous dose&#xD;
      of 375 mg/m2 in cycle 1. Consider splitting the first dose of rituximab at cycle 1 in the&#xD;
      minority of MCL patients presenting with a white cell count of &gt;25 x 109/L. Consider&#xD;
      splitting 25mg/m2 on Day 1 and 350mg/m2 on Day 2 of cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed up for a minimum of 2 years following being registered into the&#xD;
      trial. For patients that have been in follow-up for more than 2 years, annual survival and&#xD;
      disease status follow-up will continue until the end of the trial.&#xD;
