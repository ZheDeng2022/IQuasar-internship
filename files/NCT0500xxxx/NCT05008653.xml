  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SnapMe Study is a single-group, prospective study that requires healthy adults to&#xD;
      maintain food diaries in order to develop benchmark data for the prediction of food&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to develop a method that uses photography to accurately&#xD;
      calculate the types and amounts of nutrients in meals that are consumed by healthy&#xD;
      participants, thereby replacing the use of electronic food records. Researchers expect about&#xD;
      100 healthy individuals at UC Davis and around the U.S. will join to participate in this&#xD;
      research. Participation in this study will involve taking pictures of every meal and snack&#xD;
      the individual consumes using a smartphone for 3 days (2 weekdays, 1 weekend day) and&#xD;
      uploading the images to a mobile phone application called Bitesnap. In addition, the&#xD;
      participant will be asked to complete online food records on the same days using the&#xD;
      Automated Self-Administered 24-hour Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24-2020). Each participant&#xD;
      will have 4 weeks to complete the study. The study website can be viewed here:&#xD;
