        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unilateral lower extremity DVT occlusion involving iliac and/or common femoral veins&#xD;
             with up to 2 cm extension in the inferior vena cava (IVC) or femoral in combination&#xD;
             with iliac veins, including patients with extension of clot into the contralateral&#xD;
             common iliac vein&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute thrombotic or thromboembolic occlusion with symptom duration of 14 days or less&#xD;
             at presentation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Frontline treatment with Indigo Aspiration System in the target venous segment per&#xD;
             Investigator decision&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is ≥18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent is obtained per Institutional Review Board requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication to systemic or therapeutic doses of anticoagulants&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication to iodinated contrast venography that cannot be adequately&#xD;
             premedicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete infrarenal IVC occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the index leg: prior DVT&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior stent in target venous segment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment of index DVT with thrombolytics within 14 days prior to index procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pulmonary embolism (PE) defined as either high (systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg&#xD;
             and/or patient on IV vasoactive medication to support blood pressure), or intermediate&#xD;
             high-risk PE, as defined by the European Society Guideline on management of PE. Low&#xD;
             risk PE and/or intermediate low risk PE can be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known coagulation disorders both acquired (e.g., Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia,&#xD;
             etc.) or genetic (e.g., Factor V Leiden, etc.), thrombophilia, or hypercoagulable&#xD;
             state&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy &lt;1 year due to comorbidities&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active cancer: metastatic, progressive, or treated with chemotherapy or radiation&#xD;
             therapy in the last 6 months, with the exception of patients with non-melanoma primary&#xD;
             skin cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current participation in another investigational drug or device study that may&#xD;
             confound the results of this study. Studies requiring extended follow-up for products&#xD;
             that were investigational but have since become commercially available are not&#xD;
             considered investigational studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other medical, behavioral, or psychological conditions that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, precludes the patient from appropriate consent, could limit the&#xD;
             patient's ability to participate in the study, including compliance with follow-up&#xD;
             requirements, or that could impact the scientific integrity of the study&#xD;
