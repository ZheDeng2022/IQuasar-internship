  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Dashboard Activated Services and tele-Health for Heart Failure (DASH-HF) study is a&#xD;
      pragmatic randomized controlled trial of a quality improvement (QI) intervention of a&#xD;
      prospective panel management intervention to optimize medical treatment for Veterans with&#xD;
      heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) compared to the receipt of usual VA&#xD;
      health care services over a 6-month period of observation. The study will incorporate the&#xD;
      existing VA Academic Detailing Heart Failure Dashboard (ADHFD) to target actionable patients&#xD;
      with gaps in performance measures for guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMT). Patients&#xD;
      with HFrEF are optimally managed by cardiovascular specialty clinics. Typically, patients are&#xD;
      referred to cardiology or heart failure (HF) clinics from primary care, emergency department,&#xD;
      or post-hospitalization clinicians and scheduled into clinic grids. These patients may be&#xD;
      lost to follow-up or clinicians may miss opportunities to optimize GDMT for HFrEF. GDMT&#xD;
      includes Class I indicated medications from the following classes: beta blockers (BB),&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB),&#xD;
      angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist&#xD;
      (MRA), sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i). The intervention is designed around&#xD;
      a novel prospective panel management clinic led by clinicians or clinical pharmacists using&#xD;
      impromptu patient telephone calls or electronic communications with existing responsible&#xD;
      clinicians.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, pragmatic QI study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of proactive&#xD;
      panel management to close gaps in evidence-based care for patients with HFrEF. The&#xD;
      investigators will use the VA's ADHFD to generate a list of actionable patients with HFrEF&#xD;
      and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%. After identifying a cohort of HFrEF&#xD;
      patients from the ADHFD, the investigators will randomize individual patients on the&#xD;
      actionable list to usual VA care or a novel proactive panel management clinic. Clinicians&#xD;
      will be trained on how to use the dashboard information to identify opportunities for&#xD;
      optimization based on detailed chart review. The proactive panel management intervention will&#xD;
      use clinicians to perform an electronic chart review and call patients impromptu at their&#xD;
      discretion to evaluate HFrEF management and opportunities to optimize GDMT. Each panel&#xD;
      management clinic is staffed by a single cardiovascular clinician or trainee with cardiology&#xD;
      (PI) supervision. All patients will receive chart review or telehealth notes brought to the&#xD;
      attention of primary care and cardiology clinicians. Patients randomized to the intervention&#xD;
      will only receive one chart review during a half-day panel management clinic with follow-up&#xD;
      of any laboratory results or diagnostic tests as required and referral to HF or general&#xD;
      cardiology clinic as deemed appropriate. The control arm consists of the usual delivery of&#xD;
      health services with routine scheduled appointments for primary care or cardiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be assessed at 6-months from the last patient to receive the intervention. The&#xD;
      study is powered to detect superiority of the intervention compared to usual care in&#xD;
      optimizing GDMT for HFrEF. Treatment assignment is based on 1:1 randomization using fixed&#xD;
      blocks (size=6) to assure an equivalent number of patients randomized to the intervention and&#xD;
      usual care. Patients are randomized after a list of 300 actionable patients are generated&#xD;
      from the ADHFD. Study participant numbers will be assigned to the list of patients sorted by&#xD;
      optimization scores in Excel. The supervising statistician (AA) will generate concealed&#xD;
      randomization assignments by participant identification numbers. The randomization&#xD;
      assignments will be merged with baseline study dataset and exported as password protected&#xD;
      Excel and PDF documents. Study investigators will divide the intervention arm into lists of&#xD;
      10 to 15 per half-day clinic. Patients not receiving chart review or phone call attempts will&#xD;
      be reassigned to future panel management clinics until all patients receive the intervention.&#xD;
      Patients that did not answer phone calls will receive chart review notes for primary care and&#xD;
      cardiology clinicians and not be reassigned to future panel management clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants do not require informed consent as determined by the VA IRB review.&#xD;
      Patients will receive all accepted standards of care and medications approved by the Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration for HFrEF indications. The VA Subcommittee for Research and Safety found&#xD;
      an absence of any declared research-laboratory-based biohazards and granted exemption from&#xD;
      continued review. The study will evaluate the effectiveness of the QI intervention,&#xD;
      telephone/telemedicine panel management clinics, to more rapidly implement evidence-based&#xD;
      care for patients with HFrEF. Patients in the usual care arm will be unaware they are part of&#xD;
      the control group for the RCT. Intervention patients nor study staff are blinded to usual&#xD;
      care or intervention assignments. Patients that receive the intervention will be informed&#xD;
      this is a pilot quality improvement effort with informal consent before proceeding to the&#xD;
      clinical interventions. Intervention patients may refuse to participate after being contacted&#xD;
      by phone in the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study enrollment is based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria used to filter the ADHFD&#xD;
      list. A list of actionable patients with HFrEF will be exported for randomization. The GDMT&#xD;
      optimization score will be automated for each patient on the extracted list (Table 1). A&#xD;
      sample of 300 patients will be selected with the lowest GDMT composite scores. Once the final&#xD;
      sample of the study is determined, patients will be randomized to usual care or the&#xD;
      intervention. Intervention patients will be divided into smaller lists of 10 to 15 patients.&#xD;
      These smaller lists will be assigned to proactive panel management clinics. Clinicians&#xD;
      staffing the intervention clinics will review ADHFD data, review the electronic health record&#xD;
      (EHR) and decide whether to proceed to evaluate and recommend treatment over the phone to&#xD;
      patients directly. If clinicians did not have sufficient time to review all patients on their&#xD;
      clinic list, they will be redistributed to future intervention clinics. Intervention clinics&#xD;
      will be held until each patient assigned the intervention has a chart review or attempted&#xD;
      telephone contact. A failure to contact a patient will trigger a letter to a patient or&#xD;
      electronic communication to their primary care or cardiology clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to each ADHFD telehealth clinic (half-day clinic lasting 4 to 4.5 hours), clinicians&#xD;
      will be sent a secure email that will include a password-protected Excel document of 15&#xD;
      patients with exported clinical summary data from the ADHFD. Clinicians will be instructed to&#xD;
      chart-review patients and decide if an opportunity exists to further optimize the receipt of&#xD;
      GDMT. Clinicians will also be given a document providing guidance on the sequence of GDMT&#xD;
      optimization based on latest guidelines and VA policies (Supplement S1 GDMT Guidance&#xD;
      Document). If a patient does not qualify for further optimization (i.e. chart documentation&#xD;
      of prior intolerance, patient preference), a short note in the electronic health record (EHR)&#xD;
      will document the chart review and inform the primary care clinician that based on chart&#xD;
      review, no opportunity currently exists but they may consider further GDMT titration in the&#xD;
      future. If a patient appears to have an opportunity for further titration, the clinician is&#xD;
      encouraged to call the patient to see if they are available to discuss their HF care. If the&#xD;
      patient agrees, a telehealth visit will take place over phone or switch to video. A formal&#xD;
      telehealth cardiology visit will occur at the time of care. If the patient is interested but&#xD;
      does not have time for a visit, a brief telephone note will be placed and a request for a&#xD;
      future cardiology clinic visit will be requested. If a formal telehealth visit occurs,&#xD;
      clinicians will be asked to inquire about key details around medication titration (Supplement&#xD;
      S2 Interview Guide). The data from chart review and interviews will be documented on a&#xD;
      password-protected Excel document (Supplement S3 Clinician Documentation Form). Any&#xD;
      medication addition or titration will have indicated laboratory labs ordered per usual care.&#xD;
      Lastly, clinicians will also be asked to administer a short survey with each participant&#xD;
      based on a template at the end of the call proactive phone call (Supplement S2 Interview&#xD;
      guide). Primary care and regular cardiology clinicians will be notified of any changes in&#xD;
      medication management in the EHR. The study's lead (BZ, AV) will be available by phone to&#xD;
      answer questions or problems that arise during the clinic. Supervision of patient encounters&#xD;
      by clinical pharmacists, medical trainees, or advanced practice nurse practitioners and study&#xD;
      protocols will be BZ as the licensed and boarded general cardiologist.&#xD;
