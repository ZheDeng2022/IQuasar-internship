  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, phase I/IIa, randomized, controlled, observer-blinded,&#xD;
      dose-escalation, multicentre clinical trial to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of COVID-19&#xD;
      HIPRA vaccine in adult healthy volunteers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population includes 30 healthy adults aged 18-39 which will be distributed in 3&#xD;
      cohorts, receiving three different doses of antigen, 10 µg, 20 µg and 40 µg. In each cohort,&#xD;
      patients will be randomized in ratio of 10:2 test:commercial vaccine, following an staggered&#xD;
      enrolment with a sentinel subject in each cohort. Each participant will receive 2&#xD;
      immunisations separated by 21 days, and will be followed for 48 weeks after the second dose&#xD;
