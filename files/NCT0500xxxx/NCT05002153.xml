  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This past century witnessed a significant increase in the prevalence of obesity, when since&#xD;
      1980 worldwide obesity has more than doubled. According to the World Health Organization, 39%&#xD;
      of adults from the age of 18 years or older are overweight while 13% are obese. Successful&#xD;
      maintenance of weight loss as losing at least 10% of the initial body weight and maintaining&#xD;
      it for at least one year. However, keeping the low body weight is rarely maintained, as 80%&#xD;
      of people who lost 10% of their body weight will return to their initial weight within a&#xD;
      year. When weight loss is maintained for 2-5 years the chance of long term success was shown&#xD;
      to dramatically increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is no agreement as to what contributes to the recurrent weight regain&#xD;
      phenomenon (also known as 'weight cycling' or 'yo-yo diet'), it is strongly associated with&#xD;
      the risk of developing metabolic risk factors and their complications including heart disease&#xD;
      and all-cause mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Altering the gut microbiota is one method to treat disease states associated with gut&#xD;
      bacteria. For instance, fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) or fecal bacteriotherapy, is the&#xD;
      process of transferring stool from a healthy donor to another. The goal of FMT is to restore&#xD;
      host health by increasing diversity and function of the gut microbiota. The main advantage of&#xD;
      FMT over probiotics is its ability to transplant the entire gut microbiota and metabolites&#xD;
      from the donor to the recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although numerous individual microbes have been identified as related to obesity, multiple&#xD;
      studies suggest that loss of microbial diversity has a stronger impact on the development of&#xD;
      metabolic dysfunction, this diversity may be restored by FMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine whether microbiome modulation might be a possible future target&#xD;
      against recurrent obesity in humans, and whether orally administered FMT from a lean donor,&#xD;
      post weight loss might be an effective intervention to prevent weight regain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a placebo-controlled, double blinded interventional study evaluating high intensity&#xD;
      oral fecal microbiota transplantation from lean healthy donors to prevent weight regain after&#xD;
      a successful weight loss intervention. Volunteers will be recruited in the following ways:&#xD;
      e-mail, and social media. Volunteers wishing to participate will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire regarding the aforementioned inclusion and exclusion criteria. Volunteers who&#xD;
      qualify for the study will be invited to an introductory meeting at the Weizmann Institute of&#xD;
      Science. The details of the experiment and potential risks or discomforts involved in it will&#xD;
      be presented, after which the volunteers will sign informed consent forms. Volunteers will&#xD;
      start the study and become active participants for a maximal duration of two years, depending&#xD;
      on the weight loss process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise of four parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline - one week of profiling and screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nutritional intervention - weight loss intervention which will be based on Mediterranean&#xD;
           hypocaloric diet restriction. Meetings will occur twice a month starting from the second&#xD;
           week of the study for a three-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. FMT/ Placebo intervention - 5 weekly cycles of high intensity lean donor FMT/placebo&#xD;
           will be administered starting after reaching a weight loss of 5 to 10% of total body&#xD;
           weight. Each cycle will consist of 10 capsules administered on two consecutive days&#xD;
           (total 100 capsules)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Follow-up meetings - total follow up of one year after FMT cycles. Meetings will occur&#xD;
           every month for the first 3 months of the study, and every 3 months, Afterwards.&#xD;
