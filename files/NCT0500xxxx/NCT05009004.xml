      The proposed Phase 1 project aims to develop and test Memento.HTN, an individually-tailored,&#xD;
      culturallysensitive digital health intervention comprised of a provider platform and linked&#xD;
      patient SMS system to promote medication adherence among African Americans with hypertension&#xD;
      (HTN), a group that suffers from disproportionate HTN morbidity and mortality. Memento.HTN&#xD;
      overcomes access barriers on the part of patients and adherence support implementation&#xD;
      barriers on the part of healthcare teams and systems. Memento.HTN is innovative in three key&#xD;
      ways: 1) it is the first-ever linked digital provider platform and patient SMS text system&#xD;
      for HTN medication adherence; 2) it is culturally-tailored for African Americans with HTN;&#xD;
      and 3) it has unique monitoring functionality allowing providers to monitor individual&#xD;
      patient adherence, support 'new start' patients, and track group adherence rates by drug&#xD;
      class, pill format, and patient demographics.&#xD;

      Abstract: Under the leadership of Patricia Weitzman, PhD, a multicultural, multidisciplinary&#xD;
      team of clinicians and researchers will collaborate to develop, formatively test, and&#xD;
      evaluate the short-effectiveness of a digital provider platform, called Memento.HTN, that is&#xD;
      integrated with a patient SMS text system, and designed to support medication adherence by&#xD;
      African Americans with hypertension (HTN). HTN is more common and more destructive for&#xD;
      African Americans than for any other ethnic group. More than half of African American adults,&#xD;
      about 15 million people, have HTN. Furthermore, African Americans are 4 times less likely to&#xD;
      adhere to HTN medications compared to their white counterparts. Tailored approaches to reduce&#xD;
      the racial gap in HTN morbidity and mortality, particularly those that support medication&#xD;
      adherence, are needed in primary care. Such approaches must overcome barriers due to cost or&#xD;
      geographic distance that can prevent African American patients from accessing adherence&#xD;
      support. These approaches must also overcome barriers to the delivery of adherence support&#xD;
      that stem from healthcare systems themselves. Importantly, HTN is one of most common&#xD;
      co-morbidities in Covid19 hospitalizations, particularly for African Americans (CDC 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, media coverage of a possible link between certain HTN meds, called RAAS inhibitors,&#xD;
      and severe Covid19 outcomes may have alarmed HTN patients about the safety of their meds. As&#xD;
      a result, the ACC (March, 2020) promptly issued guidelines recommending all patients adhere&#xD;
      to HTN meds during the pandemic unless advised by their physicians, as there is no evidence&#xD;
      of a link between HTN drugs and Covid19 severity. Thus, in the time of Covid19, supporting&#xD;
      medication adherence of African Americans with HTN is extremely urgent. Memento.HTN is&#xD;
      innovative in three key ways: 1) To our knowledge, it is the first-ever linked digital&#xD;
      provider platform and patient SMS text system for HTN medication adherence. 2) It is&#xD;
      culturally-tailored for African Americans with HTN. 3) It has unique monitoring functionality&#xD;
      allowing providers to monitor individual patient adherence; support 'new start' patients, who&#xD;
      are at increased risk for non-adherence; and track group adherence rates by drug class, pill&#xD;
      format, and patient demographics, which have never been included in any digital med adherence&#xD;
      intervention. Thus, the Memento.HTN system greatly simplifies and facilitates provider&#xD;
      delivery of adherence support to patients, while enhancing their clinical therapeutics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The provider platform sends patients interactive SMS-text pill reminders plus&#xD;
      culturally-sensitive motivational, educational, spiritual/stress-supportive, and customizable&#xD;
      texts, along with texts targeting intentional non-adherence and Covid19-related concerns.&#xD;
      Texts go directly to patient cellphones (no mobile app needed), making the intervention&#xD;
      accessible to patients who do not possess smartphones. Importantly, Memento allows 2-way&#xD;
      texting communication between providers and patients, and automatically alerts providers when&#xD;
      a patient has a clinically-significant pill lapse. We believe Memento has significant&#xD;
      commercial potential, as EHG has already developed plans for multiple digital adherence&#xD;
      interventions that will be marketed together to clinics serving large numbers of at-risk&#xD;
      patients. This B2B business model can generate large increases in revenues for customers,&#xD;
      making our products attractive from both a financial and health perspective.&#xD;
