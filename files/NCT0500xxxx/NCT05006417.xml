  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      10 participants with Recurrent Chronic Exertional Compartment Syndrome (R-CECS) will be&#xD;
      enrolled in a 6 month study at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that injection of Botox into the affected muscle group will alleviate pain&#xD;
      associated with R-CECS.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be enrolled in study at initial clinic visit by study staff at which time&#xD;
      diagnosis of R-CECS will be established based on elevated pressure measurements in patients&#xD;
      who have had surgical release of the affected compartments. Pressure testing will be&#xD;
      performed outside of the clinical study and will be required to establish the diagnosis of&#xD;
      R-CECS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial clinic visit with study staff will consist of baseline measurements of ankle&#xD;
      plantarflexion, dorsiflexion, inversion, and eversion strength using Kiio Force Sensor. The&#xD;
      clinic visit with study staff will establish time point 0 and will consist of written consent&#xD;
      for participation, Botox injection, and baseline University of Wisconsin Running Index&#xD;
      (UWRI). Two months following this visit, the participant will have follow up with study&#xD;
      staff. Study staff will again measure ankle strength (ankle inversion, eversion,&#xD;
      plantarflexion, and dorsiflexion) using the Kiio Force Sensor utilizing the same strength&#xD;
      assessment protocol. Study staff will monitor for side effects and administer the UWRI.&#xD;
      Telephone follow up assessment of the UWRI will be made by study staff at 4 and 6 months.&#xD;
