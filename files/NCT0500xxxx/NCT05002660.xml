  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a community randomized controlled trial to evaluate a civic engagement curriculum&#xD;
      through which residents will identify barriers and facilitators to healthy eating and&#xD;
      physical activity and then implement a project in their communities.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to better understand how resident-led activities to change&#xD;
      the community environment affect health. The Change Club is a small group of residents who&#xD;
      will try to change their community environment relative to food (for example, foods in&#xD;
      restaurants or schools) or physical activity opportunities (for example, parks or walking&#xD;
      trails) by following a step-wise process facilitated by an extension educator. The purpose of&#xD;
      this research is to better understand if and how these activities affect individual behaviors&#xD;
      (for example physical activity) and health outcomes (for example blood pressure) of adults in&#xD;
      rural communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place in 12 designated rural communities in Texas and New York. It is&#xD;
      planned that about 2,260 people will participate in this study. Some will participate as&#xD;
      Change Club members; some will participate as family and friends of Change Club members; and&#xD;
      others will participate as community residents.&#xD;
