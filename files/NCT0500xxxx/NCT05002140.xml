  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      XRD-0394 is a novel, potent, oral, small molecule dual inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia&#xD;
      mutated kinase (ATM) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) that&#xD;
      has selectivity compared with other phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK)&#xD;
      family enzymes. This is a first-time-in-human study, which means that it is the first time&#xD;
      the study drug is being used in humans. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of single doses of XRD-0394 administered with palliative radiotherapy (RT)&#xD;
      to subjects with metastatic, locally advanced, or recurrent cancer. The pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      profile and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of single-dose XRD-0394 administered in combination&#xD;
      with palliative RT will also be characterized.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-finding, PK and PD study of XRD-0394 in&#xD;
      subjects with metastatic, locally advanced, or recurrent cancer receiving palliative RT. The&#xD;
      study will evaluate single-dose PK of XRD-0394 administered to serial cohorts of subjects&#xD;
      with the intent of identifying an oral dose that achieves plasma drug concentrations within a&#xD;
      specified therapeutic range. Once target plasma concentrations of XRD-0394 are reached, one&#xD;
      or more PD cohorts of subjects will be enrolled in order to demonstrate inhibition of&#xD;
      radiation-induced ATM activity in tumor biopsy samples from subjects who received the&#xD;
      selected dose(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single Dose Escalation: Eligible subjects will be enrolled in serial cohorts to evaluate the&#xD;
      PK of single ascending doses of XRD-0394. Dose escalation of XRD-0394 will proceed based on a&#xD;
      standard 3+3 design. The starting dose of XRD-0394 will be 40 mg, followed by planned doses&#xD;
      of 80 mg and 160 mg. Following administration of a single-dose of XRD-0394 and completion of&#xD;
      RT, subjects will be evaluated for the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). The&#xD;
      available PK and safety data for each cohort will be reviewed at the conclusion of the DLT&#xD;
      evaluation period before the decision to escalate to the next dose is made. The evaluation of&#xD;
      additional doses of XRD-0394 will be determined based on the safety and PK data collected at&#xD;
      completed dose levels. Dose escalation may continue until the objectives of the study are met&#xD;
      and/or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of XRD-0394 is reached. PK samples for measurement of&#xD;
      plasma concentrations of XRD-0394 will be collected pre-dose and at specified time points&#xD;
      following XRD-0394 administration. Safety and tolerability of each XRD-0394 dose level will&#xD;
      be evaluated by assessment of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), DLTs, and&#xD;
      discontinuations due to TEAEs. A Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will be used during the&#xD;
      study to monitor subject safety and evaluate potential DLTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacodynamic Assessment: The dose identified to produce plasma drug concentrations of&#xD;
      XRD-0394 within a targeted therapeutic range will be further evaluated in separate PD&#xD;
      cohort(s) of subjects. Subjects enrolled in a PD cohort must have a target tumor with a soft&#xD;
      tissue component that is accessible for biopsy and must agree to undergo 1 biopsy during&#xD;
      their RT regimen. PK samples for measurement of plasma concentrations of XRD-0394 will be&#xD;
      collected from all subjects at pre-dose and at specified time points after XRD-0394&#xD;
      administration. Safety and tolerability of XRD-0394 will be evaluated by assessment of TEAEs.&#xD;

          -  One or more of the following sites of metastasis:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Skin&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subcutaneous or soft tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any other site that will allow the radiation dose to normal structures to remain&#xD;
                  within protocol-specified dosing limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤2.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  For subjects with cancers involving the spinal cord, the length of the spinal cord&#xD;
             requiring palliative treatment must be 10 cm or less.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of difficulty swallowing, malabsorption or other chronic gastrointestinal&#xD;
             disease or condition that may hamper compliance and/or absorption of XRD-0394, use of&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Significant cardiac conduction abnormalities, including a history of long corrected QT&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, biologic therapy, or any other&#xD;
             anticancer therapy within 14 days of first XRD-0394 dose. These treatments should also&#xD;
             be held for a minimum of 14 days after completion of RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects receiving bleomycin within 30 days of the first dose of XRD-0394.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects receiving treatment with any drug that is a strong inhibitor or inducer of&#xD;

             longer). In particular,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Glucocorticoids are inducers of CYP3A4. Therefore, dexamethasone, prednisone, or&#xD;
                  other glucocorticoids should not be administered within 14 days or 5 half-lives&#xD;

                  course of palliative RT is complete (and at least 24 hours after the&#xD;
                  administration of XRD-0394).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Gefitinib and imatinib are inhibitors of BCRP. Therefore, these agents should not&#xD;
                  be administered within 14 days or 5 half-lives prior to screening (whichever is&#xD;
                  longer) and should be held for a minimum of 14 days after completion of RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another investigational study of an unapproved drug or device or&#xD;
             treatment with another ATM, DNA-PK, or ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a QTc interval &gt;450 msec (calculated using Fridericia's QT correction&#xD;
