  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wilson's disease is a rare genetic disorder that causes copper to build up in the body. This&#xD;
      overload is initially localized in the liver and the brain, but can spread throughout the&#xD;
      body and cause systemic damage if copper chelation or zinc salt therapy is not implemented&#xD;
      quickly. Treatment should be taken daily and continued all the lifelong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients usually have a follow-up (clinical examination, ultrasound of the liver, blood and&#xD;
      urine samples) every six months in the maintenance phase of the disease and more frequently&#xD;
      in the event of destabilization of the disease which requires adaptation of the doses of&#xD;
      treatment or when initiating treatment. Some patients also benefit from regular psychological&#xD;
      follow-up and patients with a disabling neurological form may have physiotherapy, and speech&#xD;
      therapy. The Covid 19 pandemic has imposed the lockdown of the entire population, including&#xD;
      patients with Wilson's disease. The non-urgent care of these patients was therefore&#xD;
      suspended. Medical consultations and paramedical care (physiotherapy, speech therapy,&#xD;
      psychologist, etc.) have been postponed. Only very urgent hospitalizations in the event of&#xD;
      imbalance of their illness with life-threatening risk were maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wilson's disease patients could in this situation be particularly anxious and present&#xD;
      disturbances of their quality of life. The psychiatric consequences could not be limited to&#xD;
      the current period but also concern long-term patients, in particular if there is a worsening&#xD;
      of the disease. The consequences of inactivity and the end of specific treatments&#xD;
      (physiotherapy and speech therapy) could also be sources of aggravation. The behavioral and&#xD;
      cognitive characteristics of the disease and the major difficulties in adherence to treatment&#xD;
      already observed in this chronic disease, may suggest a repercussion of the pandemic in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consequences of the COVID pandemic in these fragile patients with a rare disease must be&#xD;
      assessed. It will be important to look at the consequences of the lockdown on the adherence&#xD;
      to treatment and on the course of the disease.&#xD;

      During the lockdown period, the first part of a detailed questionnaire is proposed to&#xD;
      Wilson's disease patients. The second part of the questionnaire will be carried out away from&#xD;
      the lockdown This is an observational, French multicenter study, of an uncontrolled cohort of&#xD;
      Wilsonian patients followed by doctors from the Wilson national reference centers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other: Questionnaires The questionnaires are WHOQOL-BREF (quality of life) Compliance&#xD;
      questionnaire with a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) from 0 to 100 Hospital Anxiety and Depression&#xD;

    <description>To describe the quality of life of Wilsonian patients during the COVID lockdown and at short and long term after it. Quality of life was measured using the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire The WHOQOL-BREF is a self-administered questionnaire comprising 26 questions on the individual's perceptions of their health and well-being over the previous two weeks. Responses to questions are on a 1-5 Likert scale where 1 represents &quot;disagree&quot; or &quot;not at all&quot; and 5 represents &quot;completely agree&quot; or &quot;extremely&quot;.&#xD;
Thethe World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF ( WHOQOL-BREF ) covers four domains each with specific facets</description>
