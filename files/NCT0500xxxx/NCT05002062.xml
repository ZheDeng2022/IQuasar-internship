  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a rising concern about quality of life of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients has&#xD;
      emerged. Cognitive dysfunction with primary fatigue and there correlation to the level of&#xD;
      disease inflammatory process has got great interest in MS research .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of using a computer-based cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy on primary fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and inflammatory biomarkers for&#xD;
      patients with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods A total of 40 MS patients (Expanded Disability Status Scale&lt;5) were&#xD;
      divided into two groups, both groups are suffering cognitive decline (using RehaCom software&#xD;
      to assess attention/concentration, memory and reaction behavior) with primary fatigue&#xD;
      according to the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS&gt;36). Patients with depression and sleep problems&#xD;
      were excluded from the study. Patients in both groups have elevated serum levels of tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in (G1) underwent conventional physical therapy program for MS including aerobic&#xD;
      training, resistive training and a flexibility program, patients in (G2) underwent an&#xD;
      intensive computer-based cognitive program for attention, concentration, memory and reaction&#xD;
      behavior using the RehaCom software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conventional physical therapy interventions for both (G1) sustained for three months, 45&#xD;
      minutes to 1 hour, 3 times/week. The computer-based cognitive behavioral therapy for patients&#xD;
      in (G2) was prescribed as following (45 minutes to 1 hour a session, 3 times/week for&#xD;
      continues three months).&#xD;

           from Faculty of Physical Therapy ,Cairo University out-patient clinic. The patients were&#xD;
           diagnosed and referred from a neurologist. All the patients were referred from a&#xD;
           neurologist as a clinically definite MS according to Mcdonald criteria. The diagnosis&#xD;
           was confirmed by MRI. The patients were assigned into two equal groups (Conventional&#xD;
           physical therapy program)(G1) &amp; ( Computer-based cognitive behavioral therapy)(G2).&#xD;

                     to a standard neurological examination before participating in the study(&#xD;
                     sensory, motor, coordination , balance, gait and fundus examination).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  All the patients were free from any other neurological problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Multiple sclerosis patients were subdivided into two equal groups&#xD;
                     (Conventional physical therapy program)(G1) &amp; ( Computer-based cognitive&#xD;
                     behavioral therapy)(G2).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  All included patients for both groups complained from fatigue for more than&#xD;
                     three months with total score of FSS ≥ 36.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  All included patients complained of a cognitive decline for more than three&#xD;
                     months ( including attention, concentration or memory problems according to&#xD;
                     the RehaCom scores)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  All the patients were ambulatory with mild to moderate disability according to&#xD;
                     the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) ≤ 5(Ambulatory without aid or rest&#xD;
                     for 200 meters).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) were&#xD;
                     elevated in all recruited patients for both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  All the patients were medically stable with absent or mild hemiparetic,&#xD;
                     ataxic, sensory or motor manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The main complain for all patients in both groups is the sense of fatigue and&#xD;
                     varying degrees of cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  All recruited MS Patients kept on their medications as glucocorticoids,&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Secondary causes of fatigue including severe depression ( beck depression inventory&#xD;
                (BDI ≥ 21) and sleep disturbance ( Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS ≥ 12)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inability to complete questionnaires study outcome measure as in severe cognitive&#xD;
                impairment and illiteracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed plaques within the cingulate&#xD;
                gyrus, insula , temporo-basal cortical areas or diffuse patchy frontal lesions as&#xD;
                they usually complain from cognitive impairment independent of fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Instrumentations &amp; Procedures :&#xD;
&#xD;
           A. Assessment Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Fatigue severity scale (FSS) : It is valid and reliable scale used to assess fatigue&#xD;
           severity in MS patients , and to distinguish fatigued MS patients from non fatigued MS&#xD;
           patients(Armutlu et al,2007). It is self reported questionnaire consisted of nine&#xD;
           sentences. A list of statements/questions is provided. These statements are related to&#xD;
           the different aspects of fatigue and how it affects the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)was used to exclude patients with fatigue&#xD;
           secondary to moderate to severe disability. It provides a total score on a scale that&#xD;
           ranges from zero to ten. The first levels 1.0 to 4.5 indicate people with a high degree&#xD;
           of ambulatory ability. The subsequent levels 5.0 to 9.5 indicate loss of ambulatory&#xD;
           ability. Grade (Zero) indicate normal neurologic exam. Grade (Five) indicate the ability&#xD;
           of the patient to ambulate without aid or rest for 200 meter but disability is severe&#xD;
           enough to impair full daily activities. (Ten) indicate death due to MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Beck depression inventory scale (BDI) was used to exclude patients suffering from&#xD;
           fatigue secondary to depression. It composed of twenty one questions each with four&#xD;
           possible responses ranging from &quot;zero to three&quot;. Each question assess a specific symptom&#xD;
           common among people with depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)was used to exclude the patients suffering from fatigue&#xD;
           secondary to sleep disturbance. It assess daytime sleepiness in people with multiple&#xD;
           sclerosis . It consists of eight questions regarding sleep in different physiological&#xD;
           and psychological conditions in multiple sclerosis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rehacom Software to assess cognitive function : It is a computer-based intensive&#xD;
           cognitive rehabilitation test used to assess patient's cognitive functions. It includes&#xD;
           32 assessment tasks for attention, memory , logical reasoning&amp; executive functioning. It&#xD;
           composes of regular PC , 1G RAM , DVD drive, 100 GB hard drive with windows XP SP3, 128&#xD;
           MB RAM direct 3D graphic card , Screen at least 19&quot; , regular PC keyboard or Rehacom&#xD;
           panel &amp; printer .The Rehacom software version is (patient enpult (1990-1997)&#xD;
           EN/ISO-13485-certified). It is characterized by easy handling, close to reality ,&#xD;
           motivating for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood analysis: A blood sample was collected from each patient in both groups before and&#xD;
           after the 4 months treatment intervention. Assessment of patients on immunomodulatory&#xD;
           therapy was postponed 36 hours from the last dose. Serum blood samples were immediately&#xD;
           stored on ice. TNF-α and IFN- γ were measured using The Quantikine Human TNF-alpha &amp;&#xD;
           IFN-gamma Immunoassay ELISA kit . It is a 3.5 or 4.5 hour solid phase ELISA designed to&#xD;
           measure human TNF-alpha &amp; IFN-gamma in cell culture supernates, serum, and plasma. It&#xD;
           contains E. coli-derived recombinant human TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and antibodies raised&#xD;
           against this protein and antibodies raised against the recombinant factor. It has been&#xD;
           shown to accurately quantities the recombinant factor&#xD;
           (http://www.rndsystems.com/Products/DIF57&amp;sta00c/aqQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. Treatment Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Conventional Physical Therapy Program for patients in (G1):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Including (aerobic training 20 minutes, resistive training 15 minutes and flexibility&#xD;
           program for 15 minutes), total conventional PT session timing (45 to one hour), 3 times&#xD;
           /week for subsequent 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Computer- based Cognitive training using Rehacom Software in addition to&#xD;
                Conventional Physical Therapy Program in (G2) :&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cognitive training including the attention/concentration, memory and reaction behavior&#xD;
           domains, The time of each cognitive training session(45 to one hour), 3 times /week for&#xD;
           consecutive 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Each domain in the cognitive training tests consists of one hundred levels of&#xD;
                difficulty . Each level has an average 22 subtests. The maximum period of the&#xD;
                session was about (60 minutes) for each patient with five minutes rest in between&#xD;
                each level.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In Rehacom cognitive training, each patient is trained according to his/her primary&#xD;
                cognitive level, which is predetermined during the assessment stage of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data Analysis and Statistical Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All analyses were performed on SPSS for Windows version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY,&#xD;
                USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At the baseline assessment, the mean values among the two groups were compared by&#xD;
                one-way ANOVA for independent samples for continuous data or chi squared for&#xD;
                categorical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The effects of the treatment pre-intervention and immediately post intervention&#xD;
                were examined using the two factor ANOVA with factors 'time' (baseline, immediately&#xD;
                post treatment intervention) on FSS ,RehaCom Cognitive domains' scores (&#xD;
                attention/concentration, memory &amp; reaction behavior), and serum levels data of&#xD;
                tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD), A p value less than 0.05 was&#xD;
                considered statistically significant.&#xD;
