  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have immune mediated diseases commonly undergo plasma exchange (PLEX) procedures&#xD;
      to remove pathological substances, typically believed to be antibodies. At our facility about&#xD;
      400 of these procedures are performed annually on 40-60 different patients. These procedures&#xD;
      are considered within the standard of care for these patients and are covered by insurance.&#xD;
      This study will not influence the treatment plan for subjects who participate in this study.&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to collect and cryopreserve blood biospecimens (plasma, serum,&#xD;
      PBMCs) for current and future studies. Any patient undergoing plasma exchange procedures will&#xD;
      be eligible for the study. Patients or the legally authorized representative (LAR) will be&#xD;
      consented for the study as soon as feasible after the are referred to DeGowin for plasma&#xD;
      exchange. The immediate objective of the study is to examine antibody levels (IgG/IgM) and&#xD;
      BAFF levels in the blood of these patients over the course of the plasma exchange treatments.&#xD;
      Specimens and clinical data will be collected such that other immune factors that may&#xD;
      regulate B cell survival, proliferation and antibody secretion can be studied. Another goal&#xD;
      of the study is to isolate and cryopreserve PBMCs at different points during the patient's&#xD;
      treatment. This would allow the study of immune cells that may mediate these diseases. The&#xD;
      study will also follow pathological antibodies over time in these patients so biospecimens&#xD;
      can be obtained even after the completion of their course of plasma exchange treatments. The&#xD;
      collection of biospecimens and clinical information from these subjects will help us&#xD;
      understand the impact of plasma exchange on both normal and pathological immune factors in a&#xD;
      variety of patients undergoing these procedures.&#xD;
