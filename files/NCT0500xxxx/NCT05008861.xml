    <textblock>
      In this study, patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after first-line treatment&#xD;
      with PD-1/PDL-1 monoclonal antibody will be treated with Gut Microbiota reconstruction(such&#xD;
      as FMT) combined with PD-1/PDL-1 monoclonal antibody. We will evaluate the safety of FMT in&#xD;
      the treatment of advanced NSCLC, and analyze the effect of FMT on intestinal flora and&#xD;
      immunophenotype of patients.&#xD;
