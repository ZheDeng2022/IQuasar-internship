    <textblock>
      This study was planned to examine the effect of education based on learning styles in&#xD;
      diabetic individuals who are incompatible with treatment, on treatment compliance and&#xD;
      metabolic goals. The study was conducted as a randomized controlled study between&#xD;
      January-September 2021 in Dokuz Eylül University Training and Research Hospital Endocrinology&#xD;
      and Metabolic Diseases Polyclinic and Internal Medicine Polyclinic.&#xD;

      Among the individuals who applied to the outpatient clinic and were eligible for inclusion in&#xD;
      the study, the odd numbers were assigned to the application group, and the even numbers to&#xD;
      the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The practice group of 30 people and the control group were divided into 3 groups as auditory&#xD;
      (n: 10), visual (n: 10) and physical learners (n: 10). Research data; The Individual&#xD;
      Identification Form was collected using the Patient Compliance Scale for Type 2 DM Treatment,&#xD;
      the BIG 16 Learning Styles Inventory, the Standardized Mini Mental Test (SMMT) and the&#xD;
      Metabolic Goal Control Form. The training group was given according to the learning styles.&#xD;
      The auditory group in the post-training practice group; calling by phone, to the visual&#xD;
      group; By SMS, to the physical group; reminder alerts were made by phone + SMS. Standard&#xD;
      training was given to the control group. Metabolic target values of the application and&#xD;
      control groups were examined at 3 and 6 months after the training.&#xD;
