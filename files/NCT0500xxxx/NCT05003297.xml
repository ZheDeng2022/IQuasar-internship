  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to short hospital stay, rapid return to work, less pain, and good cosmetic results,&#xD;
      laparoscopic hysterectomy ( LH) has substantially increased the era of hysterectomy&#xD;
      procedures especially for the last two decades. The main reason for this is probably that LH&#xD;
      leads to fewer inflammatory responses when compared to open abdominal hysterectomy. Although&#xD;
      the inflammatory response is supposed to be lower with total laparoscopic hysteroscopy (TLH),&#xD;
      unpredictable inflammatory response as a result of the operation has been still unenlightened&#xD;
      and it can be associated with hospital stay.&#xD;

      IInflammatory response after surgery is an ordinary outcome which ends up with tissue repair.&#xD;
      The increase in neutrophil levels accompanied with a decrease in lymphocyte levels is&#xD;
      characteristic for the inflammatory response. Therefore, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR)&#xD;
      comes out as a simple index of inflammation. In the literature, NLR was shown not only to be&#xD;
      associated with surgical complications but also the length of hospital stays in certain&#xD;
      surgeries. Another inflammatory marker index of hemogram is the platelet to lymphocyte ratio&#xD;
      (PLR). As a result of endothelial tissue damage, platelets are gathered in the affected area.&#xD;
      Therefore, an increase in the number of platelets is inevitable for inflammation. Hence, PLR&#xD;
      appears to be another simple index of inflammation due to the increase of platelets and the&#xD;
      decrease of lymphocytes. PLR has also shown to be associated with length of hospital stay in&#xD;
      various surgeries. NLR and PLR are both newly recommended inflammatory markers to estimate&#xD;
      the prognosis of surgical treatment in clinics. Investigations regarding NLR and PLR&#xD;
      concerning prognosis of patients after surgeries including gynecological cancer, cardiac&#xD;
      surgeries, and emergency surgeries are available in prior literature. Investigators aimed to&#xD;
      investigate the possible effects of inflammatory parameters, that can be easily obtained from&#xD;
      complete blood count in the post-operative first day of total laparoscopic hysterectomy, to&#xD;
      the length of hospital stay in patients without any complications.&#xD;
