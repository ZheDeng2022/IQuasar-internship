  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, repeat-dose, Phase 2 study of nedosiran in participants 5 years of age&#xD;
      or younger who have PH with relatively intact renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the up-to-35- day screening period, participants will return to the clinic for&#xD;
      monthly dosing visits through Day 180.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of this study is approximately 15 months from first participant, first&#xD;
      visit, until last participant, last visit.&#xD;
