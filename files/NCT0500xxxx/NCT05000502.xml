  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Understanding the impact exercise has on a cancer survivor's gut microbiome can improve the&#xD;
      health and well-being of cancer survivors by enhancing treatments targeting the gut&#xD;
      microbiome. Although scientific studies support a link between exercise and the gut&#xD;
      microbiome, rigorous randomized trials needed to confirm this causal link are limited and&#xD;
      usually involve supervised exercise. Hence, this proposal tests feasibility of a home-based,&#xD;
      remote-only research protocol that is more accessible to cancer survivors unable to attend&#xD;
      supervised exercise including but not limited to rural populations. This study will also&#xD;
      determine if exercise effects on the gut microbiome differ by factors such as race.&#xD;

      Forty physically inactive breast cancer survivors will be randomized into 10-week conditions&#xD;
      of home-based aerobic exercise training or standard attention control. All participants will&#xD;
      receive an energy-balanced, standardized diet. Assessments will occur at baseline and week 10&#xD;
      (post-intervention) by videoconference platform. Feasibility and changes in the gut&#xD;
      microbiome will be assessed.&#xD;
