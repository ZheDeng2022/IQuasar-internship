    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy (how well the medicines work) and&#xD;
      tolerability (whether participants stop treatment because of side effects from a drug or&#xD;
      treatment) of an anti-TB treatment regimen that compares two doses of linezolid (LZD),&#xD;
      combined with bedaquiline (BDQ), delamanid (DLM), and clofazimine (CFZ). This study will also&#xD;
      measure the level of these medicines in the participants' blood.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no &quot;standard of care&quot; or single standardized treatment regimen recommended&#xD;
      for everyone with drug resistant-tuberculosis (DR- TB). Current DR-TB treatments may not be&#xD;
      well tolerated and can often have side effects. There is a need to identify drugs with enough&#xD;
      anti-TB activity (treatment against TB) and good safety profiles that can improve outcomes in&#xD;
      the treatment of DR-TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a new shorter&#xD;
      course anti-TB treatment regimen that compares two dosing strategies of linezolid (LZD),&#xD;
      combined with bedaquiline (BDQ), delamanid (DLM), and clofazimine (CFZ). As a secondary aim,&#xD;
      the study will also assess the safety (the level and type of side effects from a drug or&#xD;
      treatment) of the combination of these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everyone in the study will take these drugs once a day for the entire treatment period: BDQ,&#xD;
      DLM, and CFZ. The difference between the two treatment groups in the study is in how&#xD;
      participants will take the fourth drug: LZD. Participants in group A will take one dose of&#xD;
      LZD once a day for the entire treatment period. Participants in group B will take a higher&#xD;
      dose of LZD once a day for 4 weeks and then continue taking that higher dose of LZD just&#xD;
      three times a week for the rest of the treatment period.&#xD;
