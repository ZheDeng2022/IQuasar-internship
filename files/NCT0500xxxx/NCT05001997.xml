  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a gastrointestinal disorder defined by recurrent abdominal&#xD;
      pain, bloating, abdominal distention and altered bowel habits. IBS is common among athletes&#xD;
      and can impair performance. IBS was found to be prevalent in 9.8% (n=430) of endurance&#xD;
      athletes. The condition is associated with significantly reduced quality of life. IBS&#xD;
      patients often attribute their gastrointestinal effects to lactose intolerance (LI) and may&#xD;
      avoid/limit intake of dairy products. As LI and IBS share similar symptoms, IBS patients may&#xD;
      wrongly attribute lactose intolerance as one of the causative factors and avoid dairy&#xD;
      products altogether. Self-imposed reductions in consumption of dairy products could reduce&#xD;
      calcium intake leading to reduced bone mineral density. This study aims to determine the&#xD;
      prevalence of lactose malabsorption among athletes suffering from IBS and the potential of&#xD;
      lactose free probiotics dairy products in alleviating gastrointestinal symptoms. The&#xD;
      inclusion of probiotics dairy products in patients' diet will be beneficial in the long term&#xD;
      to ensure adequate intake of calcium.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common, global, functional gastrointestinal disorder. It&#xD;
      affects a significant number of people, i.e. between 9 - 23% of the world's population. The&#xD;
      aetiology and diagnosis of IBS is poorly understood due to the complexity, heterogeneity and&#xD;
      incomplete understanding of the pathology, thus well-defined treatments and protocols are&#xD;
      lacking. For example, impaired motility and sensitivity, changes in gut microbiome, increased&#xD;
      permeability, low-grade inflammation, gut endocrine cells, and alterations in the gut-brain&#xD;
      axis, all of which are identified to play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of IBS. Thus,&#xD;
      it may be challenging to identify the cause of a patient's symptoms as the pathology is not&#xD;
      fully understood. IBS can also further be divided into four subtypes based on a patient's&#xD;
      stool patterns: constipation-predominant (IBS-C), diarrhoea-predominant (IBS-D), mixed&#xD;
      diarrhoea and constipation (IBS-M) and those whose bowel habits cannot be identified but meet&#xD;
      the criteria (IBS-U).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary modifications in treating IBS have also received significant recognition, as many&#xD;
      patients report that foods appear to induce or exacerbate their symptoms, thus diet&#xD;
      intervention may be a very effective tool in the symptom management of IBS. Strategies to&#xD;
      relief symptoms include consuming a low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides,&#xD;
      monosaccharides, and polyol (FODMAP) diet, inclusion of prebiotics and probiotics in diet.&#xD;
      Probiotics are defined as &quot;live microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts,&#xD;
      confer a health benefit to host&quot;. Previous studies suggest that consumption of probiotics&#xD;
      help to alleviate symptoms among IBS patients. However, there is still a lack of probiotic&#xD;
      intervention studies using lactose-free dairy products to determine the efficacy in relieving&#xD;
      IBS symptoms. The aims of this study are (i) to determine the prevalence of lactose&#xD;
      malabsorption among athletes suffering from IBS and (ii) to evaluate the potential of lactose&#xD;
      free probiotics dairy products in alleviating gastrointestinal symptoms among IBS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject recruitment Twelve to 15 recreational athletes (age &gt; 18 years) with diagnosed&#xD;
      irritable bowel syndrome will be recruited. A recreational athlete is defined as a person who&#xD;
      is physically active but does not train for competition at the same level of intensity and&#xD;
      focus as a competitive athlete. Participants will be recruited from the North West IBS&#xD;
      support group. The study will also be opened to staff and students at the university.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydrogen Breath Test Participants will be asked to follow an overnight (12 hour) fasting&#xD;
      period, not to smoke or vape for at least 24 hours prior to the test and not to exercise for&#xD;
      at least 1 hour before taking the test. Breath testing will be conducted in Nutrition and&#xD;
      Health Suite, Darwin Building, University of Central Lancashire to determine the baseline&#xD;
      hydrogen breath concentration using a portable breath analyser. Participants will then be&#xD;
      provided with 400 ml semi-skimmed milk for consumption following baseline sampling.&#xD;
      Subsequent breath samples will then be collected for re-testing every 15 minutes for 3 hours.&#xD;
      Lactose malabsorption is present if the peak of hydrogen breath excretion over the baseline&#xD;
      is â‰¥20ppm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactose-free dairy products Participants will be randomised using computer random allocation&#xD;
      sequence into either the intervention group (lactose free probiotic yogurt) or the control&#xD;
      group (lactose free, non-probiotic yogurt). The lactose free probiotic yogurt and lactose&#xD;
      free non-probiotic yogurt (control) will be purchased and stored at the laboratory&#xD;
      refrigerator the day before the testing. Only lactose free probiotic yogurt containing&#xD;
      cultures such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis will be selected.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to consume 125g of lactose free products daily for 7 days,&#xD;
      followed by 1-week washout period and crossover to alternate treatment for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete the following questionnaires at Week 0 (before the&#xD;
      start of the dietary intervention), end of Week 1 (upon completion of 1st dietary&#xD;
      intervention), end of Week 2 (upon completion of washout period) and end of Week 3 (upon&#xD;
      completion of 2nd dietary intervention):&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Participants' characteristics, records of exercise, stool frequency and consistency ii)&#xD;
      IBS Severity Score Scale (IBS-SSS) iii) IBS Quality of Life (IBS-QOL)&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The IBS-SSS is a questionnaire commonly used to evaluate the severity of IBS symptoms. There are five questions (i) abdominal pain intensity; (ii) abdominal distension; (iii) bowel habit dissatisfaction, (iv) life interference and (v) abdominal pain frequency (defined as number of days with pain during the last 10 days). Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms.</description>

    <measure>IBS Quality of Life (IBS-QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The IBS-QOL is a questionnaire to assess the burden of IBS on participants' everyday functioning and wellbeing. The instrument consists of 34 items assessing wellbeing across eight subscales: dysphoria, activity interference, body image, social reaction, health worry, food avoidance, relationships and sexual. Respondents rate each item on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (Not at all) to 5 (Extremely / A great deal). All items are summed to calculate the IBS-QOL total score. It is then converted to a scale of 0-100 using the following formula: [(sum of items - lowest possible score) / possible raw score range] x 100 The higher the score, the higher the health-related quality of life.</description>
