  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coordination and balance are manifested as motor skills or abilities that are acquired as the&#xD;
      Central Nervous System develops. In the infant stage, these qualities help guide specialists&#xD;
      to recognize possible abnormalities that at first glance seem banal, but that, as time goes&#xD;
      by, acquire greater difficulty, causing even more complex problems in the long term.&#xD;
      Craniosacral therapy could help these skills to be correctly established during growth,&#xD;
      correcting such impairment in time during neurodevelopment. Objective: To correct possible&#xD;
      alterations that occur during infant growth related to balance and coordination in&#xD;
      neurodevelopment, by means of craniosacral therapy compared with the specific therapy of&#xD;
      balance and coordination usually used in pathologies diagnosed of this caliber. Design:&#xD;
      Longitudinal-experimental study with a population of 86 apparently healthy children.&#xD;
      Setting/Participants: 86 children were treated without excluding sex and divided into three&#xD;
      groups: placebo group (n=25), craniosacral therapy group (n=30) and balance and coordination&#xD;
      therapy group (n=31). Interventions: group 1 (placebo), group 2 (craniosacral therapy) group&#xD;
      3 (balance and coordination therapy). Results: The Battelle scale prior to the therapies&#xD;
      developed in the study showed balance and coordination imbalances in the participants of the&#xD;
      three groups, with lower percentages in the placebo treatment. Sessions from the 2nd to the&#xD;
      7th of treatment show increasing percentages and fluctuating for craniosacral therapy between&#xD;
      51% to 56% and 100% satisfaction, significantly valued. As for balance and coordination&#xD;
      therapy, satisfaction percentages are evident only in the 6th and 7th sessions, with&#xD;
      statistically significant values. Finally, the Battelle post-therapy assessment scale shows a&#xD;
      higher number of participants in the percentages classified as normal (50-80%) in the&#xD;
      craniosacral therapy group, improving the evaluated parameters with statistically significant&#xD;
      values. Conclusion: The study shows that craniosacral therapy can not only act as a treatment&#xD;
      for the improvement of children's balance and coordination, but also helps small corrections&#xD;
      during children's neurodevelopment, avoiding the evolution of pathologies in the long term.&#xD;
      It is therefore necessary for a more prompt, total and lasting correction of these skills in&#xD;
      the infant.&#xD;

      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A longitudinal-experimental study was carried out with a child population of 86 children aged&#xD;
      6 to 8 years old without excluding sex in a school group in Cordoba (Spain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty-six apparently healthy children between 6 and 8 years of age were treated as&#xD;
      prevention in balance and coordination motor skills at the Gema León physiotherapy clinic in&#xD;
      Córdoba (Spain). The children were divided into three groups: 25 patients in the placebo&#xD;
      group (group 1), 30 patients in the craniosacral therapy group (group 2) and 31 patients in&#xD;
      the balance and coordination therapy group (group 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: A series of questions were asked to the children's parents in a virtual&#xD;
      questionnaire on physical characteristics, previous health assessments and observations of&#xD;
      their balance and coordination in front of their children. On the other hand, the school&#xD;
      teachers examined neurobehavioral aspects of the students using the &quot;Battelle Developmental&#xD;
      Inventory&quot; (BDI), which evaluates five areas of development (personal/social, adaptive,&#xD;
      motor, communicative and cognitive) between 2 and 8 years of age. The results are assigned in&#xD;
      age-adjusted percentages, classified as: low (0-49%), normal (50-79%) and high (80-100%). Low&#xD;
      and high values are considered impairments in one or more of the areas evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome: Seven treatment sessions were carried out with the balance and&#xD;
      coordination therapeutic exercise techniques (group 3) most frequently used for the treatment&#xD;
      of these pathologies; seven sessions of craniosacral therapy (group 2) as corrective and&#xD;
      preventive in possible alterations during infant neurodevelopment and finally seven sessions&#xD;
      simulating craniosacral therapy on a placebo group (group 1) as a control of the treatments&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness values of the therapies were expressed as percentages of satisfaction with&#xD;
      the classifications of 25 to 28% (apparent changes &lt; to half of the sample in each therapy&#xD;
      group), 51 to 56% (apparent changes in half of the sample in each therapy group) and 100%&#xD;
      (apparent changes &gt; to half of the sample in each therapy group). From the above, the&#xD;
      absolute values of the sample in each therapy group are set as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variables were expressed as mean, absolute and relative frequency. The chi-square test&#xD;
      was used to analyze the differences between age ranges, balance and coordination problems&#xD;
      versus physical therapy sessions performed, as well as the association between values of the&#xD;
      Battelle scale of child neurodevelopment before and after the treatments. A confidence level&#xD;
      of 95% was established, considering as statistically significant a value of p a value of&#xD;
      p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;

    <description>Significance values are observed for craniosacral therapy participants (n=30) showing apparent changes in gradual increases in the categories of 25-28% satisfaction from the 2nd session (n=20), moving to 51-56% satisfaction in the 3rd session (n=18) and swinging in gradual increases towards 100% satisfaction by the 5th session (n=15), showing that craniosacral therapy regulates small weaknesses or alterations previously observed during the balance and coordination exploration.&#xD;
During the sixth treatment session, craniosacral therapy shows higher percentages of apparent changes that position it with better satisfaction compared to balance and coordination therapy.&#xD;
The last treatment session presented a greater percentage advantage in the craniosacral therapy in relation to the balance and coordination therapy, ratifying the values previously exposed.</description>
