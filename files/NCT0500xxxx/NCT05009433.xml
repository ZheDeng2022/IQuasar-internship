  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular exercise during pregnancy and postpartum leads to health benefits for mother and&#xD;
      child. Inactivity during pregnancy and after delivery is now treated as risky behavior.&#xD;
      Physically active pregnant women significantly less often suffer from, among others,&#xD;
      gestational diabetes, excessive weight gain, lipids disorders, hypertension, preeclampsia,&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, functional and structural disorders, including stress urinary&#xD;
      incontinence, back pain or diastasis recti abdominis (DRA). Prenatal physical activity&#xD;
      reduces the risk of premature delivery and miscarriage, fetal macrosomia, complications in&#xD;
      labor or the risk of metabolic disorders in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has become one of the most popular trends in the&#xD;
      fitness sector. The effectiveness of HIIT on a number of health indicators has been proven in&#xD;
      various populations but limited data are available on HIIT during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first hypothesis is that the HIIT, implemented during pregnancy and after childbirth, as&#xD;
      a stronger exercise stimulus, will have a better impact on selected biological and&#xD;
      psychological parameters of mothers, as well as on selected health parameters of their&#xD;
      children, compared to the MICT (moderate intensity continuous training). Therefore, it&#xD;
      promises better preventive effects on pregnancy complications and ailments as well as&#xD;
      non-communicable diseases occurring in these populations. In the second hypothesis, it was&#xD;
      assumed that HIIT and MICT implemented during pregnancy and after childbirth, tailored to the&#xD;
      specific needs of the perinatal period, will not differ in the effectiveness of maintaining&#xD;
      normal functional parameters in women, including prevention of urinary incontinence, back&#xD;
      pain, DRA, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women who apply for the study will be divided into three groups: those attending the&#xD;
      HIIT, MICT or educational programs. During the study, the participants will be under standard&#xD;
      obstetric care. As comparative groups, non-pregnant women will be also recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect data on selected biological, functional and psychological&#xD;
      parameters in the study women at each trimester of pregnancy, during the puerperium and one&#xD;
      year after childbirth. The data from the medical documentation on the course of childbirth&#xD;
      and the assessment of the new-born, as well as the results of preventive examinations in the&#xD;
      study women's children aged one, two, four and six years will be also analyzed.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study model is parallel in the two subgroups. The first subgroup consists of pregnant women who will be assigned to one of the three interventions: high intensity interval training program, moderate intensity continuous program or educational program on healthy lifestyle. The second subgroup will be age-matched nonpregnant women and they will be also assigned to the above three interventions. The pregnant women will be evaluated both in comparison to other pregnant women intervention groups and to the appropriate control non-pregnant groups.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Pregnant women will participate in 8-week HIIT cycles until the day of delivery, 3 times a week, in a volume of each session of 60 minutes. The main part (15-20 min) will be conducted in a form of high intensity intervals, approx. 85-90% of maximum exercise capacity. The intervals will consist of performing exercises for 30-60 seconds, alternating with a 30-60 second rest break, in the ratio of exercise time to rest 1:2, 1:1 or 2:1, according to the individual possibilities of the participant and taking into account the training progression and stage of pregnancy. The exercise intensity will be monitored with the use of heart rate monitors, the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) and the Talk Test.&#xD;
After birth, women will participate in 3-month HIIT cycles from the moment of achieving postpartum readiness to training until one year postpartum. Classes will be carried out stationary or online, depending on the pandemic situation and the availability of the woman.</description>

    <ipd_description>All IPD that underlie results reported in publications will be available to other researchers. All procedures will be conducted in accordance with the Regulation (2016/679) of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46 / EC. Each data set will be linked to a given research task description, the methods used to generate the data, the period of time data were collected and whether the data have been updated. The data will be stored in the standard file formats, such as MS Excel (.xlsx), MS Word (.docx), Comma Separated Values (.csv), Portable Document Format (.pdf), Joint Photographic Experts Group (.jpg), Tagged Image File Format (.tiff). Transformation of the high-resolution images may be necessary prior to data sharing. No further manipulation of these files is necessary.</ipd_description>
