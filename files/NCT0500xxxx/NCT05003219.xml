      Objective: To collect and measure the preoperative and postoperative clinical data of the&#xD;
      patients undergoing single open-door expansive laminoplasty with preservation of musclar&#xD;
      ligament complex through posterior cervical approach in our hospital. To summarize the&#xD;
      long-term clinical effect and postoperative imaging changes and to analyze the long-term&#xD;
      clinical effect of this operation on cervical spondylosis. To provide scientific basis for&#xD;
      clinical work and theoretical research in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was a retrospective study, and the medical records of posterior cervical open-door&#xD;
      expansive laminoplasty with musclar ligament complex preservation in the orthopedics&#xD;
      department of our hospital from 2006 to 2017 were collected, and the patients with complete&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment data were selected for analysis and research.The preoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative changes of the patients were studied by combining the patient's case and&#xD;
      imaging examination (MR, CT, X plain film) and other diagnosis and treatment data.&#xD;
