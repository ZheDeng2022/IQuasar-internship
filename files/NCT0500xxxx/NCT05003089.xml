  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immune system helps protect the body from diseases. But, sometimes the immune system can&#xD;
      be too sensitive and overreact to very small allergens, like dust and pet dander. This can&#xD;
      cause skin conditions like dermatitis and eczema. People with these skin conditions have&#xD;
      inflammation that can cause dry, red, and itchy skin. These symptoms often &quot;flare up&quot;,&#xD;
      meaning that the symptoms come back after being gone for some time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers are looking for a different way to treat people who have skin conditions caused&#xD;
      by an overreaction of the immune system. Before a treatment is available to all patients,&#xD;
      researchers study it in trials to better understand its safety and how well it works.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, the researchers will learn more about how BAY1834845 and BAY1830839 work and&#xD;
      how safe they are in healthy male participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will include about 72 healthy male participants who are between the ages of 18 and&#xD;
      55.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will use a computer program to randomly choose the treatment each participant&#xD;
      will take. This will help make sure the treatments are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so&#xD;
      that comparing the results of the treatments is accurate as possible. The participants will&#xD;
      be randomly put into 1 of 4 groups. The participants will take their trial treatment 2 times&#xD;
      a day for 7 days in a row.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: BAY1834845 as tablets by mouth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: BAY1830839 as tablets by mouth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3: A placebo as tablets by mouth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 4: Prednisolone as tablets by mouth A placebo looks like a treatment but does not&#xD;
           have any medicine in it. Prednisolone is a steroid treatment that is already available&#xD;
           for doctors to prescribe to people with skin conditions caused by an overreaction of the&#xD;
           immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the participants will also receive imiquimod applied as a cream to their back. All&#xD;
      participants will also receive lipopolysaccharide as an intravenous infusion. Imiquimod and&#xD;
      lipopolysaccharide will be used to cause irritation and inflammation of the skin and in the&#xD;
      blood. The researchers want to see if treatment with BAY1834845 and BAY1830939 can then help&#xD;
      reduce these symptoms of irritation and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, the researchers will look at:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the change in the amount of blood flow in the participants after imiquimod&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the change in how red the participants' skin is after imiquimod&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the change in the amount of inflammation applying the participants have after receiving&#xD;
           lipopolysaccharide infusion&#xD;
