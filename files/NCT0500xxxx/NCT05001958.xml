      One way to help a stroke survivor learn how to use their arm and hand again is to have them&#xD;
      watch and replicate &quot;normal&quot; arm and hand movements. This type of intervention is called&#xD;
      action observation (AO) and has emerged as a potentially powerful therapeutic tool to improve&#xD;
      stroke rehabilitation for the weakened arm and hand. AO involves the patient's visual&#xD;
      observation of video recorded intact body movements with the intent to perform the same task&#xD;
      with their weakened arm and hand. There is behavioral evidence in stroke survivors that&#xD;
      movement skills usually gained through physical practice can also be acquired through&#xD;
      observation of the skill alone. In preliminary research performed in Dr. Lewis Wheaton's lab&#xD;
      at Georgia Tech, AO has been successfully implemented for persons with arm and hand&#xD;
      amputations learning how to use their prostheses. AO training in patients with amputations&#xD;
      revealed that their movement is improved when they focus their eye gaze on specific aspects&#xD;
      of the movement in the video that may maximally benefit the patient. It is unknown if these&#xD;
      eye gaze patterns may serve as the mechanism behind AO and differ among those with mild or&#xD;
      moderate movement impairments due to stroke. In this study, the investigators seek to&#xD;
      identify if experience with AO in stroke survivors with varying levels of impairment has a&#xD;
      similar emergence of eye gaze patterns found in people with amputations. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that AO augments visuomotor strategies to help support improved movement and&#xD;
      enhance rehabilitation strategies in stroke survivors with mild and moderate impairments. The&#xD;
      goal of this work is to utilize eye gaze tracking approaches to understand this phenomenon.&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators will identify the feasibility of implementing and assessing AO&#xD;
      on eye gaze in stroke survivors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Arm and hand impairments after stroke significantly limit daily activities and negatively&#xD;
      impact quality of life. Action observation (AO) has emerged as a potentially powerful&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention to improve stroke rehabilitation for the weakened arm and hand. AO&#xD;
      involves the patient's visual observation of video recorded intact body movements from a&#xD;
      non-disabled actor with the intent to perform the same skill task. There is behavioral&#xD;
      evidence in stroke survivors that movement skills usually acquired through physical practice&#xD;
      can also be acquired through observation of the movement skill alone. In preliminary research&#xD;
      performed in Dr. Lewis Wheaton's lab at Georgia Tech, AO has been successfully implemented&#xD;
      for persons with arm and hand amputations learning how to use their prostheses. Where the&#xD;
      patient focuses their eye gaze on the video being observed has been shown to be key in&#xD;
      improving their movement. That is, improved movement is associated with specific eye gaze&#xD;
      patterns focused movement strategies observed in the non-disabled actor. It is unknown if&#xD;
      these mechanisms of eye gaze patterns are also exhibited in stroke survivors, or if they are&#xD;
      differentiated between those with varying levels of movement impairment. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators seek to identify if experience with AO in stroke survivors influences a similar&#xD;
      emergence of gaze patterns found in people with amputations. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      seek to explore the differences in eye gaze and movement in stroke survivors who exhibit&#xD;
      either mild or moderate impairments. The expected outcome of finding eye gaze strategy&#xD;
      patterns that are most beneficial in improving movement of the arm and hand after stroke can&#xD;
      enhance the implementation of AO by instructing participants with guided cuing to focus on&#xD;
      specific areas of interest in the videos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty participants with either mild or moderate weakness in their arm and hand due to stroke&#xD;
      will complete the AO intervention with eye gaze and movement assessments. The goal of this&#xD;
      work is to implement eye-tracking approaches to understand how AO augments visuomotor&#xD;
      strategies (i.e., the mechanism) to help improve movement and enhance rehabilitation&#xD;
      strategies in stroke survivors with varying levels of impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Evaluate how AO influences eye gaze strategies in stroke survivors as a function of&#xD;
      stroke severity. Hypothesis: There are eye gaze pattern strategies in stroke survivors that&#xD;
      differ between those with mild and moderate movement impairments. Eye gaze pattern strategies&#xD;
      will be assessed during AO, i.e., while watching the videos between participants that are&#xD;
      mildly and moderately impaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate the relationship between eye gaze strategies and arm and hand movement in&#xD;
      stroke survivors as a function of stroke severity. Hypothesis: AO influences the relationship&#xD;
      of arm and hand movement with varying gaze pattern strategies in stroke survivors with mild&#xD;
      or moderate movement impairments. Arm and hand functional movement will be assessed following&#xD;
      AO between participants that are mildly and moderately impaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Identify the feasibility of implementing and assessing AO in stroke survivors.&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There are specific factors that facilitate or hinder the recruitment, retention,&#xD;
      and completion of this protocol. Feasibility of this protocol will be assessed to provide&#xD;
      guidance for future research efforts in the stroke population.&#xD;
