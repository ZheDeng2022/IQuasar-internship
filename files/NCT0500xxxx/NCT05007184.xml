  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a 3-arm randomized controlled trial, the investigators aim to rigorously evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of two front-of-pack (FOP) food labels on diet quality. The first food label is a&#xD;
      modified version of Chilean warning FOP label and the second food label is a modified version&#xD;
      of French FOP label, Nutri-Score. The investigators used an experimental online grocery&#xD;
      store, called NUSMart, which is similar in design to commercial web-based grocery stores to&#xD;
      test these two FOP labels. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the following arms&#xD;
      and asked to complete a one-time hypothetical shop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: Participants experienced a default version of NUSMart which replicated the traditional&#xD;
      shopping experience of online grocery stores with no FOP labels (Control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: Same as Arm 1 NUSMart except that Chilean warning FOP labels were displayed on less&#xD;
      healthy food and beverages. Products with specific nutrients (i.e. sugar, sodium, saturated&#xD;
      fat, energy) falling outside the bounds of the thresholds defined by the Chilean warning&#xD;
      labels were depicted with the warning labels on them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 3: Same as Arm 1 NUSMart except that Nutri-Score FOP labels along with % sugar per&#xD;
      serving were displayed on all food and beverages. These labels score products on the basis of&#xD;
      7 nutrients (calories, saturated fats, sugar, salt, fibre, protein and percentage of fruits,&#xD;
      vegetables and nuts) from A to E (best to worst). To ensure that participants understood what&#xD;
      Nutri-Score labels mean and how they work, an introductory video was shown before shopping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Diet quality, as measured by weighted average Nutri-Score point of shoppers'&#xD;
      final baskets, will be greatest in Arm 3, followed by Arm 2, followed by Control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Grams of sugar per serving/ milligrams of sodium per serving/ grams of&#xD;
      saturated fat per serving/ calories per serving will be least in Arm 2, followed by Arm 3,&#xD;
      followed by Control.&#xD;

      Experimental design &amp; procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to use a 3-arm randomized controlled trial with an online grocery&#xD;
      store (NUSMart), to rigorously evaluate the effect of the two FOP labels, Chilean warning&#xD;
      labels and Nutri-Score, on diet quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Food labels&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators tested 2 different types of food labels in this study. They are as&#xD;
           follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Chilean Warning Labels: These labels were implemented in Chile in 2016. They are&#xD;
                shown on those less-healthy food and beverage products that don't fall within&#xD;
                thresholds that are defined for the following nutrients: sugar, sodium, calories&#xD;
                and saturated fats. The original labels are in Spanish but the ones that the&#xD;
                investigators displayed were in Arabic.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Nutri-Score Labels: These labels were implemented by the French government in 2017.&#xD;
                They are shown on all food and beverage products and range from A to E with the&#xD;
                corresponding colours moving from Green to Red (symbolizing best to worst). The&#xD;
                scores and grades are calculated based on 7 different nutrients grouped into 2&#xD;
                categories i.e. nutrients to consume (such as fibre) and nutrients to avoid (such&#xD;
                as sugar). The investigators modified the labels by adding % sugar per serving on&#xD;
                the right side of the labels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Overview of RCT Design&#xD;
&#xD;
           To test these labels, the investigators used three different versions of NUSMart. Each&#xD;
           participant was randomly assigned to one of the following arms and asked to complete a&#xD;
           one-time hypothetical shop.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Arm 1: Control arm. Participants experienced an unmodified version of NUSMart, which&#xD;
           replicates the traditional shopping experience of online grocery stores.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Arm 2: Similar to Arm 1 except that products were labeled with Chilean warning FOP&#xD;
           labels.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Arm 3: Similar to Arm 1 except that products were labeled with NutriScore FOP labels.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To minimize hypothetical shopping biases, the investigators set a minimum spending value&#xD;
           per person per week and adjusted the total minimum spending value depending on household&#xD;
           size.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subject related procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the investigators have done in prior studies, participants were recruited if they were KSA&#xD;
      residents aged 18 years or older, could speak Arabic and were primary weekly shoppers for&#xD;
      their households. Recruitment was done using a Saudi Arabia based web panelist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On recruitment, they were asked to fill in a baseline questionnaire to collect demographic&#xD;
      and health characteristics, which took approximately 10-15 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline questionnaire includes a question as to whether any household members have a&#xD;
      medical condition, such as diabetes or hypertension, which requires limiting the types of&#xD;
      foods they eat. The investigators asked this question to allow for testing whether the&#xD;
      interventions differentially influence these households, with the expectation that households&#xD;
      with less healthy patients may obtain greater benefits from purchasing baskets with higher&#xD;
      mean Nutri-Scores. Since the objective of this RCT is to quantify the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      interventions on diet quality, a precursor to NCDs, the collection of household health&#xD;
      indicators is reasonable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the baseline survey, participants were randomly assigned to one of the 3&#xD;
      shopping conditions (Arm 1 [Control], Arm 2, or Arm 3). They logged into the NUSMart website&#xD;
      and were asked to purchase their weekly groceries with a minimum spend per person per week&#xD;
      (the total minimum spending value depends on the household size). Each participant therefore&#xD;
      shopped only once during the study in one of the arms (1,2 or 3) which was randomly assigned&#xD;
      to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were given explicit instructions to purchase groceries for the purposes of&#xD;
      breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and beverage consumption for one week keeping in mind that&#xD;
      they would not be consuming any meals outside. The stores were set up such that participants&#xD;
      were not allowed to check out with their cart unless they selected items from at least 4&#xD;
      different NUSMart categories. This ensures that participants shop as though they are shopping&#xD;
      for their own consumption i.e. to minimize hypothetical biases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A post-study survey was conducted after the last shop to collect participant opinions on the&#xD;
      labels and understand their impact better.&#xD;
