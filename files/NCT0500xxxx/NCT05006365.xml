    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of transranial pulse stimulation (TPS) on&#xD;
      young adults with symptoms of depression in Hong Kong. Methods: This is a single-blind&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial design with two-armed repeated measures, and participants will be&#xD;
      followed up at a 3-months post-stimulation period. Eligbility: 1) aged 18 or over; 2) able to&#xD;
      understand/read Chinese; 3) HAM-D-17 score of ≥ 8; 4) provide written informed consent.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria includes: 1) individuals being prescribed a DSM-5 diagnosis other than&#xD;
      major depressive disorder (e.g., bipolar affective disorder or schizophrenia); 2) Alcohol or&#xD;
      substance dependence; 3) Concomitant unstable major medical conditions or major neurological&#xD;
      conditions such as brain tumour, brain aneurysm; 4) Haemophilia or other blood clotting&#xD;
      disorders or thrombosis; 5) Significant communicative impairments; 6) Participants with metal&#xD;
      implant in brain or treated area of the head; 7) Participants who undertook corticosteroid&#xD;
      treatment within the last six weeks before first TPS treatment; 8) Pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
      women. Recruitment: A total of 30 subjects will be recruited from collaborative NGOs and&#xD;
      PolyU and randomly assigned into the Intervention Group (TPS) and the Waitlist Control Group&#xD;
      on a 1: 1 ratio. Intervention: All participants (both TPS group and the waitlist control&#xD;
      group) will receive six 30 minute-TPS sessions (300 pulse in each session, total: 1800 pulse)&#xD;
      in 2 weeks' time. Outcome measurements include depression, anhedonia, instrumental activities&#xD;
      of daily living, cognition and neuroimaging.&#xD;

      1. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of Transcranial Pulse Stimulation (TPS) on&#xD;
           symptoms of depression among young adults in Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
           SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To improve young adults' Anhedonia symptoms after the 2-week TPS intervention and will&#xD;
           be maintained at 3-month post-intervention follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To improve young adults' Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) after the 2-week&#xD;
           TPS intervention and will be maintained at 3-month post-intervention follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To improve young adults' Cognition after the 2-week TPS intervention and will be&#xD;
           maintained at 3-month post-intervention follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Post-MRI scan will show a remarkable structural and functional connectivity in&#xD;
           participants' brain after the 2-week TPS intervention compared to pre-MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation: To the best of investigator's knowledge, there is only one TPS&#xD;
      uncontrolled pilot study conducted on 35 patients with AD in Austria and therefore, we cannot&#xD;
      base on their effect size to estimate our sample size in this study. Considering the nature&#xD;
      of this study is the first pilot RCT in using TPS in the treatment of&#xD;
      depression,investigators aim at recruiting 30 subjects to evaluate the efficacy of our&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcomes in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research plan and Methodology Methods Trial Design: In this study, the investigators will use&#xD;
      a single-blind randomized controlled trial design with two-armed repeated measures. The trial&#xD;
      design complies with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement. In&#xD;
      this two-armed design, investigators will use TPS as an intervention group and a waitlist&#xD;
      control group. A waitlist control group is appropriate for comparing the effect of the TPS on&#xD;
      the intervention group to that of those not receiving the TPS treatment at the same&#xD;
      timepoints Both groups will be measured at baseline (T1), immediately after the intervention&#xD;
      (T2) and at the 3-month follow-up (T3). Based on the previous studies, a 3-month follow-up is&#xD;
      sufficient to assess the long-term sustainability of the TPS intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (Transcranial Pulse Stimulation) Purpose of the intervention: The key tenets of&#xD;
      the TPS intervention is neuromodulation, i.e., using ultrasound-based brain stimulation&#xD;
      techniques to modulate the human brain in a focal and targeted manner. Intervention dose:&#xD;
      Each participant should have the pre-treatment MRI scan performed in the University Research&#xD;
      Facility in Behavioural and Systems Neuroscience, PolyU prior coming to the first&#xD;
      intervention session. All participants (both TPS group and the waitlist control group) will&#xD;
      receive six 30 minute-TPS sessions (300 pulse in each session, total: 1800 pulse) in 2 weeks'&#xD;
      time (i.e., 3 sessions (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) per week, total: 3 hours). Participants&#xD;
      will be followed up at 3-month period after the intervention (Fig 1). The investigators&#xD;
      believe that a 2-week TPS intervention is sufficient enough to test the effects of TPS on&#xD;
      depressive symptoms.&#xD;

    <description>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17 (HAM-D-17) is a widely used reliable measurement. Scores range from 0 and 52, with higher scores indicating more severe depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anhedonia</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be measured the changes of SHAPS score at baseline, immediately after intervention and at 3-months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The core symptom of depression will be assessed by the Chinese version of the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS). SHAPS is a self-report scale containing 14 items. Each item scores from 1 to 4. Total scores range from 14 to 56. A higher total SHAPS score indicates lower level of anhedonia.</description>

    <measure>Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be measured the changes of IADL score at baseline, immediately after intervention and at 3-months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>IADL will be assessed by the 8-item Hong Kong Chinese version of the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale. Each item scores from 0 or 1. Total score ranges from 0-8. A lower score indicates a higher level of dependence.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognition</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be measured the changes of the MoCA scores at baseline, immediately after intervention and at 3-months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Global cognition will be measured using the Hong Kong Chinese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Montreal Cognitive Assessment is a 30-point scale, with points awarded differently depending on the type of question asked. A score between 26 to 30 indicate normal cognitive abilities. A score of 19 to 25 indicates mild cognitive impairment. Scores of between 11 and 21 suggest mild Alzheimer's disease.</description>
