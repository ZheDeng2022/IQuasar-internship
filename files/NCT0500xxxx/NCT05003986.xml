  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, 108-week study of sparsentan in approximately 57 pediatric&#xD;
      subjects aged ≥1 year to &lt;18 years with selected proteinuric glomerular diseases, divided&#xD;
      into 2 populations, defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Population 1: Subjects with selected proteinuric glomerular diseases associated with&#xD;
           Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and Minimal Change Disease (MCD) histological&#xD;
           patterns&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Population 2: Subjects with biopsy-confirmed immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN),&#xD;
           immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV), or subjects with Alport syndrome (AS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy with pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      evaluations at Day 1 (Baseline), Day 2 (Visit 3), and Week 12 (Visit 9). For each population,&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled in 3 cohorts based on age ranges.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential, beginning at menarche, who do not agree to&#xD;
             use 1 highly reliable (ie, can achieve a failure rate of &lt;1% per year) method of&#xD;
             contraception from 7 days before the first dose of the investigational product until&#xD;
             90 days after the last dose of investigational product. Examples of highly reliable&#xD;
             contraception methods include stable oral, implanted, transdermal, or injected&#xD;
             contraceptive hormones associated with the inhibition of ovulation or an intrauterine&#xD;
             device in place for at least 3 months. One additional barrier method must also be used&#xD;
             during sexual activity, such as a diaphragm, diaphragm with spermicide (preferred), or&#xD;
             male partner's use of male condom or male condom with spermicide (preferred), from Day&#xD;
             1/Randomization until 90 days after the last dose of investigational product. Female&#xD;
             subjects of childbearing potential are defined as those who are fertile after&#xD;
             menarche, unless permanently sterile; permanent sterilization methods include&#xD;
             hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. All female subjects&#xD;
             of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result at&#xD;
             screening (Visit 1) and a negative urine pregnancy test result, with positive results&#xD;
             confirmed by serum, at every study visit from Day 1 (Visit 3) and after.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Before menarche, pregnancy testing and contraceptive use are not required. However,&#xD;
        subjects and their parents/legal guardians must be advised that, immediately upon menarche,&#xD;
        subjects will be required to begin pregnancy testing and initiate contraceptive use. This&#xD;
        requirement cannot be waived.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has participated in a study of another investigational product within 28&#xD;
             days before screening or plans to participate in such a study during the course of&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has had prior exposure to sparsentan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject or parent/legal guardian (as appropriate), in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, are unable to adhere to the requirements of the study including but not&#xD;
             limited to, a history of noncompliance and/or any other reason that causes the&#xD;
             Investigator to believe the subject would not be a good candidate for the study.&#xD;
