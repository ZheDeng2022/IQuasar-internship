      Only in subjects who satisfy the inclusion/exclusion criteria, a single dose of&#xD;
      [F-18]Florastamin at 10 ± 1 mCi is IV administered at Visit 2, and [F-18]Florastamin PET/CT&#xD;
      images are obtained from the head to thigh after 110 ± 10 minutes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Once a subject provides voluntary written consent on participation in this study, the&#xD;
      investigator conducts screening of the subject. Subsequently, MRI and [F-18]Florastamin&#xD;
      PET/CT are performed for each patient, only for those who satisfy the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. For MRI at Visit 2, routine MRI, as implemented in the Urology Department, is&#xD;
      performed in the abdomen and pelvis. On the date of or within 7 days after MRI, a single dose&#xD;
      of [F-18]Florastamin at 10 ± 1 mCi is IV administered to a subject, and PET/CT images are&#xD;
      obtained from the head to thigh after 110 ± 10 minutes (care should be taken to prevent&#xD;
      extravasation of the radiopharmaceutical product). At Visit 3, the principal investigator or&#xD;
      a treating doctor as delegated by the principal investigator conducts the template&#xD;
      prostate-mapping (TPM) biopsy in at least the Modified Barzell 20-zone using the standard&#xD;
      template. After general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia, the tissue is collected by&#xD;
      horizontally sticking a histological needle through the perineum, and the process can be&#xD;
      performed as in-patient, at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI finding is determined positive for a lesion with the PI-RADS score of 3 or higher,&#xD;
      and the [F-18]Florastamin PET/CT finding is considered positive for the focal uptake higher&#xD;
      than the background level and unrelated with the physiologic uptake or known pitfall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI and [F-18]Florastamin PET/CT images are sent to the central reading institution, Seoul&#xD;
      St. Mary's Hospital, after blinding for the study information. Suspected sites on MRI are&#xD;
      evaluated at the Seoul St. Mary's Hospital Radiology Department, and the suspected sites on&#xD;
      [F-18]Florastamin PET/CT are assessed at the Seoul St. Mary's Hospital Nuclear Medicine&#xD;
      Department. Note that the [F-18]Florastamin PET/CT rater would participate in the assessment&#xD;
      after undergoing sufficient training with [F-18]Florastamin PET/CT images from a Phase 1&#xD;
      study of the same product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pathologist at each center will conduct diagnosis of prostate cancer for TPM biopsy samples&#xD;
      from the entire prostate volume. Target biopsy of MRI and [F-18]Florastamin PET/CT will not&#xD;
      be performed. By comparing confirmed sites from each imaging diagnosis method and&#xD;
      positive/negative results for prostate cancer from TPM biopsy diagnosis, the proportions of&#xD;
      True Positive (TP), False Positive (FP), True Negative (TN), False Negative (FN) will be&#xD;
      analyzed and the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive&#xD;
      value, and diagnostic accuracy will be compared using a 2x2 contingency table.&#xD;
