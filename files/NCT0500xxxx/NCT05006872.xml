  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention based on the use of a&#xD;
      mobile-device based system delivering automated, tailored brief text messages to offer&#xD;
      support for medicine use and lifestyle recommendations alongside usual care to people with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A list of patients registered in primary care centers of the Balearic Islands and potentially&#xD;
      meeting the eligibility criteria will be obtained from electronic health records (EHRs). A&#xD;
      research assistant will contact the potential participants via phone to invite them to the&#xD;
      study and confirm eligibility. All eligible participants will complete informed consent&#xD;
      followed by baseline assessment over the phone before randomization. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated using a computer-generated randomization sequence. All participants will&#xD;
      continue with their usual diabetes care including all medical visits, tests, and diabetes&#xD;
      support programs throughout the study. In addition, the intervention group will receive the&#xD;
      text messaging intervention. Control participants will receive usual care only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After twelve months of follow-up, all participants will complete post-intervention&#xD;
      assessments via phone interview. Data on glycemic control (HbA1c) at baseline and&#xD;
      post-intervention will be extracted from EHRs, as according to the protocol used for primary&#xD;
      care providers in the Balearic Islands, patients with poor glycemic control (HbA1c &gt;8% ) must&#xD;
      request an HbA1c determination every six months. Results of the most recent determination&#xD;
      will be extracted from electronic medical records. For those patients with no recorded HbA1c&#xD;
      within the previous four months, the research assistant will contact the primary care center&#xD;
      to arrange blood test analyses.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Healthcare providers (doctors and nurses from the participants' health centres, do not know if their patients are participating in the study nor the group (intervention vs control) they are. Just if a patient ask them for more information related to the study or text messages, they will know about it. Also, the interviewers that evaluate and register participants data are masked until randomization. After 12 months of follow-up, the interviewers will be masked before post-intervention evaluation. The primary outcome HbA1c is an objective measure and assessors of this outcome will be blinded to treatment allocation.</masking_description>
