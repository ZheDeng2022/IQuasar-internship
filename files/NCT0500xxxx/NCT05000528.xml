  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      20 to 30% of the general population suffers from chronic insomnia. Cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy (CBT) is the first-line treatment, but unfortunately its implementation is complex.&#xD;
      Long waiting times for a consultation / exploration, too short a consultation period,&#xD;
      non-reimbursement of specialists and a lack of trained staff make the current care of&#xD;
      insomniac patients difficult. Patients are thus treated late, often with heavy drug&#xD;
      treatment, dependence on sleeping pills, difficult withdrawal and / or reactive mood&#xD;
      disorders. The treatment is therefore limited to advice on sleep hygiene and a restriction of&#xD;
      time spent in bed without ultimately intervening in the cognitive domain. Therapeutic&#xD;
      education consists of empowering the patient in the management of chronic insomnia through&#xD;
      group education workshops. The patient learns the principles of normal sleep, the way in&#xD;
      which sleep evolves with aging, the dangers of treatments as well as the rules of sleep&#xD;
      hygiene and the behaviors to modify to sleep well. In addition to benefiting from sharing of&#xD;
      experience with other patients, therapeutic education makes the care pathway smoother and&#xD;
      considerably reduces the long waiting times of the traditional care pathway in consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigators hypothesize that therapeutic education is more effective as a&#xD;
      treatment for chronic insomnia than traditional management in individualized consultation&#xD;
      (IC). Thus, therapeutic education could constitute an effective alternative to CBT.&#xD;
