    <textblock>
      this study will compare the efficacy and safety of HLX04-O administered by IVT with&#xD;
      ranibizumab in patients with active CNV secondary to AMD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized double masked active controlled study to compare&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of HLX04-O administered by IVT with ranibizumab in patients with&#xD;
      active CNV secondary to AMD. The study will be conducted in approximately 60 sites in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Either HLX04-O (1.25 mg) IVT or ranibizumab (0.5 mg) IVT will be administered at a 4-week&#xD;
      interval for 1 year (12 cycles).&#xD;

             bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, established physical contraception and&#xD;
             copper intrauterine devices (IUDs).&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Known active or suspected autoimmune diseases, requiring systemic immunosuppressive&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Known allergy to any component of the study intervention or history of allergy to&#xD;

             the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. In the Investigator's judgment, there is evidence of a disease or condition that&#xD;
             contraindicates the use an investigational drug or that might affect interpretation of&#xD;
