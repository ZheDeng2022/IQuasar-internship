  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study addresses the need to rigorously advance the science and understanding of the&#xD;
      development, feasibility, acceptability and adoption of novel culturally-sensitive&#xD;
      motivational strategies to improve dialysis treatment adherence among African Americans with&#xD;
      end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). This study specifically aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gain advanced skills in the development and implementation of novel culturally sensitive&#xD;
           motivational strategies&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Acquire critical preliminary data for an R01-funded phase II efficacy trial testing the&#xD;
           use of these motivational strategies to improve dialysis treatment adherence.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dialysis treatment adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Abstraction of dialysis treatment adherence data from the dialysis units' records which includes data on every treatment that occurred or should have occurred within the time frame. Records will reflect dialysis treatments which were completed, shortened, missed or did not occur due to hospitalizations, ER visits or travel.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Autonomous Regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6, Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Change in autonomous regulation will be measured by the 6-item Autonomous Regulation (AR) questionnaire. Questions range in score from 1 to 7, and overall score is a mean of all items (range 1 - 7). Lower scores reflect less autonomous regulation, and higher scores reflect greater autonomous regulation</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Autonomy Support</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6, Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Change in autonomy support will be measured by the 6-item Health Care Climate (HCC) questionnaire. Questions range in score from 1 to 7, and overall score is a mean of all items (range 1 - 7). Lower scores reflect less autonomous support, and higher scores reflect greater autonomous support.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Perceived competence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6, Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Change in perceived competence will be measured by the 8-item Perceived Kidney Disease Self-Management Scale (PKDSMS) questionnaire.Each question ranges in score from 1 to 5. Four of the items (#s 1, 2, 6, 7) are reversed-scored. The score is the sum of the 8 individual items. The total PKDSMS score can range from 8 to 40, with higher scores indicating more confidence in self-managing one's (dialysis).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Apathy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6, Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Change in apathy will be measured by the 7-item Apathy Evaluation Scale survey (AES-S) which measures three domains of apathy: deficits in goal-directed behavior; a decrement in goal-related thought content; and emotional indifference with flat affect. Each question ranges in score from 1 to 4. Item 3 is reverse-scored and then the sum of the 7 item scores is calculated. Range of scores is 7-28.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Optimism</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6, Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Change in optimism will be measured by the 10-item Life Orientation Test - Revised (LOT-R) questionnaire which assesses individual differences in generalized optimism versus pessimism. Only 6 of the 10 items on the revised LOT are used to derive an optimism score. Four of the items are filler items and are not used in scoring. Of the 6 survey questions utilized, each question ranges in score from 1 to 5. Thus, scores in principle can range from 6 to 30.</description>

    <description>In this trial, motivational interviewing (MI) is the intervention. The MI sessions will embody the spirit of MI (PACE - Partnership, Acceptance, Compassion and Evocation) and the use of MI strategies (OARS - Open-ended questions, Affirmations, Reflections and Summaries) and MI communication processes (engagement, focusing, evoking and planning).</description>
