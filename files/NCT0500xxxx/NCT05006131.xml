      The investigators' goal is to conduct a prospective multicenter study to evaluate the yield&#xD;
      and outcomes of screening of pancreas cancer in individuals who are at-risk for pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer. We plan to use International Cancer of the Pancreas Screening (CAPS3) Consortium&#xD;
      recommendations to standardize study population, screening methodology, and study outcomes.&#xD;

      Methods The investigators' goal is to conduct a prospective multicenter study to evaluate the&#xD;
      yield and outcomes of pancreas cancer screening in high-risk individuals. High-risk patients&#xD;
      who are undergoing pancreatic cancer screening in accordance with national guidelines at&#xD;
      participating study centers will be eligible for the study. Information regarding patient&#xD;
      characteristics, findings at screening examination, and patient outcomes will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome (Primary Aim):&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the proportion of patients who meet International Cancer of the Pancreas&#xD;
      Screening Consortium screening criteria 3rd update (CAPS Jan 2020), or more updated national&#xD;
      guidelines, who are found at the screening to have high-risk pancreatic lesions amenable to&#xD;
      treatment (definition of &quot;high-risk lesions amenable to treatment&quot; is provided under the&#xD;
      section on study outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes (Secondary Aims) will include (details are provided under the section on&#xD;
      study outcomes):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Proportion of patients diagnosed with any stage pancreatic cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. proportion of patients undergoing pancreatic surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cancer-related outcome, defined as a cancer-related death&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. proportion of patients experience harms, defined as any complications/adverse event due&#xD;
           to screen related procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Comparison of cancer outcome, defined cancer-related death, in screen-detected cancer&#xD;
           with cancer outcomes reported by the SEERs population-based registry. Study overview&#xD;
           Study type: a prospective observational cohort High-risk patients who meet study&#xD;
           inclusion criteria at study centers will be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and patient follow-up will be performed at individual study centers per standard&#xD;
      clinical practice. Patient characteristics, screening performed and screening results,&#xD;
      clinical outcome data will be collected by individual study centers. This data will be stored&#xD;
      and analyzed at central study REDCap located at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC)&#xD;
