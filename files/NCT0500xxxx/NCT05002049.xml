      SEEDS is a multicenter 24-month citizen science (CS) cluster randomized controlled study,&#xD;
      with interventions conducted in four European countries acting as pilot sites: 1) Greece, 2)&#xD;
      The Netherlands, 3) Spain and 4) The United Kingdom. This project will merge CS and&#xD;
      traditional approaches and will target high schools located in deprived neighborhoods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology, that combines CS and traditional science, could build effective cooperation&#xD;
      between science and society to empower adolescents from low-income environments to adopt&#xD;
      healthy lifestyles to prevent obesity, increase their interest in science and improve their&#xD;
      critical thinking.&#xD;

      SEEDS is a multicenter 24-month citizen science (CS) cluster randomized controlled study,&#xD;
      with interventions conducted in four European countries acting as pilot sites: 1) Greece, 2)&#xD;
      The Netherlands, 3) Spain and 4) The United Kingdom. This project will merge CS and&#xD;
      traditional approaches and will target high schools located in deprived neighborhoods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology, that combines CS and traditional science, could build effective cooperation&#xD;
      between science and society to empower adolescents from low-income environments to adopt&#xD;
      healthy lifestyles to prevent obesity, increase their interest in science and improve their&#xD;
      critical thinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to engage teenagers on this citizen science project to collaborate in all phases&#xD;
      of the study: problem definition, data collection, analyses and dissemination. This will&#xD;
      empower them to change habits, thereby contributing to behavioural changes. This&#xD;
      cluster-randomized control trial involves intervention and control high-schools from deprived&#xD;
      areas in the Netherlands, England, Greece and Spain. Teenagers with leadership skills from&#xD;
      intervention schools (called ambassadors) and stakeholders will participate in focus groups&#xD;
      to gain insights on the barriers and facilitators for healthy lifestyles of teenagers, and&#xD;
      how science could help address these. Building on the information of the focus groups,&#xD;
      ambassadors, stakeholders and other peers will participate in a collaborative competition&#xD;
      event where the SEEDS intervention(s) will be designed. The intervention(s) will be&#xD;
      implemented at intervention high-schools. Outcomes in health behaviours and science literacy&#xD;
      will be assessed by validated questionnaires at the start and end of the project.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>High schools located in deprived areas will be randomized to the intervention group (IG) which will receive the whole citizen science intervention of the SEEDS project, or the controls group (CG) which will not receive any kind of intervention. As the high-schools will be the unit of randomization, this study is a cluster-randomized.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to end-of-study (6-month)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in physical activity assessed by validated questionnaire HBSC and Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children (PAQ-C).&#xD;
HBSC: days a week physically active for a total of at least 60 minutes, frequency of exercise in free time that participants get out of breath or sweat and means of transport to go to school.&#xD;
PAQ-C: 7-day recall questionnaire that assesses participation in different physical activities, as well as activity during Physical Education, lunch break, recess, after school, in the evenings and at weekends. Each of the 9 questionnaire items is scored between 1 (low) and 5 (high physical activity), and a mean score of all items constitutes the overall PAQ score.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to end-of-study (6-month)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in healthy snacking choices (inside and outside school). This outcome will be assessed by validated questionnaires HBSC (times per week consume healthy and unhealthy snacking choices) and Beverage Frequency Questionnaire ( 7-day food record of beverages). Additionally, questions for assessing the frequency of consumption (times per week and time frame of the day) of each type of snack (chocolates, fruit and vegs, cakes or cookies and chocolates and sweets).</description>
