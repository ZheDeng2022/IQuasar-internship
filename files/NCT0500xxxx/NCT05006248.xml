  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers have developed games controlled by electromyographic (EMG) and inertial&#xD;
      measurement unit (IMU) activity recorded by a sensor. These will provide biofeedback to&#xD;
      participants post-stroke about the activity of their paretic muscles. The researchers&#xD;
      anticipate that providing visual biofeedback will allow subjects to observe the level of&#xD;
      co-activation in an agonist-antagonist muscle pair, and therefore initiate interventions to&#xD;
      reduce their level of co-activation. Similarly, the researchers will provide additional&#xD;
      haptic feedback using an assistive robot at the ankle joint (i.e., M1) and compare the&#xD;
      results with the pure visual feedback condition. At the end, the main objective is to compare&#xD;
      1) conventional robotic continuous passive movement (CPM) training to 2) training with visual&#xD;
      biofeedback and 3) training with both visual and haptic biofeedback.&#xD;

      Post-stroke patients will be recruited when they are referred to Shirley Ryan AbilityLab's&#xD;
      stroke rehabilitation outpatient clinics at Shirley Ryan Ability Lab's flagship hospital, or&#xD;
      satellite SRAlab locations (e.g. Arlington Heights, Wheeling, Glenview, Homewood, Northbrook,&#xD;
      or Burr Ridge) or participate in SRALab inpatient rehabilitation. The researchers will also&#xD;
      recruit from local physicians or from the Clinical Neuroscience Research Registry (CNRR). If&#xD;
      eligible and interested, they will be consented and enrolled, and the location of research&#xD;
      visits will be based on participant preference: at SRAlab's flagship hospital (355 E Erie St,&#xD;
      Chicago, 60611) or at SRAlab Burr Ridge (7600 County Line Road, Burr Ridge, 60527). Eligible&#xD;
      participants will then be randomized (using a pre-generated sequence of block randomization&#xD;
      numbers) to receive either 1) conventional robotic CPM training, 2) training with visual&#xD;
      biofeedback (games) or 3) training with visual (game) and haptic (robotic assistance)&#xD;
      biofeedback. Participants will complete a 60 min session to perform 30 minutes of their&#xD;
      assigned type of training. The goal of this study is to compare the efficacy of the three&#xD;
      different rehabilitation training conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each condition, 3 sessions per week for a total of 4 weeks will be completed in addition&#xD;
      to the daily PT sessions. Each training session will be 60 min long and include experimental&#xD;
      setup, vitals monitoring (i.e., blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation level), and&#xD;
      training time. The maximum training time for each session will be 30 minutes. For healthy&#xD;
      participants, they will use their dominant foot for all training sessions, designated by&#xD;
      asking the healthy participant the question &quot;which leg do you use to kick a ball?&quot;. For&#xD;
      clinical participants, they will use their affected/weaker foot for all training sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full clinical assessments will be performed before (T0), mid (T2) and after (T4) training&#xD;
      sessions. Note that additional 180 min will be allotted before or after the 60 min training&#xD;
      session to perform all clinical assessments: Flexion/extension range of motion (ROM), Maximal&#xD;
      Volitional Electromyographic Activity (MVEA), Maximum Voluntary Contraction Torque (MVCT),&#xD;
      Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), 10-Meter Walk Test (10MWT), 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), Berg&#xD;
      Balance Scale (BBS), Functional Gait Assessment (FGA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the final training session at T4, patients will complete a subjective experience&#xD;
      survey: Game Experience, Stroke Specific Quality of Life (SSQoL), Short Form 36.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONDITION 1 - CONTINUOUS PASSIVE MOVEMENT (CPM) TRAINING. At the beginning of the session,&#xD;
      the participant's vitals (i.e., blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation level) will be&#xD;
      measured. Participants will then be seated and secured to the chair with a gait belt and the&#xD;
      research personnel will assist with the placement of their limb into the M1 device. Velcro&#xD;
      straps will be adjusted to prevent movement between the M1 device and the participant's foot.&#xD;
      The shank Velcro straps will also be adjusted to provide support to the knee. Three sensors&#xD;
      will then be placed either on the tibialis anterior (TA) or extensor halluces longus (EHL),&#xD;
      vastus lateralis (VL) and biceps femoris longus (BF), and soleus (S) or gastrocnemius (GAS)&#xD;
      muscles on the designated limb after cleaning the skin with alcohol prep pads by a&#xD;
      researcher. Then, the ROM of the ankle joint, MVEA and MVCT of the ankle will be measured.&#xD;
      The participant will then be asked to perform up to 30 min of ankle CPM training. The&#xD;
      trajectory, ROM, and rate of oscillations provided during the CPM training will vary&#xD;
      according to the participant's functional capacity. The total session time will be 60 min,&#xD;
      including the vital measurements, experimental setup, and CPM training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONDITION 2 - VISUAL FEEDBACK. At the beginning of the session, the vitals will be measured.&#xD;
      Participants will then be seated and secured to the chair with a gait belt and the research&#xD;
      personnel will assist with the placement of their limb into the M1 device. Velcro straps will&#xD;
      be adjusted to prevent movement between the M1 device and the participant's foot. Shank&#xD;
      Velcro straps will also be adjusted to provide support to the knee. Three sensors will then&#xD;
      be placed either on the tibialis anterior (TA) or extensor halluces longus (EHL), vastus&#xD;
      lateralis (VL) and biceps femoris longus (BF), and soleus (S) or gastrocnemius (GAS) muscles&#xD;
      on the designated limb after cleaning the skin with alcohol prep pads by a researcher. Then,&#xD;
      the ROM of the ankle joint, MVEA and MVCT of the ankle will be measured. Based on the ROM of&#xD;
      the ankle, the movement of the game avatar will be adjusted (calibrated so that the ROM of&#xD;
      the participant corresponds to the maximum movement required by the avatar to play the game).&#xD;
      Participants will perform 30 min of training with visual biofeedback (games). Participants&#xD;
      will be observed while playing the games to note any software challenges they may encountered&#xD;
      while playing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONDITION 3 - HAPTIC + VISUAL FEEDBACK. At the beginning of the session, the vitals will be&#xD;
      measured. Participants will then be seated and secured to the chair with a gait belt and the&#xD;
      research personnel will assist with the placement of their limb into the M1 device. Velcro&#xD;
      straps will be adjusted to prevent movement between the M1 device and the participant's foot.&#xD;
      Shank Velcro straps will also be adjusted to provide support to the knee. Three sensors will&#xD;
      then be placed either on the tibialis anterior (TA) or extensor halluces longus (EHL), vastus&#xD;
      lateralis (VL) and biceps femoris longus (BF), and soleus (S) or gastrocnemius (GAS) muscles&#xD;
      on the designated limb after cleaning the skin with alcohol prep pads by a researcher. Then,&#xD;
      the ROM of the ankle joint, MVEA and MVCT of the ankle will be measured. Based on the ROM of&#xD;
      the ankle, the movement of the game avatar and assistance provided by the M1 device will be&#xD;
      adjusted (calibrated). Participants will perform up to 30 min of training with visual&#xD;
      biofeedback (games) and haptic biofeedback. The assistive torque that is provided by the M1&#xD;
      robot with respect to the EMG signals will be adjusted according to the participant.&#xD;
      Participants will be observed while playing the games to note any software or hardware&#xD;
      challenges they may encountered while playing.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, midpoint of intervention (after 2 weeks), and endpoint (after 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Physical function test measuring strength of the muscle of interest. A muscle is isolated, and gradual external force is applied at a right angle to the muscle's long axis. Each muscle is scored on a graded scale of &quot;weak&quot; (score of 0) to &quot;strong&quot; (score of 5) based on the participant's ability to resist the external force. The test is first completed for muscles on the unimpaired side to determine normal strength before being repeated on the impaired side. Weaker participants may be tested while lying prone (gravity eliminated). A higher score value indicates higher strength and improvement.</description>
