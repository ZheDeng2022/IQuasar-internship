    <textblock>
      Expanding the availability of quantitative tools for gait quality assessment is essential to&#xD;
      enable clinicians to analyze patient's gait, monitor gait changes, and modify the&#xD;
      rehabilitation process, when gold-standard tools are not available. The OneStep technology is&#xD;
      a smartphone application (app), that uses smartphone sensors to provide ongoing gait&#xD;
      diagnostics. This study aims to further evaluate the analytical capability of the OneStep&#xD;
      algorithm in recording and analyzing gait parameters and test its reliability and validity.&#xD;
      The study will take place at Reuth Rehabilitation Hospital. All participants will be using&#xD;
      the App and the C-Mill treadmill (Motek, Amsterdam, Netherlands) built-in gait analysis&#xD;
      system, during two separate treadmill walks of up to 15 minutes. All walking sessions will be&#xD;
      recorded with two cameras. Data obtained from participants will be collected and analyzed for&#xD;
      gait parameters. The study sample will include 30 healthy volunteers and 70 patients.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current gold standard for gait analyses are laboratories equipped for three-dimensional&#xD;
      gait analysis. However, a major drawback of these laboratories is their inability to examine&#xD;
      gait in patients' own environment. Therefore, there is a need for an inexpensive, portable,&#xD;
      easy-to-use, and reliable gait tracking method. Wearable devices and smartphones may provide&#xD;
      a solution. The OneStep smartphone application (app) is one such technology. It can be&#xD;
      downloaded to a smartphone, placed in the pants pocket, and once activated, can collect gait&#xD;
      data while a subject is in motion. In an earlier study, the OneStep app has been used to&#xD;
      collect data on patients with lower extremity disability or pain, during in-hospital&#xD;
      physiotherapy sessions, self-exercises in the hospital or at home, and other daily&#xD;
      activities, to assess patients' adherence to and compliance with the prescribed&#xD;
      rehabilitation regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to expand the utilization of the OneStep app in gait parameters&#xD;
      analysis by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Collecting and analyzing new walking parameters: main parts of the foot bearing weight;&#xD;
           walking base; identification of which part hits the ground first during the initial&#xD;
           contact; ankle and knee range of motion; pelvic movement&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Validating the OneStep app against standard gait measurement tools among both healthy&#xD;
           volunteers and patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessing the test-retest reliability of the OneStep app gait measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sample will include a total of 100 participants: 30 healthy volunteers and 70&#xD;
      patients. Each participant will have two sessions using the treadmill for walks of up to 15&#xD;
      minutes, with the second walking session used for test-retest reliability assessment. Healthy&#xD;
      volunteers will complete the second session on the same day as the first session after a&#xD;
      10-minute break. Patients will complete the second session within one week of the first. A&#xD;
      check-in phase will be performed at the beginning of each session, during which the&#xD;
      participants (specifically the patients) will be instructed to rest for up to 10 min, to&#xD;
      ensure their performance on treadmill is not affected by prior physical activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During both sessions, participants will use the C-Mill treadmill (Motek, Amsterdam,&#xD;
      Netherlands) and will be equipped with 2 smartphones placed on each hip. As some patients&#xD;
      will not be able to keep on walking for 15 minutes, a minimal duration of the required walk&#xD;
      was set at 2 minutes. Sessions will be recorded using two high resolution video cameras. The&#xD;
      phones will be placed in a participant's front pants pockets; for those without pockets, two&#xD;
      leg harnesses will be provided with space to hold the phones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data obtained from all participants will be collected and analyzed for gait parameters.&#xD;
      Patients were instructed to walk at a comfortable gait speed. Healthy volunteers were given a&#xD;
      specific walking protocol of 15 minutes each, which consisted of 14 selected gait types with&#xD;
      different speeds and walking styles.&#xD;
