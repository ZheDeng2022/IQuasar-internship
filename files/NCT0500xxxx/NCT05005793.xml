  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower serum bicarbonate levels, even within the normal laboratory range, in kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients (KTRs) are associated with an increased risk of graft loss, cardiovascular events&#xD;
      and mortality. Because acid retention is common in KTRs, it is plausible that alkali therapy&#xD;
      in KTRs may also result in improved vascular and graft function. The investigators will&#xD;
      perform a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 12 month study in 120 KTRs to&#xD;
      examine the effect of sodium bicarbonate therapy on surrogate markers of CVD and graft&#xD;
      function. The overall hypothesis is that treatment with bicarbonate will improve indicators&#xD;
      of vascular and graft function in KTRs by decreasing complement activation.&#xD;
