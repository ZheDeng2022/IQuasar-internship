  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-part, first-in-human study of single ascending doses (SAD; Part 1) and multiple&#xD;
      ascending doses (MAD; Part 2) of CORT125236 in healthy participants; Part 3 is optional, to&#xD;
      investigate whether CORT125236 ameliorates the effects of prednisone on various&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints. The 3 parts may not be conducted entirely sequentially&#xD;
      provided that this is justified by the pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety data obtained from&#xD;
      completed cohorts. The first MAD cohort will not start until data are available from at least&#xD;
      3 SAD levels to allow MAD administration to proceed. The decision on whether to start Part 3&#xD;
      can be made at any point after completion of 3 SAD levels, and will be based on achieving&#xD;
      sufficiently high plasma CORT125236 exposure in Part 1 of the study.&#xD;

    <description>Cohorts will receive a single dose of CORT125236 lipid capsule formulation by mouth on Day 1 in a fasted or fed state. Cohort A will receive a 20-mg dose in a fasted state. Cohort B will receive a ≤3-fold increase in dose from Cohort A in a fasted state; the dose level and dose regimen (whether to split the dose) will be determined after evaluation of safety and PK data for Cohort A. Subsequent cohorts will receive a ≤3-fold increase in CORT125236 dose from the previous cohort in a fasted or fed state; the dose level, dose regimen, and prandial state will be determined after evaluation of safety and PK data from previous cohorts.</description>

    <description>In Period 1, participants will receive a single dose of prednisone 25 mg (20 mg + 5 mg) tablet by mouth on Day 1 in a fasted or fed state. After a 7-day washout, in Period 2, participants will receive a single dose of prednisone as in Period 1 plus a single dose of CORT125236 lipid capsule formulation by mouth on Day 1 in a fasted or fed state. The dose of CORT125236 and the prandial state will be determined after evaluation of safety and PK data from Part 1. Part 3 of the study is optional.</description>
