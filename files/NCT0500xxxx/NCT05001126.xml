      This study aims to explore the dose effects of three weekly volumes of high-intensity&#xD;
      functional training (HIFT) on apolipoprotein B (ApoB), triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol&#xD;
      (CHOL) content of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), and&#xD;
      high-density lipoproteins (HDL) particles, fasting insulin and glucose, glycosylated&#xD;
      hemoglobin (HbA1c), and endothelial function after a 12-week training program. Secondarily,&#xD;
      this study aims to also explore the subjective dose-responses of &quot;exercise enjoyment&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;intention to continue&quot; after this 12-week training program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Individuals with metabolic syndrome (MetS) are at a greater risk for developing&#xD;
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) than those without MetS, due to underlying&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Exercise is an effective&#xD;
      primary and secondary prevention strategy for MetS, however less than 25% of adults meet the&#xD;
      minimum stated public recommendations. Barriers often identified are lack of enjoyment and&#xD;
      lack of time. High intensity functional training (HIFT), a time efficient modality of&#xD;
      exercise, has shown some potential to elicit positive affectivity, and elicit increased&#xD;
      fitness and improved glucose metabolism. However, the effects of HIFT on dyslipidemia and&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction have not been explored, nor have the effects been explored in a&#xD;
      population with MetS. Additionally, no studies have investigated the minimal dose of HIFT per&#xD;
      week to see clinically meaningful changes in cardiometabolic health. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to: 1) determine the dose-response effect of HIFT on blood lipids, insulin&#xD;
      resistance, and endothelial function, and 2) determine the dose-response effect of HIFT on&#xD;
      body composition, fitness, and perceived enjoyment and intention to continue the exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/design: In this randomized, dose-response trial, participants will undergo a 12-week&#xD;
      HIFT intervention of either 1 day/week, 2 days/week, or 3 days/week of supervised,&#xD;
      progressive exercise. Outcomes assessed at baseline and post-intervention will be multiple&#xD;
      cardiometabolic markers, and fitness. Additionally, the participant's affective response will&#xD;
      be measured after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: The findings of this research will provide evidence on the minimal dose of HIFT&#xD;
      per week to see clinically meaningful improvements in the risk factors of MetS, as well as&#xD;
      whether this modality is likely to mitigate the barriers to exercise. If an effective dose of&#xD;
      HIFT per week is determined and if this modality is perceived positively, it may provide&#xD;
      exercise specialists and health care providers a tool to prevent and treat MetS.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and 48hrs post 12-week training completion</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline and post-training VO2max will be measured via a graded exercise test (GXT) on a power treadmill. After a 5 min warm-up, participants will walk at a constant speed while incline is increased 1% each minute until volitional exhaustion [Balke &amp; Ware, 1959] while VO2 is continuously captured. VO2max will be recorded and reported in units of mL/kg/min. Participants will rest passively for 20 min then perform a verification trial at 105% of their maximal GXT workload while VO2 is continuously captured until volitional exhaustion. If VO2max of the verification bout and GXT are within ± 3%, true VO2max will be considered achieved [Astorino et al., 2009; Nolan et al., 2014; Weatherwax et al., 2016]. If verification is not achieved, they will repeat the trial after a 24hr rest. Change from baseline will be calculated and aggregated as mean (SD) for each dose group and male/female subgroups.

The scale contains five questions with the answering options (Very Poor-1, Poor-2, Average-3, Good-4, Very Good-5) associated to these elements of physical fitness: cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength, speed-agility, and flexibility. Change from baseline will be calculated and aggregated as mean (SD) for each dose group and male/female subgroups.

    <description>To assess the participants perception of enjoyment of their allocated HIFT intervention, the validated Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) will be used [Kendzierski &amp; DeCarlo, 1991] and reported as the sum of all scores. The PACES is an 18-item, 7-point bipolar rating scale where 1 represents the lowest level of enjoyment and 7 represents the highest level of enjoyment. Data will be aggregated as mean (SD) for each dose group and male/female subgroups. Mean (SD) will be compared between dose groups and male/female subgroups.</description>

    <description>To assess the participants intention to continue their allocated HIFT intervention, two additional items will be added to the PACES regarding 1) how likely the participant will continue performing the modality of exercise (0=unlikely to 10=very likely) and 2) how many days per week the participant will would consider performing the modality of exercise (0-7 days) [Kwan &amp; Bryan, 2010; Heinrich et al., 2019]. Data per question will be aggregated as mean (SD) for each dose group and male/female subgroups. Mean (SD) will be compared between dose groups and male/female subgroups.</description>
