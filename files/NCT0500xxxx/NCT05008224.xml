  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3475)&#xD;
      monotherapy, followed by chemotherapy, followed by pembrolizumab consolidation. The primary&#xD;
      hypothesis of the study is that the complete response (CR) rate at the end of study&#xD;
      intervention according to Lugano 2014 response criteria is higher than conventional&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <description>The rate of PET negativity is defined as the percentage of participants with a score of 1, 2, or 3, assessed by independent central review according to the FDG-PET 5-point scale, after administration of pembrolizumab monotherapy. Per FDG-PET 5-point scale: Score 1= No uptake above the background, Score 2= Uptake ≤ mediastinum, Score 3= Uptake &gt; mediastinum but ≤ liver, Score 4= Uptake moderately higher than liver, Score 5= Uptake markedly higher than liver or new lesions. In the present study, scores of 1, 2 and 3 are considered to be negative and scores of 4 and 5 are considered to be positive.</description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention.
