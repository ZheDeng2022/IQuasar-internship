  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of chronic pains is challenging and fraught with limitations. Fibromyalgia is&#xD;
      a common pain disorder characterized by chronic widespread pains, associated with fatigue and&#xD;
      impaired quality of life. Fibromyalgia affects millions of people and is among the most&#xD;
      common reasons for consulting with a rheumatologist. The food and drug administration (FDA)&#xD;
      approved three medications to treat fibromyalgia, though there are many patients for whom&#xD;
      these medications are ineffective, poorly tolerated or cost-prohibitive. Accordingly, there&#xD;
      exists a need for novel therapeutics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers would like to test the therapeutic efficacy of a non-pharmacologic&#xD;
      non-interventional bedside technique called vestibular caloric stimulation (VCS). VCS,&#xD;
      irrigating the external ear canal with water, is a simple, non-invasive, cost-free procedure&#xD;
      with preliminary data suggesting potential for improving pain. VCS is a form of&#xD;
      neuromodulation and there are anatomically defined pathways elucidated to help explain how&#xD;
      this works. There currently exists limited data on the topic, only case reports and case&#xD;
      series. Given a clear need for additional therapeutics in many patients with fibromyalgia,&#xD;
      the researchers have elected to conduct this trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label pilot study testing the potential therapeutic efficacy of&#xD;
      vestibulocortical stimulation via cold water calorics in fibromyalgia. The trial will entail&#xD;
      6 weeks of total involvement for each participant including 3 weeks of active participation,&#xD;
      with 4 weeks follow up: the irrigation happens at the beginning of week 2, so 4 weeks later&#xD;
      is week 6.&#xD;
