  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis affects 3-4% of the Canadian population, of which about 10%&#xD;
      will need a brace treatment during pubertal growth spurt. Our team has developed an&#xD;
      innovative conception method for brace design by optimizing for the immediate in-brace&#xD;
      correction. The model is customized to each patient. In this project, the investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of this platform's customized treatment and validate its clinical&#xD;
      application.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study will be separated into two stages. Each patient will initially try a control brace and a test brace in a crossover study model to evaluate the immediate correction. Each patient will then use one brace from either the control arm or test arm to evaluate the long-term correction of the brace.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Treatment failure is defined as having a Cobb angle progress by more than 5 degrees compared to the baseline measurement or exceeding a value of 45 degrees</description>

    <description>The trunk surface will be scanned to reconstruct a numerical model of the patient's trunk, this reconstruction will help to produce the optimized brace. The patient skeletal will also be reconstructed from a bilateral radiograph using an EOS imaging system. Each patient will try both the control and the test brace. Radiographic (supine position) and patient-reported data will be gathered and analyzed to observe changes between the immediate correction of the braces. The SRS-22r will be collected. The study protocol requires no additional visits beyond the standard of care. There will be one additional radiograph compared to the standard of care.</description>

    <description>After comparing the immediate correction of the braces, each patient will be using either the test or the control brace for a period of two years. There will be follow-up visits, between 6 months and 1 year depending on the patient growth. The brace will be renewed using the same procedure to adapt to the patient's growth. The study protocol requires no additional visits beyond the standard of care. There will be no additional radiograph compared to the standard of care. Compliance monitors are installed in each brace.</description>
