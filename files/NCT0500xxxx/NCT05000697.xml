  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT) has been considered the preferred initial&#xD;
      treatment strategy for distal rectal cancer. Advantages of this approach include improved&#xD;
      local control after radical surgery but also the opportunity for organ preserving strategies&#xD;
      (Watch and Wait - WW). Consolidation chemotherapy (cCT) regimens using fluoropyrimidine-based&#xD;
      with or without oxaliplatin following nCRT have demonstrated to increase complete response&#xD;
      and organ preservation rates among these patients. However, the benefit of adding oxaliplatin&#xD;
      to cCt compared to fluoropyrimidine alone regimens in terms of primary tumor response remains&#xD;
      unclear. Since oxaliplatin-treatment may be associated with considerable toxicity, it becomes&#xD;
      imperative to understand the benefit of its incorporation into standard cCT regimens in terms&#xD;
      of primary tumor response. The aim of the present trial is to compare the outcomes of 2&#xD;
      different cCT regimens following nCRT (fluoropyrimidine-alone versus&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidine+oxaliplatin) for patients with distal rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In this multi-centre study, patients with magnetic resonance-defined distal rectal&#xD;
      tumors will be randomized on a 1:1 ratio to receive long-course chemoradiation (54Gy)&#xD;
      followed by cCT with fluoropyrimidine alone versus fluoropyrimidine+oxaliplatin. Magnetic&#xD;
      resonance (MR) will be analyzed centrally prior to patient inclusion and randomization.&#xD;
      mrT2-3N0-1 tumor located no more than 1cm above the anorectal ring determined by sagittal&#xD;
      views on MR will be eligible for the study. Tumor response will be assessed after 12 weeks&#xD;
      from radiotherapy (RT) completion. Patients with clinical complete response (clinical,&#xD;
      endoscopic and radiological) will be enrolled in an organ-preservation program (WW). The&#xD;
      primary endpoint of this trial is decision to organ-preservation surveillance (WW) at 18&#xD;
      weeks from RT completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: Long-course nCRT with cCT is associated with improved complete response rates and&#xD;
      may be a very attractive alternative to increase the chances for organ-preservation&#xD;
      strategies. Fluoropyrimidine-based cCT with or without oxaliplatin has never been&#xD;
      investigated in the setting of a randomized trial to compare clinical response rates and the&#xD;
      possibility of organ-preservation. The outcomes of this study may significantly impact&#xD;
      clinical practice of patients with distal rectal cancer interested in organ-preservation.&#xD;

      Patients and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with distal rectal cancer will be eligible for the study after initial clinical,&#xD;
      endoscopic and radiological assessment. At this point, patients will be offered to&#xD;
      participate in the study and after informed consent, randomized to control or experimental&#xD;
      arms as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Decision to Watch and Wait due to clinical complete response achieved at 18&#xD;
      weeks from last date of radiation using clinical (DRE), endoscopic and radiological criteria&#xD;
      (mrTRG grade) or near-complete clinical response (no progressive disease clinically,&#xD;
      endoscopically or radiologically)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of clinical complete response (cCR) available below and at the discretion of the&#xD;
      attending surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of radiological complete response as described below (centralized).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be counted as event if at 18 weeks the decision is to interrupt Watch and Wait&#xD;
      and proceed to surgery (any kind) because of overt incomplete clinical response. In order to&#xD;
      standardize assessment of response and reduce inter-observer variability, the decision to&#xD;
      continue on Watch and Wait (or not) will be at the discretion of the central committee during&#xD;
      central revision of studies.&#xD;

           4,27,28&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical: only superficial ulceration or minor (questionable) irregularities of the&#xD;
           mucosal/rectal wall&#xD;

           signal intensity; no extramural vascular invasion 27&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central Committee&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central committee is multidisciplinary group of surgeons, medical oncologists and&#xD;
      radiologists previously appointed at the beginning of the recruitment of patients and with&#xD;
      previous experience with organ preservation.2, 21 This group of specialist will be&#xD;
      responsible to assess the baseline staging and define if the patients fulfill all the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to randomization. The committee will also be responsible&#xD;
      to evaluate the endoscopic and radiological tumor re-assessment studies at 12 and 18 weeks&#xD;
      from radiation completion. The definition to continue on the Watch and Wait pathway or not&#xD;
      will be at the discretion of this committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical aspects of assessment tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suggested MR protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.5T - FRFSE; TR/TE: 3300/120 (ms); slice thickness/gap: 3.0/0; Matrix: 256 x 256; NSA 8)&#xD;
      3.0T - FRFSE; TR/TE: 8000/150 (ms); slice thickness/gap: 3.0/0; Matrix: 288 x 288; NSA 5) DWI&#xD;
      - inclusion of a high b-value of at least 800&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suggested Endoscopic assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic assessment using a flexible scope (gastroscope preferred for retroflexion); direct&#xD;
      endoscopic and retroflexion view of the primary tumor/scar; endoscopic biopsies at discretion&#xD;
      of participating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative radiotherapy will be delivered on a linear accelerator in prone or supine&#xD;
      position, preferably with full bladder. The use of a belly board is allowed. Isocentric 3 or&#xD;
      4 fields, as well as an IMRT technique is allowed, as long as all beams are treated on a&#xD;
      daily basis. The dose distribution and calculation should be performed on CT or MRI and&#xD;
      specified according to the ICRU 50 guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose specification: All patients will receive 25 daily fractions of 1.8 Gy up to a total dose&#xD;
      of 45 Gy to the pelvic field including the tumor bed with a margin and the regional lymph&#xD;
      nodes. A field reduction after 45 Gy is recommended up to 54 Gy. The last 5 fractions will&#xD;
      then be given to the tumor bed with a margin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target volume:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic CTV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mesorectum: Distally, only lymph nodes or tumor deposits up to 4 cm are included. For&#xD;
           tumors in lower rectum this means that the entire mesorectum down to the pelvic floor is&#xD;
           included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presacral nodes and nodes along the rectal superior artery: Since local recurrences are&#xD;
           very unusual above S1 - S2, lymph nodes above this level should not be included unless&#xD;
           there are signs of radiologically positive lymph nodes presacrally. If this is the case,&#xD;
           the cranial limit of CTV should be at least 1 cm above the most cranial radiologically&#xD;
           positive lymph node.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lateral lymph node stations: Until they reach the level of the obturator canal Internal&#xD;
           iliac artery up to the bifurcation from the external iliac artery. The cranial border&#xD;
           for the CTV is in most cases just below the bifurcation of the internal and external&#xD;
           iliac arteries. In most patients this is at the level of S1 - S2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ischio-rectal fossa and the anal canal: Included in pelvic CTV only if the tumor grows&#xD;
           into the levators or down into the anal canal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lymph nodes along the external iliac artery: Included if the tumor grows into anterior&#xD;
           organs like the prostate, urinary bladder, cervix, vagina or uterus to such an extent&#xD;
           that the external nodes are at risk for metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Boost GTV:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GTV is the visible primary tumor and radiologically positive lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTV boost:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GTV boost plus a margin of 2 cm within the same anatomical compartment as the tumour is in,&#xD;
      for the dose of 45 Gy, also around radiologically engaged lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTV:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above description relates to the CTV. A PTV should normally be defined and includes CTV&#xD;
      and internal target volume (ITV) and a margin necessary for the setup. These margins are&#xD;
      depending upon several factors that are related to the equipment at each radiotherapy center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy Protocols&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant capecitabine: 825mg/m2 bid on the radiotherapy days only&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consolidation chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Consolidation capecitabine (alone): 1000mg/m2 bid, for 14 days, in a 3 week cycle, for 4&#xD;
           cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Consolidation options with oxaliplatin:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1. mFOLFOX6: Oxaliplatin 85mg/m2 plus Leucovorin 400mg/m2 on a concomitant 2 hours&#xD;
      infusion. 5FU 400mg/m2 on a bolus infusion, followed by 5FU 2400mg/m2 in 46 hours infusion,&#xD;
      every 2 weeks, for 6 cycles 2.2. CAPOX: Oxaliplatin 130mg/m2 on a 2 hours infusion.&#xD;
      Capecitabine 1000mg/m2 bid daily, for 14 days, starting on the evening of the oxaliplatin&#xD;
      infusion. Repeat every 3 weeks, for 4 cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Response&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of response will be performed at 12 weeks (and 18 weeks from last date of&#xD;
      radiation therapy if cCR or near-complete response is detected at 12 weeks). All patients&#xD;
      will undergo endoscopic reassessment, DRE and high-resolution MR. Endoscopic biopsies will be&#xD;
      at the discretion of the attending surgeon/endoscopist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with complete or near-complete clinical response at 12 weeks will be recommended&#xD;
      reassessment at 18 weeks from RT. Patients with clinically overt incomplete clinical response&#xD;
      at 12 or 18 weeks will be referred to immediate radical surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals will be randomized and allocated at a 1:1 ratio to the two groups (control and&#xD;
      experimental) using a permuted block design with a random block size of 4, 6, and 8. (1-3) A&#xD;
      randomization list will be generated electronically using appropriate software immediately&#xD;
      after being considered eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and attending physicians will not be blinded to the treatment arm randomized for&#xD;
      each patient. However, as a strategy to reduce investigator's expectations and reduce&#xD;
      inherent bias, the central committee will be blinded to the treatment arm. It is expected&#xD;
      that blinding the central committee, who will be responsible for assessing the primary&#xD;
      endpoint, any bias related to the investigator's expectation about the treatment arm and the&#xD;
      chances of Watch and Wait will be nulled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint (decision to WW due to cCR/near CR) was observed in 55% and 85% at 12&#xD;
      weeks (in contrast to the 18 weeks used in the present trial) among patients with early cT3&#xD;
      and cT2 rectal cancer respectively.29 In this study, there was a distribution of 66% of cT3&#xD;
      and 33% cT2. Therefore, response rates appear to be highly dependent on exact T-stage&#xD;
      distribution. Considering the expected inclusion of more advanced disease (late mrT3 or even&#xD;
      mrT4 rectal cancers) the investigators expect 40% cCR/near-CR in the control arm. A similar&#xD;
      difference 60% versus 40% was achieved in the preliminary report of the outcomes of the OPRA&#xD;
      trial. This difference in TME-free survival at 3 years was statistically significant favoring&#xD;
      patients undergoing nCRT with cCT in comparison to nCRT preceded by induction chemotherapy&#xD;
      (both regimens incorporating oxaliplatin). In this setting, if experimental results in ≥60%&#xD;
      cCR/near-CR, the study will be considered POSITIVE. The incorporation of oxaliplatin to a&#xD;
      consolidation CRT regimen that results in ≥20% increase in cCR/near-CR exceeds the potential&#xD;
      disadvantages of treatment-related toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assume that the primary outcome will occur in 40% of individuals in&#xD;
      control group and 60% in the experimental group, which corresponds to an absolute difference&#xD;
      in proportions of 20%. It is estimated that a sample of 194 (97 per group) provides 80%&#xD;
      statistical power to detect this difference at a significance level of 5% using the&#xD;
      Chi-square test and assuming a two-sided significance hypothesis and considering a 1:1&#xD;
      allocation. The estimated dropout rate is 10% in each group, so it is expected to include 216&#xD;
      individuals (108 per group). The sample size calculation was performed using SAS 9.4 (PROC&#xD;
      POWER procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time-table&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient accrual: 2 years and 6 months Patient/institution/year: 5-6 (20 institutions:&#xD;
      100-120/year - 2 years n=200-240)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the arm of two drugs during consolidation shows ≥25% response rate after 72 patients,&#xD;
      study will be interrupted (efficacy). If the arm of two drugs shows less than 5% response&#xD;
      rate after 72 patients, the study will be interrupted.&#xD;
