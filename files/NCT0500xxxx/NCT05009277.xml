  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LINDA thermal device consists of a thermal camera attachable to a cell phone and an&#xD;
      application for connection with an artificial intelligence program based on a convolutional&#xD;
      neural network for classification of thermographic breast images. The system is previously&#xD;
      fed with thermographic images of the breast and their respective results/diagnostics. The&#xD;
      images are processed in an automated way and return a percentage of chance of having a&#xD;
      pathological pattern.&#xD;

      The LINDA thermal device consists of a thermal camera attachable to a cell phone and an&#xD;
      application for connection with an artificial intelligence program based on a convolutional&#xD;
      neural network for classification of thermographic breast images. The system is previously&#xD;
      fed with thermographic images of the breast and their respective results/diagnostics. The&#xD;
      images are processed in an automated way and return a percentage of chance of having a&#xD;
      pathological pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      nfrared imaging (thermography) was approved as an auxiliary imaging modality for mammography&#xD;
      by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1982. Thermography is a non-invasive,&#xD;
      non-contact method without ionizing radiation, which is why its use can be prolonged and&#xD;
      repeated. This technique allows for an evaluation of the functionality of the structures,&#xD;
      which is why it is considered a physiological test and records the variation in the surface&#xD;
      temperature of the human body based on the infrared radiation emitted by the surface of that&#xD;
      body. It is capable of detecting tumor lesions since cancer cells generate heat due to the&#xD;
      release of nitric oxide in the blood, causing changes in microcirculation, vasodilation,&#xD;
      neo-angiogenesis and increased metabolic activity of cancer cells. Thus, in the initial stage&#xD;
      of breast cancer, when it has not yet caused anatomical changes, there will be physiological&#xD;
      changes that will lead to an increase in blood flow and metabolic activity. This increase&#xD;
      induces a temperature rise in the area which will then be detected by thermography.&#xD;
