      The aim of this study was to determine the effect of a home visit program provided to the&#xD;
      caregivers of asthmatic patients on the perceived care burden. A randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      was used. The sample consisted of 30 participants in the intervention group and 30&#xD;
      participants in the control group. A home visit program including education and counseling&#xD;
      was applied to participants in the intervention group.&#xD;
