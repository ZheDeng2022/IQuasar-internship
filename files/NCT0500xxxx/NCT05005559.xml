  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, randomized, two-armed, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a candidate adjuvanted recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike&#xD;
      (S) protein subunit vaccine (SpikoGen) produced by CinnaGen Co. 16,876 adult individuals&#xD;
      receive either SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike protein (25 µg) with Advax-SM adjuvant (15 mg) or&#xD;
      saline placebo in a 3:1 ratio. The randomization is stratified by age (from 18 to under 40&#xD;
      years of age or from 40 to under 50 years of age). The injection is given in two doses with a&#xD;
      21-day interval in the deltoid muscle of the non-dominant arm. Participants will be followed&#xD;
      up for six months after the second dose of the study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypotheses include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine candidate significantly reduces the risk of symptomatic&#xD;
           COVID-19 in adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine candidate significantly reduces the risk of severe&#xD;
           COVID-19 in adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine candidate is safe and tolerable in adult subjects.&#xD;
