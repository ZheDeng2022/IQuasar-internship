  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Roller Hockey is a sport played on a 40*20 metres rink characterized by combined periods of&#xD;
      high intensity and short breaks, there´s a lack of epidemiological studies in this field. In&#xD;
      line with the well-established model of sports injury prevention research proffered by van&#xD;
      Mechelen, the first stage in this process is establishing the extent of the problem i.e.&#xD;
      injury incidence, severity and burden. Through an online survey filled by semiprofessional&#xD;
      athletes, it is posible to obtain all this important information. This way, it will be&#xD;
      possible to fulfill a gap in the literature and take action in the near future in order to&#xD;
      reduce the prevalence of injuries in this sport.&#xD;

      A retrospective study was performed in male Roller Hockey players. 275 players will be&#xD;
      recruited. Data of all injury along a whole season will be collected. Patients' information,&#xD;
      including age, number of years playing, skill level and injured body part, will be analysed.&#xD;
