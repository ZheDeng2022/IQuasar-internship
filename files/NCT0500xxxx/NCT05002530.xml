             -  Very important Note: This clinical study is the first clinical study in literature&#xD;
                (First posted August 12, 2021) which demonstrated depending on molecular findings&#xD;
                that Vitamin A /Retinoic Acid will treat smell loss resulted by COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent rapidly accumulating evidences and reports indicate that partial loss of the sense of&#xD;
      smell or even total anosmia are early markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection and frequently reported&#xD;
      symptoms associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (Lechien J. R et al., 2020) However, the&#xD;
      cellular mechanisms of this phenomenon are unknown. The rates of insomnia and depression were&#xD;
      26.45% and 9.92% in the COVID-19 patients after recovery. Therefore, finding an effective&#xD;
      treatment for COVID-19 Anosmia is a critical point. Although, ACE2 has been identified as the&#xD;
      principal host cell receptor of 2019-nCoV, and it is thought to play a critical role in the&#xD;
      virus's entrance into the cell and subsequent infection, many cells can be infected by&#xD;
      COVID-19 while also expressing little or no ACE2. Even though the COVID-19 entry receptor,&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is not expressed in the receptor of olfactory&#xD;
      neurons, or its synthesis is limited to to a minor fraction of these neurons.of these&#xD;
      neurons, COVID-19 infection causes a loss of smell (anosmia) (Katarzyna Bilinska et&#xD;
      al.,2021). Our recent findings showed that COVID-19 binds directly to STRA6 receptors of&#xD;
      retinol leading to retinol depletion and retinoic acid insufficiency (M Elkazzaz et al,.&#xD;
      2021) . Retinoic acid insufficiency in the olfactory epithelium, both in mouse and chick&#xD;
      models, causes progenitor cell maintenance failure and, consequently, olfactory neurons&#xD;
      differentiation is not maintained . An explant system, showed that renewal of olfactory&#xD;
      neurons is inhibited if retinoic acid synthesis was failed in the olfactory epithelium&#xD;
      (Paschaki M et al., 2013) . It's worth noting that vitamin A shortage also causes olfactory&#xD;
      and taste problems, In a study by Garrett-Laster et al., (1984), the patients had vitamin A&#xD;
      deficiency because of malnutrition and alcoholic liver cirrhosis; they lost their sense of&#xD;
      smell after that disorder. LaMantia and Rawson et al.,( 2007) reported that administration of&#xD;
      retinoid acid after the damage of olfactory system motivates an immune response and produces&#xD;
      a more quick recovery of olfactoryguided behavior. It was showed that Isotretinoin improved&#xD;
      the significantly performance of patients in the olfactory test(Demet Kartal et al.,2017)&#xD;
      Moreover, there is increasing evidence that retinoic acid (atRA) influences gene expression&#xD;
      of components of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which plays a pivotal role in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of essential hypertension. Retinoic acid induced ACE2 expression in different&#xD;
      animal models. Moreover, a study suggests that topical retinoids may have applicability in&#xD;
      promoting sinus regeneration and wound healing. In a study comparing treated and untreated&#xD;
      nasal mucosa ,untreated regenerated mucosa showed expected changes of submucosal gland loss,&#xD;
      basal lamina and lamina propria fibrosis and loss of cilia. Reinoic acid treatment appeared&#xD;
      to result in better mucosal regeneration marked by less cellular atypia and fibrosis(Mendy S.&#xD;
      Maccabee et al,. 2003).. Aerosolized retinoic acid will have an effective role in treating&#xD;
      post COVID-19 anosmia (loss of smell) via upregulating ACE2, STRA 6 and regenerating of&#xD;
      olfactory receptors and olfactory sensory cells and neurons.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized interventional comparative and multicenter Phase IIII trial. 10000&#xD;
      adult male and female patients with post COVID-19 anosmia (loss of smell) and fulfilling the&#xD;
      below outlined inclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinoic acids,STRA6, COVID-19, ocular and olfactory nervous system&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pinkeye (conjunctivitis), which is also associated with vitamin A deficiency, is prevalent&#xD;
      symptom in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. (68,69).According to our findings, the&#xD;
      binding of COVID-19 spike protein to STRA6, which is one of the main receptors for retinol&#xD;
      cell entrance and retinoic acid production in the retina, strongly explains this symptoms .It&#xD;
      was showed that genetic null mutation of STRA6 in mice model results in high retinoid&#xD;
      reduction in the neurosensory retina and retinal pigment epithelium , diminished eye&#xD;
      morphology and visual responses , despite the fact the last-mentioned problem is not as&#xD;
      serious as in patients with mutant STRA6 (11).STRA6-mediated transport is especially&#xD;
      significant in the eye and in the existence of vitamin A deficiency in the diet (Probable).&#xD;
      Retinoic acid isn't transported. (70). A study strongly suggested that STRA6 works as a&#xD;
      retinol channel/transporter(70). Analysis of function Loss- in embryos of zebrafishshowed&#xD;
      that deficiency of Stra6 caused vitamin A deprivation of the developing eyes(70). RA&#xD;
      signaling pathway promotes normal development of the optic nerve and ventral retina via its&#xD;
      activities in the neural crest cell-derivedperiocular mesenchyme (71)and its deficiency may&#xD;
      leads to retinitis. Although, several studies applied on COVID-19 patients have attempted to&#xD;
      identify parameters linked to the olfactory disorders and taste with Angiotensin-Converting&#xD;
      Enzyme 2 (ACE2)receptors it is clear that it takes place via receptors of vitamin A . (72)&#xD;
      It's worth noting that vitamin A shortage also causes olfactory and taste problems, In a&#xD;
      study by Garrett-Laster et al.,(73)the patients had vitamin A deficiency because of&#xD;
      malnutrition and alcoholic liver cirrhosis; they lost their sense of smell after that&#xD;
      disorder. LaMantia and Rawson reported that administration of retinoid acid after the damage&#xD;
      of olfactory system motivates an immune response and produces a more quick recovery of&#xD;
      olfactoryguided behavior(74).&#xD;
&#xD;
      13 cis retinoic acid improved the sense of smell and the performance of the olfactory test in&#xD;
      acne patients (75) This also propose that insufficiency of vitamin A also rises in COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we strongly suggest that loss of stra6 function thorough blocking it by COVID-19&#xD;
      spike protein which binds to it with high affinity as a result it may hijack its signaling&#xD;
      pathway leading to retinoic acid synthesis disruption and vitamin A deficiency . The symptoms&#xD;
      and outcomes that arise in the eyes and nervous system of patients with COVID-19 are with&#xD;
      unknown etiology but the results of retinoic acid deficiency manifested through vitamin A&#xD;
      receptors. Ataxia , Headache , acute cerebrovascular disorder, impaired and consciousness are&#xD;
      observed in patients with COVID-19 as central nervous system involvement and hyposmia,&#xD;
      hypogeusia, neuralgia and hypopsia are seen as involvement of the peripheral nervous system.&#xD;
      Patients with muscle involvement were also observed(76,77). COVID-19-related acute&#xD;
      hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy instances have also been documented. The unenhanced&#xD;
      cranial BT obtained in the patients revealed hypodensity in both medial thalamuses (78).&#xD;
      Similarly, this is a region with a lot of Stra6 receptors of Vitamin A (58). Zhao et al (79)&#xD;
      reported the first case of Guillain-Barré syndrome linked to COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinoic acids play a critical role in inducing neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. RA are&#xD;
      important for hypothalamus and the hippocampus that control alertness and mentality&#xD;
      .All-trans retinoic acid (atRA) can be formed from the vitamin A/ retinol in the brain. This&#xD;
      is important for long-term potentiation (LTP). Vitamin A insufficiency also leads to&#xD;
      circadian dysfunction. Cognitive dysfunction is also commonly showed(80,81).Pasutto et al.(7)&#xD;
      reported that STRA6 mutations associated with lung malformations and many heart , eye&#xD;
      diaphragm as well as retardation in mentality as in syndrome of Matthew-Wood in humans,&#xD;
      validating its reported functions in vitamin A uptake by cells as vitamin A/retinoic acid is&#xD;
      very critical in the process of organogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the adult brain, components of the retinoid metabolic pathways have been thoroughly&#xD;
      characterized(81). In some parts of the brain, all-trans-retinoic acid is synthesized..&#xD;
      Certain neuronal-specific genes contain recognition sequences for retinoid receptors and can&#xD;
      be arranged directly by retinoids. receptors of retinoid have a widespread distribution in&#xD;
      the human nervous system. This distribution differs significantly from that seen during&#xD;
      embryonic development, implying that retinoid signalling may have a physiological role in the&#xD;
      adult hypothalamus , cortex, striatum , amygdala, hippocampus, and other brain regions&#xD;
      (81,82).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinoid signal pathways disruption in models of rodent caused in disturbance in synaptic&#xD;
      plasticity, memory behaviors and learning . Signal pathways of retinoid also play a critical&#xD;
      role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia , Alzheimer's disease, and depression(81).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinoic acid regulates gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and its receptor G-protein&#xD;
      coupled receptor (GnRH) an important action in smelling process .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The olfactory bulb (OB) is a conserved region found in brain that its main function is&#xD;
      receiving sensory neurons direct synaptic input in the nasal epithelium part and conveys that&#xD;
      instructions to the rest of the brain. (81). It gets instructions from the brain regarding&#xD;
      odours recognized by cells in the nasal cavity. Axons of the olfactory sensory neurons&#xD;
      extends to the region of the olfactory bulb, which is dedicated to process odour-related&#xD;
      instructions (82).The nervusterminalis, or zeroeth cranial nerve, contains specific neurons&#xD;
      that produce gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). All vertebrate animals without sharks&#xD;
      have a nervusterminalis, a chain of neurons implanted within vomeronasal or olfactory nerves&#xD;
      in the region of the nasal canal, where it is considered a distinct nerve. The main role of&#xD;
      the gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH) constituent of the nervusterminalis is supposed to&#xD;
      have neuromodulatory properties . (83). Numerous studies suggested that the role of the&#xD;
      intranasal gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH) system is to adapt and modify olfactory&#xD;
      information, maybe at opportune times for reproduction(83). Gonadotropin-releasing hormone&#xD;
      (GnRH), was showed to be expressed on 30 to 40 percent of neurons located in the region of&#xD;
      the nervusterminalis and also, a small dozen of these neurons may produce&#xD;
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) directly into blood veins underlying the olfactory&#xD;
      epithelium (OE). (84). During prenatal GnRH neurons emerge from the nasal placode until reach&#xD;
      the brain(1). These neurons become critical ingredients of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal&#xD;
      axis, which is required for activity of reproduction, after they enter the brain.&#xD;
      Hypogonadotropichypogonadism (HH) is caused when this mechanism is disrupted (HH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      .The primary modulator of mammalian function of reproduction in both men and women is&#xD;
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). It acts via distinct receptors, G-protein coupled&#xD;
      receptor (GnRH) found in gonadotropes to induce production of the gonadotropin hormones,&#xD;
      follicle and luteinizing -stimulating hormones (FSH), (LH)(85). a study found that congenital&#xD;
      anosmia (loss of smell) is frequently linked with GnRH deficiency in human patients, leading&#xD;
      to the widely held belief that GnRH neurons rely on olfactory structures to reach the brain,&#xD;
      but this suggestion has yet to be proven(86).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinoic acid regulates both GnRH neurons and G-protein coupled receptor (GnRH-R).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, retinoic acid plays critical physiological roles in synaptic plasticity,&#xD;
      learning and memory(27), hormone production(27,28) and adult neurogenesis(27) (15).They also&#xD;
      control a variety of processes in adults, including vision, cellular differentiation,&#xD;
      fertilization, and tissue homeostasis(87). Retinoids are therefore essential for optimal&#xD;
      physiology during both the early stages of development and throughout maturity(87). The&#xD;
      mammalian type I gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor (GnRH-R) is a structurally unique G&#xD;
      protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)(88). The majority of hormones stimulates and mediates their&#xD;
      signal transduction via G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).(90) Retinoic acid induce&#xD;
      expression of G protein-coupled receptor called Retinoic Acid - Inducible G Protein-Coupled&#xD;
      Receptors(89) . Studies show general agreement that all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) has been&#xD;
      linked to the regulation of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCRs) signaling,(91,92,93). Retinoic&#xD;
      acid induces expression of G protein-coupled receptors that are used by&#xD;
      Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Retinoic acid (RA) appears to be a significant&#xD;
      regulator of GnRH neurons in GT1-1 of rat neuronal cells and hypothalamic fragments in vitro,&#xD;
      according to a study. (93). In this study during a short period (2hours), Retinoic acid&#xD;
      raised gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) production in a dose-dependent manner in&#xD;
      addition, time-course tests revealed that Retinoic acid speedily induced&#xD;
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnR0H release by thirty min in both types of used cells.&#xD;
      Furthermore, significant increase in mRNA levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone by&#xD;
      Retinoic acid was observed within 12hours. (94). In another study showed that that&#xD;
      all-trans-RA controls gene expression and release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in&#xD;
      neuronal cells and hypothalamic fragments of rat. All-trans-RA increased GnRH transcription&#xD;
      by activating functional retinoic acid response elements (RARE) in the promoter's distal&#xD;
      region of GnRH. (95).&#xD;
