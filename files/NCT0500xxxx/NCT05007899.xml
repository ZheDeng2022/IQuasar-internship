  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency anemia affects over half of girls and young women with heavy periods and is&#xD;
      the most common cause of anemia worldwide. Most girls with heavy periods who also have iron&#xD;
      deficiency anemia are prescribed iron to take by mouth every day by their doctor. There are&#xD;
      some studies showing that taking iron every other day may actually help the iron be absorbed&#xD;
      into the bloodstream better. This study is trying to compare how taking iron every other day&#xD;
      compares to taking iron daily for treatment of anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn which of the two methods of care will be&#xD;
      the best way for girls and young women with iron deficiency anemia to take iron&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;

      The research will be conducted at the following location(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baylor College of Medicine, TCH: Texas Children's Hospital, and TCH: Texas Children's&#xD;
      Hospital Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patient appears to qualify for the study they will sign and date this consent form, and&#xD;
      the doctor will confirm that they are eligible for the study. The patient will complete the&#xD;
      following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history including prior hospitalizations, lab results, medications, diet, social&#xD;
           and family history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical Examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples: The patient will not have any extra blood draws (pokes) for this study.&#xD;
           However, we will ask to take about 1/2 (0.5) teaspoons (3 mL) of extra blood for an&#xD;
           extra research test when you have follow up blood test(s) in one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be on the study for 24 weeks (6 months),and will receive an information sheet&#xD;
      about how to take iron to help it absorb in the stomach and on iron-rich foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 2 different treatments in this study. If a patient enrolls, they cannot choose&#xD;
      which treatment to receive. Instead, they will be randomly assigned to one of the two&#xD;
      treatments. That means there is a fifty percent chance they will receive iron medicine to&#xD;
      take every day and a fifty percent chance they will receive iron medicine to take every other&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
