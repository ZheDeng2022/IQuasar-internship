  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure (BP) is the major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases&#xD;
      (CVD) and related health conditions, particularly among postmenopausal (PM) women. In adults&#xD;
      age ≥50 years this risk is primarily driven by above-normal systolic BP (SBP ≥120 mmHg), as&#xD;
      diastolic BP plateaus, then decreases in older adulthood. Although SBP is lower in&#xD;
      premenopausal women vs. age-matched men, SBP reaches, then surpasses men after age 60. As&#xD;
      such, &gt;75% of PM women in the U.S. have above-normal SBP, which, in turn, is responsible for&#xD;
      a 2-fold increase in risk of hypertension and corresponding increases in risk of CVD, chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease and many other disorders. A key process linking high SBP to CVD and related&#xD;
      conditions is vascular endothelial dysfunction, mediated by excessive reactive oxygen species&#xD;
      (ROS)-induced oxidative stress and reductions in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. As the&#xD;
      number of PM women is rapidly growing, further increases in SBP-related CV disorders are&#xD;
      projected without effective intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aerobic exercise (AE) is a first-line, standard-of-care therapy for lowering BP. In PM&#xD;
           women with baseline SBP ≥120 mmHg, AE reduces casual (resting) SBP by ~3 mmHg (back to&#xD;
           baseline ≤4 weeks post-training), whereas 24-hour SBP is typically unchanged. However,&#xD;
           only 25-30% of PM women meet guidelines for 150 min/week of moderate-intensity AE,&#xD;
           citing the extensive time requirement, facility access and travel disruptions as major&#xD;
           barriers. Another, far less recognized, limitation is that AE training consistently&#xD;
           improves endothelial function in midlife/older men, but not in estrogen-deficient PM&#xD;
           (PMe-) women, i.e., in &gt;95% of the 60+million PM women in the U.S. Thus, establishing&#xD;
           new lifestyle therapies that induce and sustain reductions in SBP and increases in&#xD;
           endothelial function in PMe- women with above-normal SBP is an important public health&#xD;
           goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High-resistance inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST) is a time-efficient (5&#xD;
           minutes per session) lifestyle intervention consisting of 30 inspiratory maneuvers&#xD;
           performed against a high resistance. Preliminary data suggest 6-weeks of IMST performed&#xD;
           6 days/week reduces SBP by 9 mmHg in adults with above-normal SBP (i.e., greater than&#xD;
           120 mmHg) at baseline. Importantly, this reduction in SBP is equal to or greater than&#xD;
           the reduction in blood pressure typically achieved with time- and effort-intensive&#xD;
           healthy lifestyle strategies like conventional aerobic exercise. In addition, IMST&#xD;
           improved endothelial function in the PMe- women in a small pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To translate these promising preliminary results towards clinical practice, this&#xD;
           randomized clinical trial is being conducted to directly compare the efficacy of a&#xD;
           longer, clinically relevant treatment duration of IMST (3 months) against home-based,&#xD;
           moderate-intensity (standard-of-care) AE in PMe-women. The primary outcome will be the&#xD;
           change in casual SBP (IMST vs. AE). Changes in 24-hour SBP and endothelial function will&#xD;
           serve as secondary outcomes. Effects on NO bioavailability, ROS/oxidative stress, and&#xD;
           the role of &quot;circulating factors&quot; will provide insight into mechanisms of action. The&#xD;
           sustained effects on SBP and endothelial function also will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accordingly, a randomized, blinded, sham-controlled, parallel group design clinical&#xD;
           trial will be conducted to assess the efficacy of 3-months of IMST (75 percent maximal&#xD;
           inspiratory pressure) vs. brisk walking (40-60% heart rate reserve; an established&#xD;
           healthy lifestyle strategy) for lowering SBP and improving endothelial function in PMe-&#xD;
           women age 50 years and older with above-normal SBP. It is hypothesized that IMST will&#xD;
           lower SBP and improve endothelial function by decreasing oxidative stress and increasing&#xD;
           nitric oxide bioavailability. It is also expect that adherence to the intervention will&#xD;
           be excellent (over 80 percent of all training sessions completed at the appropriate&#xD;
           intensity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test this hypothesis, 90 PMe- women age 50 years and older who have SBP &gt;/= 120 mmHg&#xD;
           will be recruited. Participants will undergo baseline testing for casual (resting) SBP,&#xD;
           24-hour ambulatory SBP and endothelial function. Innovative mechanistic probes including&#xD;
           pharmaco-dissection with vitamin C, analysis of biopsied endothelial cells, and&#xD;
           high-throughput metabolomics, will be performed to assess oxidative stress and nitric&#xD;
           oxide bioavailability at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After baseline testing, subjects will be randomized to perform either 3-months of&#xD;
           high-resistance IMST or brisk walking. Subjects will train 6 days/week. Following 3&#xD;
           months of training, subjects will redo all the tests that were done during baseline&#xD;
           testing to assess training-induced changes in SBP, physiological functions, and&#xD;
           underlying mechanisms. Subjects will then cease training for 6 weeks before returning to&#xD;
           the lab for follow-up testing to determine the persistent effects of IMST.&#xD;
