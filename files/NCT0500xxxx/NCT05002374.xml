    <textblock>
      Background Patients with peripheral vestibular dysfunction often complain of dizziness,&#xD;
      blurred vision, imbalance and etc. Vestibular rehabilitation although has been proved to be&#xD;
      an efficient method to improve the symptoms, the optimal treatment type, intensity and&#xD;
      frequency is still unclear. Base on the mechanisms of vestibular rehabilitation, vestibular&#xD;
      adaptation, substitution, and habituation, repeated practice and exposure to symptom-provoked&#xD;
      movement could improve the symptoms. However, the symptom-provoked movement generated by only&#xD;
      head and eye movement might not create sufficient threshold to induce vestibulo-ocular reflex&#xD;
      adaptation. Practicing vestibular exercises in the same environment might be difficult for&#xD;
      the patients to transfer learned ability to the real world environment. Therefore,&#xD;
      optokinetic stimulation could potentially provide stronger visual-vestibular mismatch, and&#xD;
      when combining with a virtual reality system could also simulate real world environment.&#xD;
      Furthermore, an intensive training protocol on a daily basis might possibly promote the&#xD;
      mechanisms of vestibular rehabilitation to enhance recovery from peripheral vestibular&#xD;
      lesions. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of an intense vestibular&#xD;
      rehabilitation programme incorporated with optokinetic stimulation in virtual reality&#xD;
      environment on both subjective and objective symptoms in patients with peripheral vestibular&#xD;
      dysfunction in the short and long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This study will be an assessor-blind randomised controlled trial. Patients diagnosed&#xD;
      as peripheral vestibular dysfunction aged between 20-80 years will be recruited and randomly&#xD;
      allocated into two groups: vestibular rehabilitation incorporated with optokinetic&#xD;
      stimulation in virtual reality (Group OKN) and vestibular rehabilitation only (Group C).&#xD;
      Group C will receive customised vestibular rehabilitation, while Group OKN will receive the&#xD;
      same exercise programme as Group C plus optokinetic stimulation provided in virtual&#xD;
      environment. Both groups will receive vestibular rehabilitation intensively for five&#xD;
      consecutive days with a trained physiotherapist, following with daily home exercise for two&#xD;
      months. Self-perceived symptoms, spatial orientation, postural control and gait performance&#xD;
      will be assessed prior to treatment (baseline), at the end of the five-day treatment, at four&#xD;
      and eight weeks following the five-day training.&#xD;

    <description>This test is to assess a person's perception of verticality. In this test, the subject is instructed to align a tilted illuminated line to self-perceived verticality in a completely darkened room. Differences between the subject's adjusted orientation and true spatial vertical are calculated as the subjective visual vertical.</description>

    <description>A 25-item self-report questionnaire assesses the impact of dizziness on daily life by measuring self-perceived handicap. The maximum score is 100. The higher the score, the more the perceived handicap due to dizziness.</description>

    <time_frame>Prior and after the 5-day treatment, and follow up at four and eight weeks after the treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is used to assess the effects of vertigo and balance disorders on independence in everyday activities of daily living. This scale contains 28 items of self reporting questionnaire. It is divided into 3 subscales, which are functional, ambulation, and instrumental. The higher the score indicates higher dependence on the activities of daily living.</description>
