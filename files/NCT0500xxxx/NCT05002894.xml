      strength, flexibility, and enhance mental awareness. Regular exercise of post-menopausal&#xD;
      women has benefits of increased cardio-respiratory fitness, increased muscle strength and&#xD;
      endurance, reduced body fatigue, improved morale, and increased ability to perform daily&#xD;
      tasks with greater force.Thus the main objective of regular exercise is prevention of&#xD;
      physical deterioration and optimizing functional capacity to improve overall postmenopausal&#xD;
      women's quality of life.&#xD;
