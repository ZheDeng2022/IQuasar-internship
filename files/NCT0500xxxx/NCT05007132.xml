&#xD;
         10. Patients without anticoagulation need to present with an INR &lt;1.5 x ULN and partial&#xD;
             thromboplastin time (PTT) &lt;1.5 x ULN. Patients with anticoagulation may be enrolled if&#xD;
             the patient receives the medication at a stable dose for at least 2 weeks before&#xD;
             randomisation and provided that international normalized ratio (INR) and PTT are &lt;1.5&#xD;
             x ULN..&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. For females of childbearing potential (FCBP): negative pregnancy test within 14 days&#xD;
             before randomisation and agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual&#xD;
             intercourse) or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year during&#xD;
             the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has&#xD;
             not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no&#xD;
             identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization&#xD;
             (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure&#xD;
             rate of &lt; 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male partner's sterilization,&#xD;
             hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation supplemented with a barrier method,&#xD;
             hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices. The&#xD;
             reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of&#xD;
             the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic&#xD;
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and&#xD;
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use&#xD;
             contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined&#xD;
             below: With female partners of childbearing potential, men must remain abstinent or&#xD;
             use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure&#xD;
             rate of &lt;1% per year during the treatment period and for 6 months after the last dose&#xD;
             of study treatment. In this regard, double barrier methods are not considered to have&#xD;
             a failure rate of &lt; 1%. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.&#xD;
             With pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the&#xD;
             treatment period and for 6 months after the last dose of study medication to avoid&#xD;
             exposing the embryo. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in&#xD;
             relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
             of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
             postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior systemic therapy of metastatic disease. Note: Prior adjuvant chemotherapy is&#xD;
             permitted, if completed &gt; 3 months prior to randomisation. Multimodal treatment of&#xD;

             participation&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         18. Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical&#xD;
             laboratory finding that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, may affect&#xD;
             the interpretation of the results, or may render the patient at high risk from&#xD;
             treatment complications.&#xD;
