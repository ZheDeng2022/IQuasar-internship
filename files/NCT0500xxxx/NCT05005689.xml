  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this 2-armed, parallel, randomised, controlled trial is to assess the effect of&#xD;
      different ways of applying fluoride to teeth on the formation of white spots (enamel&#xD;
      demineralisation), during orthodontic treatment with fixed metal braces, in children and&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the most common side-effects and risks of orthodontic treatment with fixed (metal)&#xD;
      braces is damage to the outer surface (enamel) of the teeth. This damage can take the form of&#xD;
      white or brown spots on the teeth (white spot lesions; WSLs) or if severe, holes in the teeth&#xD;
      that need a filling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to find out the best way of preventing damage to the teeth of&#xD;
      children and adolescents who are under going orthodontic treatment with fixed (metal) braces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be 130 children, aged 11-16 years old, inclusive. The participants will&#xD;
      be split into two groups using a process called randomisation. The treatments will be&#xD;
      standard fluoride toothpaste (Colgate) and either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fluoride mouth wash (Fluorigard) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tooth Mousse Plus&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants' teeth will be checked at every visit and the brace adjusted. Photographs of&#xD;
      the participants' teeth will be taken very 3 months to see if any of the teeth have been&#xD;
      damaged. The participants will be asked about the impact of their teeth on their life.&#xD;
      Participants and parents will be asked about the impact of any white spots that form on the&#xD;
      participants' teeth during the treatment with fixed (metal) braces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow the participants through the whole length of treatment which will take&#xD;
      about 2 years.&#xD;
