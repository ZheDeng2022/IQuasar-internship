  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The global COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented strain on health care services around&#xD;
      the world.The absence of specific anti-viral medications to treat the underlying infection&#xD;
      led to a proliferation of clinical studies and trials aimed at re-purposing existing&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is vital enzyme utilised by viruses to replicate&#xD;
      in the host cell. Leflunomide, a drug that is already licenced to treat rheumatoid arthritis,&#xD;
      is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme DHODH. Importantly, this drug has dual anti-viral and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties so it targets viral replication and suppresses host inflammatory&#xD;
      response which plays a role at more progressive stages of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEFEAT-COVID is a multi-site, international, interventional, pragmatic, parallel group&#xD;
      design, open label, randomised CTIMP with a pilot phase that will allow to adapt procedures&#xD;
      and assessments if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase III clinical trial of leflunomide for treating COVID-19 has been registered in China,&#xD;
      Registration number: ChiCTR2000030058). The current proposal extends the original clinical&#xD;
      study of leflunomide in China (People's Hospital of Wuhan University) to the UK through a&#xD;
      structured collaboration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leflunomide is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme DHODH and is already licenced to treat&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis. Importantly, this drug has dual anti-viral and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties which is advantageous in COVID-19 infected patients, as more progressive stages of&#xD;
      the disease involve augmented responses from the host inflammatory mechanisms leading to&#xD;
      serious complications and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the current understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection and its spectrum&#xD;
      of clinical manifestation it is evident that a significant proportion of those infected&#xD;
      develop pneumonia, systemic inflammatory response and cardiovascular complications with high&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. The progression from initial mild symptoms (usually fever, fatigue&#xD;
      and cough) to severe pneumonia requiring oxygen support or mechanical ventilation often takes&#xD;
      one to two weeks after the onset of symptoms. The progression leading to a such deterioration&#xD;
      is thought to be related to the kinetics of viral replication culminating in an exaggerated&#xD;
      surge in inflammatory mediator release, called &quot;cytokine storm&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Host-targeting antiviral (HTA) strategies have many advantages to fight against a broad&#xD;
      spectrum of viruses compared to direct-acting antiviral drugs. These include blocking the&#xD;
      viral replication and overcoming the potential of viral mutagenesis simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concept The quest for optimal HTA strategies enabled the investigators to identify a crucial&#xD;
      enzyme called human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) that limits pyrimidine synthesis.&#xD;
      This is a vital metabolic process utilised by viruses for replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preclinical models of cell and animal infection by SARS-CoV-2 the DHODH inhibitors&#xD;
      exhibited multiple actions including attenuation of viral genome replication, suppression of&#xD;
      the inflammatory reaction and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine. These&#xD;
      drugs also offered protection against mortality in mice when administered at later stages of&#xD;
      infection when direct acting antivirals offered no survival benefit. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      DHODH inhibitors may have the advantage in treatment of COVID-19 disease even at its advanced&#xD;
      stage compared to the drugs with either standalone anti-viral or anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, collaborators in China have conducted a pilot study in COVID-19 patients in&#xD;
      Wuhan, the epicentre of China COVID-19 outbreak, with moderate clinical symptoms. This study&#xD;
      has demonstrated feasibility with a favourable clinical outcome and good safety profile&#xD;
      within the leflunomide treatment arm. Patients receiving leflunomide had a shorter clinical&#xD;
      recovery time and a reduction in clinical inflammatory biomarkers with no side effects&#xD;
      observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leflunomide This is an immunosuppressive agent whose efficacy and safety profiles are well&#xD;
      established in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In 76 000 patients treated with leflunomide&#xD;
      there were 16 potential cases of pancytopenia and 9 cases of serious skin reactions. It has&#xD;
      few GI side effects including derangement in liver function, associated with long-term use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommended dosage of leflunomide in COVID-19 is a loading dose of 100 mg/day for 3 days,&#xD;
      followed by 10-20 mg once daily depending on liver functions (patients with ALT/AST levels&#xD;
      above upper limits of normal (ULN) reference range will have 10mg instead of 20mg). This&#xD;
      regimen is routinely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis providing effective blood&#xD;
      concentration and few adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leflunomide not only inhibits SARS-CoV-2 viral genome replication but also suppresses the&#xD;
      release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, suggesting its potential advantage in&#xD;
      treating the SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19 disease compared to the drugs with standalone&#xD;
      anti-viral or anti-inflammatory properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapidly replicating viruses rely on the de novo pyrimidines biosynthesis to acquire&#xD;
      sufficient pyrimidines for genome replication. By inhibiting the host target DHODH,&#xD;
      leflunomide can block the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis by inhibiting the rate limiting&#xD;
      step for the viral nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) replication process. The in-vitro data have&#xD;
      shown it to be effective against a broad-spectrum of viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and Outcome Measures/ Endpoints The main trial objective is to evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy and safety of 10 days oral leflunomide treatment starting within 2 weeks of&#xD;
      moderate to critical illness symptoms' onset in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the study will evaluate the impact of leflunomide on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the rate of viral clearance&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the extent of lung injury, based on CT imaging and on the need of invasive/non-invasive&#xD;
           ventilation and respiratory support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. myocardial, kidney, and liver function based on the need for inotropic/vasoactive and&#xD;
           mechanical support and renal replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. assessment of respiratory, myocardial and kidney injury assessed by standardised&#xD;
           physiological and biomarker criteria including emerging molecular and inflammatory&#xD;
           footprints of COVID-19 disease Based on the measured variables models to predict the&#xD;
           severity of the disease as well as clinical outcomes will be built.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design The World Health Organisation (WHO) &quot;master protocol&quot; i.e. the R&amp;D blueprint&#xD;
      Therapeutic Trial Synopsis for COVID-19 was taken into account when designing the trial. This&#xD;
      is illustrated in how the trial is conducted i.e. i) using a 2 stage approach of including a&#xD;
      pilot phase before a main trial, ii) target population, ii) participant eligibility, iv)&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcomes / endpoints, and v) the trial assessments needed to meet the&#xD;
      objectives of ensuring clinical benefit and patient safety of the new therapy being&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patient visits and assessments conducted are kept to a minimum but sufficient&#xD;
      to address both the immediate and long term risk to public health. This takes into account&#xD;
      conventional standard operating procedures, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), national and&#xD;
      international clinical trial regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEFEAT-COVID is a multi-site, international, interventional, pragmatic, parallel group&#xD;
      design, open label, randomised CTIMP with a pilot phase that will allow us to adapt&#xD;
      procedures and assessments if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Setting The study is primarily conducted at secondary and tertiary healthcare settings&#xD;
      in England and India. At each local clinical centre (LCC), the principal investigator (P)I&#xD;
      will be responsible for trial activities but much of the work will be carried out by medical&#xD;
      staff providing care to patients with COVID-19 within the hospital and by hospital research&#xD;
      nurses, medical students and other staff when delegated and with appropriate education,&#xD;
      training, and experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The landscape of the COVID infection in London and other regions in the UK is being&#xD;
      monitored. Additional sites will be invited to contribute to the trial upon recommendation by&#xD;
      the Steering and Trial Management Committees taking into consideration of developing national&#xD;
      hotspots, second wave of the pandemic etc.&#xD;
