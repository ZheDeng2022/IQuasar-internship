    <textblock>
      The primary study objectives are to test whether among a sample of healthy adults consuming:&#xD;
      (1) a single capsule containing 250 mg citicoline has an effect on attentional performance 1,&#xD;
      2 and 3 h post-dose compared to placebo (acute effect), and (2) capsule containing 250 mg&#xD;
      citicoline per day for 28 consecutive days has an effect on attentional performance compared&#xD;
      to placebo (chronic effect).&#xD;
