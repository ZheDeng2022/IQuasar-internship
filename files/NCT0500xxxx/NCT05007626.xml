  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to assess the association of refraction and axial length with&#xD;
      near-horizontal heterophoria in a large population-based study of school-aged Chinese&#xD;
      children. The study makes a significant contribution to better know the etiology of myopia&#xD;
      progression and ocular axial length development. Further, this study will be of interest to&#xD;
      the readership of your journal because its noteworthy finding and which could contribute to&#xD;
      guide recommendations for targeted interventions to slow myopia progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myopia is becoming a global public health burden which is believed to have a multifactorial&#xD;
      etiology. The relationship between heterophoria and refraction remains controversial. We&#xD;
      describe the association of refraction and axial length (AL) with heterophoria in a large&#xD;
      population-based study of school-aged Chinese children. Eleven thousand thirteen elementary&#xD;
      school children grades 1-6, were included in this school-based, cross-sectional study. Near&#xD;
      phoria data was quantified by using Maddox rod test and prism at 33 cm. Children in each&#xD;
      grade level were sorted into three groups based upon phoria: 1) those with more than six&#xD;
      prism diopters (PD) exophoria, 2) those with zero to six PD exophoria, and 3) those with any&#xD;
      amount of esophoria. Autorefraction was measured by autorefractor (Topcon KR8900, Japan) and&#xD;
      AL was measured by Optical Biometer AL-Scan (Nidek AL-Scan, Japan). A generalized additive&#xD;
      model (GAM) was applied with a Gaussian link to explore the association between the&#xD;
      refractive error or axial length and heterophoria. An additional age-adjusted model was also&#xD;
      employed for analysis.&#xD;

        A total of 15,081 Chinese children between the ages of 6 and 13 years were enrolled in this&#xD;
