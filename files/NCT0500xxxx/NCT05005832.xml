  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the health habits and changes in body composition and&#xD;
      exercise capacity as well as blood biochemical parameters of people participating in&#xD;
      14-21-day walking pilgrimages. This type of physical activity can be classified as long-term&#xD;
      and multi-stage hiking tours. Among the people participating in the pilgrimage, a significant&#xD;
      part of the population are people aged&gt; 50 years. Moderate physical activity is an important&#xD;
      pro-health element, however, it has not been determined yet how long and accumulated activity&#xD;
      may affect the health of pilgrims. Suddenly taking up activity and the challenge of walking&#xD;
      several hundred kilometres may be a heavy burden for the body, and its effects may have a&#xD;
      negative impact on the body. The evaluation of the processes taking place in the body under&#xD;
      the influence of this type of physical activity, motivated by religious goals, will expand&#xD;
      the scope of knowledge about safety as well as health indications and contraindications for&#xD;
      this type of activity. It will also allow identifying adaptive changes and their effects&#xD;

    <measure>Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>14-21 days</time_frame>
    <description>Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation scales (SCORE) are high and low cardiovascular risk charts based on gender, age, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and smoking status, with relative risk chart, qualifiers and instructions.&#xD;
SCORE calculate 10-year risk of fatal cardiovascular disease (%),&#xD;
Low- to moderate-risk persons (calculated SCORE &lt;5%)&#xD;
High-risk persons (calculated SCORE &gt;5% and &lt;10%):&#xD;
Very-high-risk persons (calculated SCORE &gt;10%):&#xD;
Charts are available free at https://www.escardio.org/Education/Practice-Tools/CVD-prevention-toolbox/SCORE-Risk-Charts&#xD;

    <measure>Tiffeneau-Pinelli index</measure>
    <time_frame>14-21 days</time_frame>
    <description>Tiffeneau-Pinelli index FEV1/FVC% The FEV1/FVC ratio, also called Tiffeneau-Pinelli index, is a calculated ratio represents the proportion of a person's vital capacity that they are able to expire in the first second of forced expiration (FEV1) to the full, forced vital capacity (FVC).The result of this ratio is expressed as FEV1%.&#xD;
Normal FEV1% values are approximately 70-80%</description>

    <measure>Clarke angle</measure>
    <time_frame>14-21 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Clarke angle (CL)enables the assessment of the longitudinal arch of the foot. Feet having a CL angle value of less than 42° are classified as the feet with the fallen arch, i.e., the flatfoot (pes planus), feet classified as having a proper (normal) arch are characterised by the CL restricted within the range of 42-54° (pes rectus), whereas feet having CL ≥ 55° are classified as feet with a high arch (pes cavus)</description>

    <measure>Transepidermal water loss</measure>
    <time_frame>14-21 days</time_frame>
    <description>Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) is the most widely used objective measurement for assessing the barrier function of skin in healthy individuals. TEWL is the quantity of condensed water that diffuses across a fixed area of stratum corneum to the skin surface per unit time.&#xD;
TEWL are stated as grams of water per square meter per hour (g/m2/h). Measured at forehead and right cheek.&#xD;
TEWL normal values (mean,95% CI) for forehead 12.8 (11.7-14.0) and cheek 13.9 (12.9-14.9).</description>
