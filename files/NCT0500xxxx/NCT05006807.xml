  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this research is to evaluate different laboratory-built and&#xD;
      commercially available sensors used to measure the effects of neuromuscular blocking drugs on&#xD;
      neuromuscular function during surgery, by measuring evoked thumb twitch response to ulnar&#xD;
      nerve stimulation (also known as &quot;twitch monitoring&quot;). The specific aim is to compare&#xD;
      mechanomyography, which is the &quot;gold standard&quot; laboratory measurement to assess neuromuscular&#xD;
      blockade, to the sensors used in commercially available neuromuscular blockade monitors, such&#xD;
      as acceleromyography and electromyography. The study endpoints are the train-of-four count&#xD;
      (TOFC), the ratio of the height of the 4th twitch to the height of the 1st twitch&#xD;
      (train-of-four ratio, TOFR), and the post tetanic count (PTC). The mechanomyography devices&#xD;
      have been constructed in our laboratory and are not commercially available.&#xD;

      Twitch monitoring will be performed as described below for each device:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimpod NMS 450 or other related Stimpod device (Xavant Technology, Pretoria, South&#xD;
      Africa)--acceleromyography and/or electromyography. Movement of the thumb and hand will not&#xD;
      be restricted and no artificial preload will be used. Electrodes (3M Red Dot, 3M Healthcare,&#xD;
      St. Paul, MN, USA) will be applied over the ulnar nerve at the wrist for acceleromyography.&#xD;
      The Stimpod acceleromyography sensor will be attached to the distal phalanx of the thumb&#xD;
      using the supplied plastic circumferential band, reinforced with tape if necessary. The&#xD;
      Stimpod electromyography printed electrode array will be applied as described in the&#xD;
      manufacturer's instructions for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TwitchView Monitor (Blink Device Company, Seattle, WA, USA)--electromyography. The TwitchView&#xD;
      electromyography printed electrode array will be applied as described in the manufacturer's&#xD;
      instructions for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TetraGraph (Senzime, Sweden)--electromyography. The TetraGraph electromyography printed&#xD;
      electrode array will be applied as described in the manufacturer's instructions for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nihon Kohden (Japan)--electromyography. The Nihon Kohden printed electromyography electrode&#xD;
      array will be applied as described in the manufacturer's instructions for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanomyography. The mechanomyography monitors were built in our laboratory and consists of&#xD;
      a force transducer, signal amplifier and analogue to digital converter held in a 3D printed&#xD;
      wrist and hand immobilizer, or other hand immobilizer rig. The mechanomyography force&#xD;
      transducer response is linear with precision to 5g and accuracy to 25g for measurements&#xD;
      examined from 0 to 5kg with sensitivity to 10g within that range. A preload of 200-300g will&#xD;
      applied to the thumb prior to data collection. Custom software using the LabVIEW package&#xD;
      (National Instruments, Austin, Texas) was developed for data acquisition, analysis of the&#xD;
      voltage response after the train-of-four stimulus and for counting the twitches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General experimental conditions. The amplitude of the train of four stimulus will be set at&#xD;
      60 mA in all cases. Skin prep with alcohol wipes will be performed prior to attaching any&#xD;
      electrodes. Temperature homeostasis will be maintained in all patients through the use of&#xD;
      active warming. Normocarbia will be maintained as defined by end tidal CO2 between&#xD;
      approximately 32 and 40 mmHg. The anesthesia technique including the choice of anesthetic and&#xD;
      neuromuscular blocking agents will be at the discretion of the anesthesia care team and may&#xD;
      include propofol, opioids (mainly fentanyl and hydromorphone), sevoflurane, isoflurane,&#xD;
      rocuronium and vecuronium. Data collection will be customized in each patient depending upon&#xD;
      the availability of upper limbs for monitoring. Acceleromyography and mechanomyography cannot&#xD;
      be tested on the same arm simultaneously because the mechanomyography restricts movement of&#xD;
      the thumb. The electromyography electrode array does not interfere with simultaneously&#xD;
      measuring either acceleromyography or mechanomyography. Subjective twitch count can be made&#xD;
      on the same hand as the acceleromyography or electromyography measurement, but not on the&#xD;
      same hand as mechanomyography since the plastic frame or other rig of the mechanomyography&#xD;
      precludes manual palpation of thumb movement. Train-of- four count will be measured by&#xD;
      palpation (when possible) and then by one or more of the twitch monitors (i.e. two&#xD;
      measurements were taken within the span of about 2 minutes) approximately every 5 minutes&#xD;
      from induction of anesthesia until just before emergence from anesthesia. Measurements will&#xD;
      not be made for 10 minutes following administration of neuromuscular blocking drugs or&#xD;
      reversal agents in order to avoid periods when the extent of neuromuscular blockade was&#xD;
      changing very rapidly. When measurements were made on both arms, the train of four twitch&#xD;
      stimulus will be administered in each arm within about 2 minutes. Not all twitch monitoring&#xD;
      devices we be evaluated in each patient. The choice of devices to be evaluated in each&#xD;
      patient will be made primarily on the basis of the availability of arms for monitoring and&#xD;
      the availability of monitoring devices.&#xD;
