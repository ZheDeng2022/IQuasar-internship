  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PRAAN is a post-market registry designed to collect real-world data associated with the use&#xD;
      of Medtronic market release neurothrombectomy devices in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients&#xD;
      from India.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this registry is to access clinical outcomes associated with the use of&#xD;
      these device in patients experiencing the AIS due to large intracranial vessel occlusion&#xD;
      within 8 hours of last known well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real-world evidence per Standard-of-care (SOC) will be generated using Medtronic&#xD;
      neurothrombectomy devices approved in India, using on-label indications for use in this&#xD;
      post-market clinical follow-up registry.&#xD;

Cost effectiveness: Evaluation of cost effectiveness of Solitaire and/or React Aspiration catheters family of devices will be performed without a statistical test. Therefore, there is no hypothesis test for this ancillary objective. Cost effectiveness will be calculated using a credible model with inputs from the PRAAN study wherever possible (e.g., age, mortality, quality of life). When direct input from the study is not possible, inputs will be derived from prior clinical evidence, from localized outcomes research (within region of from comparable region), or from expert advisory board input. A separate document will outline the plan for evaluating the cost-effectiveness component. Cost effectiveness will be expressed as incremental cost in local currency per quality adjusted life year gained (QALY).</description>
