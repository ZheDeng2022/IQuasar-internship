      This study aims to evaluate the impact of Transanal irrigation (TAI) on the quality of life&#xD;
      and low anterior resection symptoms (LARS) in Canadian rectal cancer survivors living with&#xD;
      minor to major LARS. We propose to teach TAI through a novel online platform and to provide&#xD;
      virtual nursing support for the participants. To our knowledge, this is the first North&#xD;
      American based and largest randomized control trial on the use of TAI for patients with LARS.&#xD;
      This will also be the first study to teach and support patients through the TAI process using&#xD;
      a virtual platform. While TAI has been demonstrated to reduce LARS scores and increased QoL&#xD;
      in patients with significant LARS, its feasibility and acceptance for Canadian patients&#xD;
      remains uncertain. Furthermore despite the existing studies, the rate of TAI seems to be low&#xD;
      in North America. We hypothesize that TAI, taught and supported through an online portal&#xD;
      dedicated to LARS patients, will positively impact QoL and improve LARS symptoms. We hope&#xD;
      that the results of this trial will allow TAI to become part of the standard armamentarium&#xD;
      that clinicians offer patients for LARS management, with the presence of online nursing&#xD;
      support and guidance to facilitate this practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) is a constellation of bowel symptoms which occur&#xD;
      following rectal cancer treatment. These symptoms have a well characterized negative impact&#xD;
      on a patient's quality of life (QoL) following sphincter sparing surgery. The treatment of&#xD;
      LARS is primarily based on the management of symptoms with conservative measures such as&#xD;
      dietary changes and fiber supplements, anti-diarrheal medications and pelvic floor&#xD;
      physiotherapy. Despite these measures, patients often still experience uncontrolled&#xD;
      debilitating symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transanal irrigation (TAI) has been described for the management of LARS symptoms that&#xD;
      persist after conservative measures have been insufficient. The positive impact of this&#xD;
      treatment on LARS and the number of bowel movements experienced by patients has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in several, primarily European small studies. We purpose conducting a&#xD;
      multi-center, assessor-blinded, parallel-group randomized control trial (RCT) to assess the&#xD;
      outcomes of an online, nurse-led, North American TAI program for the management of LARS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This RCT will recruit patients who have undergone a low anterior resection (LAR) with closure&#xD;
      of any diverting stoma at least 6 months prior to entry into the trial with a LARS score of&#xD;
      &gt;20 at recruitment. Participants will be recruited from five academic hospitals with high&#xD;
      volumes of rectal cancer care in Ontario and Quebec, and will be randomized using a&#xD;
      computer-generated sequence in balanced blocks, stratified by hospital, to the intervention&#xD;
      (TAI) or control (traditional care) arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention arm will be asked to perform TAI every 1-2 days for a&#xD;
      six-month period. Teaching on the use of TAI will be given through virtual sessions with an&#xD;
      experienced research nurse and supportive material (video and animated text) on a web-based&#xD;
      application, eLARS. This is an established online application designed to provide quality&#xD;
      health information for patients living with LARS created by our research group. Participants&#xD;
      in the intervention arm of this study will be given access to a restricted transanal&#xD;
      irrigation section on this application dedicated to this RCT with detailed written&#xD;
      instructions and educational videos on the use of TAI. Participants in the control arm of the&#xD;
      study will have access to the general eLARS application without the section on the transanal&#xD;
      irrigation, and no specific change in their current management routine will be required. The&#xD;
      required sample size for this RCT, accounting for attrition, is 99 patients. We anticipate&#xD;
      that we can accrue this patient sample from the five interested sites within a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study will be health-related quality of life (QoL) as measured by&#xD;
      the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core Quality of Life&#xD;
      questionnaire (EORTIC-QLQ-C30), with secondary outcomes including evaluation of bowel&#xD;
      function by the LARS score, Wexner/Cleveland Clinic Fecal Incontinence Score, and bowel diary&#xD;
      and satisfaction with TAI. Participant demographics, disease and treatment characteristics&#xD;
      will be obtained via hospital chart review as time of recruitment. The TAI treatment effect&#xD;
      on global QoL will be modeled using generalized estimating equations (GEE), accounting for&#xD;
      within-subject correlations between responses at different time-points, and possible&#xD;
      clustering of responses among participants from the same hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, this will be the first North American trial to assess TAI acceptance and&#xD;
      impact on quality of life for patients living with LARS. Furthermore, this will be the&#xD;
      largest RCT to date, and the first to use a virtual platform to deliver this service for&#xD;
      rectal cancer survivors. With this study, we aim to provide an additional feasible and&#xD;
      acceptable treatment option for the management of LARS symptoms refractory to our currently&#xD;
      limited treatment options.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Transanal Irrigation</intervention_name>
    <description>Each participant will receive a mailed package of TAI materials, given access to the eLARS app, and have two scheduled virtual visits with a trained research nurse to learn how to use TAI once assigned to the intervention arm. These sessions will include one on one session with the nurse for review of the material, discussion of the device and any questions. TAI involves introducing an applicator into the anus for irrigation. An initial volume of 1000 mL will be suggested but can be increased to 1500mL or reduced to 500 mL as per patient preference and tolerance. Applicators are single-use instruments that can be disposed of into standard waster receptacle after each treatment. The irrigation system is multiple-use and can be used for the duration recommend by the manufacturer manual. Daily irrigation can take anywhere between 20 and 90 minutes depending on individual patient experience.</description>
