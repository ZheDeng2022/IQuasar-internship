  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The unstable condylar position in the glenoid fossa is a critical problem for postsurgical&#xD;
      instability after mandibular advancement with subsequent mandibular relapse. The habitual&#xD;
      forward occlusion in class II patients creates unstable condyle to glenoid fossa relationship&#xD;
      making it hard for clinicians to determine the amount of mandibular advancement. Splint&#xD;
      therapy is considered as a preoperative reversible nonsurgical condylar repositioning option&#xD;
      in addition to its adjunctive effect for pain relief in TMJ symptomatic patients. To minimize&#xD;
      this relapse, presurgical functional appliance therapy has been proposed and has shown&#xD;
      promising outcomes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effect of postsurgical versus presurgical computer&#xD;
      guided functional appliance in relapse prevention after mandibular advancement surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Owbgeser incision will be performed to expose the buccal and lingual aspects of the&#xD;
           ramus angle region.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CAD/CAM generated preoperative wafer will be placed on the lower arch dentition, the&#xD;
           guide has an extension to guide medial, vertical, oblique cuts as well as screw holes&#xD;
           for reference landmarks for proximal segment &amp; tooth bearing segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Drilling of all the reference landmarks on the proximal segment and locating medial,&#xD;
           vertical, oblique cuts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Removal of guide, then BSSO is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The final wafer is placed, the guiding hole on the proximal segment will then be&#xD;
           realigned with the previously drilled screw holes, fixation using mono cortical screws&#xD;
           then drilling screw holes for plate fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Fixation of the osteotomy using 2.0 mm pre-bent mini plates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. A positioning screw will be added to improve stability against rotational forces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b-Functional appliance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postsurgical computer guided functional appliance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After achieving ideal condylar poison by computer guided surgery. The distal extension of the&#xD;
      final occlusal wafer will be cut and the appliance will be fitted to be utilized as a&#xD;
      postsurgical functional appliance for condylar adaptation. Patients will be instructed to&#xD;
      wear the splints continuously for 3 months, only being allowed to remove them when eating and&#xD;
      brushing their teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presurgical computer guided functional appliance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the software, 3D digitized mandible will be virtually repositioned in ideal centric&#xD;
      relation through accurate adjustment of the condyle in its glenoid fossa. Patients' dental&#xD;
      casts will be scanned, and digitized into a virtual 3D model and superimposed to the CT cuts&#xD;
      into the virtual plan software environment in order to produce preoperative CAD/CAM splint on&#xD;
      the adjusted centric occlusion. Patients will be instructed to wear the splints continuously&#xD;
      for 3 months, only being allowed to remove them when eating and brushing their teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c- Follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be advised to stay on a soft diet for 4-6 weeks to avoid any undue forces&#xD;
      on the surgical site. Postoperative CT and lateral cephalogram will be obtained, immediately&#xD;
      postoperative and 12 months later respectively.&#xD;
