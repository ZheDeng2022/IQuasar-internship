  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects had randomly divided into two groups. All will do aerobic exercise in form of&#xD;
      treadmill but Group (A) will do while wearing surgical mask and Group (B) without surgical&#xD;
      mask. To detect the Influence of surgical mask on functional capacity and quality of life&#xD;
      during controlled endurance exercise in sedentary adults&#xD;

      Group (A):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Each subject will sign a consent form after receiving a detailed explanation about the&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Functional capacity and Quality of life will be evaluated before the start of the&#xD;
           training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subjects in group A will wear surgical mask before starting of the session. 4.3 sessions&#xD;
           will be done every week for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.The session will start with warming up for 5 minutes then 25 minutes of aerobic exercise on&#xD;
      the treadmill with moderate intensity followed by cooling down for 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.After finishing the program, the participant will be evaluated to detect the effect of the&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (B):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Each subject will sign a consent form after receiving a detailed explanation about the&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Functional capacity and Quality of life will be evaluated before the start of the&#xD;
           training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subjects in group A will not wear any mask during the session. 4.3 sessions will be done&#xD;
           every week for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.The session will start with warming up for 5 minutes then 25 minutes of aerobic exercise on&#xD;
      the treadmill with moderate intensity followed by cooling down for 5 minutes.&#xD;
