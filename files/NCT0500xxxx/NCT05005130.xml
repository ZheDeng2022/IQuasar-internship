  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This mixed-methods formative research study aims to adapt the WHO Package of Essential&#xD;
      Noncommunicable Disease Interventions (WHO-PEN) approach for the Zambian public health&#xD;
      system, and pilot test an adapted, streamlined, and task-shifted package of integrated HIV&#xD;
      Noncommunicable Disease (NCD) services, collectively called &quot;TASKPEN&quot;.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using local data and implementation science theories WHO-PEN will be adapted for Zambia, and&#xD;
      TASKPEN developed to focus on addressing challenges faced by persons living with HIV (PLHIV)&#xD;
      who have cardio-metabolic complications related to HIV or its treatment (e.g. hypertension,&#xD;
      diabetes, dyslipidaemia). TASKPEN aims to improve detection and management of these&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formative research activities for objective 1 include focus group discussions (FGDs), surveys&#xD;
      and interviews with key stakeholders, which will include in-depth interviews (IDIs) with&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2 launches the TASKPEN pilot and fully task-shifts the TASKPEN package to&#xD;
      non-physician healthcare workers (NPHWs) and integrates it within the President's Emergency&#xD;
      Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) -supported HIV service delivery platform. A mix of IDIs, FGDs,&#xD;
      key informant interviews, and implementation surveys with implementation actors to evaluate&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, and other implementation outcomes&#xD;

    <description>The Data-collection on Adverse Effects of Anti-HIV Drugs score The D:A:D or &quot;Data Collection on Adverse Effects of Anti-HIV Drugs&quot; is a risk prediction tool that estimates the risk of an individual developing a cardiovascular disease within the next 5 and 10 years.&#xD;
The &quot;Data Collection on Adverse Effects of Anti-HIV Drugs score classifies individuals with &gt;10% risk of nonfatal and fatal myocardial infarction within 5 years as very high risk, 5-10% as high risk, 1-5% as moderate risk, and &lt;1% as low risk.</description>
