    <textblock>
      Our findings are expected to provide real-world evidence of the renal-adverse effects of&#xD;
      colchicine and NSAIDs combination therapy in patients with gout, which will guide healthcare&#xD;
      professions in optimizing gout treatment regimens and evaluating risks of renal impairment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Gout is a common prevalent disease, which causes a low quality of life and poses&#xD;
      a significant health burden nationally and internationally. Colchicine and Nonsteroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) are the mainstay treatment of gout. Concurrent use of&#xD;
      colchicine and NSAIDs are more than half in all prescriptions of the gout patients. Both&#xD;
      colchicine and NSAIDs may cause renal impairment. However, the empirical evidence of renal&#xD;
      impairment of colchicine and NSAIDs combination therapy is limited and even absent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This proposal will assess the association between colchicine and NSAIDs&#xD;
      combination therapy and acute kidney injury. The investigators further evaluate the&#xD;
      relationships of duration-response, recency-response, and dose-response.&#xD;
