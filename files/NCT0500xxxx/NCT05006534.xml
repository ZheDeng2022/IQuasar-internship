    <textblock>
      This study enrolled patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma&#xD;
      treated with polatuzumab vedotin-based chemoimmunotherapies. Patients were allowed to use&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens other than Rituximab and Bendamustine and transplantation following&#xD;
      polatuzumab vedotin was also allowed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polatuzumab vedotin has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment for patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma in an international phase II clinical&#xD;
      trial. The clinical trials was conducted in Europe and the United States. Although there is a&#xD;
      phase III trial about polatuzumab vedotin in newly diagnosed patients with diffuse large B&#xD;
      cell lymphoma, the double-blind design has limited the efficacy assessment and side effect&#xD;
      observation, making it difficult to provide clinicians with further information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This program hopes to evaluate the clinical course and treatment response of these patients&#xD;
      in order to facilitate clinicians' understanding of this drug and to improve patients'&#xD;
      quality of life and medical care, as well as to prevent the occurrence of related&#xD;
      complications and treatment toxicity.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The informed consent form must be signed before any study specific tests or procedures&#xD;
             are done&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Adult male and female patients â‰¥20 years at the time of inclusion in the study Ability&#xD;
             to understand and follow study-related instructions&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Histological diagnosis of primary refractory or relapsed aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin&#xD;
             lymphoma (B-NHL), confirmed by a biopsy of involved nodal or extranodal site. Patients&#xD;
             with any of the following histologies can be included:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  DLBCL not otherwise specified (NOS)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
