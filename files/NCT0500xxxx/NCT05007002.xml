  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a stroke, more than two out of three patients experience problems with upper limb&#xD;
      movement and sensation. Current evidence on treatment of upper limb sensory impairments is&#xD;
      scarce and shows unclear results. Robot-based therapy has been increasingly used to treat&#xD;
      upper limb motor impairments, with similar positive results as compared to conventional&#xD;
      therapy. This study aims to investigate a novel robot-based therapy program for treatment of&#xD;
      upper limb sensory impairments. The therapy program consists of 10 one-hour session spread&#xD;
      over 4 weeks and will be evaluated for its effect in 20 chronic stroke patients. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that a 4-week robot-based therapy program can improve upper limb&#xD;
      sensation and movement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 70% of stroke survivors show upper limb impairments consisting of motor and/or&#xD;
      somatosensory impairments. These impairments often persist well into the chronic stage, and&#xD;
      may lead to significant limitations in activities of daily living and may negatively affect&#xD;
      quality of life. Different interventions have been investigated to treat upper limb motor&#xD;
      impairments, including robot-based therapy, which shows similar positive results as compared&#xD;
      to conventional therapy. Evidence on interventions for somatosensory impairments is scarce&#xD;
      and often of low quality. This study therefore aims to evaluate the effect of a robot-based&#xD;
      therapy program on sensorimotor function of the upper limb in a group of 20 chronic stroke&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The robot-based therapy will be provided using the Kinarm End-Point Lab (BKIN Technologies&#xD;
      Ltd., Canada) and consists of passive and active therapy tasks for proprioception and sensory&#xD;
      processing. The therapy consists of 10 one-hour sessions spread over 4 weeks. Clinical and&#xD;
      robot-based motor and somatosensory assessments will be performed at 4 time points: twice at&#xD;
      baseline, once at mid intervention, and once after 10 hours of therapy. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize to find improvement in both upper limb motor and somatosensory function after the&#xD;
      therapy program. The results from this pilot study will provide a basis for further research.&#xD;
