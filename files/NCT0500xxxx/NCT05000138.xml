  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Giant cell arteritis (GCA) causes inflammation of the arteries and can lead to serious&#xD;
      complications such as blindness, necessitating rapid diagnosis and treatment. Although older&#xD;
      technology non-digital PET/CT scans are routinely used for the diagnosis of GCA in large&#xD;
      arteries, they have not been able to reliably detect inflammation of the small arteries&#xD;
      responsible for blindness. Recent technological advances have enabled PET/CT imaging of&#xD;
      millimetric disease in the body, and Quebec has been one of the first to deploy these new&#xD;
      digital PET/CT scanners, which are now able to resolve small arteries. In the proposed&#xD;
      research study, patients who are suspected by their doctors to have GCA will undergo temporal&#xD;
      artery biopsy (the standard of care), an ultrasound of the temporal arteries, and digital&#xD;
      PET/CT scan after injection of radioactive glucose. Digital PET/CT scans will be interpreted&#xD;
      for the presence of abnormal uptake in the large and small arteries, as well as for the&#xD;
      presence of other causes of the patient's symptoms. The diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT and&#xD;
      ultrasound will be evaluated with respect to an expert panel diagnosis of giant cell&#xD;
      arteritis and compared. Results will be adjusted for lack of a perfect reference test using&#xD;
      advanced statistics. The goal will be to see if digital PET/CT can become a single,&#xD;
      integrated test to diagnose this disease.&#xD;
