    <measure>Distance Visual Acuity (logMAR)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 4-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Binocular visual performance on logMAR (Logarithm of Minimal Angle of Resolution) scale will be evaluated at distance (4 meters) under high luminance high contrast lighting condition using ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) charts. The room illuminance was required to be between 7.3 and 7.9 EV (394-597 lux). For Distance (4 meters), the acceptable range for the chart luminance was 10.5-10.7 EV (181-208 cd/m2). Letter-by-letter results calculated the visual performance score for each chart read. A logMAR score closer to zero, or below zero, indicates a better visual acuity. A logMAR visual performance score of 0.0 is equivalent to Snellen visual acuity of 20/20.</description>

    <measure>Intermediate LogMAR Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>at 4-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Binocular visual performance on logMAR (Logarithm of Minimal Angle of Resolution) scale will be evaluated at intermediate (64 centimeters) under high luminance high contrast lighting condition using reduced Guillon-Poling charts. The room illuminance was required to be between 7.3 and 7.9 EV (394-597 lux). For Intermediate (64 cm), the acceptable range for the chart luminance 10.8-11.1 EV (223-274 cd/m2). Letter-by-letter results calculated the visual performance score for each chart read. A logMAR score closer to zero, or below zero, indicates a better visual acuity. A logMAR visual performance score of 0.0 is equivalent to Snellen visual acuity of 20/20.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Near Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>at 4-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Binocular visual performance on logMAR (Logarithm of Minimal Angle of Resolution) scale was evaluated at near (40 centimeters) under high luminance high contrast lighting condition u using reduced Guillon-Poling charts. The room illuminance was required to be between 7.3 and 7.9 EV (394-597 lux). For Near (40cm), the acceptable range for the chart luminance 10.8-11.1 EV (223-274 cd/m2). Letter-by-letter results calculated the visual performance score for each chart read. A logMAR score closer to zero, or below zero, indicates a better visual acuity.
