  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, with ischemic heart disease&#xD;
      (IHD) the leading cause of cardiovascular mortality. Persons with IHD suffering from&#xD;
      psychological distress, including hopelessness, are more likely to die from IHD. Following a&#xD;
      stressful event, the vagus nerve enables activation of either a sympathetic (fight/flight) or&#xD;
      parasympathetic (rest/digest) response. Heart rate variability (HRV), the beat-to-beat&#xD;
      variability between normal successive heart beats, is a biomarker of both adaptive and&#xD;
      maladaptive reactions to stress. Decreased HRV predicts greater risk for morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality and is associated with poor mental health outcomes in persons with IHD. As stated&#xD;
      by polyvagal theory, HRV may be influenced by social support. Decreased perceived social&#xD;
      support (PSS), a social determinant of cardiovascular risk, is predictive of increased&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in persons with IHD. Decreased PSS has been associated with&#xD;
      hopelessness in patients with cancer, but this relationship has not been studied in IHD&#xD;
      beyond the applicant's small pilot study of patients with hopelessness. Hopelessness, a&#xD;
      negative outlook and sense of helplessness about the future, is present in 27-52% of patients&#xD;
      with IHD. This is of grave concern, because hopelessness is associated with a 3.4 times&#xD;
      increased risk of mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with IHD,&#xD;
      independent of depression. This research focuses on understanding the biological (HRV) and&#xD;
      social (PSS) aspects of hopelessness, with the long-term goal of developing and testing novel&#xD;
      interventions to reduce the adverse effects of hopelessness and improve health outcomes in&#xD;
      patients with IHD. Participants for this cross-sectional study will be recruited while&#xD;
      hospitalized for an IHD event. Participants will include patients who report moderate to&#xD;
      severe hopelessness from the sponsor's NIH-funded study (n = 225); additional patients with&#xD;
      minimal to no hopelessness will be recruited and enrolled by the applicant (n = 45). Data&#xD;
      collection will take place remotely two weeks after hospital discharge. Specific aims&#xD;
      include: Aim 1) Evaluate the relationship between HRV and hopelessness in patients with IHD;&#xD;
      Aim 2) Determine the relationship between PSS and hopelessness in patients with IHD; and Aim&#xD;
      3) Explore the possible mediating effect of HRV on the relationship between PSS and&#xD;
      hopelessness in patients with IHD.&#xD;

      Design, Sample, and Setting. A cross-sectional design will be used to address study aims.&#xD;
      Data will be collected 2 weeks after hospital discharge for an IHD event. Patients who&#xD;
      provide written-informed consent and enroll will be sent a package with study materials to&#xD;
      their home and complete a phone visit 2 weeks after hospital discharge. Comorbidities and&#xD;
      clinical characteristics will be abstracted from the medical record. Recruitment and&#xD;
      enrollment of all patients will take place during patients' hospitalization for an IHD event&#xD;
      at a large teaching hospital in the Midwestern United States. The applicant will analyze data&#xD;
      from Dr. Dunn's NIH-funded study (R01NR017649) of 225 patients with IHD who report moderate&#xD;
      to severe hopelessness and will additionally recruit 45 sex and age matched patients with IHD&#xD;
      who report minimal to no hopelessness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment, Screening and Consent. Study enrollers, employed by the recruiting hospital,&#xD;
      will determine eligibility for hopelessness screening by reviewing the patient's medical&#xD;
      record. Eligible hospitalized IHD patients will be called by enrollers and invited to screen&#xD;
      for hopelessness over the phone. Enrollers will use a script to introduce the screening&#xD;
      portion of the study, explaining that eligibility for Dr. Dunn's study (enrolling those who&#xD;
      report moderate to severe hopelessness) and the applicant's study (enrolling those with&#xD;
      minimal or no hopelessness) will depend on screening results. Interested patients will&#xD;
      provide consent for the hopelessness screening, including a HIPAA waiver. Patients who&#xD;
      provide consent will be screened for hopelessness using the 10-item state subscale of the&#xD;
      23-item State-Trait Hopelessness Scale (STHS). Based on published cut-point criteria, a&#xD;
      criterion of ≥ 1.8 will be used for classification of moderate to severe hopelessness levels.&#xD;
      Patients who score ≥ 1.8 during screening will be asked to participate in Dr. Dunn's study,&#xD;
      and the applicant will have access to this data. Patients who score &lt; 1.8 on the STHS will be&#xD;
      asked by the applicant to participate in the proposed research. To mitigate potential&#xD;
      exposure to COVID-19, the only in-person contact with participants throughout the course of&#xD;
      the proposed study will be during the enrollment process. During enrollment, the applicant&#xD;
      will explain the study, risks, benefits, voluntary nature of participation, and the patient's&#xD;
      right to discontinue participation at any time without consequences. Written consent will be&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Procedures. Study participants will receive the study package by USPS mail&#xD;
      two weeks after hospital discharge and will also receive a phone visit at Week 2. Study&#xD;
      package materials will include a Polar H7 heart rate monitor, ActiGraph wGT3X-BT (to link to&#xD;
      the Polar monitor for HRV data collection), written instructions for HRV measurement, hard&#xD;
      copies of questionnaires (to view during the data collection phone call), instructions to&#xD;
      return the monitors, and a prepaid return envelope. Participants will also be sent a secure&#xD;
      link via text or email to an instructional video depicting verbal and visual demonstration of&#xD;
      proper HRV measurement. The applicant will call the participant once a mail delivery notice&#xD;
      has been received to instruct and confirm proper placement of the monitors used to measure&#xD;
      HRV and answer any questions. All data collection will occur at Week 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HRV Procedures. At Week 2, participants will be instructed to place the Polar H7 heart rate&#xD;
      monitor around the center of their chest, in contact with the skin, and the ActiGraph&#xD;
      wGT3X-BT around their waist, according to directions outlined in the written instructions&#xD;
      provided and as demonstrated in the instructional video and practiced with the applicant over&#xD;
      the phone. Participants will be informed that the monitors are used to gather data about&#xD;
      their body at rest. The Polar H7 heart rate monitor connects to the ActiGraph with Bluetooth®&#xD;
      wireless technology so that the interval between normal to normal (RR) heart beats can be&#xD;
      transferred to csv files for analysis. The Polar H7 has demonstrated strong correlation with&#xD;
      ECG for measuring HRV (r=0.99). The HRV protocol will take place during a 10-minute time&#xD;
      period on two consecutive days, to ensure at least one timeframe of usable data. Participants&#xD;
      will be instructed to place the monitors first thing in the morning after they wake up and&#xD;
      empty their bladder. Once the monitors are placed, participants will be instructed to lay&#xD;
      supine, still, and quiet for 10 minutes. The standardized HRV protocol enhances reliability&#xD;
      of the HRV measurement because control of extraneous variables is maintained. Respirations&#xD;
      will not be controlled because this can artificially increase HF HRV. The gold standard&#xD;
      amount of time for a short-term HRV recording is 5 minutes. The intermediate 5 minutes of the&#xD;
      recording will be used for analysis, so that the initial minutes of lying flat and the final&#xD;
      minutes will be removed. After the participant completes the two HRV measurements, they will&#xD;
      be asked to return the monitors in a prepaid envelope that will be picked up from their&#xD;
      mailbox by USPS, mitigating any exposure to COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phone Visit to Complete Questionnaires. After completion of the HRV measurement instructional&#xD;
      phone visit, participants will receive their Week 2 data collection visit. Participants in&#xD;
      Dr. Dunn's study will receive their phone visit from a trained data collector prior to the&#xD;
      RCT's intervention. Participants in the applicant's study will receive their phone visit from&#xD;
      the applicant. The data collectors/applicant will follow identical scripts for data&#xD;
      collection. During the phone visit, the data collector/applicant will first ask how HRV&#xD;
      measurement went that morning and remind participants to complete the measurement the&#xD;
      following morning. Participants will then complete four questionnaires. Deidentified HRV data&#xD;
      will be uploaded into Box, a secure cloud-based storage service, by the applicant. All&#xD;
      questionnaire and electronic medical record data will be logged directly into REDCap using a&#xD;
      secure electronic tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures. The following questionnaires will be completed during the data collection phone&#xD;
      visit. Demographic Questionnaire: Demographics are being collected to describe the sample and&#xD;
      determine if these variables are confounders. State-Trait Hopelessness Scale (STHS): The STHS&#xD;
      measures state and trait hopelessness. The scale uses a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging&#xD;
      from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Item scores are added and divided by the&#xD;
      number of items to provide a total score for each subscale, ranging in a final score from 1-4&#xD;
      with higher scores indicating greater levels of hopelessness. In patients with IHD, the scale&#xD;
      has demonstrated reliability and validity. ENRICHD Social Support Inventory (ESSI): The ESSI&#xD;
      measures PSS. The ESSI is a 7-item instrument that uses a 5-point Likert-type scale for items&#xD;
      1-6 ranging from 1 (none of the time) to 5 (all of the time). The 7th item is yes/no. Items&#xD;
      are summed for a final score with a range from 8-34, higher scores indicate greater levels of&#xD;
      PSS. The ESSI was found to be valid and reliable in patients with IHD. Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9): The PHQ-9 measures depressive symptom severity. The instrument is&#xD;
      comprised of 9 items that are scored on a Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3&#xD;
      (nearly every day). Item scores are summed for a total score ranging from 0-27, higher scores&#xD;
      indicating greater depressive symptom severity. The PHQ-9 has been validated in patients with&#xD;
      IHD. Internal reliability and criterion and construct validity have been previously&#xD;
      established. Depressive symptoms are being measured as a potential covariate because of the&#xD;
      known association between hopelessness and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both a medical record abstraction and the Charlson Comorbidity Index are completed within two&#xD;
      weeks after the participant's hospital discharge. The medical record abstraction is completed&#xD;
      to obtain participant clinical characteristics. The Charlson Comorbidity Index is a&#xD;
      prognostic index of comorbidity. The instrument predicts 1-year mortality based on illness&#xD;
      severity, reason for admission, and weighted comorbidity score. It is a reliable and valid&#xD;
      prognostic indicator for in-hospital and 1-year outcomes in patients with IHD.&#xD;
