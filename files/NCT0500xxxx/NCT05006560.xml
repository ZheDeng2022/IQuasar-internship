  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate a 12-week internet-based rehabilitation aftercare program&#xD;
      with an emphasis on physical activity promotion for persons with COPD. The program starts&#xD;
      directly after an inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program. It includes monitoring and&#xD;
      promotion of physical activity, progressive resistance and endurance training, education&#xD;
      through online learning modules and continuous support from a therapist.&#xD;

    <description>Questionnaire: Subjectively measured physical activity&#xD;
The questionnaire asks for physical activities during a typical week. It differentiates between leisure-time/transportation activities (physical activity score) and sport-/exercise-related activities (sports score). Participants are required to report frequency and duration of activities executed during the last two weeks. Minutes of leisure-time physical activity per week and sport-/exercise related activity per week are calculated to get the physical activity and the sports score. Both scores can be combined in order to receive the overall volume of physical activity completed during leisure-time and transportation as well as sport-/exercise-related activities.</description>

    <measure>Bief Fatigue Inventory (BFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Two weeks prior to inpatient rehabilitation (T-1), during the last week of pulmonary rehabilitation (T1), one week after the rehabilitation aftercare program (T2)</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire: Fatigue&#xD;
The BFI starts with a question asking the patient whether he feels more than usual fatigued or tired (yes/no). This question is followed by nine items on the intensity of fatigue as well as impairments caused by fatigue. These questions can be answered on an eleven-step numerical rating scale (0-10), with higher scores indicating higher intensity and impairment. The total BFI score is the mean of the nine items.</description>

    <measure>Health Care Climate Questionnaire (German version) (HCCQ-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>during the last week of pulmonary rehabilitation (T1), one week after the rehabilitation aftercare program (T2)</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire: patients' perceived autonomy support from their health care provider&#xD;
The questionnaire consists of 15 items that can be answered on a seven-point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree). An overall score is calculated by taking the average of individual item scores.</description>

    <time_frame>during the last week of pulmonary rehabilitation (T1) (only intervention group), one week after the rehabilitation aftercare program (T2)</time_frame>
    <description>The module usability and usefulness of the meCue 2.0 questionnaire was used. The module contains 3 items on usability and 3 items on usefulness that are answered on a 7-point Likert scale (scored from 1 to 7). In order two receive a score for usability and a score for usefulness, the mean is calculated for the items of each area</description>

    <description>Participants receive the standard inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in a specialized German Rehabilitation Clinic. PR is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary intervention implemented by an interdisciplinary rehabilitation team. PR is based on a patient assessment followed by a combination of patient-tailored therapies. PR includes the following obligatory main components: Checking and, if required, adjusting the current COPD medication according to current guidelines; physical training (endurance training, strength training, whole body vibration muscle training); structured education; respiratory physiotherapy. PR lasts on average 25 days.</description>

PR includes the following obligatory main components: Checking and, if required, adjusting the current COPD medication according to current guidelines; physical training (endurance training, strength training, whole body vibration muscle training); structured education; respiratory physiotherapy. PR lasts on average 25 days. Additionally, participants use several functions of the aftercare program's mobile application. This includes using the application during endurance and strength training (as part of usual care) and using a consumer activity monitor to count daily steps.</description>

    <description>Participants will agree with their therapist on an exercise plan (endurance and resistance training) that are made available for participants through the study's mobile app. Frequency and duration of endurance and strength training are prescribed in accordance with exercise guidelines for persons with COPD. However, they can be adjusted according to participants needs.&#xD;
Next to the exercise, participants receive physical activity counseling. This consists of phone or video calls with a therapist, group video calls with a therapist, a complementary e-learning course as well as complementary functions of the study's mobile app.</description>
