  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lack of current consensus on the therapeutic management of low-grade osteo-ligament injuries&#xD;
      in ankle trauma in children. Several types of immobilization are evaluated in the literature,&#xD;
      with different conclusions. Some teams recommend a functional treatment similar to the adult&#xD;
      (with or without strict immobilization), others remain on standard rigid immobilizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to simplify and homogenize the therapeutic management of low-grade&#xD;
      osteo-ligament injuries in ankle trauma in children.&#xD;

      with different conclusions. Some teams recommend a functional treatment similar to the adult&#xD;

&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to simplify and homogenize the therapeutic management of low-grade&#xD;
      osteo-ligament injuries in ankle trauma in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHEVIPED is a controlled, randomized, comparative monocentric trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization into 2 groups and stratified on presence to fracture Salter 1 and age&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group : Patients with below-knee soft resin cast Control group : Patients with&#xD;
      below-knee rigid resin cast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to demonstrate at 2 months that with post traumatic low- grade&#xD;
      osteo-ligamentous ankle injury the recovery of physical function are at least as effective&#xD;
      with a below-knee soft resin cast compared to a below-knee rigid resin cast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical evaluation of treatment at 3 weeks in immediate post-immobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluation of the management satisfaction (effectiveness and understanding) and the&#xD;
           treatment tolerance .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluation of the time taken to resume painless support after immobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Point of interest evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Determine the diagnostic performance of the &quot;combined clinical criteria&quot; in comparison&#xD;
           with the ultrasound/radiography couple.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Evaluation of the diagnostic performance of clinical inspection criteria (edema, bruise)&#xD;
           in high-grade ligament damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Evaluation of the link between the &quot;combined clinical criteria&quot; and the results of the&#xD;
           radiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Evaluation of the relationship between &quot;combined clinical criteria&quot; and ultrasound&#xD;
           results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Evaluation of the link between the results of radiography and ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      200 patients are expected to be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion period : 12 months. Duration of patient's participation: 2 months Total study&#xD;
      duration: 14 months.&#xD;
