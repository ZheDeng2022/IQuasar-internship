    <textblock>
      This phase II trial determines if the combination of ONC201 with different drugs,&#xD;
      panobinostat or paxalisib, is effective for treating patients with diffuse midline gliomas&#xD;
      (DMGs). Despite years of research, little to no progress has been made to improve outcomes&#xD;
      for patients with DMGs, and there are few treatment options. ONC201, panobinostat, and&#xD;
      paxalisib are all enzyme inhibitors that may stop the growth of tumor cells by clocking some&#xD;
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. This phase II trial assesses different combinations of&#xD;
      these drugs for the treatment of DMGs.&#xD;

      Cohort 2 and Arms 1, 3 and 5 in Cohorts 1 and 3 will not open until the recommended phase II&#xD;
      dose (RP2D) for panobinostat is confirmed from the safety lead-in. Once the RP2D for&#xD;
      panobinostat is confirmed, the investigator will open all arms across all cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the RP2D (outside of this trial) is declared before full completion our safety lead-in,&#xD;
      the investigator will transition to opening all arms and cohorts immediately and use the&#xD;
      declared RP2D for all panobinostat arms and cohorts.&#xD;
