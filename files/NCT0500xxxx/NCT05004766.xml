    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the application of virtual reality (VR) is&#xD;
      effective in reducing training pain in robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) in patients with&#xD;
      lower extremity burn. The investigators investigated through an analysis of the activation&#xD;
      status over time in the prefrontal cortex using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Burn injuries and their treatment are considered to be among the most painful a person can&#xD;
      endure. Therefore, new modalities that prove effective with burn patients are expected to&#xD;
      improve clinical outcomes when applied to painful therapies. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine whether the application of virtual reality (VR) is effective in reducing training&#xD;
      pain in robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) in patients with lower extremity burn. The&#xD;
      investigators investigated through an analysis of the activation status over time in the&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). RAGT was performed 10&#xD;
      times for 2 weeks from Monday to Friday, and the cerebral blood flow measurement using NIRS&#xD;
      was measured 3 times each while applying or not applying VR for 30 minutes as long as the&#xD;
      RAGT is in progress. The VR program provided non-immersive VR walking along a forest path or&#xD;
      a coastal path according to the walking speed while the RAGT was in progress. For each&#xD;
      physical therapy session, each patient spent equal amounts of time in VR and in the control&#xD;
      condition (without VR). The average of oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb of each session was measured for&#xD;
      10 days. In the prefrontal cortex, the levels of hemoglobin (Hb) were measured using the&#xD;
      fNIRS measurement system. Average values of both oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb were calculated at four&#xD;
      stages : temporal delay time with RAGT, RAGT without VR, temporal delay time with VR, RAGT&#xD;
      with VR. Before training, all patients verbally rated their most severe pain during physical&#xD;
      training as a score of 5 or higher on a visual analog scale (VAS) of 0 to 10, where 0&#xD;
      presents &quot; no pain at all&quot; and 10 presents &quot; worst pain&quot;. Pain, the primary dependent&#xD;
      variable, was measured immediately after each experimental treatment. Patient rated (1) their&#xD;
      worst pain (no pain to worst pain), and (2) their average pain ( no pain or worst pain).&#xD;
