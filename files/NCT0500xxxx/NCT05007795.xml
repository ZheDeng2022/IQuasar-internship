  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs is a continually growing problem. Multidrug-resistant&#xD;
      tuberculosis (MDRTB) is resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, and extensively&#xD;
      drug-resistant TB is additional resistance to a fluoroquinolone and a second injectable line&#xD;
      drug. Methods currently employed in testing for resistance are inadequate and a contributing&#xD;
      factor to the 40-50% MDR-TB treatment success rate. Current drug susceptibility testing&#xD;
      methods are slow for most drugs, taking weeks. Rapid molecular methods such as the line probe&#xD;
      assays, e.g. Hain GenoType MDRTBplus and sl, provide resistant calls to only a limited number&#xD;
      of drugs, and are often less useful in smear negative patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular technologies such as sequencing can provide a comprehensive readout of drug&#xD;
      resistance and are able to detect resistant populations at very low levels (≤1%), thus&#xD;
      enabling individualized therapy. This can be done directly from sputum. Targeted sequencing&#xD;
      amplifies regions of genomic DNA associated with resistance prior to sequencing. Rapid&#xD;
      analytic software is used to process the raw sequence data, identify resistance causing&#xD;
      mutations and provide a readout of clinically relevant information. However, the feasibility,&#xD;
      and more importantly the impact, of this approach has not been evaluated in a clinical trial&#xD;
      to establish proof of concept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To conduct a randomised controlled trial to determine the impact of sputum-based&#xD;
      targeted sequencing in detecting resistance to second-line TB drugs compared to the current&#xD;
      programmatic standard of care (Hain MDRTBplus/sl and adjunct phenotypic drug susceptibility&#xD;
      testing) when used to inform of treatment for MDR-TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To compare currently available drug resistant sequencing pipelines for diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and predictive value as compared to culture based&#xD;
      phenotypic drug susceptibility testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To compare the feasibility, accuracy, turn-aroundtime, and cost implications of the&#xD;
      above-mentioned diagnostic approaches.&#xD;

      Trial aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To conduct a randomised controlled trial to determine the impact of sputum-based&#xD;
      targeted sequencing in detecting resistance to second-line TB drugs compared to the current&#xD;
      programmatic standard of care (Hain MDRTBplus/sl and adjunct phenotypic drug susceptibility&#xD;
      testing) when used to inform of treatment for MDR-TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-aim 1.1: To determine the proportion of patients (in the control and conventional groups)&#xD;
      placed on ≥ 5 likely effective drugs within 14 days of rifampicin resistant tuberculosis&#xD;
      diagnosis (the current WHO guideline) in the two groups (targeted sequencing versus LPA and&#xD;
      phenotypic testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-aim 1.2: To determine time-specific treatment-related outcomes (6, 12, and 18-20 month&#xD;
      favourable outcome rates), amplification of drug resistance rates (number of drugs), and&#xD;
      6-month change in chest radiograph disease scores in the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-aim 1.3: To determine the prevalence of minority hetero-resistant bacterial populations&#xD;
      in patients in the same two groups and the change in these populations during the course of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To compare currently available drug resistant sequencing pipelines for diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and predictive value as compared to culture based&#xD;
      phenotypic drug susceptibility testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To compare the feasibility, accuracy, turn-around-time, and cost implications of the&#xD;
      above-mentioned diagnostic approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 of this multistage study will recruit 100 patients (Stage 2 and 3 will only be&#xD;
      undertaken if the primary outcome has been achieved in the stage 1 study). Patients aged &gt; 18&#xD;
      years with newly diagnosed pulmonary rifampicin resistant tuberculosis will be recruited from&#xD;
      the two study recruiting sites. Both HIV-infected and un-infected patients will be eligible&#xD;
      for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff will be referred newly diagnosed, rifampicin-resistant cases by the staff from&#xD;
      City of Cape Town TB Clinics and TB-specific hospitals (after a discussion with the patients)&#xD;
      at each site. Once the patient's diagnosis has been disclosed by the attending TB doctor, the&#xD;
      study team will meet the patient after they have commenced treatment. The study staff will&#xD;
      screen the potential participants for eligibility to participate in the study according to&#xD;
      the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are required to meet ALL of the following inclusion criteria to participate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Newly diagnosed culture and/or Xpert/MTB Ultra positive pulmonary TB&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rifampicin resistance detected using GeneXpert&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide written informed consent prior to all trial-related procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Male or female aged 18 years and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients on TB treatment for less than or equal to 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients receiving both the shorter and longer MDR-TB regimen will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be excluded from participation if they meet ANY of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A subject who in the opinion of the investigator is unlikely to cope with regular visits&#xD;
           to the trial site either because of travel constraints, or drug or alcohol abuse, or&#xD;
           other reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Currently on MDR-TB treatment and completed 7 days of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any participant with a clinically significant pre-existing medical condition that, in&#xD;
           the opinion of the investigator, may be significantly worsened by the patient's&#xD;
           participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any subject with a Karnofsky score &lt; 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Having participated in other clinical studies within 8 weeks prior to trial start where&#xD;
           investigational agents were used that may potentially impact current trial outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant who is pregnant, breast-feeding (and not willing to stop), or planning to&#xD;
           conceive a child within 6 months of cessation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any pre-existing laboratory abnormality, which in the opinion of the investigator will&#xD;
           place the participant at risk (see detailed protocol for grade of abnormality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All inclusion and no exclusion criteria must be met prior to enrolment and randomisation.&#xD;
      Whenever the investigator has reason to suspect that there might be a health problem (other&#xD;
      than TB), participation should only be considered after discussing the case with the medical&#xD;
      monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An open-label pragmatic proof of concept randomized controlled trial will be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multi-arm multi-staged (MAMS) trial with three stages. We have funding to&#xD;
      currently complete stage 1, but further funding will be made available through the MRC AMR&#xD;
      EMU (PI= K Dheda) if the primary outcomes are achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 primary outcome measure: Proportion of patients initiated on treatment with ≥5 likely&#xD;
      effective drugs within 14 days of rifampicin resistant tuberculosis diagnosis in each group&#xD;
      (n=100).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 primary outcome measure: Six-month unfavourable outcome rates in each group (n=230&#xD;
      inclusive of stage 1 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3 primary outcome measure: End of treatment (12 or 18-20 month depending on the regimen&#xD;
      used) unfavourable outcome rate in each group (n=280 inclusive of stage 2 patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled participants will be randomised 1:1 (open-label) to receive either the empiric&#xD;
      standard of care (9-11 month or sometimes the 18-20 month conventional treatment regimen) or&#xD;
      the individualised interventional regimen for MDR-TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment duration in the conventional arm will be 9-11 months, or 18-20 months, based on the&#xD;
      SA Department of Health Policy Guidelines for the treatment of MDR, with sputum culture (and&#xD;
      smear microscopy) being evaluated monthly during the treatment period (and 6 monthly during&#xD;
      the follow-up period). In the interventional arm sputum culture (and smear microscopy) will&#xD;
      also be evaluated monthly during the treatment period (and 6 monthly during the follow-up&#xD;
      phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The regimen in the interventional arm will be individualised and constructed in accordance to&#xD;
      the Xpert/MTB Ultra, and results from targeted genome sequencing. The regimen will be&#xD;
      developed using drugs from the table below (new WHO classification). The duration of&#xD;
      treatment will be in accordance to the National TB program (NTP) guidelines i.e. patients who&#xD;
      have been exposed to second-line drugs for &gt;1 month previously, patients who require&#xD;
      substitution of a key drug (i.e bedaquiline, linezolid or levofloxacin), those with a&#xD;
      haemoglobin of &lt; 8g/dl, or patients with complicated extra-pulmonary TB (meningitis, bone and&#xD;
      complicated abdominal TB), will receive the longer regimen (18-20 months with some&#xD;
      medications like bedaquiline and linezolid being prescribed for ~ 6 months) while all other&#xD;
      patients will receive the NTP recommended shorter regimen (9-11 months with some medications,&#xD;
      like bedaquiline (6 months) and linezolid (2 months), being used for shorter duration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: The SA guidelines for the management of MDR-TB are currently finalised but may change&#xD;
      slightly or over time; our study will adopt the final decision from the NTP with regards to&#xD;
      selection/indications for the long vs. short course regimen and their respective duration of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHO Grouping Group A: Include all three medications (unless they can not be used) -&#xD;
      Bedaquiline, Linezolid, Levofloxacin Group B: Add both medicines (unless they cannot be used)&#xD;
      - Clofazimine, Cycloserine/ Terizidone Group C: Add to complete the regimen and when&#xD;
      medicines from Group A and B cannot be used - PZA, Delaminid, Ethambutol, Imipenem-cilastin/&#xD;
      Meropenem, Amikacin/ Streptomycin, High dose Isoniazid, Ethionamide/ Prothionamide,&#xD;
      p-aminosalicylic, Terizidone&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional Arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment in the conventional arm will be in accordance to the National TB program's&#xD;
      recommendations. Patients on short and long course regimen will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional regimen for adult MDR-TB as per the SA Department of Health Policy Guidelines on&#xD;
      the treatment of MDR:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DRUGS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bedaquiline (Bdq) 6 months Daily dosing Linezolid (Lzd) Only 2-months Daily Levofloxacin&#xD;
      Daily Clofazimine Daily PZA Daily Ethambutol Daily High dose INH Daily&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conventional arm is adopted from the NTP. Any changes by the NTP to the standard of care&#xD;
      will be mirrored in the conventional arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Endpoint: feasibility and impact of targeted genome sequencing to initiate more&#xD;
           than or equal to five effective TB drugs within 14 days of diagnosis (reference standard&#xD;
           phenotypic DST). Feasibility is a co-primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary efficacy endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  favourable outcome rate (time-specific 6, 12, 18, 24 month post treatment&#xD;
                initiation)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  time-specific rate of treatment failure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  time-specific culture conversion rates&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  time-specific relapse rate (including the 6 and 12 months of follow-up)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  time-specific rates of resistance amplification&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  adverse event rates&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  cost effectiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We estimate that the proportion of patients receiving effective treatment (at least 5 drugs&#xD;
      started within 14 days) will be ~47% and ~82% in the conventional and intervention arms,&#xD;
      respectively (rounded off conservatively to 50% and 80%; see Table 4 below for a summary&#xD;
      readout representing detailed drug-specific calculations based on published data from several&#xD;
      seminal studies(1-5)). Individualized therapy in the intervention arm, based on appropriate&#xD;
      sequencing readouts, and the availability of susceptibility readouts for ethambutol and&#xD;
      pyrazinamide will greatly reduce ineffective drugs and allow effective alternatives to be&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the assumptions outlined in Table 5, a sample size of 100 patients will allow us to&#xD;
      detect a 30% difference in the primary outcome between the arms assuming 95% confidence, and&#xD;
      80% power, considering a 10% loss to follow-up rate, and an additional 1% allowance for&#xD;
      interim analysis (performed after 50 patients are recruited). We feel that a 30% difference&#xD;
      is what would be required to be meaningful clinically in terms of outcome relative to&#xD;
      resource investment. We have designed a multistage trial and the sample size calculations for&#xD;
      the stages to determine the six-month favourable outcome rate, and six-month culture&#xD;
      conversion rate, and twelve-month favourable outcome rate are shown in Table 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both arms will recruit 1:1 with the duration of treatment being 9-11 months (or 18-20&#xD;
      months), regardless of the arm that the participant may be assigned to. The follow up will be&#xD;
      a total duration of 12 months for both arms after treatment completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical and management considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Informed consent will be obtained from all patients. The consent form will be translated&#xD;
      into the relevant local languages and interpreters made available where necessary. Data will&#xD;
      be kept confidential and password-protected, with all personal identifiers removed from&#xD;
      research-related information. The patients will be given the option to withdraw from the&#xD;
      study at any time. Pregnant patients will not be enrolled. There will be no gender bias&#xD;
      during the conduct of the study. This study will not discriminate against HIV-infected&#xD;
      persons and will recruit both HIV-infected and uninfected persons. Newly diagnosed&#xD;
      HIV-infected participants will be commenced on ARV treatment using either nevirapine or a&#xD;
      lopinavir/ritonavir combination with two other NRTI's (for compatibility with bedaquiline).&#xD;
      HIV-infected participants already on alternative ARV treatment regimens will be changed to&#xD;
      the above-mentioned regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (v) Participants whose MDR-TB treatment has failed: In the conventional arm, management of&#xD;
      failed MDR-TB treatment will be as per the NTP guidelines (with guidance from the provincial&#xD;
      and national committees). In the interventional arm, participants where treatment has failed&#xD;
      will be referred to the NTP and presented at the provincial and national committees with&#xD;
      recommendations based on the extended DST pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (vi) Management of cases of relapse and re-infection in either treatment arm: As per cases&#xD;
      with treatment failure.&#xD;
