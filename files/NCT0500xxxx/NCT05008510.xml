      To compare the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The efficacy of sabizabulin monotherapy to sacituzumab govitecan-hziy monotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy/sabizabulin combination therapy to&#xD;
           sacituzumab govitecan-hziy monotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      These comparisons will be made in the efficacy in the treatment of metastatic triple negative&#xD;
      breast cancer (mTNBC) in patients previously treated with at least two systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapies for metastatic disease as measured by radiographic progression free survival&#xD;
      (rPFS) as the primary endpoint.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stage 1: This is a safety run-in portion of the study for the combination therapy. Three&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled into Stage 1 of the study to receive sacituzumab govitecan-hziy for&#xD;
      injection + sabizabulin 32 mg. Dosing with sabizabulin should be within 1 hour prior to&#xD;
      initiation of the sacituzumab govitecan-hziy infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed for 21 days. Samples for assessment of pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      sacutizumab (in the Control Treated Group and TS Combination Group), and sabizabulin (in the&#xD;
      Sabizabulin Treated Group and TS Combination Group) will be collected on Day 1 (prior to&#xD;
      dosing and within 1 hour after the sacituzumab govitecan-hziy infusion has been completed in&#xD;
      Stage 1 and Stage 2, Cycle 1 only), Day 3 (prior to dosing with sabizabulin, Stage 1, Cycle 1&#xD;
      only), and Day 8 (prior to dosing and within 1 hour after the sacituzumab govitecan-hziy&#xD;
      infusion has been completed in Stage 1 and Stage 2, Cycle 1 only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of Stage 1 is to demonstrate an acceptable safety profile of the&#xD;
      combination therapy regimen that is planned for Stage 2 of the protocol. If an acceptable&#xD;
      safety profile and no unacceptable drug related adverse event is observed in Stage 1, then&#xD;
      Stage 2 will be initiated as designed. If an unacceptable drug related adverse event is&#xD;
      observed in one patient in the combination treatment group in Stage 1, then an additional 3&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled to the combination treatment arm. If 2 out of 3 or 2 out of 6&#xD;
      patients experience an unacceptable drug related adverse event in Stage 1, then the&#xD;
      combination treatment regimen will not be dosed in Stage 2 of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: This study is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, three treatment-arm, efficacy&#xD;
      and safety study. Subjects will be randomized to the three treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to the sacituzumab govitecan-hziy monotherapy,&#xD;
      sabizabulin monotherapy, and the sacituzumab govitecan-hziy/sabizabulin combination therapy&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the Sabizabulin Treated Group and sacituzumab govitecan-hziy/sabizabulin&#xD;
      Combination Group will receive sabizabulin 32 mg per day orally until radiographic&#xD;
      progression (blinded independent central read) in observed. Subjects in the Control Treated&#xD;
      Group and in the sacituzumab govitecan-hziy/sabizabulin Combination Group will receive&#xD;
      sacituzumab govitecan-hziy using the dose and dosing regimen defined in the FDA approved&#xD;
      prescribing information for the treatment of mTNBC until radiographic progression in&#xD;
      observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint of the study will be the median rPFS. Subjects will continue&#xD;
      study treatment until disease progression confirmed by blinded independent central reader&#xD;
      (BICR) is observed. A follow up visit will occur approximately 30 days after last dose of&#xD;
      study drug.&#xD;
