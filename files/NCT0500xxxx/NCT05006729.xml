      The Boston University Medical Campus (BUMC) will serve as the site for the RURAL Study&#xD;
      Coordinating Center, led by PI Vasan Ramachandran, MD, and the Pulmonary Core, led by George&#xD;
      O'Connor, MD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary function of the Study Coordinating Center (SCC) is to serve as an administrative&#xD;
      liaison between all of the RURAL study's cores. The SCC schedules, facilitates, and hosts,&#xD;
      all RURAL meetings including preparation for Observational Study Monitoring Board (OSMB)&#xD;
      meetings, and maintains direct communication with the study's program officers at NHLBI. The&#xD;
      SCC monitors the overall progress of RURAL and keeps all RURAL cores abreast of study updates&#xD;
      through meetings, emails, newsletters. It also maintains the official RURAL website and&#xD;
      serves as an administrator for investigators seeking to collaborate with RURAL through the&#xD;
      submission of Ancillary Studies. The SCC will have no direct interaction with any&#xD;
      participants, nor will it have access to identifiable data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RURAL pulmonary core's primary function will be to read the daily Pulmonary Function&#xD;
      Tests (PFTs) performed by participants at each of RURAL's recruiting sites (Alabama,&#xD;
      Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi). The BUMC Pulmonary Core investigators will receive&#xD;
      de-identified data on a daily basis sent by the Statistical Data Coordinating Center at the&#xD;
      University of Pennsylvania and will provide a clinical interpretation for each test and&#xD;
      &quot;score&quot; the results for quality assurance purposes. Although the Pulmonary Core investigators&#xD;
      will not have direct interaction with any participants, in rare circumstances, there may be a&#xD;
      need to review identifiable results in the case of a medical emergency at one of the&#xD;
      recruiting sites. The pulmonary core will also provide training for all staff who will carry&#xD;
      out PFTs.&#xD;

      The Risk Underlying Rural Areas Longitudinal (RURAL) Cohort is a health research project that&#xD;
      plans to enroll approximately 4,600 adults in ten rural counties throughout Alabama (AL),&#xD;
      Kentucky (KY), Louisiana (LA), and Mississippi (MS). The ten specific counties are: Dallas&#xD;
      County, AL; Wilcox County, AL; Boyle County, KY; Perry County, KY; Garrard County, KY;&#xD;
      Breathitt County, KY; Assumption Parish, LA; Franklin Parish, LA; Oktibbeha County, MS; and&#xD;
      Panola County, MS. The study will help to better understand health and disease in these rural&#xD;
      areas. The information gathered in this study will help build future health programs to&#xD;
      improve the health of local people in your community, which may promote healthier lives.&#xD;
      Several different aspects of the participants' health will be examined including heart and&#xD;
      lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Broad goals of the RURAL Cohort Study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identifying the frequency of and risk factors for heart and lung diseases in the RURAL&#xD;
           communities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identifying unique factors contributing to health disorders in these communities -&#xD;
           including psychosocial, economic, and familial factors - and how they interact together&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identifying potential solutions by examining differences between higher and lower risk&#xD;
           rural counties&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings from the RURAL study will inform health care providers, participants, researchers&#xD;
      and the community regarding the frequency, burden, determinants, and prognosis of heart,&#xD;
      lung, blood, and sleep diseases in the rural South, provide new knowledge that is critical&#xD;
      for rural implementation science, and set the stage for collaborative opportunities for a&#xD;
      wider community of scientists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the RURAL Study will receive information on different areas of their health,&#xD;
      including their heart and lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will visit participants in their communities to complete a research exam about&#xD;
      heart and lung health. To get started, investigators will first speak with participants over&#xD;
      the phone or by computer for a baseline visit. After this visit, participants will receive a&#xD;
      Fitbit [activity tracker] device and a RURAL cell phone app that will be used to collect&#xD;
      information about their health and lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then attend an in-person exam at the RURAL study mobile exam vehicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive results from their research exam, which they can also share with&#xD;
      their doctor. The RURAL Study team will refer participants to a health center if there are&#xD;
      immediate health concerns found during the research exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RURAL Study follows all HIPAA rules and regulations, in addition to the NIH and&#xD;
      institutional guidelines, for the protection of all research participants. No information&#xD;
      from the study that could identify a participant will be publicly shared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the baseline visit, participants will answer surveys about their medical history,&#xD;
      lifestyle, and other health-related factors. The baseline visit will take about 35 to 50&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline visit, The RURAL study team will track participants' physical activity&#xD;
      using the provided Fitbit device. The RURAL health team will also ask questions about overall&#xD;
      health and lifestyle through the RURAL cell phone app. Participants will receive a kit to&#xD;
      measure environmental and health factors in your home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visit in the mobile exam vehicle will take about 3 hours and will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs including height and weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interviews and surveys asking about lifestyle and health history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests related to heart, lung, and blood vessel health&#xD;
