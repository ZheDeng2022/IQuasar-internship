    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR3680 plus androgen&#xD;
      deprivation therapy (ADT) vs. placebo plus ADT in patients with high-risk localized or&#xD;
      locally advanced prostate cancer using pathologic complete response (pCR) rate and&#xD;
      metastasis-free survival (MFS).&#xD;
