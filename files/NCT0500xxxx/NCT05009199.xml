      The overall goal of this protocol is to evaluate the binding of caffeine to adenosine A2A&#xD;
      receptors in the brain of participants at risk for developing PD. The specific objectives&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics of multiple doses of oral&#xD;
           caffeine on striatal binding of the adenosine A2A receptor ligand [18F]MNI-444.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 3 doses of the positron emission tomography&#xD;
           (PET) radiotracer, [18F]MNI-444.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of oral caffeine in this&#xD;
           paradigm.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants are eligible for inclusion in this study only if they meet all of the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is able to provide written informed consent, which must be obtained before&#xD;
             any assessment is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants must not be of childbearing potential, or if they are of&#xD;
             childbearing potential, must agree to use contraception and not donate eggs. At the&#xD;
             discretion of the Investigator, participants without documentation of non-childbearing&#xD;
             potential may receive pregnancy testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal,&#xD;
                  has not reached a postmenopausal state (12 continuous months of amenorrhea with&#xD;
                  no identified cause other than menopause), and is not permanently infertile due&#xD;
                  to surgery (ie, removal of ovaries, fallopian tubes, and/or uterus, tubal&#xD;
                  ligation) or another cause as determined by the Investigator (eg, Müllerian&#xD;
                  agenesis).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of childbearing potential must commit to remain abstinent (refrain from&#xD;
                  heterosexual intercourse) or use 2 forms of birth control, 1 of which is a&#xD;
                  barrier contraception method, for the duration of the study and 30 days after&#xD;
                  study completion. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of childbearing potential must commit to not donate ovum for the duration&#xD;
                  of the study and 30 days after study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male participants with partners of childbearing potential must commit to the use of 2&#xD;
             methods of contraception, 1 of which is a barrier method for male participants for the&#xD;
             study duration and 90 days after study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male participants must not donate sperm for the study duration and for 90 days after&#xD;
             study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to cooperate with study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and females aged ≥ 30 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy with no clinically relevant finding on physical examination at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No personal history of clinically significant neurologic and/or psychiatric disorders,&#xD;
             including PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No history of dopamine transporter deficit on DaTscan for any previously acquired&#xD;
             DaTscan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No cognitive impairment as judged by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a sequence variation in the LRKK2 gene that is a genetic risk factor for the&#xD;
             development of PD (based on previous genetic testing in medical history).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants fulfilling any of the following criteria are not eligible for inclusion in&#xD;
        this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or prior history of any alcohol or drug abuse in the past 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory tests with clinically significant abnormalities and/or clinically&#xD;
             significant unstable medical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has received an investigational drug within 30 days or five half-lives&#xD;
             prior to the baseline assessments, whichever is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior participation in other research protocols or clinical care during the past year&#xD;
             that would result in radiation exposure to an effective radiation dose exceeding the&#xD;
             acceptable annual limit established by the US Federal Guidelines (effective dose of 50&#xD;
             mSv, including the procedures in this clinical protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant, lactating or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of clinically significant gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal,&#xD;
             hematological, neoplastic, endocrine, alternative neurological, immunodeficiency,&#xD;
             pulmonary, or other disorder or disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unsuitable veins for repeated venipuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Brain MRI with clinically significant structural abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a medical condition or takes a medication likely to interfere with assessment of&#xD;
             brain A2A receptor levels by PET in the opinion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Implants such as implanted cardiac pacemakers or defibrillators, insulin pumps,&#xD;
             cochlear implants, metallic ocular foreign body, implanted neural stimulators, CNS&#xD;
             aneurysm clips and other medical implants that have not been certified for MRI, or&#xD;
             history of claustrophobia in MRI, unless a previous MRI is used.&#xD;
