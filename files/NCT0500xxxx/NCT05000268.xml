  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the literature, there are studies examining the effects of telerehabilitation on&#xD;
      individuals who have had COVID-19, but studies examining the effects on healthcare workers&#xD;
      who have experienced COVID-19 are insufficient. In this study, which is planned to be done,&#xD;
      it is aimed to examine the effects of myofascial relaxation technique on pain and other&#xD;
      symptoms through telerehabilitation. The aim of the study is to examine the effects of&#xD;
      myofascial relaxation technique applied with the telerehabilitation method on pain level,&#xD;
      anxiety, depression, sleep, fatigue and kinesiophobia in healthcare workers with and without&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection with pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a disease caused by severe acute coronavirus 2 infection and declared as a&#xD;
      pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. In the period from March 11,&#xD;
      when the first case was announced in Turkey, to the present day, the total number of cases&#xD;
      has exceeded 2.3 million. COVID-19 is mainly transmitted by air droplets, aerosols and direct&#xD;
      contact, and asymptomatic carriers are the main reason for rapid spread. While many&#xD;
      professional groups are working at home during the pandemic process; the risk of contracting&#xD;
      COVID-19 has increased, especially in healthcare workers working in high-risk departments of&#xD;
      hospitals where COVID-19 patients are treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with symptoms such as fever, dry cough and shortness of breath, common musculoskeletal&#xD;
      problems such as muscle pain, joint pain and fatigue, anxiety, depression and deterioration&#xD;
      in sleep quality have been observed in COVID-19 patients. It can take weeks to get over the&#xD;
      COVID-19 disease; however, some symptoms persist even after the infection has cleared. The&#xD;
      continuation of physical, cognitive and psychological problems in COVID-19 patients&#xD;
      recovering from the acute phase of the disease is called 'Post-COVID-19 Syndrome'. A good&#xD;
      evaluation and treatment is required to prevent these symptoms in individuals with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telerehabilitation refers to providing rehabilitation services using electronic communication&#xD;
      technologies. In the current pandemic process, the use of telerehabilitation has increased&#xD;
      all over the world to help patients without compromising the social distance rule. There is&#xD;
      no need for protective equipment as there is no physical contact during telerehabilitation&#xD;
      sessions. As a result, patient satisfaction and treatment efficiency are increased by&#xD;
      enabling more effective and natural human interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, there are studies examining the effects of telerehabilitation on&#xD;
      individuals who have had COVID-19, but studies examining the effects on healthcare workers&#xD;
      who have experienced COVID-19 are insufficient. In this study, which is planned to be done,&#xD;
      it is aimed to examine the effects of myofascial relaxation technique on pain and other&#xD;
      symptoms through telerehabilitation. The aim of the study is to examine the effects of&#xD;
      myofascial relaxation technique applied with the telerehabilitation method on pain level,&#xD;
      anxiety, depression, sleep, fatigue and kinesiophobia in healthcare workers with and without&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be divided into two groups as those with pain after COVID-19 infection and those with pain not related to COVID-19 infection. Both groups will be applied telerehabilitation methods, progressive myofascial relaxation techniques and simple posture correction exercises every other day for 2 weeks. Progressive myofascial relaxation exercises will be asked to do morning and evening while lying in bed. Posture exercises will be required to perform while standing, at least 2 or 3 sets during work.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The intensity of pain felt by individuals in their muscles and joints will be evaluated with a visual analog scale. The Visual Analog Scale is scored from 0 to 10. On this scale, &quot;0&quot; indicates no pain, &quot;10&quot; indicates unbearable severity.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quality will be assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. This questionnaire is a 19-item scale that assesses sleep quality and disturbance over the past month. A total score of less than 5 indicates good sleep quality. A total score greater than 5 indicates that sleep quality is impaired.</description>
