      Prospective single arm, single center observational study to evaluate factors which were&#xD;
      easily available from preoperative examination for predicting therapeutic effects and&#xD;
      clinical prognosis of hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) for hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma. There factors are collected in preoperative routine blood examination,&#xD;
      preoperative radiological imaging and pathological examination. Patients which are diagnosed&#xD;
      with locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will receive standard HAIC and follow-up&#xD;
      exclusively as routinely done.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a global health challenge and its incidence is growing&#xD;
      worldwide. About 60%-70% of HCC patients were locally advanced or metastatic disease at the&#xD;
      initial diagnosis, with a poor prognosis causing by unavailability of potentially curative&#xD;
      therapies. Therefore, treatments that can control the progression and improve the prognosis&#xD;
      of advanced HCC are under great need in sufficient liver reservation. Recent studies have&#xD;
      shown that hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) is beneficial to patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced HCC. These studies have demonstrated that HAIC is superior to Sorafinib for&#xD;
      the treatment of HCC with PVTT, whereas Sorafinib is recommended as first line treatment for&#xD;
      locally advanced HCC. Therefore, HAIC is an important treatment option for locally advanced&#xD;
      HCC. However, current tumor staging and prediction models for predicting the prognosis of&#xD;
      HAIC for HCC is still unconvincing, and we found that some factors which were easily&#xD;
      available from routine preoperative examination might be related to therapeutic effects and&#xD;
      prognosis of HAIC for HCC. Thus, this prospective observational study aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      value of these indicators for predicting therapeutic effects and prognosis of HAIC for HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard procedure for HAIC is that femoral artery puncture and catheterization are&#xD;
      performed in every cycle of treatment, a micro-catheter is inserted and located in feeding&#xD;
      hepatic artery. The therapeutic scheme is modified FOLFOX6 regimens including oxaliplatin&#xD;
      (130 mg/m2 infusion for 3 hours on day 1), leucovorin (200 mg/m2 from hour 3 to 5 on day 1)&#xD;
      and Fluorouracil (400 mg/m2 in bolus, and then 2,400 mg/m2 continuous infusion 46 hours). All&#xD;
      chemo-drugs are given by HAI. Treatment was repeated every 3 weeks and continued until&#xD;
      intrahepatic lesions progression or unacceptable toxicity. Enhanced CT or MRI was performed&#xD;
      every 6 weeks after treatment begins. Routine follow-up intervals were 2-4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment, each patient will undergo routine hematological examinations which include&#xD;
      blood routine, biochemical routine, coagulation routine, HCC related tumor markers. A&#xD;
      three-phases enhanced CT or MR scan and biopsy of intrahepatic mass are performed before&#xD;
      HAIC. Some factors through these examinations are collected and used to evaluate the relation&#xD;
      of postoperative response rate and survival.&#xD;
