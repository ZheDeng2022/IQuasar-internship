  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MANTRA is a prospective, multiple-arm, multi-center, global, post-market clinical follow-up&#xD;
      study. The main objective is to monitor ongoing safety and performance of the CORCYM devices&#xD;
      and accessories used for aortic, mitral and tricuspid valvular diseases in a real-world&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corcym S.r.l., is a medical device manufacturer with a broad product portfolio for cardiac&#xD;
      surgeons, offering solutions for the treatment of aortic, mitral and tricuspid valve disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MANTRA Master Plan (Master Protocol) is intended as an overarching Umbrella Protocol that&#xD;
      allows multiple sub-studies to be added, as needed. The Umbrella Master Protocol concept&#xD;
      offers an excellent solution to provide post-marketing clinical follow-up information on the&#xD;
      entire cardiac surgery heart valve portfolio of the sponsor in a common database, including&#xD;
      corelab assessment of hemodynamic and structural performance, annular motion and Dynamics for&#xD;
      one of the products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, three sub-studies are planned:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MANTRA - Aortic Sub-Study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MANTRA - Mitral/Tricuspid Sub-Study (Excluding Memo 4D)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MANTRA - Memo 4D Sub-Study&#xD;

      The MANTRA Master Plan (Master Protocol) is intended as an overarching Umbrella Protocol that&#xD;
      allows multiple substudies to be added, as needed. The Umbrella Master Protocol concept&#xD;
      offers an excellent solution to provide post-marketing clinical follow-up information on the&#xD;
      entire cardiac surgery heart valve portfolio of the sponsor in a common database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, three substudies are planned:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MANTRA - Aortic Sub-Study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MANTRA - Mitral/Tricuspid Sub-Study (excluding Memo 4D)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MANTRA - Memo 4D Sub-Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the studies assembled under the master protocol is the continued collection of&#xD;
      safety and performance data during heart valve procedures and the relevant follow-up visits&#xD;
      in subjects where any of the CORCYM devices and accessories are used in a real-world setting,&#xD;
      in accordance with the IFUs, and at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MANTRA study is expected to enroll approximately 1750 subjects in up to 100 sites worldwide:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 1250 subjects considered suitable for treatment with a CORCYM aortic&#xD;
           device&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 300 subjects considered suitable for treatment with a CORCYM mitral and/or&#xD;
           tricuspid device (excluding Memo 4D)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 200 subjects considered suitable for treatment with Memo 4D&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected enrollment duration may vary across the different projects. Subject follow-up is&#xD;
      planned at discharge, 30 days after implantation and then annually up to 10 years. Sites can&#xD;
      choose to participate in one or more sub-studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All available data shall be gathered during standard medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a minimum, the following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening/Baseline data, including demographics and medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedural data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalization and Discharge data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up data: 30 days and annually up to 10 years post procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious Adverse Event and Device Deficiencies information&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the study, the subject will be asked to complete quality of life questionnaire(s)&#xD;
      at baseline, 30 days and at 1-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, for the MEMO 4D sub-study only, an Echocardiography Core Laboratory has been&#xD;
      appointed by the Sponsor to assess the hemodynamic and structural performance, annular motion&#xD;
      and dynamics, and 3D echocardiogram images (transesophageal during the procedure and&#xD;
      transthoracic during follow up) will be collected for Corelab readings.&#xD;
