  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite a strong evidence-base for the efficacy of multilevel programs in reducing asthma&#xD;
      symptoms among low-income preschool minority children, gaps remain in our understanding of&#xD;
      how to best translate and scale up these efficacious interventions into sustainable programs&#xD;
      that reduce known asthma health disparities.Head Start (HS) serves over one million low&#xD;
      income children in the US each year by focusing on early learning, physical health, and&#xD;
      family engagement. HS is committed to implementing evidence based programs to promote overall&#xD;
      child well-being, and is focused on addressing asthma symptoms due to the deleterious impact&#xD;
      on school absences and child development. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      multi-level staff and family education program (ABC Asthma) that significantly reduced asthma&#xD;
      symptoms and courses of oral corticosteroids. However, these interventions are not&#xD;
      successfully integrated within community organizations for long-term sustainability.It is&#xD;
      unknown how to best scale up and implement these evidence based asthma interventions into low&#xD;
      resource community organizations that serve children at risk. Implementation strategies are&#xD;
      frequently developed atheoretically and may not be tailored to the setting.The overall&#xD;
      purpose of this project is to inform best practices of implementation of an asthma education&#xD;
      program by 1) systematically evaluating the use of intervention mapping to develop a tailored&#xD;
      implementation strategy in partnership with Head Start stakeholders, 2) examining both staff&#xD;
      and organizational level determinants associated with implementation of ABC Asthma, and 3)&#xD;
      evaluating the success of tailored implementation strategies on implementation outcomes and&#xD;
      school absences and other health outcomes. The YMCA of Central Maryland have enthusiastically&#xD;
      agreed to implement the Maryland ABC HS Asthma within 40 sites in three communities:&#xD;
      Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and Anne Arundel County.&#xD;
