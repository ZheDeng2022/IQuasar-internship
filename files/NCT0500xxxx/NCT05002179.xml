      Echinaforce® Chewable tablets&quot;- Further, it is aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      study product for the prevention and treatment of respiratory tract infections in generally&#xD;
      healthy adults following a real-life setting. The study covers 2x2 + 1 month of prevention in&#xD;
      120 randomized participants following a tight sampling set-up for sensitive detection of&#xD;
      viral infections by RT-qPCR analysis of nasal swabs and seroconversion of SARS-CoV2 IgG/IgM&#xD;
      in serum samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study flyers are presented in waiting rooms at GPs/hospitals locally and study information is&#xD;
      forwarded via the study centre network to attract interest of potential participants.&#xD;
      Altogether, 140 participants shall be recruited (screened) by the study. Interested persons&#xD;
      shall be invited to the study centre for first informative visit 1 (V1). Participants&#xD;
      encountering acute symptoms during screening and/or run-in phase can be included as well. The&#xD;
      number of recurrences that can be treated and documented per participant during the time of&#xD;
      observation in this study is in principal unlimited. Participants are equipped with study&#xD;
      product and study diaries sufficient to encounter a max of 3 individual respiratory tract&#xD;
      infections &quot;RTI&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The commercially available study product &quot;Echinaforce Chewable &quot;EC&quot; tablets shall be compared&#xD;
      to no treatment in study participants that were randomized equally to the two study groups:&#xD;
      1) &quot;Treatment group&quot; and 2) &quot;no-treatment group&quot;. Participants assigned to the &quot;treatment&#xD;
      group&quot; are instructed to perform 2 consecutive prevention periods taking 3x2 EC tablets daily&#xD;
      for 2x2 months followed by a voluntary, 1 month follow up prevention in frame of this study.&#xD;
      After each 2 month prevention phase, participant interrupted prevention for 1 week before&#xD;
      starting with a new phase. Intake of regular preventive supplements is recorded as per eCRF&#xD;
      entries (V1-V7) and intake of co-medication to treat acute RTI symptoms as per study diary&#xD;
      entries. Participants should contact the study coordinator as soon as possible upon first&#xD;
      signs of acute cold-/flu like symptoms. The study coordinator confirms the symptoms and&#xD;
      instructs participants to start taking 5x2 instead of 3x2 EC tablets daily immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent Forms, individual e-CRFs accounts and paper study diaries, investigator&#xD;
      records, medical test results, and study product must be accessible at all times to study&#xD;
      monitors commissioned by the CRO (CONVEX CRO Ltd.) on behalf of and mandated by the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The monitor will review the data of the participants and the declared and signed informed&#xD;
      consent forms as well as all other study relevant notifications according to procedures&#xD;
      defined in the monitoring manual of this study. The monitor will also have access to the&#xD;
      source data and undertakes to maintain confidentiality at any time with special regard to&#xD;
      reviewed personal, de-anonymized participant data. The monitor assesses protocol deviations&#xD;
      of any kind and reports to responsible A. Vogel Clinical trial project manager (CTPM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, generally, healthy volunteers are to be included and the pharmacological&#xD;
      mode-of-action and effectiveness of the test medication, which is Echinaforce Chewable&#xD;
      tablets &quot;EC&quot;, to prevent from RTIs during phases of prevention assessed with regard to&#xD;
      self-diagnosed, usually self-limiting common colds/flu-like infections including infections&#xD;
      with SARS-CoV2. Additionally, asymptomatic courses of RTIs are assessed to give a more&#xD;
      comprehensive picture of preventive effectiveness. For most of the participants no medical&#xD;
      history at the trial center exists and due to the study design, a complete cross-section&#xD;
      comparison of e-CRF and participant files waived at the family doctor. With regard to the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria (e.g. existence of serious diseases such as autoimmune diseases or&#xD;
      degenerative diseases, it is assumed that the participants are aware of them and can name&#xD;
      correctly during screening at visit 1). Despite this, no additional comparison between the&#xD;
      participant's medical history stored at his doctors place and study centre filed e-CRF&#xD;
      accounts/printouts of e-CRF will take place (and vice versa). This also includes relevant&#xD;
      AEs/ADRs during the study as well as newly-diagnosed exclusion criteria (accompanying&#xD;
      illnesses) during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be monitored by the executing CRO's representative as specified in the&#xD;
      monitoring manual. The monitor will perform an initiation visit before the first participant&#xD;
      is screened, have regular contacts with the study site, including routine visits conducted&#xD;
      to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide information and support to the Investigator(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assure compliance with the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Verify that the research facilities, including laboratories and equipment, are adequate&#xD;
           to safely and properly conduct the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Verify that the investigational product is stored properly and under the proper&#xD;
           conditions, is in sufficient supply, and that receipt, use, and return of&#xD;
           investigational product are controlled and documented adequately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Verify that written informed consent was obtained before any protocol-specific screening&#xD;
           procedures are performed solely for the purpose of determining eligibility for the&#xD;
           clinical study and/or prior to the provision of study product.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review the CRFs and source documents to ensure that reported study data are accurate,&#xD;
           complete, and verifiable transferred from source documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ensure that adequate records of clinical trial supplies are maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Verify that the Investigator and study site personnel are adequately qualified&#xD;
           throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Verify that the safety information and amendments are submitted to the relevant&#xD;
           authorities and to sponsors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All checks that the data given in the eCRF complies with the source document will be carried&#xD;
      out in accordance with the study specific monitoring manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The monitor will be available between visits if the Investigator(s) or other staff at the&#xD;
      centre needs information and advice about the study conduct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the data base lock and approval from the Sponsor a close-out visit will be performed in&#xD;
      order to close the study at the site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The corresponding SOPs of the executing CRO as well as a study specific monitoring manual set&#xD;
      the guidelines applicable for carrying out the monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor or a delegate on his behalf, local authorities (Bulgarian drugs administration,&#xD;
      BDA) or the responsible ethics committee may inspect this study to reassure quality. The&#xD;
      inspectors must be granted access to all medical documents, study documents, correspondence&#xD;
      and declarations of consent of participants, which are deemed relevant. All parties involved&#xD;
      are to uphold the confidentiality regarding all de-anonymized participant data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source data/SDV:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source data are the original records of all variables collected for the clinical&#xD;
      investigation. They include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Original printouts of laboratory reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progress notes, Follow-up notes.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Evaluation checklists&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study product related records (dispensation, return, replacement, compliance, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Documentation of sample storage, processing and shipment. The Investigator must allow&#xD;
           the monitor access to all documents in the participant's study file to confirm their&#xD;
           consistency with the eCRF entries. All study data will be handled confidentially. No&#xD;
           information about participant identity on these documents will be allowed to leave the&#xD;
           study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the responsibility of the Investigator to maintain a comprehensive and centralized&#xD;
      filing system of all relevant documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Investigators will be instructed to retain all study records required by the Sponsor and&#xD;
      regulatory authorities in a secure and safe facility with limited access for one of the&#xD;
      following time periods based on notification from the Sponsor:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For a period of at least 2 years from the last marketing approval worldwide or for at&#xD;
           least 25 years, whichever is the greater&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Or a period of at least two years after discontinuation of clinical development of the&#xD;
           investigational product as confirmed by the Sponsor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For a longer period if required by local regulations The Investigator will be instructed&#xD;
           to consult with the Sponsor before disposal of any study records and to provide written&#xD;
           notification to the Sponsor of any change in the location, disposition, or custody of&#xD;
           the study files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor or its representative may visit the study facilities at any time in order to&#xD;
      maintain current and personal knowledge of the study through review of the records,&#xD;
      comparison with source documents, observation and discussion of the conduct and progress of&#xD;
      the study. The investigator will permit trial-related monitoring, audits, EC review and&#xD;
      regulatory inspections, providing direct access to source data and study documents&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data coding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The full details of procedures for data handling will be documented in the Data Management&#xD;
      Plan (DMP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AEs and medical history will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities&#xD;
      (MedDRA, version 17.1GE). Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unique numbers will identify the participant and the biological material obtained from the&#xD;
      participant. Appropriate measures such as encryption or deletion will be enforced to protect&#xD;
      the identity of human participants in all presentations and publications as required by&#xD;
      local/regional/national requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size calculation has been conducted on the main study parameter, which is the&#xD;
      incidence of RTIs during the time of observation. A difference between both study groups of&#xD;
      at least 20.5% will be recognized as significant clinically relevant (two-group Chi-square&#xD;
      test with a 0.05 two sided significance level) with a power of 80% with an incidence rate of&#xD;
      10% seen under active treatment and at least 60 participants included evaluable per study&#xD;
      group (chi²-test, nquery advisor 7.0). In addition, for the pharmacological parameters&#xD;
      assessed in the study it is estimated that 80% power is achieved with cross-sectional and&#xD;
      longitudinal sampling to detect CpG DNA methylation differences of 20%.Amendments to the&#xD;
      protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For planning the statistical analysis and reporting in this clinical study the ICH guidelines&#xD;
      for &quot;biostatistical methodology in clinical trials&quot; are taken into account. The details of&#xD;
      the statistical methodology (including the handling of missing and incorrect data) are&#xD;
      presented in detail in a separate statistical analysis plan (SAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive parameters are determined for assessed clinical variables. In addition to the&#xD;
      absolute and relative frequencies of the score values, the arithmetic mean, median, first and&#xD;
      third quartile (Q1 or Q3), standard deviation, minimum and maximum of the current value and&#xD;
      the changes in comparison between &quot;treatment group&quot; and &quot;no treatment group&quot;, are calculated.&#xD;
      All assessed target variables are exploratory evaluated using suitable test methods&#xD;
      (Mantel-Haenszel test for ordinal variables, Fisher's exact/Chi-Square test for dichotomous&#xD;
      or categorical variables and t-test or analysis of variance for quantitative target&#xD;
      variables) in the &quot;treatment group&quot; compared to &quot;no treatment group&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety assessment is based on the recording of adverse events (AEs), adverse drug&#xD;
      reactions (ADRs) as per entries in the e-CRF and ultimately the subjective assessment of&#xD;
      tolerability and acceptance by the study investigators and participants.&#xD;

    <description>The use of any regular preventive supplements in addition to EC tablets is assessed as per eCRF entries. Participants of both study groups are asked about the use of any such product during the time since last visit frequently during study centre visits. By asking if they have taken any preventive supplement regularly during the past month (at least every 2nd day or 2 weeks of the past month)?. The use concomitant medication/therapies for the treatment of acute symptoms of vRTI including antibiotics is assessed as per study diary entries and by asking participants upon study centre visits VA1, VA2, VA3, VA4 the question whether they took any medication/therapy to treat symptoms of vRTIs and if yes, which ones (full product name, dosing, duration) and to treat which symptoms?. The analysis is done by non-parametric chi-square endpoint analysis]</description>
