      Quality assurance of the laboratory examinations. Retrospective non-interventional study with&#xD;
      ThinPrep slides collected as part of the German Co-Screening Program for routine diagnostic.&#xD;
      These slides will retrospectively be used to validate the Hologic Genius Digital Cytology&#xD;
      (DC) system vs. the ThinPrep Imaging system (TIS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cause of cervical cancer is a persistent infection with high-risk types of human&#xD;
      papillomavirus (HPV). Cytology has been the gold standard for cervical screening since the&#xD;
      introduction of routine screening with the Pap test in the 1950s due to its effect on&#xD;
      mortality in regions with screening programs. Since that time, there have been several&#xD;
      technological advances (LBC, Imaging) to improve and automate cervical cytology, resulting in&#xD;
      increased disease detection and efficiency. The Hologic's Genius Digital Diagnostics System&#xD;
      is a CE-IVD (CE-marked in vitro diagnostic device) marked digital cytology platform. For&#xD;
      quality assurance and to retrospectively validate the Hologic Genius Digital Cytology (DC)&#xD;
      system selected slides earlier measured with TIS will be additionally reviewed with the&#xD;
      Genius Digital Diagnostic System in order to demonstrate clinical performance and efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hologic's Digital Image Analysis Algorithm uses AI to identify diagnostically relevant&#xD;
      objects of interest.Only anonymized results will be evaluated.&#xD;
