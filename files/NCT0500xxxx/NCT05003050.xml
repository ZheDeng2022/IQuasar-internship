    <textblock>
      Sleep difficulties have been identified as one of the most distressing symptoms for&#xD;
      adolescents with Chronic Liver Disease (CLD), Autoimmune Liver Disease (AILD) and Liver&#xD;
      Transplantation (LT), sleep difficulties have a direct negative impact on quality of life.&#xD;
      The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for this are complex. In addition Adolescents&#xD;
      with chronic illness tend to have a higher rate of mental health problems than the general&#xD;
      population. The complexity of sleep deprivation, fatigue, stress and anxiety, may well all be&#xD;
      contributory factors to these patients having poor adherence to their medication. This in&#xD;
      turn has a negative impact on the success of their tissue graft or indeed increases the&#xD;
      likelihood for transplant surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the risks of medication toxicity and dependency, there is a need for further research&#xD;
      to address the issues of insomnia, stress and anxiety with a non - pharmacological approach&#xD;
      for these Adolescent chronically ill patients. Meditation Based Practices and Energy&#xD;
      Therapies (Acupuncture) have gained robust scientific evidence over the last 20 years to&#xD;
      demonstrate their efficacy for patients with insomnia, stress and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to demonstrate the benefits of a non - touch Energy Therapy (ET) and a&#xD;
      Meditation Based Practice (MBP) to relieve symptoms of insomnia, stress and anxiety in&#xD;
      Adolescents with CLD, ALD and LT. The participants will be 16 - 24 years old. The&#xD;
      intervention will have 3 groups, Standard of Care Group, MBP and ET. The intervention will be&#xD;
      for 8 weeks with the ET and MBP group each receiving 1 hour of therapy each week for 8 weeks.&#xD;
      The data will be collected with questionnaires and actigraph wrist devices.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE The liver is a vital organ responsible for enabling our body to&#xD;
      digest food and rid itself of toxic substances. There are more than 100 types of liver&#xD;
      disease affecting both children and adults presenting with a wide variety of symptoms. Young&#xD;
      people (YP) with chronic illness tend to have a higher rate of mental health problems&#xD;
      compared to the general population, with psychosocial complex issues affecting adherence to&#xD;
      medication and resulting poorer health outcomes. Adolescents that have liver transplants (LT)&#xD;
      demonstrate an inferior success rate compared to children and adults across all solid organ&#xD;
      transplant groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This seems to be partially attributed to the high rate of non - adherence to medication which&#xD;
      is a common issue amongst this age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescence is the peak time for the onset of mental health problems with approximately 50%&#xD;
      of mental health illnesses appearing before the age of 14 years and 75% of mental health&#xD;
      problems developing before the age of 24 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rates of anxiety, depression and behaviour difficulties are further elevated in children and&#xD;
      adolescents with physical health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A diagnosis of Autoimmune liver disease (ALD) between the ages of 14 - 20 years has been&#xD;
      found to be independently predictive of liver related death or the need for liver&#xD;
      transplantation compared with other age groups. In view of organ shortages, avoiding&#xD;
      transplantation in these patients is a priority and focus on non - adherence (NA) to&#xD;
      medication in patients with ALD. The focus on minimising NA in ALD aims to prevent avoidable&#xD;
      transplantation and after LT aims to reduce graft loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hames aimed to identify from a large cohort of YP who had already received a LT having had&#xD;
      ALD and CLD their prevalence rates of anxiety and depression and factors associated with&#xD;
      this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patient's demonstrated, psychological stresses worry (30.2 %) and low self - esteem&#xD;
      (27.5%) among physical complaints almost 50% cited fatigue. Nearly 33% of participants also&#xD;
      cited sleep difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep difficulties have been identified as one of the most distressing symptoms for&#xD;
      adolescents with LT and they are negatively correlated with health related quality of life in&#xD;
      both children and adolescents. It has been, suggested psychological interventions for sleep&#xD;
      problems are highly effective and should be evaluated for this population as a priority.&#xD;
      Patients with CLD or patients who have had LT both cohorts exhibit sleep difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the potential for medication toxicity in these disabled patients further studies are&#xD;
      needed to address the potential role of non - drug therapies (eg. CBT, mindfulness, yoga). It&#xD;
      is not, recommended for these young people with chronic illness to then take medication for&#xD;
      insomnia due to toxicity risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insomnia and fatigue will affect school, home life, medical health and medication adherence.&#xD;
      There therefore is a true clinical need for complementary therapies to be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meditation and Energy associated therapies have shown efficacy with patients that have&#xD;
      chronic illness/ pain /insomnia. These complimentary therapies are often Eastern in origin&#xD;
      however during the last 30 years these therapies have been practiced and researched widely in&#xD;
      the UK, demonstrating efficacy in multiple dimensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meditation and Energy Therapy Meditation can be defined as a family of complex emotional and&#xD;
      attentional regulatory training regimes - developed for various ends including the&#xD;
      cultivation of wellbeing and emotional balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been an explosion of interest in mindfulness based programs such as Mindfulness&#xD;
      based stress reduction program (MBSR) and mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT) in the&#xD;
      last 2 decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MBSR has accrued a robust evidence base in improving mental health outcomes in those with&#xD;
      chronic physical health problems. MBCT is an adaptation of the MBSR program, developed to&#xD;
      teach those at risk of depressive relapse, skills to stay well and has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The durability of the MBSR program is notable, benefits have been obtained with no evidence&#xD;
      of adverse events with these findings, suggesting clinicians should consider recommending&#xD;
      MBSR to transplant recipients that are affected by these symptoms particularly anxiety and&#xD;
      poor sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those with chronic illness such as ALD and LT are more susceptible to stress and anxiety and&#xD;
      a higher prevalence of S&amp;A and depression in YP and is demonstrated by Hames at King's&#xD;
      College Hospital London. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although in its infancy in the 'Western World, Energy therapies are demonstrating they can&#xD;
      help as a valuable adjunct to traditional medical practices to enhance the recovery process&#xD;
      of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the family of energy therapies Acupuncture is the first wave, acupuncture is widely&#xD;
      practiced globally and within the UK and the NHS, for 30 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar to acupuncture Pranic Healing is an Energy Therapy with fundamental, principles and&#xD;
      beliefs akin to those in acupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Energy Therapy is based on the principle that energy flows freely throughout the body&#xD;
      via channels and again similarly to acupuncture, energy is removed from specific points&#xD;
      around the affected area that has stagnated energy and often causing pain. Removal of this&#xD;
      energy enables free flow to again resume and recovery to occur. Pranic Healing similar to&#xD;
      acupuncture follows exact protocols for each condition. It is a non - touch systematic&#xD;
      therapy. For each physiological and psychological condition there is an exact protocol that&#xD;
      must followed precisely for the treatment to be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture has proved itself to be effective for many chronic illnesses as an adjunct to&#xD;
      traditional medical practice and has been recognised as an alternative medical therapy for&#xD;
      insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there is a real need to provide complementary non pharmacological therapy for YP with&#xD;
      liver disease, insomnia and its associated difficulties. T'his study is justified in&#xD;
      evaluating 2 complementary therapies that are non-pharmacological, akin in approach to&#xD;
      recognised and utilised complementary therapies already in practice in the NHS (MBSR and&#xD;
      Acupuncture ) The aspiration being that YP with ALD / LT suffering with insomnia, stress and&#xD;
      anxiety will have improvements in their symptoms in turn improving their quality of life and&#xD;
      adherence to medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To give these patients an opportunity to experience a therapy that is non -&#xD;
           pharmacological&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To experience inner peace and relaxation during these sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To improve sleep quality for these patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To reduce stress and anxiety within the body&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To reduce fatigue&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To improve their overall wellbeing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To encourage them to feel more positive within their lives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To improve their adherence to medication&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY This study is an experimental, longitudinal study&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the efficacy of 2 non pharmacological complementary therapies for&#xD;
      patients with ALD, CLD, LT, sleep difficulties, stress and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANT SAMPLE All participants are registered patients at King's College Hospital&#xD;
      Paediatric liver, GI and Nutrition Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size 10 patients for each group - 3 groups Both genders Ages 16- 24 years All&#xD;
      participants will have received a LT or have some form of CLD and will be selected from the&#xD;
      KCH patient data base, all interviews and treatment sessions will be conducted at KCH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive an information letter and patient participation sheet via post.&#xD;
      Interested participants will have a one - hour information session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that are eligible will then have baseline characteristics assessed and be allocated&#xD;
      to one of the 3 participant groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meditation Based Practice Energy Therapy -Pranic Healing Standard of Care&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will continue with their routine care, medication and treatment at KCH. The,&#xD;
      three groups will run parallel and independent of each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomised control trial. BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS -will be, taken prior to the&#xD;
      intervention. PARTICIPANT INFORMATION - participation information sheet, an information&#xD;
      booklet explaining what will happen during the intervention, a sleep hygiene information&#xD;
      sheet, Actigraphy watches (Fitbit). Participants will be requested to wear this for 2 weeks&#xD;
      prior to the intervention, throughout the intervention and for 2 weeks afterwards and again&#xD;
      at 3 months for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION Subjective data - Questionnaires, sleep diary and calendar for both groups.&#xD;
      Questionnaires - will be completed prior to the intervention, at the end of 8 weeks and again&#xD;
      at 3 months The IMPARTS (Integrated mental and physical healthcare Research: Training&#xD;
      Services) System contains a core set of measures, these will form part of the questionnaires&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. PHQ9&#xD;

           benefit of sleep medication and daytime dysfunction Sleep diary - A sleep diary is&#xD;
           attached, participants to complete each morning for 8 weeks Objective data Actigraphy -&#xD;
           To record sleep, and record movements that can be used to estimate sleep parameters.&#xD;
           Measurements will be TST - total sleep time WASO- wake after sleep onset. Deep sleep and&#xD;
           light Sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEDICATION - Documentation of patient's medication dose and frequency prior to intervention&#xD;
      will be recorded and continue in the normal way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMISATION - Participants will be, randomly allocated to one of the three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 blank envelopes, within each will have one of the three groups stated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Meditation Based practice - Pranic Healing - Standard of Care The envelopes will be&#xD;
           sealed and blank. Placed into a closed box. Recruitment lead will pick out an envelope&#xD;
           for the participants and they will be, allocated to the group named on the inside of the&#xD;
           envelope. Once participants have been, allocated to one of the three groups, they will&#xD;
           then, be given the relevant information and support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SESSION DESIGN MEDITATION BASED PRACTICE Participants will meet the meditation teacher prior&#xD;
      to the intervention and have the opportunity to ask any questions. They will be given&#xD;
      booklets explaining the techniques and benefits of the techniques which the will be carried&#xD;
      out in each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home practice in between sessions is encouraged, with CDs of the meditations. Each session&#xD;
      will be one hour each week, the sessions will be online/virtual for 8 consecutive weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be, given sleep diaries to complete each morning and actigraph watches The&#xD;
      sessions will always contain the same elements. There will be 3- 5 participants in each group&#xD;
      PRANIC HEALING Participants will have the opportunity to meet the therapist prior to the&#xD;
      intervention and have the opportunity to ask any questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be, given a booklet explaining energy therapy and its benefits, a calendar&#xD;
      with the dates and times of the sessions, sleep diaries to complete each morning, actigraph&#xD;
      watches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The session will be one hour each week for 8 weeks consecutively The session will be 1:1&#xD;
      Participant will sit in a comfortable chair The therapist will carry out exact protocols for&#xD;
      sleep, stress and anxiety. The treatment session is painless, non - invasive and non- touch.&#xD;
      STANDARD OF CARE Participants will have their data recorded in the same way as above. Routine&#xD;
      medical care will continue with no intervention. All will be offered both therapies after 8&#xD;
