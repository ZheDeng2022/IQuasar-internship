  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will measure affective, neurocognitive and behavioral&#xD;
      outcomes related to chronic use of opioids and benzodiazepines (screening phase), and in&#xD;
      response to the administration of the opioid morphine, the benzodiazepine alprazolam,&#xD;
      morphine then alprazolam, alprazolam then morphine, morphine+alprazolam simultaneously, and&#xD;
      placebo (laboratory pharmacology experiment). The latter will enable the investigators to&#xD;
      assess the effects of an opioid alone, benzodiazepine alone, concurrent and simultaneous&#xD;
      administration of opioid+benzodiazepine, relative to a placebo control.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose that benzodiazepine/opioid polysubstance abuse is perpetuated by a&#xD;
      dual-deficit in affective/hedonic regulation (difficulties modulating emotional reactions&#xD;
      relative to the context and the person's long-term goals). Furthermore, the investigators&#xD;
      propose that this dual-deficit biases neurocognition (interferes with executive function) and&#xD;
      behaviors (guided by negative reinforcement processes such that polysubstance use acutely&#xD;
      blunts aversive states and directs actions away from natural rewards). The scientific premise&#xD;
      for this project builds on George Koob's foundational concept that addiction is a&#xD;
      'reward-deficit/stress-surfeit disorder'. There is an urgent need to obtain clinical&#xD;
      pharmacology and mechanistic data to test this hypothesis of dual-deficit in&#xD;
      affective/hedonic regulation. This study will use human laboratory methods to test affective,&#xD;
      neurocognitive and behavioral mechanisms that maintain benzodiazepine/opioid polysubstance&#xD;
      abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening phase of this human laboratory study will include measures of affective&#xD;
      dysregulation related to benzodiazepine/opioid polysubstance use behaviors. These include&#xD;
      distress tolerance, pain sensitivity and nocebo responding, and biomarkers (e.g. plasma&#xD;
      cortisol). Also, the investigators will include behavioral measures of drug and non-drug&#xD;
      reinforcement (e.g. economic simulations of price elasticity of alprazolam and morphine) and&#xD;
      neurocognition (e.g. drug attentional bias, response inhibition, cognitive flexibility).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the pharmacology study the investigators will administer oral placebo, morphine alone&#xD;
      and alprazolam doses alone, as well as morphine and alprazolam sequentially (in&#xD;
      counterbalanced order) and simultaneously. Following each drug administration, the&#xD;
      investigators will measure responses in affective (e.g. anxiety levels, distress tolerance),&#xD;
      neurocognitive (e.g. executive function, learning) and behavioral domains (e.g. impulsivity,&#xD;
      psychomotor function, reinforcer preferences). The lab study is highly significant because we&#xD;
      lack prospective, controlled, dose-response studies that identify whether opioids,&#xD;
      benzodiazepines, and their combination modulate core phenotypes that underlie this harmful&#xD;
      polysubstance abuse. Testing effects of both sequential and simultaneous&#xD;
      benzodiazepine/opioid administration within the same individuals will establish a firm&#xD;
      foundation for understanding which phenotypes are sensitive to disruption and may respond to&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings from this study will help to focus clinical assessment and identify mechanisms that&#xD;
      maintain benzodiazepine/opioid polysubstance abuse, toward the development of novel&#xD;
      medication-assisted, evidence-based psychosocial interventions.&#xD;

    <description>Intensity and elasticity of drug demand. This is measured by having the participant make a series of independent choices as to how many drug units s/he will purchase across a range of (low to high) unit prices. Demand intensity is the drug purchase amount at the lowest non-zero price. Demand intensity is the calculated point on the price/purchasing curve where the slope (in log/log space) equals -1 (i.e. 'tipping point' where purchasing decreases more rapidly than the rate of increase in drug price).</description>
