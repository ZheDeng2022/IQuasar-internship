    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea is a common under-diagnosed medical disorder, and moderate to severe disease is&#xD;
      found in approximately 9% of men and 4% of women. The disease is characterized by repetitive&#xD;
      collapse of the airway during sleep, causing sleep disruption, episodic low oxygen levels,&#xD;
      and daytime sleepiness. Also, patients with sleep apnea are at high risk of developing&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (including strokes and heart attacks). Partly, this is because the&#xD;
      episodic low oxygen levels followed by higher oxygen levels due to sleep apnea results in the&#xD;
      generation of reactive oxygen species (unstable and potentially toxic substances caused by&#xD;
      interactions with oxygen) and a state of &quot;oxidative stress.&quot; Oxidative stress is an important&#xD;
      contributing factor to heart disease. We are interested in determining whether treatment with&#xD;
      antioxidants, which are substances that help reduce oxidative stress, helps cardiovascular&#xD;
      health in patients with sleep apnea. Specifically, we want to determine whether treatment&#xD;
      improves blood vessel function (an early sign of heart disease), and blood/urine markers of&#xD;
      cardiac risk (i.e., inflammation and oxidative stress).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty adult patients with moderate to severe sleep apnea will be asked to participate. They&#xD;
      will have their blood vessel function measured with a non-invasive finger probe, and&#xD;
      blood/urine will be collected to measure the cardiac risk markers. Patients will then be&#xD;
      'randomized' to one of two groups: 50% chance that the patient will be asked to take an&#xD;
      antioxidant, and a 50% chance that they will be asked to take a placebo tablet (though he/she&#xD;
      will not know which one they are taking). After 8 weeks, blood vessel function and markers&#xD;
      will be remeasured to determine if antioxidants help patients with sleep apnea.&#xD;

      Purpose: To determine whether treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients with a&#xD;
      potent oral antioxidant (alpha lipoic acid, ALA) improves cardiovascular health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective of the study is to assess the impact of ALA on endothelial&#xD;
      function (primary outcome). We will also assess whether ALA improves systemic inflammation&#xD;
      and markers of oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and consequent oxidative&#xD;
      stress results in tissue damage and activation of inflammation, and is a recognized risk&#xD;
      factor for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is&#xD;
      a prevalent under-recognized disorder; moderate to severe disease is found in approximately&#xD;
      9% of randomly selected middle-aged men and 4% of women. In addition, patients with OSA are&#xD;
      at increased (i.e., 3 fold) risk of incident CVD including myocardial infarction and acute&#xD;
      coronary syndromes. OSA is characterized by repetitive episodes of desaturation followed by&#xD;
      reoxygenation; this ischemia/reperfusion is a potent stimulus for the production of ROS, and&#xD;
      results in high levels of oxidative stress. Indeed, OSA may be considered a prototypical&#xD;
      oxidative stress disease. However, few studies have assessed the potential beneficial impact&#xD;
      of antioxidant therapy in OSA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that antioxidants may mitigate some of the adverse CV consequences associated&#xD;
      with OSA. The current proposal builds upon our translational work, and focuses on&#xD;
      comprehensively assessing the impact of a routinely used potent antioxidant on CV health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 80 patients with moderate to severe OSA will be enrolled in a parallel randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT). At baseline, endothelial function will be measured noninvasively&#xD;
      using a standard technique (EndoPAT). In addition, we will measure circulating levels of C&#xD;
      reactive protein, and markers of oxidative stress (urinary 8-isoprostane and&#xD;
      8-hydroxy-2-deoxy guanosine). Patients will be randomized to either ALA or placebo.&#xD;
      Endothelial function and biochemical markers will be remeasured after 12 weeks to determine&#xD;
      the impact of ALA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If ALA does result in significant benefits, this would raise the possibility of using ALA as&#xD;
      a therapy in OSA patients to prevent CVD, and justify a larger RCT to validate the result.&#xD;
      This is of substantial importance given the high prevalence of OSA in the population.&#xD;
