  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the COVID-19 vaccine candidate AZD1222 to investigate its safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and capability of boosting immune responses both in the blood and the lung when&#xD;
      administered to the respiratory tract, in volunteers previously vaccinated by intramuscular&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccination. Using standardised methods, we will measure immune responses in the&#xD;
      blood, nose and lower airway and compare with data from ongoing clinical trials of&#xD;
      intramuscular vaccination. Thus, we will show the effect of the delivery method and provide&#xD;
      the critical information required to begin further clinical trials to show the efficacy of&#xD;
      this needle-free vaccination strategy for booster vaccination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open label non-randomised dose escalation study in healthy adults aged&#xD;
      30-55 years recruited in the UK. AZD1222 will be administered by inhalation via vibrating&#xD;
      mesh nebuliser. The study will assess safety and immunogenicity of AZD1222 with blood and&#xD;
      respiratory tract samples. The dose evaluation will be conducted in a single centre&#xD;
      supervised by the Chief Investigator and senior clinician experienced in first-in human&#xD;
      studies in a cohort of 15 individuals. Approximately 14 days before vaccination, participants&#xD;
      will undergo bronchoscopy to sample their lower airways, obtaining bronchoalveolar lavage&#xD;
      (BAL), bronchial lining fluid and bronchial tissue. This will be repeated at day +21 and day&#xD;
      +182 post-vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation cohort will proceed through low (1x10^9), medium (5x10^9) and high&#xD;
      (1x10^10 vp) dose as follows: The first participant will receive the low dose and be invited&#xD;
      to enter information on local and systemic reactions into a diary that evening and daily&#xD;
      thereafter for 6 days. At 48 hours post-vaccination, the team will call the first participant&#xD;
      and go through their diary. If the reactions are Grade 1-2 or transient Grade 3 that resolved&#xD;
      within 24 hours, two further participants will receive the same dose. At 48 hours&#xD;
      post-vaccination, the team will call participants 2 and 3 to go through their diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provided there are no safety concerns, the fourth participant can proceed to receive the&#xD;
      medium dose. The steps above will be repeated in order to escalate to the highest dose (1x&#xD;
      10^10 vp). Provided there are no safety concerns outlined, a further 6 participants will be&#xD;
      vaccinated at the maximum tolerated dose - a total of 9 individuals vaccinated with the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose. The DSMB chair will review safety data before each dose escalation&#xD;
      and the full DSMB will periodically assess safety data every 4-8 weeks and/or as required.&#xD;
