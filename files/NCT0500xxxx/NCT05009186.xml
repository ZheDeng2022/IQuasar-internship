  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a worldwide pandemic in&#xD;
      over 100 years. The disease caused by this newly discovered virus was called Covid-19. In&#xD;
      this study, we aimed to evaluate changing of PSA value in patients with Covid-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with positive PCR test results were included in the study. The age of the patient&#xD;
      and urea, leukocyte, hemoglobin, platelet, urea, and creatinine values of the patients were&#xD;
      recorded. Urinalysis and urine culture were taken from all patients. Acute phase reactants&#xD;
      such as sedimentation, C-reaktif protein (CRP), ferritin, and fibrinogen were measured both&#xD;
      at the time the patients applied and three weeks after the patient recovered. PSA and free&#xD;
      PSA were also measured in the same way. Patients whose symptoms improved and the PCR test&#xD;
      result was negative were considered as recovered.&#xD;
