      This study in, healthy human subjects using fMRI and MRS (magnetic resonance spectroscopy)&#xD;
      characterizes, how attention and acetylcholine affect visual perception and the brain's&#xD;
      representation of the visual environment. Levels of acetylcholine in the cerebral cortex will&#xD;
      be enhanced by administration of donepezil, an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. Half the&#xD;
      subjects will receive donepezil and other half will receive placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term objective of this project is to characterize how attention and acetylcholine&#xD;
      affect visual perception and the brain's representation of the visual environment.&#xD;
      Acetylcholine is a naturally occurring neurotransmitter, and acetylcholine release is&#xD;
      elevated during periods of sustained attention. Both acetylcholine and attention enhance&#xD;
      aspects of visual perception, but the underlying brain mechanisms are poorly understood. The&#xD;
      proposed work will address these questions in healthy human subjects by using functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and MRS (magnetic resonance spectroscopy) to measure the&#xD;
      brain's responses to visual stimuli. Our previous studies have shown that increasing levels&#xD;
      of acetylcholine in the brain enhances the spatial resolution of the brain's representation&#xD;
      of the visual environment. The proposed research will document exactly which brain areas&#xD;
      mediate this effect of acetylcholine and will also characterize the effects of attention on&#xD;
      these measures of spatial resolution in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique of fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) and MRS (magnetic resonance&#xD;
      spectroscopy), both subtypes of MRI, will be employed to measure brain activity in different&#xD;
      brain areas while subjects are performing a visual attention task. Levels of acetylcholine in&#xD;
      the cerebral cortex will be enhanced by administration of donepezil, an inhibitor of&#xD;
      acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that metabolizes acetylcholine. Moreover, the technique of&#xD;
      MRS will be employed to locally quantify the levels of acetylcholine in different brain&#xD;
      areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to providing information about how attention is represented in the brain and how&#xD;
      it affects processing of visual stimuli, the present experiments should also shed light on&#xD;
      the function of the cholinergic projection from the basal forebrain to the cerebral cortex.&#xD;
      As this projection is thought to be selectively impaired in Alzheimer's disease, knowledge&#xD;
      concerning its function in the healthy brain may be useful for understanding the etiology of&#xD;
      this disease and for development of appropriate therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BEHAVIORAL PHARMACOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will perform 6 behavioral sessions over several days outside the scanner, split into&#xD;
      two experimental parts. There will be 2 baseline sessions without donepezil/placebo and 4&#xD;
      testing sessions with donepezil/placebo. Each behavioral (outside the scanner) session will&#xD;
      last 1-2 hours. During the testing session, subjects will be given one pill of (2.5 or 5 or&#xD;
      10mg) donepezil or placebo per session. The choice of the pill will be determined by the flip&#xD;
      of a coin. The drug dosage (2.5 or 5 or 10mg) will be determined so as to ensure that there&#xD;
      are equal number of participants per drug dosage. The pill (drug or placebo) not selected for&#xD;
      the first experimental session in a pair will be administered during the second experimental&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A typical cognitive task will involve presentation of images or words on a computer monitor&#xD;
      or sounds through headphones. The subjects are asked to respond to certain stimuli by&#xD;
      pressing a button. All stimuli are presented at a comfortable level. The cognitive task&#xD;
      performed during the behavioral is an object-tracking/target detection paradigm in which&#xD;
      subjects indicate whether a target is presented or not on each experimental trial. The&#xD;
      target, when it is presented, is a visual stimulus at the threshold of detectability. On some&#xD;
      trials, subjects will receive cues indicating target location and/or features that will&#xD;
      facilitate target detection. Subjects will be asked to report by pressing a button on a&#xD;
      response box. Subjects will receive breaks every 5-10 minutes or more frequently if they&#xD;
      desire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI AND PHARMACOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For experiments involving MRI, there will be a total of 6 sessions across several days, split&#xD;
      into two experimental parts. There will be two baseline MRI session without donepezil/placebo&#xD;
      and 4 testing sessions (two donepezil, two placebo). Subjects will be given one pill of (2.5&#xD;
      or 5 or 10mg) donepezil or placebo per session. The choice of the pill will be determined by&#xD;
      the flip of a coin. The pill not selected for the first experimental part will be&#xD;
      administered during the second experimental part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For MRI experiments, the experimenter will escort the subject to the Brain Imaging Center in&#xD;
      Li Ka Shing about 2.5 hours after pill administration, and fMRI measurements will begin&#xD;
      approximately 3 hours after pill administration. The MRI sessions typically take 1-2.5 hours,&#xD;
      and the subject is given frequent breaks. The subject may stop the experiment at any time.&#xD;
      Subjects undergoing MRI scanning will be asked to lie on their back in the MRI scanner.&#xD;
      Before being scanned, a MRI imaging coil made of plastic will be placed around the subject's&#xD;
      head. The subject will not come into contact with the coil during the experiment. Foam pads&#xD;
      will be placed around the subject's head to limit head movement during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

      A typical cognitive task will involve presentation of images or words on a computer monitor&#xD;
      or sounds through headphones. The subjects are asked to respond to certain stimuli by&#xD;

      trials, subjects will receive cues indicating target location and/or features that will&#xD;
      facilitate target detection. Subjects will be asked to report by pressing a button on a&#xD;
      response box. Subjects will receive breaks every 5-10 minutes or more frequently if they&#xD;
      desire.&#xD;
