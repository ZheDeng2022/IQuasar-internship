      The purpose of this research study is to determine if two drugs approved for treating&#xD;
      multiple myeloma, belantamab mafodotin and elotuzumab, are safe and more effective when used&#xD;
      together.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with RR MM beyond two-three lines of therapy have inferior outcomes. They have to&#xD;
      cycle through the available lines of treatment options and ultimately succumb to progressive&#xD;
      disease. Despite improvements in modern treatments this subset of MM patients has a grim&#xD;
      prognosis and thus represent a population with unmet need. Hence, further advances in&#xD;
      combination therapies are required. MM is associated with both qualitative and quantitative T&#xD;
      cell dysfunction owing to variety of mechanisms including increased expression of inhibitory&#xD;
      immune checkpoint molecules. Elotuzumab enhances NK cell cytotoxicity via SLAMF7 ligation and&#xD;
      has an established role in therapy of RR MM in combination with immunomodulatory agents&#xD;
      (iMIDs). On the other hand, BCMA has emerged as one of the best therapeutic targets to&#xD;
      eradicate plasma cells in MM. Therapeutic success with anti-BCMA ADC belantamab mafodotin is&#xD;
      readily evident based on the results of recent trials DREAMM 1 and DREAMM2 in&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory MM, leading to its Breakthrough Therapy Designation awarded by US FDA in&#xD;
      2017. Bela has demonstrated the potential to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) in a&#xD;
      BCMA-expressing MM cells. Tumor cells undergoing ICD induced an antigen-specific T cell&#xD;
      response, enhancing anti-tumor effects. Generally, in myeloma, success in therapy has always&#xD;
      been achieved by multifaceted treatment approach, targeting several pathways concurrently. To&#xD;
      combat antigen loss and resistance, combining monoclonal antibodies with different targets is&#xD;
      proposed. In this study, we propose immune-stimulatory therapy with anti-SLAMF7 antibody&#xD;
      elotuzumab in combination with belantamab mafodotin in subjects with RR MM. Administration of&#xD;
      elotuzumab would enrich NK cells and together with belantamab mafodotin would further&#xD;
      intensify anti-tumor immunity against MM. This combination would provide a novel all-immune&#xD;
      targeted therapy with potentially increased efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that this unique combination of an antibody drug conjugate and an&#xD;
      immune-stimulatory monoclonal antibody, targeting two very relevant pathways in MM will&#xD;
      result in significant clinical benefit for patients with RR MM. From the standpoint of&#xD;
      safety, each one of these immune-pharmaceutical drugs separately is well-tolerated, and in&#xD;
      combination are not expected to display overlapping toxicity. Thus, the investigators&#xD;
      believe, the adverse event profile of this combination would be favorable.&#xD;

    <description>Study patients will be enrolled and treated in cohorts of size 4 with maximum of 12 patients in the Phase I portion of the trial with possible dose de-escalation of belantamab mafodotin plus a fixed level of elotuzumab. Starting dose of belantamab mafodotin will be 1.9 mg/kg q4w. If the DLT rate hits de-escalation boundary (≥ 29.8%), four more patients will be enrolled for lower dose level with 1.9 mg/kg q8w. Otherwise next cohort of 4 will be treated at same dose. The MTD will be determined once the maximum sample size of 12 for phase I portion is reached or stop the trial if 8 patients are treated at the initial dose without need of de-escalation.</description>
