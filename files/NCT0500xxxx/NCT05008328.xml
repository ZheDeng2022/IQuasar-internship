  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will study music therapy for patients during breathing&#xD;
      trials, a procedure performed in intensive care units. Participants will be assigned either&#xD;
      to standard medical care or standard medical care plus music therapy. Participants have a&#xD;
      50/50 chance (like flipping a coin) of being in either group. In the music therapy group, a&#xD;
      board-certified music therapist will sing softly with guitar accompaniment to provide music&#xD;
      during the breathing trial. The music is in addition to the usual treatment provided by&#xD;
      hospital staff. Participants in the standard medical care group will receive the usual&#xD;
      medical care given by hospital staff members. Information will be collected from&#xD;
      participant's charts and by observation of vital signs during the breathing trial.&#xD;

    <description>If the participant is randomly assigned to standard care plus music therapy, a music therapist will enter the room five minutes prior to the start of the breathing trial and begin to play quiet music on a guitar. The nurse will reduce medicine to bring the participant to an alert state. The music therapist will introduce themselves and the music intervention, and will continue to play quiet guitar music and sing softly while the respiratory therapist begins the breathing trial. The music therapist will continue playing and singing for 20 minutes into the breathing trial.</description>

    <description>The patient's nurse will reduce sedatives so the patient is alert and awake. The respiratory therapist will introduce themselves to the patient and inform them of the SBT, stating they will turn off the ventilator machine and allow the patient to breathe independently. The respiratory therapist will switch off the ventilator and leave the room. The respiratory therapist and nurse will both be available throughout the SBT, and the ventilator will automatically turn on if the patient stops breathing. The SBT will last for 30-60 minutes.</description>
