      This is a single center, randomized, parallel assignment, and double-blind placebo-controlled&#xD;
      pilot study to characterize the intestinal microbiome in patients with severe Alcoholic&#xD;
      Hepatitis (SAH) and evaluate the safety and the trends in improvement of diversity of&#xD;
      intestinal microbiome following administration of lyophilized capsules containing microbiota&#xD;
      suspension from well screened health donors. The study aims to enroll 50 patients with SAH&#xD;
      who will be randomly assigned in 1:1 where 25 patients will be assigned to receive orally&#xD;
      administered lyophilized PRIM-DJ2727 and Standard of Care (SOC) and the other 25 patients&#xD;
      will be assigned to receive placebo and SOC for 4 weeks.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a major public health problem in the United States, caused by&#xD;
      chronic alcohol consumption of more than 40-60 g/day. Approximately 5 million Americans are&#xD;
      diagnosed with AH, contributing to 5% of US annual mortality. A 28-day mortality rate had&#xD;
      been reported in 30 to 50% of patients with AH. Steroid therapy has been the mainstay&#xD;
      treatment of patients with severe AH for the last 50 years. Yet, such treatment hasn't&#xD;
      clearly result in improvement of liver indices and survival rates among AH patients.&#xD;
      Moreover, the use of prednisolone was associated with significant side effects and has&#xD;
      several contraindications. Alternative therapeutic approaches have been explored but with&#xD;
      lack of effectiveness. On the other side, shortage of organs and cost for liver&#xD;
      transplantation are major barriers for liver transplantation in patients with AH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a growing evidence suggesting that gut-derived bacterial endotoxins may play a role&#xD;
      in alcohol-induced tissue injury and liver failure among heavy alcohol drinkers. This could&#xD;
      be attributable to two factors: The first is decreased gastrointestinal motility. Ethanol can&#xD;
      alter intestinal permeability by disrupting intercellular tight junctions and lead to GUT&#xD;
      leak and translocation of the microbes. The second factor explain the association between&#xD;
      microbiota and alcohol liver diseases is down-regulation of antimicrobial peptides induced by&#xD;
      alterations in host immune responses in alcohol drinkers. One experimental study compared&#xD;
      alcohol-sensitive mice (ASM) to alcohol-resistant mice (ARM). The study showed that ASM have&#xD;
      reduced Bacteroidetes and increased level of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes and that&#xD;
      performing fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from ARM to ASM yielded protection against&#xD;
      Bacteroidetes depletion and against the alcohol-induced steatosis in ASM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last few years, multiple studies have shown that FMT is safe and more effective in&#xD;
      treatment of recurrent clostridium difficile than the standard medical treatment. The&#xD;
      successful use of FMT in recurrent C. difficile, lead to multiple exploratory studies&#xD;
      assessing safety and efficacy of FMT in multiple diseases especially gastrointestinal&#xD;
      disorders, including Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD),&#xD;
      Liver cirrhosis and Hepatic Encephalopathy. These studies showed that FMT was safe and showed&#xD;
      signs of effectiveness that requires larger Randomized control trials (RCTs) to confirm these&#xD;
      findings. A Recent study by Indian investigators showed that modulation of intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota has shown to improve survival in patients with severe AH. However, the study had&#xD;
      multiple limitations, including absence of randomization, limited number of biochemical&#xD;
      parameters and prognostic scores used, use of Nasoduodenal tube to deliver FMT and the lack&#xD;
      of detail profiling of intestinal microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Agent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIM-DJ2727(microbiota suspension)is an intestinal microbial suspension prepared form stool&#xD;
      obtained from carefully and thoroughly screened healthy human donors. PRIM-DJ2727 is prepared&#xD;
      from a standard amount of healthy human stool mixed with 0.85%NaCI(normal saline) and 2%&#xD;
      mannitol. Microbiota from a single donor will be screened before lyophilization and&#xD;
      encapsulation. The lyophilized capsules given for each treatment contain bacteria from 10g&#xD;
      Filtered stool. Placebo will be identical to the investigational product but will not contain&#xD;
      intestinal bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, randomized, parallel assignment, and double-blind placebo-controlled&#xD;
      pilot study to be conducted in subjects with severe AH. Subjects with clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
      severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH) based on recommendation From the NIAAA Alcoholic Hepatitis&#xD;
      Consortia criteria will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening, the investigators aim to enroll 50 patients with SAH who will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned in 1:1 where 25 patients will be assigned to receive orally administered lyophilized&#xD;
      PRIM-DJ2727 and Standard of Care (SOC) and the other 25 patients will be assigned to receive&#xD;
      placebo and SOC for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is considered Pilot study due to small sample size as the investigators are using&#xD;
      this Phase I study to assess the safety of the PRIM-DJ2727 Capsules in patients with&#xD;
      Alcoholic hepatitis and to provide enough data to design and prepare for Phase II trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A formal sample size has not been calculated as this study is not powered to establish&#xD;
      significance. This is a pilot study aimed at characterizing the intestinal microbiome in&#xD;
      patients with severe AH and evaluate the safety and the trends in improvement of diversity of&#xD;
      intestinal microbiome following administration of lyophilized capsules containing microbiota&#xD;
      suspension (PRIM-DJ2727 capsules) from well screened health donors.&#xD;
