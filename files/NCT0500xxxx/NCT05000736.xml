      A retrospective cohort study conducted at the Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical&#xD;
      Sciences to compare the effectiveness of palbociclib plus AI therapy and fulvestrant&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to be a retrospective cohort study conducted at the Cancer Hospital&#xD;
      Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. The target populations of this study are patients with&#xD;
      HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer who received the initial endocrine therapy of palbociclib&#xD;
      plus AI or fulvestrant monotherapy from August 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020. It is expected&#xD;
      to enroll 600 subjects in this study. The subjects' data such as demographics and other&#xD;
      baseline characteristics, medications, prognosis, will be collected retrospectively, and&#xD;
      statistical analysis of data will be conducted to compare the effectiveness outcome measures.&#xD;

    <description>It is defined as the time (months) from the start of palbociclib+AI or fulvestrant monotherapy to progressive disease or all-cause mortality. The progressive disease is determined by clinicians based on the results of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, imaging or pathological examinations. Patients who have not died or have not experienced progressive disease will be censored at the beginning of next-line treatment or at the last visit during the study period.</description>
