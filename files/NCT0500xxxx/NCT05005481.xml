  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phantom limb pain (PLP), defined as pain felt in the missing portion of the amputated limb&#xD;
      following amputation, occurs in a significant percentage of patients who undergo limb&#xD;
      amputation and it is among the most difficult chronic pain syndromes to treat. Its incidence&#xD;
      has been reported to be around 70% though a local pilot study in 2013 reported the incidence&#xD;
      to be 25%. The investigators aim to determine the actual incidence of PLP by conducting a&#xD;
      single-centre prospective cohort study and identify risk factors associated with PLP.&#xD;
      Subsequently, the investigators will use identified risk factors to develop and validate a&#xD;
      risk prediction model for PLP after amputation surgery and design interventional studies&#xD;
      aimed at reducing the development of PLP in high risk patients.&#xD;

      Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using prospective design and validated multidimensional pain questionnaire, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to better estimate the true incidence of PLP, other associated risk factors&#xD;
      and the severity of functional impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is divided into 2 phases, of which the first phase of the study would be covered&#xD;
      by the scope of the grant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 Primary Aim 1. To determine the local incidence of PLP at 3 months post amputation&#xD;
      surgery (as literature suggests that PLP is most likely to develop within 3 months of&#xD;
      amputation surgery) Hypothesis It is hypothesized that the incidence of PLP is estimated to&#xD;
      be 41-85% from the literature .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims 1. Analyse and delineate modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors (patient,&#xD;
      anaesthetic and surgical factors) contributing to the development of PLP. 2. Identify factors&#xD;
      likely to prevent or reduce the development of PLP after amputation surgery 3. To identify&#xD;
      factors prognosticating patient outcomes and recovery from PLP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 (out of the scope of the grant) Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To follow up patients prospectively to identify the long-term functional and psychological&#xD;
      effects of PLP on patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), Phantom limb pain (PLP)&#xD;
      is defined as pain felt in the absent body part. PLP occurs in a significant percentage of&#xD;
      patients who undergo limb amputation and it is among the most difficult chronic pain&#xD;
      condition to treat. Undertreated PLP, together with other persistent chronic pain secondary&#xD;
      to amputation can lead to limitations in both physical and psychosocial function and impair&#xD;
      their rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The true prevalence of PLP among people with amputation is unclear, especially among Asian&#xD;
      population. There are various reports of PLP prevalence ranging from 40% to 80% depending on&#xD;
      the site of amputation, the patient population, and the time since amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact reason why some patients develop phantom pain after amputation is still unknown.&#xD;
      The development of PLP is likely multifactorial and includes peripheral, central, and&#xD;
      psychological factors. Several risk factors associated with the development of PLP have been&#xD;
      identified in various studies but the overall results are rather conflicting. Risk factors&#xD;
      such as persisting pre-operative pain, stump pain, patient comorbidity contribute to the&#xD;
      onset of PLP. The majority of these studies, however, are based on Caucasian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, it is increasingly clear that patients with PLP will continue to rise locally&#xD;
      in view of higher prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus and malignancy, largely attributed to&#xD;
      ageing population. In Singapore, major lower extremity amputation rate has increased from&#xD;
      11.0 per 100,000 population in 2008 to 13.3 per 100,000 population in 2013. It was reported&#xD;
      in 2001 that approximately 700 lower extremity amputation (LEA) were performed in patients&#xD;
      with diabetes annually. The figures more than doubled to 1500 LEA annually in 2017, due to&#xD;
      complications arising from diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite anticipating PLP to be a significant burgeoning healthcare burden, PLP is&#xD;
      underreported and undertreated, leading to poor rehabilitation outcome. There is also a&#xD;
      paucity on local data, with only one ever publication related to PLP in Singapore. The lack&#xD;
      of local data in terms of definitive incidence estimate in our population, the functional&#xD;
      impairment from PLP and potential risk factors has greatly hindered the development or&#xD;
      implementation of effective interventions for preventing or treating PLP. Thus, the primary&#xD;
      aim of this study is to establish the incidence of PLP in our local population, the risk&#xD;
      factors associated with PLP and its functional impact.&#xD;
