    <textblock>
      Sarcomas are rare tumours that represent less than 1% of cancers. Their actual incidence in&#xD;
      France, however, is not known. The chances of survival at 5 years, without signs of the&#xD;
      disease, are currently estimated at about 60%. The possibility of soft tissue sarcoma (STS)&#xD;
      is frequently unrecognised, leading to an inappropriate initial diagnostic process and often&#xD;
      to inadequate surgery. Compliance with good practice guides, which we can recall were&#xD;
      targeted at oncologists, is good when the patient's record is discussed within the framework&#xD;
      of a multidisciplinary consultation. The consequences of inadequate initial management,&#xD;
      however, can be critical: unplanned surgery results in the need for systematic repeat&#xD;
      procedure, with residual tumour found in more than half of cases, and the absence of&#xD;
      multidisciplinary care has a deleterious impact on local disease control and specific&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to measure the impact of a public health intervention programme&#xD;
      focused on the initial management of STS among all professionals who may come to suspect or&#xD;
      diagnose soft tissue sarcoma. For this project, the 4 regions involved in the Cancéropôle du&#xD;
      Grand Sud-Ouest, France (Aquitaine, Languedoc-Roussillon, Limousin and Midi-Pyrénées) propose&#xD;
      to implement actions targeted at general practitioners, treating physicians and&#xD;
      non-specialist surgeons in the field of STS, aimed at improving initial care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An improvement in initial management (diagnosis and assessment) which should allow an&#xD;
      improvement in the loco-regional control of these diseases and in the specific survival of&#xD;
      the patients. The actions recognised as effective in this study could then be adapted and&#xD;
      extended to the rest of France via the French sarcomas group and the bone tumours study group&#xD;
      (GSF-GETO).&#xD;

      Background: Sarcomas are rare tumours that represent less than 1% of cancers. Their actual&#xD;
      incidence in France, however, is not known. The chances of survival at 5 years, without signs&#xD;
      of the disease, are currently estimated at about 60%. The possibility of soft tissue sarcoma&#xD;
      (STS) is frequently unrecognised, leading to an inappropriate initial diagnostic process and&#xD;
      often to inadequate surgery. Compliance with good practice guides, which we can recall were&#xD;
      targeted at oncologists, is good when the patient's record is discussed within the framework&#xD;
      of a multidisciplinary consultation. The consequences of inadequate initial management,&#xD;
      however, can be critical: unplanned surgery results in the need for systematic repeat&#xD;
      procedure, with residual tumour found in more than half of cases, and the absence of&#xD;
      multidisciplinary care has a deleterious impact on local disease control and specific&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objective of the study is to measure the impact of a public health&#xD;
      intervention programme focused on the initial management of STS among all professionals who&#xD;
      may come to suspect or diagnose soft tissue sarcoma. For this project, the 4 regions involved&#xD;
      in the Cancéropôle du Grand Sud-Ouest, France (Aquitaine, Languedoc-Roussillon, Limousin and&#xD;
      Midi-Pyrénées) propose to implement actions targeted at general practitioners, treating&#xD;
      physicians and non-specialist surgeons in the field of STS, aimed at improving initial care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outline: This is a &quot;before and after (the intervention programme)&quot; study with a &quot;control&quot;&#xD;
      group (Nantes region with multidisciplinary &quot;sarcoma&quot; consultation meetings organised, but&#xD;
      where no specific intervention shall be made).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Course the intervention: The programme shall combine 3 actions: a simple dissemination of&#xD;
      information via the regional Unions of private practice physicians and the local&#xD;
      correspondents of the regional networks (action 1), an action in the form of oral&#xD;
      communication during regional meetings of professionals (action 2) and an action focused on&#xD;
      each surgeon for whom the pathologist has diagnosed soft tissue sarcoma (action 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study size: It is assumed that the proposed programme shall serve to measure a 35%&#xD;
      improvement in the proportion of adequate care (70% with intervention versus 35%). To take&#xD;
      into account in the analysis of potential clusters of practices (professionals with similar&#xD;
      medical practices), the number of subjects was increased to 60 observations per study phase&#xD;
      (before/after). The results of the &quot;Before the intervention&quot; study should enable us to adjust&#xD;
      the number of subjects to take into account any cluster effects, which cannot be estimated as&#xD;
      it is, while taking into account the feasibility since these are rare tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: For each patient, the main analyses shall focus on different care quality&#xD;
      endpoints, in particular those relating to the initial diagnosis and initial surgery stages.&#xD;
      The elements of these endpoints shall be collected in health establishments and pathology&#xD;
      laboratories in the regions involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impacts and perspectives: An improvement in initial management (diagnosis and assessment)&#xD;
      which should allow an improvement in the loco-regional control of these diseases and in the&#xD;
      specific survival of the patients. The actions recognised as effective in this study could&#xD;
      then be adapted and extended to the rest of France via the French sarcomas group and the bone&#xD;
      tumours study group (GSF-GETO).&#xD;
