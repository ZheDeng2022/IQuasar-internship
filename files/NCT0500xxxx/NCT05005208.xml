      The study was designed to test the acceptability of the SI-ROBOTICS system in a group of 20&#xD;
      subjects with Parkinson's Disease at an early stage during a rehabilitation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SI-ROBOTICS system is composed of multiple technological components with the aim of&#xD;
      facilitating a rehabilitation program based on Irish dance and encouraging the execution of&#xD;
      dance steps. The SI-ROBOTICS system consists of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ROBOTIC PLATFORM: a social robot that allows the monitoring of patients during sessions,&#xD;
           moving around patients safely and, if necessary, intervening in their support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LET'S DANCE GAME: a component that allows users to enjoy the game sessions (setting up&#xD;
           of therapy sessions by the therapist, presentation of tasks to the player and execution&#xD;
           by the latter, display of feedback on the sessions).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ENVIRONMENTAL AND WEARABLE SENSORS: this allows data to be collected on the patient's&#xD;
           main clinical parameters (e.g. heart rate, respiratory rate, etc.). These data allow the&#xD;
           therapist to know the patient's state during the execution of tasks and the AI reasoner&#xD;
           component to have an additional level of information with which to adapt the planning of&#xD;
           steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AI REASONERS: this is the back-end of the Si-Robotics system, i.e. the &quot;intelligent&quot;&#xD;
           component that allows the adaptation of the game sessions, based on the users' game&#xD;
           performance and the data collected through the sensors. In this way it will be possible&#xD;
           to dynamically customize the session according to the user's needs and abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ARTIFICIAL VISION SETTING: a commercial camera called Inter Real Sense&#xD;
           (https://www.intel.it/content/www/it/it/architecture-and-technology/realsense-overview.h&#xD;
           tml) will be installed in the experimental setting for the extraction of kinematic&#xD;
           parameters, saved anonymously and locally on this computer. Also the robotic platform&#xD;
           will be equipped with a RealSense camera and will be able to acquire kinematic&#xD;
           parameters. To extract features of interest from the signals, proprietary skeleton&#xD;
           tracking software of the Real Sense camera will be used, together with specially&#xD;
           developed algorithms for feature extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, kinematic and performance parameters will be collected, which will be used by&#xD;
      the physiotherapist to evaluate and plan subsequent sessions, and by the system to delineate&#xD;
      the levels of difficulty of the exercise.&#xD;

    <time_frame>change from baseline to 4 and 8 weeks after intervention commencement</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability will be assessed using a 52-item questionnaire based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model. It's a standardized instrument for measuring the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps to understand the drivers of its acceptance.&#xD;
The questionnaire has 52 questions distributed in 4 key constructs: 1) performance expectancy, 2) effort expectancy, 3) social influence, and 4) facilitating conditions.&#xD;
Each question are based on a Likert-type 5-point scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. Increments are integers between 1 to 5.</description>

    <measure>Change in walking speed</measure>

    <description>The walking speed will be evaluated by the Six-Minute Walking Test (6MWT).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in balance</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 4 and 8 weeks after intervention commencement</time_frame>
    <description>The change in balance will be evaluated by the Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA) consists of two sub-scales: the balance evaluation scale (&quot;balance scale&quot; or POMA-B) and the gait evaluation scale (&quot;gait scale&quot; or POMA-G). The maximum score is 28 points: in detail, the maximum score of the POMA-B is 16, while for the POMA-G the maximum score is 12.</description>

    <measure>Change in fear of falling</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 4 and 8 weeks after intervention commencement</time_frame>
    <description>The change in fear of falling will be evaluated by the Short Falls Efficacy Scale - International (FES-I- Short). The cut offs are divided as follows: a score between 7-8 indicates a low concern, between 9-12 a moderate concern and between 14 and 28, high concern.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in physical performance</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 4 and 8 weeks after intervention commencement</time_frame>
    <description>Change in physical performance will be ascertained using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Summary scores range from 0-12 and higher scores denote higher physical performance</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 4 and 8 weeks after intervention commencement</time_frame>
    <description>Change in mobility will be evaluated by Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) Test. A score of ten seconds or less indicates normal mobility; times between 11 and 20 seconds are within normal limits for frail elderly and disabled patients; times over 20 seconds indicate that the person requires external assistance and the need for further examination and intervention. A score above 30 seconds suggests that the person may be prone to falls.</description>
