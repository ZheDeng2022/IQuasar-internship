  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, it was aimed to investigate the analgesic efficacy of the preoperatively&#xD;
      applied Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) Block in the management of acute&#xD;
      appendicitis-related abdominal pain and post-appendectomy pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TAP block creates an analgesic effect by blocking both sensory skin dermotams and&#xD;
      viscerosomatic transmission. TAP block with ultrasound was first performed by Hebbard, and&#xD;
      the use of USG made the procedure faster and safer. TAP block has been successfully applied&#xD;
      for analgesia in procedures such as laparoscopic colocystectomy, inguinal hernia repair,&#xD;
      abdominal hysterectomy, prostatectomy and appendectomy. According to the surgical incision to&#xD;
      be applied, TAP block is performed from different anatomical regions. It is also applied for&#xD;
      pain palliation in intra-abdominal etiologies or rarely for anesthesia in surgical&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analgesic efficacy of TAP block on preoperative abdominal pain and postoperative surgical&#xD;
      pain in acute appendicitis was investigated.&#xD;

        Patients aged 18 years and older who underwent open appendectomy with the diagnosis of&#xD;
        acute appendicitis, who underwent TAP block, were identified retrospectively. Demographic&#xD;
        data of the patients, change of pain scores at rest and with coughing, postoperative pain&#xD;
        scores, postoperative analgesic need were evaluated.&#xD;
