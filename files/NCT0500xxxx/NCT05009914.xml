  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, random controlled trial(RCT) study. 430 patients undergoing coronary&#xD;
      artery bypass grafting were enrolled. Our new way of cardiac denervation, defined as excision&#xD;
      of Marshall ligament and Waterstone fat pad, was performed in 215 patients, and the other 215&#xD;
      patients were used as control subjects. All the patients need to equip with electronic&#xD;
      monitor to record heart rhythms within 6 days after CABG. The investigators will compare the&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation between two groups, and follow up 30 days&#xD;
      after discharged.&#xD;
