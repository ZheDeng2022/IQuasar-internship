  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of TrueLoo™, an Internet-connected&#xD;
      smart toilet seat, in accurately monitoring and logging bowel movements and urinations of&#xD;
      residents in senior living facilities across Northern California.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The logging and monitoring of bowel movements and urinary events is an important aspect of&#xD;
      preventative care for residents in senior living facilities, providing early warning signs&#xD;
      for conditions that may otherwise cause complications if dealt with reactively. However, this&#xD;
      information is sporadically collected - if at all - and subjectively interpreted by&#xD;
      caregivers, leading to inconsistencies and unreliable data. Toi Labs, Inc. has created&#xD;
      TrueLoo™, an Internet-connected toilet seat, as a solution to these issues. TrueLoo™ acquires&#xD;
      time-lapse images of a bowel movement or urinary event automatically and under controlled&#xD;
      conditions. Residents enrolled in the current study will have a TrueLoo™ installed in their&#xD;
      private bathroom, through which all bowel movements and urinary events will be tracked,&#xD;
      anonymously, privately, and securely. As a result, an electronic bowel movement and urinary&#xD;
      event log for each enrolled resident will be generated. Given sufficient data, the TrueLoo™&#xD;
      system will complete such electronic logs automatically, identify points in time where&#xD;
      particular enrolled residents may have experienced anomalous toileting patterns, and&#xD;
      determine the relevance of such events through targeted health history and urine sampling.&#xD;

    <description>TrueLoo™ is an Internet-connected, smart toilet seat that uses computer vision technology to log and capture daily bowel movements and urinations. This data is then categorized by physical excreta characteristics to train and develop machine learning algorithms that are intended to eventually identify significant changes in stool and urine in real-time.</description>
