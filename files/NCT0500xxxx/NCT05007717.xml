    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a Phase III cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of the implementation of a data-informed stepped care (DiSC)&#xD;
      intervention for HIV treatment management among adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) in&#xD;
      high-volume HIV clinics in Kenya. The DiSC intervention is comprised of a system to assign&#xD;
      ALHIV to care based on their health needs and the different levels of care for each&#xD;
      assignment group. The primary outcome will be ALHIV retention, and the secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will include adherence, viral non-suppression, and receipt of differentiated care among&#xD;
      ALHIV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      UNAIDS '95-95-95' targets cannot be achieved without additional support for adolescents&#xD;
      living with HIV (ALHIV) to increase retention in care and to support viral suppression. Risk&#xD;
      prediction tools as well as a stepped care approach to care can support differentiation of&#xD;
      ALHIV to different risk groups, and tailor care based on risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have conducted informative work with ALHIV, caregivers, healthcare workers&#xD;
      (HCW) and policy makers, and has developed a clinical prediction tool to identify ALHIV at&#xD;
      highest risk of not being retained in care and poor viral suppression that could be adapted&#xD;
      to identify adolescents who may need more support in their care. Understanding how best to&#xD;
      use the risk prediction tool as well as how to tailor services based on risk may ultimately&#xD;
      result in more efficient HIV care services, as well as adequate support for ALHIV at highest&#xD;
      risk of poor outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building on that informative work, in this protocol, the investigators will conduct a Phase&#xD;
      III cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) by implementing a data-informed stepped care&#xD;
      (DiSC) intervention of ALHIV HIV treatment management in high-volume HIV clinics in Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cRCT will be conducted at up to 24 HIV care and treatment facilities located in Kisumu,&#xD;
      Homabay, Migori county in Western Kenya, in which approximately 6000 HIV positive adolescents&#xD;
      and young adults ages 10-24 years enrolled in HIV care, 900 caregivers of ALHIV, and 200 HCW&#xD;
      will be recruited in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinics randomized to the DiSC intervention arm will use a data-driven system to assign ALHIV&#xD;
      to different levels of care depending on their current and anticipated health care needs. The&#xD;
      intervention will be delivered at the individual level by HCW providing routine care during&#xD;
      routine HIV clinic visits. Clinics randomized to the control arm will continue with standard&#xD;
      of care approaches for adolescent clinic visits (usually 1-3 monthly visits), regardless of&#xD;
      health care needs and additional support as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary objectives, this study also aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the DiSC&#xD;
      intervention on ALHIV cascade outcomes (adherence, viral non-suppression) and receiving&#xD;
      differentiated HIV care based on health status evaluation.&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will calculate the proportion of scheduled visits that are missed. Missed visits will be defined as a participant not seen within 30 days after each scheduled visit. Each scheduled visit will be classified as missed versus not missed.</description>

    <description>Loss to follow-up will be defined as a participant not seen within 30 days after a scheduled visit AND never returned to care within the 12-month study period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of viral load results showing viral non-suppression</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will calculate the overall proportion of viral load test results that show non-suppression. Viral non-suppression will be defined as having HIV RNA viral loads (VL) &gt;1,000 copies per milliliter. Each VL test result will be classified as VL suppressed vs. unsuppressed.</description>

    <measure>Rate of adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence will be defined as the number of pills dispensed divided by the number of days between visits. A percentage greater than 80% will be classified as good adherence. The level of adherence during the past inter-visit interval will be assessed at each visit.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of adolescents enrolled in differentiated care will be computed as participants who (1) have multi-month prescription refill intervals â‰¥3 months; and/or (2) are assigned to fast-track status.</description>

    <description>The DiSC intervention is comprised of a data-driven system to assign adolescents to care based on their health needs and the different levels of care for each assignment group.&#xD;
The trajectory of services moves from a relative position of ALHIV autonomy to more intensive service provision. Intervention steps start with 1) multi-month refills or community treatment delivery (differentiated care); 2) a standard of care level for those with medical needs such as pregnancy or opportunistic infections or patient choice; 3) patient reminders/tracking and counseling and referral services for mental health needs; 4) case management of unsuppressed individuals, including enhanced counseling and case conference problem-solving</description>
