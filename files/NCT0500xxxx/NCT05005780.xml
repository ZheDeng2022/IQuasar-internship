  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical pilot trial investigates the therapeutic&#xD;
      potential of a novel personalized therapeutic brain-stimulation protocol in chronic stroke&#xD;
      patients with spasticity. Stroke patients will either receive ipsilesional 100 Hz&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) triplet burst protocol synchronized to the ongoing&#xD;
      µ-alpha oscillation or contralesional 1 Hz repetitive TMS (rTMS) protocol. Motor recovery is&#xD;
      assessed directly after as well as three months after completion of the therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the leading cause for long-term disability worldwide. The standard approach&#xD;
      to treat deficits after stroke is a rehabilitation therapy, that follows the stroke event&#xD;
      directly. This therapy mainly includes physiotherapy and occupational therapy. Yet, despite&#xD;
      intensive rehabilitation efforts, more than half of all stroke patients remain greatly&#xD;
      disabled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repetitive TMS is capable of inducing plasticity-like effects in the brain, that are expected&#xD;
      to enhance adaptive plasticity processes leading to functional regain after stroke. In the&#xD;
      motor cortex, brain oscillation-synchronized TMS, i.e. TMS triggered dependent on the phase&#xD;
      of instantaneous µ-alpha oscillations as detected by real-time EEG (electroencephalography)&#xD;
      analysis, has been shown to consistently increase motor cortical excitability and plasticity&#xD;
      effects. We therefore hypothesis that a greater therapeutic potential of TMS to modulate&#xD;
      dysfunctional brain networks can be exploited by personalizing TMS therapy to individual&#xD;
      brain states (i.e. brain oscillations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of an ipsilesional 100 Hz TMS triplet burst&#xD;
      protocol synchronized to the ongoing µ-alpha oscillation compared to the current TMS standard&#xD;
      therapy of contralesional 1 Hz rTMS in chronic stroke patients. Both groups will undergo&#xD;
      stimulation therapy three times a week, with each session directly followed by physiotherapy.&#xD;
      Motor recovery will be assessed directly after as well as three months after completion of&#xD;
      the therapy.&#xD;
