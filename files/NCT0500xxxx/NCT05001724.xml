  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2/3, multicenter, randomized, open, positive-controlled study of patients&#xD;
      with advanced non-small cell lung cancer whose disease has progressed after prior&#xD;
      anti-PD-(L)1 therapy. Subjects should have documented progressive disease during prior&#xD;
      treatment with first- or second-line PD-(L)1 and platinum-containing dual-agent&#xD;
      chemotherapy.Subjects will be randomized to three treatment groups in a 4:1:4 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group 1: KN046 5mg/kg every 2 weeks + lenvatinib recommended for phase III dose&#xD;
      (RP3D) every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group 2: lenvatinib RP3D every day . Control group: Docetaxel 75mg/m2 every 3 weeks&#xD;
