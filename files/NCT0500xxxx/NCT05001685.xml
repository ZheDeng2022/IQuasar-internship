      In 2006, our hospital improved and began to use cervical expansive open-door laminoplasty&#xD;
      preserving the unilateral ligament with muscle complex.The effect of recent follow-up,&#xD;
      postoperative complications and their effects on posterior cervical muscle volume were also&#xD;
      studied.However, there are few reports about medium and long-term follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Expansive laminoplasty of posterior cervical canal has been widely used for the treatment of&#xD;
      cervical spondylotic myelopathy with cervical spinal stenosis and ossification of the&#xD;
      posterior longitudinal ligament since Hirabayashi et al. described it in the 1970s.&#xD;
      Traditional single-door surgery requires extensive dissection of both paravertebral muscles&#xD;
      and ligaments, and resect part of the spinous process. Postoperative complications (axial&#xD;
      neck pain, stiffness, cervical kyphosis, reduced range of motion, etc.) are also related to&#xD;
      that in degree. In order to reduce the damage to the posterior cervical structure and reduce&#xD;
      the associated complications, in the 1990s, Yoshihiko Oshima et al. introduced the expansive&#xD;
      laminoplasty of the spinal canal with one side of the posterior ligamentwith muscle complex&#xD;
      attached to the spinous process. In 2006, our hospital improved and began to use cervical&#xD;
      expansive open-door laminoplasty preserving the unilateral ligament with muscle complex.The&#xD;
      effect of recent follow-up, postoperative complications and their effects on posterior&#xD;
      cervical muscle volume were also studied.However, there are few reports about medium and&#xD;
      long-term follow-up.&#xD;
