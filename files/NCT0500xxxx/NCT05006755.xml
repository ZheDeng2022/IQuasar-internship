  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Preservation of the primary teeth is a mandatory issue for maintaining the integrity of&#xD;
           the normal dentition and functioning till the eruption of the successors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  furcal perforations may occur due to iatrogenic and non-iatrogenic causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Despite the high successful outcomes in perforation repair with MTA, there are some&#xD;
           issues which prevent the clinicians from using it for many cases such as its very long&#xD;
           setting time and its difficult manipulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biodentin could be used as an alternative to MTA in reparative treatment procedures due&#xD;
           to its ability to provide a hermetic seal and durable restoration and thus an optimal&#xD;
           sealing is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The importance of the trial lies in testing the sealing ability of Biodentine using&#xD;
           scanning electron microscope. Biodentine has short setting time and is easier in&#xD;
           manipulation than MTA which are major needs when dealing with pediatric patients to be&#xD;
           able to give best results in short time.&#xD;

      -  By immediate diagnosis and sealing of furcal perforations in primary molar teeth with a&#xD;
           biocompatible material, the prognosis is usually favorable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MTA has high clinical efficacy, but there were some drawbacks which made it difficult&#xD;
           for the clinicians to use it in many cases. The major ones being very long setting time&#xD;
           and difficult manipulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biodentine has a good sealing ability, high compressive strengths, short setting time,&#xD;
           biocompatibility, bioactivity and biomineralization properties that make it available to&#xD;
           be used in endodontic repair procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  42 extracted primary molar teeth will be collected, sterilized and stored according to&#xD;
           the Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines and regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A standard access cavity will be prepared in each tooth using a diamond bur and non-end&#xD;
           cutting bur in high-speed handpiece with water spray. A 0.5 mm round bur will be used to&#xD;
           standardize the size of furcal perforation, and the furcal involvement will be made on&#xD;
           the center of the pulpal floor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the furcal perforation, the blocks will randomly be divided into two groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: MTA Group, Using amalgam applicator the material will be carried and&#xD;
           sealed in the furcation site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention group: Biodentin Group,The material will be scooped and applied on the&#xD;
           perforation site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcome : sealing ability measurement method : scanning electron microscope unit of&#xD;
           measurement : µm&#xD;
