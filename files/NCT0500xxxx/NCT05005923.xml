    <textblock>
      The present study aimed to assess the effect of non-surgical periodontal treatment on serum&#xD;
      and salivary MMP-8, MAF, MIP-1α, M-CSF, and IL34 levels in periodontitis stage III grade B&#xD;
      (P-III-B) and C (P-III-C) patients. 20 periodontally healthy, 20 P-III-B and 25 P-III-C&#xD;
      participants were enrolled. At baseline, serum and saliva samples were collected and the&#xD;
      whole mouth clinical periodontal parameters were recorded. Periodontitis patients received&#xD;
      non-surgical periodontal treatment. Clinical parameters were re-measured and samples were&#xD;
      re-collected at 1 and 3 months after treatment. Serum and salivary MMP-8, MAF, MIP-1α, M-CSF,&#xD;
      and IL34 levels were analyzed by ELISA. Data were analyzed using appropriate statistical&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal disease is an inflammatory process that can result in tooth loss and also is&#xD;
      considered a modifying factor for systemic health. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8 is the&#xD;
      major collagenase of periodontal tissue breakdown. Macrophage-activating factor (MAF) can&#xD;
      activate macrophages. M-CSF is known to modulate disease and inflammation and to play an&#xD;
      important role in bone destruction. IL-34 shares vital functions of M-CSF, and manages&#xD;
      myeloid cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is the first controlled clinical study that examines the levels of MIP-1α, MAF,&#xD;
      MMP-8, M-CSF, IL-34 in saliva and serum in two different periodontitis, and evaluates the&#xD;
      situation before and after the treatment. The first hypothesis of this study; in&#xD;
      periodontitis group, salivary and serum MIP-1α, MAF, MMP-8, M-CSF, IL-34 levels will be high,&#xD;
      in contrast to the periodontal healthy group. The second hypothesis of this study is that&#xD;
      after periodontal treatment, saliva and serum MIP-1α, MAF, MMP-8, M-CSF, IL-34 levels will&#xD;
      decrease. Based on these hypotheses, the aim of the study is; to compare the levels of&#xD;
      MIP-1a, MAF, MMP-8, M-CSF, IL-34 in saliva and serum of healthy controls, P-III-B, and&#xD;
      P-III-C subjects and to evaluate the effect of periodontal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 65 systemically healthy patients; 20 periodontally healthy, 20 P-III-B, 25 P-III-C&#xD;
      were included in this study. The whole mouth clinical periodontal examination included&#xD;
      measurement of probing depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), presence of bleeding on&#xD;
      probing (BOP), gingival index (GI), and plaque index (PI) at 6 sites per tooth, except the&#xD;
      third molars. The presence and type of the alveolar bone loss were assessed on the digital&#xD;
      panoramic radiograph in each participant, which was supplemented with periapical radiographs&#xD;
      if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal status of each patient was evaluated by a single calibrated periodontists with a&#xD;
      manual probe. The diagnosis of periodontitis or periodontally health was determined according&#xD;
      to the 2017 World Workshop on Classification of Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases and&#xD;
      Conditions. Periodontally healthy individuals (n=20) in the control group had no sites with&#xD;
      PD &gt;3 mm and CAL &gt;2 mm and also no radiographic evidence of alveolar bone loss. BOP was &lt;10%&#xD;
      in the whole mouth. Healthy group also exhibited no history of periodontitis. The&#xD;
      periodontitis stage III patients had a minimum three teeth apart from the first molars and&#xD;
      incisors showing CAL ≥5 mm and PD ≥6 mm and showed no&gt;4 teeth loss because of periodontitis.&#xD;
      Radiographic bone loss extending from coronal to middle third or beyond. Radiographic bone&#xD;
      loss was determined from the tooth showing the most severe bone loss as a percentage of root&#xD;
      length. If the values of bone loss %/age were between 0.25 and 1.0, the patients were&#xD;
      assigned to grade B (n=20). If higher than 1.0, the patients were assigned to grade C (n=25)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruited periodontitis patients received conventional quadrant scaling and root planning&#xD;
      (SRP) under local anesthesia in a total of 4 sessions in two weeks. SRP was performed by the&#xD;
      same periodontist using ultrasonic inserts and manual periodontal curettes. Re-evaluations&#xD;
      were performed at 1 and 3 months following the completion of the SRP. No periodontal&#xD;
      intervention was carried out in the periodontally healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva and Serum Sampling A total of 5 mL of unstimulated whole saliva was collected by&#xD;
      passive drool method between 9:00 and 10:00 am. The participants were advised to avoid food&#xD;
      consumption for three hours before sample collection. The participants were seated upright&#xD;
      and saliva was collected over a period of 5 minutes with instructions to pool saliva in the&#xD;
      floor of the mouth and passively drool it into a sterile glass beaker. Then saliva samples&#xD;
      are immediately transferred to a 2 mL polypropylene tube and stored at -80°C. A total of 5 mL&#xD;
      of blood was collected from the antecubital fossa by venepuncture method. Serum was isolated&#xD;
      from the blood by centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 10 minutes followed by its rapid transfer to a&#xD;
      sterile polypropylene tube and storage at -80°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarker Immunoassays Saliva and serum samples were thawed on ice. The saliva samples were&#xD;
      centrifuged at 5.000 rpm for 15 minutes at room temperature, and supernatants were&#xD;
      immediately used for assays. Serum and salivary samples of MMP-8 , M-CSF*, MIP-1α*, MAF ,&#xD;
      IL-34 in were measured by ELISA using commercial kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses were carried out with the standard statistical&#xD;
      software package. For the intra-group comparisons, if the data were not normally disturbed,&#xD;
      Friedman test and the Dunn test with the Bonferroni correction were used to analyze the&#xD;
      change between baseline and 1 month and 3 months after treatment. For inter-group&#xD;
      comparisons, Mann-Whitney U test for normally and non-normally disturbed data. The Spearman's&#xD;
      rank correlation test was used to detect the correlations of biochemical parameters with&#xD;
      clinical parameters and each others in diseased group before and after treatment. All tests&#xD;
      were performed at significance level of P &lt;0.05.&#xD;
