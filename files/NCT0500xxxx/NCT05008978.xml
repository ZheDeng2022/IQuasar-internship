    <textblock>
      The health benefits of fruits and their importance in a healthy diet have long been known.&#xD;
      Several intervention studies have included the promotion of fruit as part of the healthy diet&#xD;
      and epidemiologic evidences have demonstrated that a diet rich in fruits is associated with&#xD;
      the reduction in the risk of many chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes. Such&#xD;
      beneficial health effects of fruits could be attributed to the presence of dietary fiber,&#xD;
      micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), antioxidants and phytochemicals found in them.&#xD;
      However, up to our knowledge, no study has investigate the time-course effects on the&#xD;
      co-ingestion of fruits with other food product on postprandial glycaemic response (GR) and&#xD;
      insulinaemic response (IR). The time-course effect will be examined in this study in order to&#xD;
      determine its optimal effect on GR and IR. The investigators also aimed to compare the&#xD;
      effects of varying micronutrients content in fruits on GR and IR.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is one of the most common non-communicable diseases found in 415 million&#xD;
      adults worldwide in 2015 and the number is expected to increase to 642 million in 2040. This&#xD;
      has serious consequences for healthcare expenditure as it has been estimated that the global&#xD;
      health expenditure on diabetes is at least USD$673 billion in 2015 and is forecasted to&#xD;
      increase to USD$802 billion in 2040. This creates a major public health burden and effective&#xD;
      treatments and prevention strategies are necessary. The Asian phenotype has been shown to be&#xD;
      more susceptible to diabetes compared to the Western phenotype where more than half (56%) of&#xD;
      the population with type 2 diabetes lived in the South-East Asia Region or the Western&#xD;
      Pacific Region in 2015.Pharmacological methods through the use of drugs and insulin remains&#xD;
      as the conventional strategy in the management of type 2 diabetes. However, in recent years,&#xD;
      dietary interventions have been used as a mean to prevent or delay the onset of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. Food has now become the new medicine and a healthy diet is widely believed to play&#xD;
      an important role in the prevention of the development of type 2 diabetes.The health benefits&#xD;
      of fruits and their importance in a healthy diet have long been established. Several&#xD;
      intervention studies have included the promotion of fruit as part of the healthy diet with&#xD;
      epidemiological evidences demonstrating that a diet rich in fruits is associated with a&#xD;
      reduction in the risk of many chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes. Such beneficial&#xD;
      health effects of fruits may be attributed to the presence of dietary fibre, micronutrients&#xD;
      (vitamins and minerals), antioxidants and phytochemicals found in them. However, to our&#xD;
      knowledge, no study has investigated the time-course effects of co-ingesting fruits with a&#xD;
      carbohydrate-based food product on postprandial glycaemic response (GR) and insulinaemic&#xD;
      response (IR). GR and IR is the effect a food product has on blood glucose and insulin levels&#xD;
      respectively, after consumption. Better control of GR and IR were found to be associated with&#xD;
      a lower risk of development of type 2 diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases. Studies&#xD;
      have shown that soluble dietary fibre, which are found in fruits, decrease the rise in blood&#xD;
      glucose and insulin level. Addition of fibre as a food ingredient was also found to modulate&#xD;
      glucose response by improving insulin sensitivity. Antioxidants and phytochemicals in fruits&#xD;
      have also been hypothesized to improve insulin sensitivity and hence protect against&#xD;
      diabetes. In the second part of the study, the investigators aim to compare the effects of&#xD;
      varying micronutrients content in fruits on GR and IR. Fruits have highly variable contents&#xD;
      of fibre, antioxidants, other nutrients, and phytochemicals that may jointly influence the&#xD;
      risk of metabolic diseases. It has been reported that the consumption of higher anthocyanins&#xD;
      content had an inverse relationship with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Varying&#xD;
      content of resveratrol, chlorogenic acid and naringin have also been reported to have an&#xD;
      association with the risk of type 2 diabetes in animal studies. Due to the heterogeneous&#xD;
      composition found in fruits, it may be plausible that different fruits have varying effects&#xD;
      on GR and IR. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that varying micronutrients content&#xD;
      in fruit plays an essential role in the association with diabetes risk due to a difference in&#xD;
      GR and IR. In this proposed study, the investigators will thus determine whether different&#xD;
      micronutrients content present in different fruits have an effect on postprandial on GR and&#xD;
      IR.&#xD;
