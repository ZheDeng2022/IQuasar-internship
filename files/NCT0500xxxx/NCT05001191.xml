    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled experimental study is planned in order to determine the effect of&#xD;
      gentle human touch on pain, comfort and physiological parameters in preterm infants during&#xD;
      heel lancing matched for gestational age, gender and birth weight. The study will be&#xD;
      performed with preterm infants hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit of a tertiary&#xD;
      hospital. Ethical committee approval, institutional permission, parental written consent were&#xD;
      obtained. The therapeutic touch will be applied 10 minutes before the heel lancing, it will&#xD;
      continue during and after the procedure, a total of 15 minutes of sensitive touch will be&#xD;
      applied. The practitioner will place one hand on the baby's head and the other hand on the&#xD;
      lower abdomen covering the waist and hips of the preterm baby for 15 minutes. Before and&#xD;
      after the study the following were evaluated in preterm infants in the gentle human touch and&#xD;
      control group: pain, comfort and physiological parameters.&#xD;

      This randomized controlled experimental study is planned in order to determine the effect of&#xD;
      gentle human touch on pain, comfort and physiological parameters in preterm infants during&#xD;
      heel lancing matched for gestational age, gender and birth weight. The research sample will&#xD;
      consist of 60 preterm infants who meet the inclusion criteria. In the literature, the number&#xD;
      of infants varies between 11 and 38 in different studies in which gentle human touch was&#xD;
      applied to preterm infants. In this study, it was decided that the number of infants in the&#xD;
      groups should be 30 according to Î±=95% confidence level and 90% power. In the study, it was&#xD;
      planned to have 30 infants in the gentle human touch (GHT) and control groups. After reaching&#xD;
      60 preterm infants in the study, power analysis will be calculated using pain scores and it&#xD;
      will be decided whether the sample size is sufficient or not. The infants in the GHT group&#xD;
      will be applied gentle human touch for a total of 15 minutes, starting 10 minutes before the&#xD;
      heel lancing and continuing during the heel lancing. The infants in the control group will&#xD;
      not be subjected to any intervention other than their clinical routines, only observation&#xD;
      will be made. Being 32-37 gestational age weeks, being birth weight of 1500 g and above,&#xD;
      without a congenital anomaly, not having any disease at birth such as neonatal asphyxia,&#xD;
      hemolytic status, metabolic disease, skin disease, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA),&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and sepsis, no chest tube, not connected to a mechanical&#xD;
      ventilator, not having intracranial bleeding, not taking any medication other than&#xD;
      antibiotics and vitamin supplements, not taking opiates and sedatives within 4 hours before&#xD;
      heel lancing, no painful intervention is applied at least one hour before the heel lancing,&#xD;
      preterm infants whose mothers gave verbal and written consent will be included in the study.&#xD;
      Data will be collected with the Questionnare Form, Physiological Parameters Observation Form,&#xD;
      Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), Premature Infant Comfort Scale (PBIC) and Pulse Oximeter.&#xD;

    <description>According to the PICS, a score between 7-35 is obtained from the scale. A high score from the scale indicates a low level of comfort. Change= (before the heel lancing, during the heel lancing and after heel lancing 15. minute )</description>
