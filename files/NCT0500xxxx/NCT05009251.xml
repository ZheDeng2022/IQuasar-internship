  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study team previously demonstrated that patients are more likely to receive flu vaccine&#xD;
      after learning that they are at high risk for flu complications. Building on this past work,&#xD;
      the present study will explore whether providing reasons that patients are considered high&#xD;
      risk for flu complications (a) further increases the likelihood they will receive flu vaccine&#xD;
      and (b) decreases the likelihood that they receive diagnoses of flu and/or flu-like symptoms&#xD;
      in the ensuing flu season. It will also examine whether informing patients that their&#xD;
      high-risk status was determined by analyzing their medical records or by an artificial&#xD;
      intelligence (AI) / machine-learning (ML) algorithm analyzing their medical records will&#xD;
      affect the likelihood of receiving the flu vaccine or diagnoses of flu and/or flu-like&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Geisinger has partnered with Medial EarlySign and developed an ML algorithm to identify&#xD;
      patients at risk for serious (moderate to severe) flu-associated complications on the basis&#xD;
      of their existing electronic health record (EHR) data. Geisinger will apply this algorithm to&#xD;
      current patients during the 2021-22 flu season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the effect of contacting patients identified as high risk with&#xD;
      special messages to encourage vaccination. These communications will inform patients they are&#xD;
      at high risk with either (a) no additional explanation, (b) an explanation that this&#xD;
      determination comes from an analysis of their medical records, along with a short list of the&#xD;
      top factors from their medical record that explain their risk, and (c) the additional&#xD;
      explanation that an AI or ML algorithm made this determination, along with a short list of&#xD;
      the top factors from their medical record that explain their risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included in the study will be current Geisinger patients 18+ years of age with no&#xD;
      contraindications for flu vaccine and who have been assessed by the Medial algorithm and&#xD;
      assigned a risk score. The primary study outcomes will be the rates of flu vaccination and&#xD;
      flu diagnosis during the 2020-21 season by targeted patients.&#xD;
