  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose escalation, dose expansion and extension cohort phase 1 study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor activity of&#xD;
      SYSA1801&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study includes two stages. The dose escalation and dose expansion part (Stage I) will&#xD;
      determine the MTD and RP2D of SYSA1801 in subjects with advanced solid tumor for which there&#xD;
      is no available standard likely to confer clinical benefit based on a modified 3+3 dose&#xD;
      escalation design (an accelerated dose titration design followed by traditional 3+3 dose&#xD;
      escalation design) The extension cohort (Stage II) will evaluate the preliminary efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of SYSA1801 in subjects with Claudin 18.2 positive gastric cancer (GC),&#xD;
      gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer, pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and&#xD;
      other solid tumors who have relapsed and/or are refractory to approved therapies.&#xD;

    <description>Stage I: Dose Escalation and dose expansion： Dose Escalation：SYSA1801 will be administered intravenously (IV) at different dose levels, including 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4.5 and 6 mg/kg according to a modified 3+3 dose-escalation design. Accelerated dose titration design will be used for the first 2 dose levels (0.5 and 1 mg/kg), and then traditional 3+3 dose escalation design will be used for the following levels (2, 3, 4.5 and 6 mg/kg).&#xD;
Dose expansion: SYSA 1801 will be administered at up to dose levels which is equal or lower than MTD IV infusion. Each dose level contains no more than 12 subjects (including subjects in dose escalation) Stage II: Extension cohort This cohort will comprise subjects with Claudin 18.2 positive GC or GEJ adenocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer or other solid cancer with prior failure of, progression on, or intolerance to, standard therapy.&#xD;
