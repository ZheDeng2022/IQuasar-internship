  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart Failure (HF) is a complex disease associated with the highest burden of cost to the&#xD;
      healthcare system. The cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) is instrumental in determining&#xD;
      the prognosis of patients with HF. This study will evaluate whether aggregate biometric data&#xD;
      from the Apple Watch combined with demographic, cardiac, and biomarker testing can improve&#xD;
      our ability to predict heart failure outcomes among a diverse ambulatory HF population&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart Failure (HF) has a prevalence of 3.5% suggesting that over one million Canadians are&#xD;
      affected by this disease, and more than 50,000 are newly diagnosed each year. This complex&#xD;
      disease is associated with the highest burden of cost to the healthcare system, attributable&#xD;
      to hospitalizations, missed work, medications, and health care services&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, clinicians have relied on static snapshots of patients to determine clinical&#xD;
      status and estimate prognosis. More advanced cardiac centers rely on cardiopulmonary exercise&#xD;
      testing (CPET), where patients are further stratified based on validated exercise parameters.&#xD;
      CPET remains underutilized and resource-intensive. It requires expensive equipment,&#xD;
      proficient personnel, and clinicians with specialized training. Thus, there is an unmet need&#xD;
      for a more widely available, accessible, and longitudinal assessment of clinical status to&#xD;
      better monitor and prognosticate patients outside of the ambulatory setting. Wearable devices&#xD;
      such as the Apple Watch hold great promise in this regard, as they provide near-continuous&#xD;
      monitoring of biometric data. By combining biometric data with demographic, cardiac, and&#xD;
      biomarker testing, the investigators will significantly improve our ability to predict heart&#xD;
      failure outcomes such as early warning of decompensation, clinical deterioration (symptoms&#xD;
      and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) as a surrogate), hospitalization, mortality (using the&#xD;
      Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM) as a surrogate), and/or need for advanced heart failure&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study has 5 research questions based on 2 primary outcomes and 3 secondary outcomes in&#xD;
      clinically diverse adult ambulatory heart failure patients :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can biometric data obtained from the Apple Watch be used to estimate cardiorespiratory&#xD;
           fitness, as assessed by CPET?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does the 'predicted' Apple 6 MW estimate correlate with formal 6 MWT?&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is there a relationship between novel biosensors, including oxygen saturation, and&#xD;
           markers of poor prognosis specifically as defined by the SHFM, BNP, Quality of life&#xD;
           (QOL) indicators, and CPET parameters?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Can surrogates of cardiorespiratory fitness obtained from the Apple Watch, including&#xD;
           novel biosensors, predict acute decompensation of heart failure as defined rapid clinic&#xD;
           visits, need for IV diuretics, ED visits, heart failure hospitalization and unscheduled&#xD;
           health care encounters during the 3-month follow-up?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Can biometric data be used to improve a risk prediction model that can distinguish&#xD;
           between patients at high versus low risk of all-cause hospitalization (primary outcome),&#xD;
           all-cause mortality (secondary outcome), and a composite outcome of all-cause mortality,&#xD;
           need for ventricular assist device, or heart transplantation (secondary composite&#xD;
           outcome) over a 2 year period?&#xD;
