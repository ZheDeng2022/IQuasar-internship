      Brief Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will record hemodynamic data from 20 healthy volunteers at rest and during moderate&#xD;
      bicycle exercise in the recumbent and half sitting position for the following purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study 1 Testing the overall accuracy and the dependence on changes in posture and&#xD;
      exercise of a new non-invasive blood pressure sensor against simultaneous invasive&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study 2 Exploration of the effect of exercise and position on cardiac energy delivery to&#xD;
      the circulation. The interplay between heart and vasculature (Ventriculo-arterial coupling)&#xD;
      will be characterized based on simultaneous blood pressure and ultrasound blood flow&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study 3 Evaluation and possible improvement of an individualized mechanistic model&#xD;
      predicting the hemodynamic response to exercise based on hemodynamic profile at rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study 4 Testing of a machine learning based system for evaluation of dynamic&#xD;
      autoregulation of renal blood flow from simultaneous continuous blood pressure and ultrasound&#xD;
      blood flow measurements.&#xD;

      Sub-study 1 A new non-invasive blood pressure sensor designed to give continuous blood&#xD;
      pressure signals from ambulatory persons has been developed at NTNU (Norwegian University of&#xD;
      Technology and Science). In this sub study we will test the ability of this new device to&#xD;
      correctly represent the invasive blood pressure measurements and if its accuracy is affected&#xD;
      by changes in posture and activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new sensor is an armband carried around the distal forearm. We will evaluate the degree&#xD;
      of correspondence with invasive blood pressure measurements from the probands' other arm. The&#xD;
      study's primary goal is to compare paired, beat-to-beat numeric values for systolic,&#xD;
      diastolic, and mean arterial pressures during each study period, As a secondary study goal&#xD;
      the accordance of the arterial curve waveforms, in these periods will also be compared.&#xD;
      Overall performance and data from each separate study period will be reported. The effect of&#xD;
      changes in posture and activity on the convergence between invasive and non-invasive&#xD;
      measurements will be assessed by comparison of four repeated recordings in recumbent and half&#xD;
      sitting positions, namely: at rest and during bicycle exercise of 50, 100 and 150 Watts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study 2 Changes in posture and exercise level are both known to affect cardiac output and&#xD;
      blood pressure, and thus the energy transfer from the heart to the circulation. The amount of&#xD;
      energy can be assessed by multiplying invasive blood pressure recordings with synchronized&#xD;
      transthoracic ultrasound measurement of blood flow through the aortic valve. The study's&#xD;
      primary goal is to investigate the effect of exercise and position on cardiac energy delivery&#xD;
      to the circulation in normal subjects. From the synchronized measurements of blood pressure&#xD;
      and blood flow two separate parameters describing energy transfer are calculated, Total&#xD;
      Cardiac Power, and Cardiac Power Output, both given in Watts. The former includes the energy&#xD;
      associated with oscillations in flow and pressure, the latter does not. Oscillatory power is&#xD;
      calculated as the difference: Total Cardiac Power - Cardiac Power Output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Energy transfer from the heart to the vasculature depends not only on the heart's&#xD;
      contractility but also on systemic vascular resistance and aortic elastance. Cardio-vascular&#xD;
      interaction will be investigated as a secondary study goal. Two methods will be used, both&#xD;
      based on the combination of cardiac ultrasound and invasive arterial pressure. The first of&#xD;
      these, Single beat Ventriculo-Arterial Coupling calculates Ae/Ees (Aortic elastance/Left&#xD;
      ventricular elastance) that requires cardiac catheterization, from a combination of several&#xD;
      less invasive variables. Despite complicated calculation this method has become increasingly&#xD;
      popular in clinical research over the last years. Newly Oscillatory Power Fraction, i.e.&#xD;
      Oscillatory Power/Total Cardiac Power was proposed as an alternative. This parameter is much&#xD;
      easier calculated but little data confirm its reliability as a measure of cardio-vascular&#xD;
      interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated synchronized ultrasound and arterial pressure measurements during the same postures&#xD;
      and bicycle workloads as described in Sub study 1 will be compared to assess the effects of&#xD;
      exercise level and posture on energy transfer and, cardio-vascular interaction in healthy&#xD;
      persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study 3 A simple mechanistic model has been established predicting individual hemodynamic&#xD;
      responses to exercise based on demographic data and the hemodynamic profile at rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main idea of this sub-study is to test this model by comparing the individually predicted&#xD;
      hemodynamic values for each specific combination of posture and exercise applied in&#xD;
      sub-studies 1 and 2 to the actual individual hemodynamic responses recorded in the study&#xD;
      subjects. The overall result will be analyzed for determination of the model's predictive&#xD;
      power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a second goal, a detailed analysis will be performed for detection of possible&#xD;
      improvements of the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study 4 Impaired Dynamic Autoregulation of Renal Blood Flow may be an early warning&#xD;
      signal in intensive care patients developing Acute Kidney Injury. However, assessment of the&#xD;
      kidney's autoregulation mechanisms Myogenic Response (MR) and Tubulo-Glomerular Feedback&#xD;
      (TGF) depends on simultaneous continuous recordings of blood pressure and flow signals from&#xD;
      renal arteries for several minutes. This is challenging as the kidneys move with respiration,&#xD;
      and we consequently developed a system for machine learning assisted ultrasound recording of&#xD;
      flow velocities in renal arteries. A high-end ordinary ultrasound scanner will be used for a&#xD;
      four minutes recording in recumbent and resting probands. Synchronized blood pressure curves&#xD;
      are recorded from the indwelling arterial cannula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of MR and TGF function will be performed by off-line transfer function frequency&#xD;
      analyses with blood pressure as input and flow velocities as output. Different machine&#xD;
      learning methods and different approaches to the transfer function analysis will be tested to&#xD;
      determine their ability to detect dynamic autoregulation of renal blood flow in normal&#xD;
      subjects, and which method(s) perform(s) the best.&#xD;
