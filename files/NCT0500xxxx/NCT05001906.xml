      Physical activity, defined as any movement of the body produced by the contraction of&#xD;
      skeletal muscles in all phases of life, maintains and improves cardiorespiratory capacity,&#xD;
      reduces the risk of obesity and associated comorbidities. The study will analyze the effect&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Physical activity, defined as any movement of the body produced by the contraction of&#xD;
      skeletal muscles in all phases of life, maintains and improves cardiorespiratory capacity,&#xD;
      reduces the risk of obesity and associated comorbidities. The incidence of a sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyle during pregnancy ranges from 64.5 to 91.5% and tends to increase in the third&#xD;
      trimester. This has a negative impact on the quality of life and contributes to the obesity&#xD;
      epidemic in pregnant women. Physical inactivity and excessive weight gain during pregnancy&#xD;
      increase the risk of gestational diabetes and pregnancy-induced hypertension. In pregnancy,&#xD;
      the circulatory system adapts to adequately supply the needs of the mother and fetus.&#xD;
      Physical activity is considered a preventive measure for the diseases of the cardiovascular&#xD;
      system in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will analyze the effect of prenatal exercise on circulatory functional and&#xD;
      structural parameters and gestational weight gain in pregnant women who exercised regularly,&#xD;
      compared to pregnant women who did not exercise regularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first phase of the study, an experimental and control group will be formed. The&#xD;
      prenatal exercise program will be conducted with the experimental group for 8 weeks. The&#xD;
      control group will not exercise, will have standard prenatal care, and attend classes of&#xD;
      theoretical classes on childbirth. Respondents in both groups will fill out a questionnaire&#xD;
      from which the data will be obtained: age, height, bodyweight before pregnancy. Data on the&#xD;
      week of pregnancy will be obtained from the medical documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prenatal exercise program was made according to the recommendations of the American&#xD;
      College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG recommendations) and the guidelines of the&#xD;
      Croatian Association of Physiotherapists for Women's Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise program is presented with: muscle stretching exercises and muscle strength&#xD;
      exercises, exercises to strengthen the abdominal wall muscles, exercises to strengthen the&#xD;
      thigh muscles - quadriceps femoris (lat. musculus quadriceps femoris), to strengthen gluteal&#xD;
      muscles, exercises to increase pelvic mobility, exercise to improve circulation, as well as&#xD;
      pelvic floor muscle training with breathing and relaxation techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bodyweight will be measured at the beginning of the test, at the end of the exercise program,&#xD;
      and at the end of the pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure data will be obtained by measuring blood pressure with a mercury manometer&#xD;
      with a mercury column, in both groups: at the beginning of the study and the end of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The shape of capillary loops and the number of capillary loops of the nail skin fold will be&#xD;
      analyzed with nailfold capillaroscopy in both groups of subjects: at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study and after 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase of the work, the collected data will be processed by methods of&#xD;
      descriptive and parametric statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The obtained results will be presented at the third phase of the work.&#xD;

    <time_frame>20-32 weeks of gestation</time_frame>
    <description>The blood pressure of pregnant women would be measured using a standard mercury manometer and compared in between study groups. In the experimental group, blood pressure would be measured at the beginning of prenatal exercises, between 20 and 32 weeks of gestation. In the control group, blood pressure would be measured at the beginning of theoretical classes, between 20 and 32 weeks of gestation.</description>

    <description>Using a standard mercury manometer blood pressure would be measured in the experimental group after eight weeks of prenatal exercises (between 28 and 40 weeks of gestation) and in the control group after eight weeks of theoretical classes (between 28 and 40 weeks of gestation).</description>
