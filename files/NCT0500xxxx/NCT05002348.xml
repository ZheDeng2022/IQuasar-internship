  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the aging of today's population, stroke is the top three causes of disability and death&#xD;
      among people over the age of 60 in the world. About 5.5 million people die each year from&#xD;
      strokes in Taiwan, and Taiwan's top ten causes of death in cerebrovascular disease rank&#xD;
      fourth in the world. Constipation is the most common complication of stroke patients and&#xD;
      increases the risk of brain damage and re-stroke. Although the clinical use of drugs can&#xD;
      relieve intestinal symptoms, there is also a risk of potential side effects. The systematic&#xD;
      literature points out that the use of acupoint stimulation can improve spontaneous bowel&#xD;
      movements and promote bowel motility, but there is no conclusion on effective acupuncture&#xD;
      points. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to improve the constipation of patients with&#xD;
      stroke by non-invasive and precise acupoint care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study used a single-blind randomized control trial. The neurosurgery ward of a medical&#xD;
      center in the north was used as the research site, and patients with ischemic stroke were&#xD;
      used as the research objects. The experimental group received precision acupoint care, and&#xD;
      the control group received routine care. The questionnaire was used to collect basic patient&#xD;
      information (basic attributes, disease care and TCM constitution), and gut-related&#xD;
      assessments. Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS 22.0 software for descriptive&#xD;
      statistical analysis and inferential statistical analysis, and p &lt;.05 was considered to have&#xD;
      statistical significance.&#xD;

      Research purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Explore the effect of acupoint stimulation on constipation in stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explore the effect of acupoint stimulation on bowel movement in patients with stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Explore the effect of acupoint stimulation on the quality of life of stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Selection criteria and number of people.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Number of subjects accepted: 100 people in this hospital The sample number is&#xD;
                estimated using G*power statistical software to estimate the number of samples to&#xD;
                be collected. The two-tailed test, the α value is 0.05, the power is 0.8, the&#xD;
                effect size is 0.25, and the estimated sample number is 86 people, each group is 43&#xD;
                people, considering the attrition rate of 20%, so the number of people in each&#xD;
                group is 50, and the total number of people is 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Conditions of inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
                1. Patients who are twenty years old and above who are diagnosed with ischemic&#xD;
                stroke combined with constipation. 2. A clear awareness and can communicate in&#xD;

&#xD;
                1. Patients undergoing intravenous injection of thrombolytic agent combined tissue&#xD;
                plasminogen activator (r-TPA), arterial thrombectomy (IA thrombectomy). 2. Imaging&#xD;
                shows patients with brainstem stroke. 3. Patients who have installed cardiac rhythm&#xD;
                devices or ventricular-abdominal shunt surgery. 4. Patients with abnormal blood&#xD;
                coagulation function (with obvious spontaneous bleeding). 5. Patients with&#xD;
                malignant tumors. 6. Patients with abnormal skin or obvious trauma at the location&#xD;
                of the acupuncture point. 7. There are patients who have undergone surgery on their&#xD;
                abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Recruitment method:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. During the morning meeting, the doctors announced the purpose of the study and&#xD;
                     the conditions for admission to let the doctors understand. 2. The ward&#xD;
                     meeting/morning meeting announces the research plan and acceptance conditions&#xD;
                     for the nurses to understand. 3. Check medical records and screen suitable&#xD;
                     cases from 11G patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The method of consent of the research subject: will be in the patient room 1. First let&#xD;
           the patient understand the purpose of the research and the process and method of&#xD;
           collecting data. If the patient feels uncomfortable during the research process, the&#xD;
           patient can withdraw and terminate the research at any time, without affecting their&#xD;
           original treatment and care . 2. The admission process must first obtain the written&#xD;
           consent of the patient and the attending physician before accepting the case.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research design:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The method of research: the research plan is approved by the IRB of our hospital →&#xD;
                the subject who meets the conditions is asked for consent according to the&#xD;
                acceptance criteria, and the consent form is signed → basic information and&#xD;
                pre-test questionnaires → sub-control and experimental group acceptance Case →&#xD;
                post-test (before discharge) → follow-up (approximately one month after discharge).&#xD;
&#xD;
                Single-blind random assignment: When subjects are confirmed to have constipation,&#xD;
                they will be given an envelope bag and randomly coded into groups after seeking&#xD;
                their consent. They are divided into experimental and control groups, and the&#xD;
                patient will not be told whether they belong to the experimental or the control&#xD;
                group.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The method of implementation of the measures: the subject of the case will be given&#xD;
                a pre-test questionnaire immediately after completing the consent form of the&#xD;
                subject, and the personnel who have received acupoint picking training will be&#xD;
                provided with a separate hidden environment from Monday to Friday from Monday to&#xD;
                Friday, and the fixed site will be given non-invasively every day Acupuncture point&#xD;
                stimulation. The laser pen of the control group does not turn on the energy during&#xD;
                execution. The laser pen of the experimental group turns on the energy. The&#xD;
                acupoint stimulation is performed for about 3-5 minutes. Each acupoint is performed&#xD;
                once a day. The physiological monitor observes the patient's vital signs (blood&#xD;
                pressure, heartbeat and blood oxygen). If the patient has any discomfort, the&#xD;
                procedure will be stopped. The patient's defecation status will be&#xD;
                recorded/evaluated every day for up to 10 days (including Saturdays and Sundays),&#xD;
                on the day of discharge. That is, a post-test questionnaire will be conducted, and&#xD;
                the follow-up status will be asked by telephone within one month after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Subject follow-up or necessary rehabilitation plan: outpatient/telephone follow-up&#xD;
                after discharge, a total of one interview and follow-up within one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Treatment effect evaluation and statistical analysis methods: pre-test&#xD;
                questionnaires are conducted when admission is admitted, and then the patient's&#xD;
                defecation status, stool softener usage and bowel movements will be recorded daily.&#xD;
                The re-evaluation of the questionnaire before discharge is a post-test. SPSS 22.0&#xD;
                filed for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Questionnaire or other research-related materials: The questionnaire contains:&#xD;
                basic information questionnaire, TCM physical fitness classification criteria,&#xD;
                constipation patient quality of life self-rating scale, Bayesian anxiety scale,&#xD;
                patient constipation symptom scale, Bristol stool Classification table, visual&#xD;
                analogy scale for constipation symptoms, constipation assessment scale.&#xD;
