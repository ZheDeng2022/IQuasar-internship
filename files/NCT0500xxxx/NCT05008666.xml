  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ENKTL is a highly aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma closely related to EBV infection，and&#xD;
      advanced patients often suffer from hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). ENKTL-HLH lacks&#xD;
      standard treatment and experiences a extremely poor prognosis. Anti-PD-1 antibody has shown&#xD;
      good anti-tumor activity in ENKTL and play a potential role in EBV-HLH. Epigenetic drugs have&#xD;
      been confirmed to exert synergistic anti-tumor activity with anti-PD-1 antibody. We next&#xD;
      further explore the efficacy and safety of Sintilimab sequential combination of epigenetic&#xD;
      drugs in ENKTL-HLH.&#xD;
