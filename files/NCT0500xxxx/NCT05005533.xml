    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease is a multifaceted disease that results from the&#xD;
      interaction between genetic susceptibility and exposure to environmental stimuli. Due to the&#xD;
      slow progression and chronic nature of the disease, it creates a growing disease burden on&#xD;
      the individual. Considering the data of the Turkish Statistical Institute, the third most&#xD;
      common cause of death in Turkey in 2010, 2011 and 2012 was respiratory system diseases. 61.5%&#xD;
      of respiratory system deaths in 2012 were due to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Due&#xD;
      to the progressive airway obstruction that occurs in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,&#xD;
      the level of inspiratory muscle strength is restricted and there is an increasing&#xD;
      deterioration in the level of functional performance. However, with increasing age, postural&#xD;
      problems can be observed in individuals with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Postural&#xD;
      problems such as rounded shoulders, increase in thoracic kyphosis and muscle shortness can be&#xD;
      observed especially in patients who start to use the auxiliary respiratory muscles&#xD;
      continuously due to inspiratory muscle strength. There are few articles investigating the&#xD;
      changes in posture, physical performance and inspiratory muscles with the addition of a&#xD;
      chronic disease such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease to the normal aging process.&#xD;
      For this reason, a study titled &quot;The effect of respiratory muscle strength and functional&#xD;
      capacity on posture and balance in individuals with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease&#xD;
      with Different Phenotypes&quot; was planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of the study, inspiratory muscle strength, posture and physical performance&#xD;
      evaluations of individuals with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease will be made, and&#xD;
      suggestions will be made to help individual postural smoothness and improve physical&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;

    <measure>Maximal Inspiratory Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory muscle strength will be assessed by maximal inspiratory pressure. Values in the normal range indicate normal respiratory muscle strength, low values indicate decreased respiratory muscle strength.</description>

    <measure>Posture Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Posture assessment of individuals will be done with the Spinal Mouse device. Individuals will be asked to distribute their weight equally on both lower extremities as much as possible and to stand symmetrically. The angular deviation between each SPINE will be calculated as an angle. While the high angle of deviation indicates that the posture is bad; A low angle of deviation indicates a good posture</description>

    <measure>Biodex Balance System</measure>

    <description>Balance assessment will be evaluated with the Biodex Balance System. A high values indicates poor balance, and a low values indicates good balance.</description>

    <measure>Time Up and Go Test</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Time Up and Go Test is a balance test that is frequently used to evaluate the functional mobility of individuals. High times indicate impaired functional mobility; low times indicate good functional mobility.</description>

    <measure>Short Physical Performance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The physical performance of the lower extremities of the individuals will be evaluated with the Short Physical Performance Test. High values indicate deterioration of physical performance; low values indicate good physical performance.</description>

    <measure>Modified Medical Research Council Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The breath assessment test will be evaluated with the Modified Medical Research Council Scale. High values indicate high dyspnea; low values indicate low dyspnea.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Leicester Cough Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The cough related quality of life questionnaire will be assessed by the Leicester Cough Questionnaire. Low values indicate poor quality of life associated with cough; high values indicate good quality of life associated with cough</description>

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale</measure>
