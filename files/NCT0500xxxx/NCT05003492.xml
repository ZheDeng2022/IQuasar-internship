      SARS-CoV-2 represents the largest current health challenge for the society. Moreover,&#xD;
      numerous variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 are being tracked in the United States&#xD;
      and globally during this pandemic. Here, we will use combination therapy which involve agents&#xD;
      with significant activity and different mechanisms of action against covid-19 and its&#xD;
      inflammatory complication. Excessive activities of cysteinyl cathepsins (CysCts) contribute&#xD;
      to the progress of many diseases. however, therapeutic inhibition has been problematic.&#xD;
      Cathepsin L are crucial in terms of the endocytosis by cleaving the spike protein, which&#xD;
      permits viral membrane fusion with endosomal membrane, and succeeded by the releasing of&#xD;
      viral genome to the host cell. Thereby, inhibition of cathepsin L may be advantageous in&#xD;
      terms of decreasing infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. It is well known that zinc (Zn) possesses&#xD;
      a variety of direct and indirect antiviral properties, which are realized through different&#xD;
      mechanisms. Administration of Zn supplement has a potential to enhance antiviral immunity and&#xD;
      to restore depleted immune cell function, in particular in immunocompromised patients. It has&#xD;
      been found that Zn 2+ deficiency leads to an exaggerated activity of Cysteine cathepsin&#xD;
      increasing the autoimmune/inflammatory response. . Zn2+ is a natural inhibitor of proteases&#xD;
      with CysHis dyads or CysHis(Xaa) triads. cysteine protease Cathepsin L (CatL) involvement&#xD;
      with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19 from different&#xD;
      points of view. At this purpose Zn 2+ metal can be safely combined with phenformin a drug&#xD;
      that increases the anti-proteolytic effect of endogenous Zn 2+ lowering the excessive&#xD;
      activity of some CysCts.; A study found that phenformin-Zn2+ complex is identified as a&#xD;
      modifiable pharmacophore for synthesis of therapeutic CysCt inhibitors with a wide range of&#xD;
      potencies and specificities. Phenformin stabilizes a &quot;Zn2+ sandwich&quot; between the drug and&#xD;
      protease active site. Additionally, phenformin was found to be potent inhibitor of IL-6 R,&#xD;
      with phenformin (100 µM) treatment for 48 h, decreased IL-6R expression in ANBL6, RPMI, U266,&#xD;
      MM1S, and JJN3 was 5.51 (p = 0.0025), 3.03 (p = 0.0005), 1.55 (p &lt; 0.05), 2.09 (p = 0.0082)&#xD;
      and 1.19-fold, respectively. Furthermore, phenformin was discovered to potentially and&#xD;
      strongly bind to ACE2 receptors, according to a docking research being conducted by the&#xD;
      principle investigators of this clinical study therefore, Phenformin is expected to&#xD;
      potentially attach to ACE2 receptors and lead to its downregulation, an inhibitory mechanism&#xD;
      which may combat and block COVID-19 infection in lung epithelial cells. Phenformin may induce&#xD;
      lactic acidosis therefore according to the principal investigator The phenformin will be&#xD;
      utilized as aerosolized by inhalation for COVID-19 treatment and this may be an effective&#xD;
      novel treatment strategy that would limit the risk of systemic side-effects associated with&#xD;
      biguanides due to the low inhaled dose. In addition, we will use aerosolized phenformin in&#xD;
      combination with methylene blue. A study found that a very marked improvement in lactate and&#xD;
      pyruvate concentrations occurred within six hours of the beginning of méthylène blue&#xD;
      administration in human . It has been known for some time that méthylène blue is a moderately&#xD;
      efficient hydrogen acceptor in several enzyme sys¬ tems and significantly reduce oxidative&#xD;
      stress by scavenging ROS. Moreover, Methylene Blue has antiviral activity and was found to&#xD;
      Inhibit the Spike-ACE2 Protein-Protein Interaction-a Mechanism that can contribute to its&#xD;
      Antiviral Activity Against COVID-19 For many reasons, methylene blue is a promising drug for&#xD;
      an active treatment against SARS-CoV-2 . Since methylene blue can work as a photosensitizer,&#xD;
      photodynamic therapy as an antiviral treatment has great potential in the treatment of&#xD;
      COVID-19.. This clinical study will investigate the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 infected&#xD;
      people treatment using methylene blue and the following photodynamic therapy after that our&#xD;
      clinically approved patients will receive phenformin and zinc . But methylene blue may lead&#xD;
      to lowering in potassium concentration.Therefore, we will add potassium supplement to this&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;

      The study is a randomized interventional comparative Phase I/II trial. 360 adult male and&#xD;
      female patients with positive COVID-19 diagnosis and fulfilling the below outlined inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      --Promising features of our clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Il-6 inhibition strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Phenformin was found to be potent inhibitor of IL-6 R, with phenformin (100 µM)&#xD;
           treatment for 48 h, decreased IL-6R expression in ANBL6, RPMI, U266, MM1S, and JJN3 was&#xD;
           5.51 (p = 0.0025), 3.03 (p = 0.0005), 1.55 (p &lt; 0.05), 2.09 (p = 0.0082) and 1.19-fold,&#xD;
           respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Methylene blue inhibited IL-6 levels and attenuated Lung Injury Induced by Hindlimb&#xD;
           Ischemia Reperfusion in Rats.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. For many reasons, methylene blue is a promising drug for an active treatment against&#xD;
           SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Since methylene blue can work as a photosensitizer,&#xD;
           photodynamic therapy as an antiviral treatment has great potential in the treatment of&#xD;
           COVID-19. This clinical study investigated the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 infected&#xD;
           people treatment using methylene blue and the following photodynamic therapy&#xD;
