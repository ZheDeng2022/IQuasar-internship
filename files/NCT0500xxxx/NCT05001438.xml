    <textblock>
      &quot;Frozen shoulder&quot; disease is a pathological entity defined by the presence of a painful&#xD;
      shoulder accompanied by restricted mobility. It affects 2% of the population with a slight&#xD;
      predominance in women and the average age ranges between 40 and 60 years. The diagnosis of&#xD;
      frozen shoulder is clinical and by exclusion; it presents with constant pain, especially at&#xD;
      night, which increases on sudden mobilization, with restriction of at least two axes of&#xD;
      shoulder mobility, especially external rotation and abduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial treatment of these patients is always conservative and consists of the&#xD;
      association of pharmacological treatment (analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs) together&#xD;
      with a specific rehabilitation program. However, in many cases recovery is not complete and&#xD;
      many patients require additional more invasive treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydrodilation is a technique described in 1965 that consists of infiltrating 20-40 cc of&#xD;
      serum into the glenohumeral joint to distend the joint capsule. In most cases, it is also&#xD;
      associated with intra-articular corticosteroid and anesthetic infiltration to add an&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and anesthetic effect to joint distention. Several studies have shown good&#xD;
      results with this treatment, however, many patients persist with pain and significant&#xD;
      functional limitations despite this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Joint Mobilization Under general Anesthesia (MUA) is a more invasive alternative therapeutic&#xD;
      technique that consists of a controlled mobilization under general anesthesia to break the&#xD;
      synovial adhesions and the joint capsule, with the objective of increasing the range of&#xD;
      motion. Several studies have evaluated the effectiveness and safety of this treatment,&#xD;
      considered today a valid option for the treatment of frozen shoulder refractory to more&#xD;
      conservative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have already compared the effectiveness of hydrodilatation with MUA as&#xD;
      treatments for frozen shoulder. Jacob et al. demonstrated the same effectiveness between&#xD;
      hydrodilatation and MUA, however, MUA reported a higher rate of iatrogenesis: hemarthrosis&#xD;
      and lesions in the labrum, glenohumeral ligament or subscapularis ligament. However, there is&#xD;
      no study evaluating the synergy of both techniques in the treatment of painful shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to assess the clinical efficacy of the combination of&#xD;
      hydrodilatation and MUA in patients with frozen shoulder and to compare it with&#xD;
      hydrodilatation alone.&#xD;
