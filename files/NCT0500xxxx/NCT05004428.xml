  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this observational study, data from the recent past of patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus and chronic kidney disease will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a condition in which the body does not make enough of a&#xD;
      hormone called insulin or does not use insulin well. This results in high blood sugar levels.&#xD;
      About half of people with T2DM also have a condition called chronic kidney disease (CKD). In&#xD;
      people with CKD, the kidneys' ability to work as how it should decreases over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, researchers want to learn more about the CKD in T2DM patients in Alberta,&#xD;
      Canada. This will help them to know the chances to improve the care of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will look at the health information from adult men and women in Alberta who&#xD;
      were diagnosed with T2DM before 2018 and visited a doctor to have check-ups in 2018. They&#xD;
      will find out about how many of these people had CKD and how severe their CKD was. The&#xD;
      researchers will collect data about the age and gender of these patients, how long they had&#xD;
      T2DM and if they had other related medical problems. The researchers will also learn how&#xD;
      these patients were treated based on their kidney condition and how much money was spent on&#xD;
      these treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will collect information from the health records of about 270,000 patients with&#xD;
      T2DM who were living in Alberta, Canada. This information will come from the Alberta Kidney&#xD;
      Disease Network (AKDN) database. Besides this data collection, no further tests or&#xD;
      examinations are planned in this study.&#xD;
