    <textblock>
      Background: Both exercise and metformin are used to control blood glucose levels in patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), while no previous studies have investigated the effect&#xD;
      of resistance exercise combined with metformin versus aerobic exercise with metformin in T2DM&#xD;
      patients. This study was conducted to compare the effects of resistance exercise combined&#xD;
      with metformin versus aerobic exercise with metformin in T2DM patients.&#xD;

      Background: Both exercise and metformin are used to control blood glucose levels in patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), while no previous studies have investigated the effect&#xD;
      of resistance exercise combined with metformin versus aerobic exercise with metformin in T2DM&#xD;
      patients. This study was conducted to compare the effects of resistance exercise combined&#xD;
      with metformin versus aerobic exercise with metformin in T2DM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A total of fifty-seven T2DM patients with a mean age of 46.2±8.3 years were&#xD;
      randomized to three study groups; each group included nineteen patients. The first group&#xD;
      conducted a resistance exercise program (REP, 50-60% of 1RM, for 40-50 min) combined with&#xD;
      metformin, the second group conducted an aerobic exercise program (AEP, 50-70% maxHR, for&#xD;
      40-50 min) combined with metformin, and the third group received only metformin without&#xD;
      exercise intervention (Met group). The study program was conducted thrice weekly for&#xD;
      consecutive twelve weeks. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c),&#xD;
      homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and maximal oxygen uptake&#xD;
      (VO2max) were evaluated before and after study intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>The maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre and post 12-week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>It was assessed pre- and post-intervention on an electrical cycle ergometer (PravoMedics, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) based on an incremental cycling exercise test. The protocol was initiated with 2 min warming-up at a workload of 30W followed every 2 min by a 30W increase until the patient reaches volitional exhaustion.&#xD;
During exercise protocol, the oxygen consumption was measured using a breath-by-breath gas analyzer device (FitMate Cosmed, Rome, Italy). VO2max was estimated as the highest average value of 30-s. The technician encouraged the individuals during the last part of the test to generate the maximal effort until voluntary termination. 5-10 min after ending the incremental phase, VO2max value was verified through conducting a supramaximal constant effort to exhaustion based on the criteria for determining VO2max.</description>
