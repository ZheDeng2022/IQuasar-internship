    <textblock>
      This trial aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of colorectal survivors&#xD;
      approached and engaged in HINT and aims to assess the preliminary efficacy of HINT to improve&#xD;
      1) health insurance literacy and 2) financial burden related to medical cost concerns&#xD;
      colorectal survivors. The study investigators propose that, compared to the control arm (who&#xD;
      will receive a health insurance information guide, but will not receive the navigation&#xD;
      intervention), participants in the HINT intervention arm will have improved health insurance&#xD;
      literacy and decreased financial distress related to medical costs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With support from the American Cancer Society, Dr. Park designed a 4-session health insurance&#xD;
      navigation treatment program, Health Insurance Navigation Tools (HINT), that is currently&#xD;
      being delivered remotely, as a collaboration with the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. Given&#xD;
      the current insurance landscape and the additional insurance burden that adult colorectal&#xD;
      cancer survivors face, the present study seeks to conduct a pilot trial with the existing&#xD;
      health insurance intervention and EA survivorship cohort of adult colorectal cancer survivors&#xD;
      to improve health insurance literacy and decrease financial burden related to medical costs.&#xD;
      The present study seeks to develop and pilot a health insurance navigation program with adult&#xD;
      colorectal cancer survivors recruited from MGH. Patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer&#xD;
      have a higher risk of experiencing financial burden related to health care costs when&#xD;
      compared to patients diagnosed with other types of cancer. While many cancer survivors report&#xD;
      experiencing financial burden, financial burden is particularly acute among survivors of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. Outcomes of financial burden among colorectal cancer survivors include&#xD;
      lower health related quality of life, employment concerns, and delay or lack of engagement in&#xD;
      needed surveillance and follow-up care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding and navigating insurance benefits in the current landscape is crucial for&#xD;
      colorectal cancer survivors to obtain and utilize the health care that they need. With this&#xD;
      in mind, the study investigators propose to develop and pilot an insurance navigation&#xD;
      intervention to examine its feasibility and acceptability among colorectal cancer survivors&#xD;
      receiving care at the MGH.&#xD;
