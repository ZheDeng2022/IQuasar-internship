  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to compare the effects of progressive exercise therapy, administered&#xD;
      as a home program under the supervision of a physiotherapist, on adduction angle, pain,&#xD;
      functional status, quality of life, and kinesiophobia in individuals aged 18-64 years with a&#xD;
      hallux valgus angle of 15-40 degrees (mild-moderate).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the power analysis, 18 people will participate in the study. Individuals with&#xD;
      halluk valgus pain, deformity angle, balance, functional capacity, functionality, quality of&#xD;
      life and kinesiophobia will be evaluated.After the individuals are evaluated, they will be&#xD;
      randomly divided into 2 groups as the exercise group and the home exercise group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be instructed on wearing appropriate footwear (made of soft material, with&#xD;
      a wide round toe, with a normal heel height between 1 inch and 1.5 inches (2.5-3.8 cm). In&#xD;
      addition, in order to increase the awareness of the participants, they will be asked to focus&#xD;
      on how muscle activation feels during exercise and they will be asked to perform this&#xD;
      activation during daily living activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise program to be given to both groups will be the same, and will be applied with&#xD;
      bare feet 4 days a week for 8 weeks. The exercise program will be advanced as recommended in&#xD;
      the literature and 30 seconds of rest will be given between sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the evaluation, all exercises will be shown to the home exercise group and it will be&#xD;
      ensured that they are applied correctly. An illustrated and narrative exercise program&#xD;
      brochure containing information about exercise position, number of repetitions, contraction&#xD;
      time, rest time between sets, frequency and exercise diary will be given to the patient for&#xD;
      exercise follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of 8 weeks, the evaluations will be repeated by the same physiotherapist.&#xD;
