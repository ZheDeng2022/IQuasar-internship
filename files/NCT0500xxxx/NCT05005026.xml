  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if playing a virtual reality walking game can help&#xD;
      improve neuropathic pain in adults with chronic spinal cord injury.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many people with SCI experience neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is often described as&#xD;
      sharp, burning, or electric. 'Traditional' treatments often do not do a good job at reducing&#xD;
      neuropathic pain. Therefore, it is important to see if 'non-traditional' treatments might&#xD;
      work. Scientists think that neuropathic pain occurs in SCI because the sensations coming from&#xD;
      the eyes and up the spinal cord to the brain do not match what the brain thinks it told the&#xD;
      body to do. This 'mis-match' may result in changes in the brain that make neuropathic pain&#xD;
      possible. Virtual reality walking reduces this 'mis-match.' It does this by creating the&#xD;
      'illusion' that the person is walking. The brain then thinks it is telling the body to walk&#xD;
      AND the information coming from the eyes matches its instructions. This 'matching' may&#xD;
      reverse the brain changes that made neuropathic pain possible.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - final follow up (up to 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) measures pain intensity via 0-10 numeric rating scale 0-10 where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - final follow up (up to 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS) assesses the distinct pain qualities including sharpness, heat/cold, dullness, intensity, overall unpleasantness, and surface vs. deep pain. The NPS consists of 10 items. All the items are rated 0-10 scale, with higher score indicative of more neuropathic pain for each type of respective pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Interference</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - final follow up (up to 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The International Spinal Cord Injury Pain Basic Data Set version 2.0 interference assesses the degree to which pain interferes with day-to-day activities, mood, and sleep. Items are scored on a 0-10 numeric rating scale and scores are summed to yield an interference score ranging from 0 to 30. Higher scores indicate greater interference from pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post treatment change</measure>
    <time_frame>at follow up (up to 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Global Impression of Change is a one item 7 point Likert item assessing improvement of the participants overall status. Higher scores indicate less perceived improvement.&#xD;
Range of scores: 1-7</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mood</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - final follow up (up to 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Mood will be assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Participants will be asked to rate have how often they have been bothered by specific problems on a 4-point Likert scale. The items are summed to yield a score ranging from 0-27. Higher scores indicate worse mood.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - final follow up (up to 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life is assessed by the Satisfaction with Life Scale. This is a 5 item survey. Response options are a 7-point Likert scale. Items may be assessed individually or by summing items.&#xD;
Range of scores: 5-35. Higher scores indicate more satisfaction in life</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurological changes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) will be used to observe neurological changes. Pre and post study images will be compared by experienced researchers.</description>

    <description>Individuals playing VR game 1 will wear a head-mounted display to allow them to visualize virtual legs in the virtual environment. When wearing the display, individuals will see the legs and arms of their virtual avatar from a first-person perspective.&#xD;
Individuals will engage in virtual reality sessions in their home twice daily over the course of 10 days in a two-week period. Each daily session will take approximately 30 minutes, with 5-10 minutes dedicated to the virtual walking experience. Additionally, each daily session will be scheduled a minimum of 4 hours apart.</description>
