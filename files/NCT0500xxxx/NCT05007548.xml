    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 open-labeled study to compare the Ga68-Dolacga positron emission tomography&#xD;
      with computer tomography volumetry (CTV) and indocyanine green retention test (ICGR15) for&#xD;
      measurement of liver reserve among scheduled surgery operation patients. The goal is to&#xD;
      enroll 30 eligible subjects scheduled for surgery operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTV and ICGR15 will occur within 7 days prior to the imaging visit for all eligible subjects.&#xD;
      During the imaging visit (visit 2, Day 1), subjects will receive an iv bolus injection of&#xD;
      2.0±1.0 mCi Ga68-Dolacga Injection. Ga68-Dolacga PET will be kinetically performed 60 minutes&#xD;
      immediately after iv injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two follow-up visits (visit 3 at Day 7±2 and visit 4 at Day 14±2) will be conducted to&#xD;
      confirm subject well-being and to collect information about any new adverse events (if any).&#xD;
