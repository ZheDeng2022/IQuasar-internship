  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early-onset neonatal infection (EONI), occur within 7 days of birth. They are most often due&#xD;
      to Streptococcus B (GBS) and are associated with heavy and costly morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      The strategy combining antenatal detection (PV9) of GBS colonization and intrapartum&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy has led to a spectacular decrease in the number of GBS EONI's that have&#xD;
      become rare (0.3/1000 births). Current detection is based on the culture of a vaginal swab&#xD;
      taken between 35 and 38 SA. Because the positive predictive value of PV9 compared to a&#xD;
      culture on the day of delivery is 60%, two problems persist: i) 20% of women and newborns are&#xD;
      sometimes unnecessarily exposed to antibiotics with known short-term and long-term harmful&#xD;
      effects; ii) more than half of newborns developing EONI are born to mothers with negative&#xD;
      PV9. There is a risk of not treating intrapartum colonization when PV9 is negative, and&#xD;
      overtreating an uncolonized PV9-positive woman at the time of delivery. These inappropriate&#xD;
      antibiotic therapies generate additional maternal-fetal care, examinations, treatments and&#xD;
      hospitalizations with significant costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, a feasible, rapid, sensitive (90-95%) and specific (95-98%) PCR test (Xpert GBS,&#xD;
      CEPHEID) can be used to detect women colonized with GBS at the beginning of labor. A recent&#xD;
      study (submitted for publication) including 782 women with risk factors for infection&#xD;
      (intrapartum fever or prolonged rupture of membranes) who were subjected to PV9 and&#xD;
      intrapartum PCR (IP PCR), identified 19% potential reclassification of GBS status, with a&#xD;
      potential saving of 6% intrapartum antibiotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We postulate that the replacement of PV9 by the generalized use of GBS intrapartum detection&#xD;
      would optimize the indications for intrapartum antiobiotherapy, avoiding (i) unnecessary and&#xD;
      deleterious care consumption in the absence of intrapartum GBS colonization, and (ii)&#xD;
      avoidable EONIs occurring in the absence of intrapartum antiobiotherapy when GBS colonization&#xD;
      has not been diagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a cost-consequence study because the criteria for clinically relevant&#xD;
      judgments do not allow for cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analysis. Indeed, the&#xD;
      intrapartum PCR strategy has consequences for both mother and child and these consequences&#xD;
      cannot be aggregated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, cost-consequence analysis based on criteria validated by clinicians and the literature&#xD;
      seemed to us to be the most pragmatic approach and the most likely to help public decision&#xD;
      making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this work is therefore to carry out a cost-consequence analysis comparing&#xD;
      the intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis strategy based on intrapartum GBS colonization&#xD;
      screening by PCR, with the current strategy based on antenatal screening by culture between&#xD;
      35 and 38 SA.&#xD;

      • Inclusion visit : The patient is included in the &quot;GBS culture&quot; group or in the &quot;GBS PCR&quot;&#xD;
      group determined by the randomization of the hospital in which she gives birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample to perform the GBS PCR will be taken or not depending on the strategy in place in&#xD;
      the center at the time of inclusion. The patient's management will be adapted according to&#xD;
      the test result. The administration of intrapartum antibiotic therapy will be decided by the&#xD;
      clinician in charge of the patient based on the result of antenatal GBS screening (PCR or&#xD;
      culture) and taking into account the risk factors for EONI. In the GBS PCR group, the&#xD;
      clinician will not have access to the result of the antenatal detection, even if the result&#xD;
      is forgotten or technically impossible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • M1 follow-up visit (+/-5 days) by phone The study coordinator will follow up the patient by&#xD;
      phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected are as below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neonatal infection occurring within the first 6 days of life (this diagnosis requires&#xD;
           hospital treatment by intravenous route, and will be verified on the hospitalization&#xD;
           report),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endometritis in the first month after birth,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maternal and/or newborn antibiotic therapy (which one? how long? in which indication?)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalization of the mother and/or newborn (which hospital, which department, how&#xD;
           long? for what reason).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalization report.&#xD;

    <description>This is a multi-center, randomized cluster and crossover study, and is open-label. The cluster is defined by the hospital center. Each center will therefore experiment with both strategies and the hospital centers will be randomized according to two arms:&#xD;
Arm n°1 : 1st period with &quot;SGB culture&quot; strategy and 2nd period with &quot;SGB PCR&quot; strategy.&#xD;
Arm n°2 : 1st period with &quot;SGB PCR&quot; Strategy and 2nd period with &quot;SGB culture&quot; Strategy Each inclusion period will last 6 weeks, with a 1-month wash-in period before each of the two inclusion periods of the study (training of the teams in intrapartum PCR detection). A wash-out period is not necessary in this study because the PCR machine will be removed from the centers when switching to the GBS culture strategy.&#xD;
During these two periods, all patients meeting the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria will be included in the study after presentation of the study and oral consent.</description>
