  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early diabetic kidney disease (DKD) occurs in 50-70% of youth with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and&#xD;
      confers high lifetime risk of dialysis and premature death. Youth-onset T2D typically&#xD;
      manifests during or shortly after puberty in adolescents with obesity. Epidemiological data&#xD;
      implicate puberty as an accelerator of kidney disease in youth with obesity and diabetes and&#xD;
      the investigators posit that the link between puberty and T2D-onset may explain the high&#xD;
      burden of DKD in youth-onset T2D. A better understanding of the impact of puberty on kidney&#xD;
      health is needed to promote preservation of native kidney function, especially in youth with&#xD;
      T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Puberty is a complex process of physiological changes, including neuroreproductive and growth&#xD;
      hormone activation and rapid organ growth, that may predispose organs to injury. The kidneys&#xD;
      may be especially susceptible because they are highly metabolically active and second only to&#xD;
      the heart with respect to oxygen consumption per tissue mass. During puberty, the kidneys&#xD;
      almost double in size, likely increasing the kidneys' already high energy expenditure. In&#xD;
      parallel, puberty is associated with physiologic insulin resistance (IR), which is&#xD;
      accentuated in obesity. Our central hypothesis is that obese youth with prediabetes and T2D&#xD;
      experience relative kidney hypoxia during puberty due to a metabolic mismatch between&#xD;
      increased energy expenditure and impaired substrate metabolism. In turn, the kidney hypoxia&#xD;
      results in loss of glomerular charge and size selectivity leading to increased&#xD;
      transglomerular transport of protein and kidney dysfunction. Our preliminary data showed that&#xD;
      pubertal adolescents with obesity and/or diabetes exhibit relative kidney hypoxia compared to&#xD;
      normal weight controls using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and that relative&#xD;
      kidney hypoxia is greater in late vs. early puberty. However, determining the pubertal&#xD;
      mechanisms contributing to kidney injury in youth with obesity and T2D requires serial&#xD;
      evaluations throughout puberty. To assess the impact of pubertal changes within a 5-year&#xD;
      study period, the investigators propose an accelerated longitudinal study design in which the&#xD;
      investigators will enroll adolescents (8-14 years, 50% girls) with obesity and elevated&#xD;
      hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c ≥6%) [n=60], and healthy normal weight controls [n=40] at Tanner&#xD;
      (pubertal) stages 1-4 and examine them at baseline, 1 and 2-years. The investigators will&#xD;
      then compare data by Tanner stage to construct an integrated portrayal of the physiological&#xD;
      changes that occur throughout puberty. Given the rarity of T2D prior to pubertal onset, the&#xD;
      investigators chose to enroll a high high-risk group: youth with obesity and HbA1c ≥6.0% to&#xD;
      represent youth ranging from those at magnified risk of developing T2D to those recently&#xD;
      diagnosed.&#xD;
