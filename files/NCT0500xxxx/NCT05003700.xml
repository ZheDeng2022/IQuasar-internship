  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hepatic arterial infusion&#xD;
      chemotherapy of oxaliplatin and raltitrexed plus lenvatinib and camrelizumab in patients with&#xD;
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) of oxaliplatin and raltitrexed was effective&#xD;
      and safe for hepatocellular carcinoma. Lenvatinib was non-inferior to sorafenib in overall&#xD;
      survival in untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and programmed cell death protein-1&#xD;
      (PD-1) antibody was effective and tolerable in patients with advanced hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma. No study has evaluated HAIC of oxaliplatin and raltitrexed plus lenvatinib and&#xD;
      camrelizumab. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective, single-arm study to find&#xD;
      out it.&#xD;
