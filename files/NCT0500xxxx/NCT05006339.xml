  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess whether using retainers and an artificial intelligence supported remote monitoring&#xD;
      system maintains a more stable orthodontic treatment result than using retainers with&#xD;
      in-office review appointments.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The amount and nature of relapse are unpredictable and natural changes in the dentition are&#xD;
      life-long. Although some patients were shown to remain stable despite not wearing retainers,&#xD;
      research is unable to provide predictors for identifying those patients and therefore we have&#xD;
      to treat all patients as if they have the potential to relapse long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the results of long-term retrospective studies, there has been a gradual change of&#xD;
      practice from prescribing retainers for 1-2 years to long-term retention. This is a&#xD;
      significant burden on patients, clinicians and the health system as long term review and&#xD;
      maintenance of retainers are required from both parties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although some studies showed compliance with the use of orthodontic retainers correlated with&#xD;
      factors such as gender, age and type of retainer, one of the main reasons for non-compliance&#xD;
      with removable retainers was shown to be just forgetting to wear them. Patient compliance is&#xD;
      also needed in attending follow-up appointments for review of fit and intactness of retainers&#xD;
      as well as calculus build-up that may be present around fixed lingual wires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long term review is also needed to protect patients from any side effects from broken or&#xD;
      distorted fixed retainers. This is not common, yet when it happens its side effects can be&#xD;
      deleterious. Since patients do not always realise these side effects on time, damage may&#xD;
      range from simple malalignment of teeth to having roots of teeth come out of bone creating&#xD;
      periodontal and aesthetic consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attending review appointments could be inconvenient for both patients and parents as they&#xD;
      need to take time off of school and work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no studies on the efficacy of DM as a tool to monitor orthodontic&#xD;
      retention patients. Therefore, this project can shed light on whether the use of DM is an&#xD;
      acceptable or more effective way of monitoring patients wearing retainers than traditional&#xD;
      in-office orthodontic visits. The results of this study could also help guide clinicians&#xD;
      regarding the most effective retention regime using remote monitoring systems. The study will&#xD;
      also compare the costs of in-office retainer checks and remote monitoring of retainers, If&#xD;
      the results of this study show DM is better, or comparable to, clinical review appointments&#xD;
      and it less costly and more convenient, DM may be utilised for patients in the public system&#xD;
      freeing chair-time for patients waiting for treatment on the public orthodontic waiting list.&#xD;
