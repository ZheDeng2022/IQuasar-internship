  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, controlled, multicenter, phase III study with two parallel&#xD;
      arms. Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer after definite interventional therapy of all&#xD;
      lesions are randomized in a 2:1 fashion (favoring active therapy) to investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy, patient reported quality of life and safety of mFOLFOXIRI/mFOLFOX-6 as additive&#xD;
      treatment (Arm A) versus active follow-up/surveillance (Arm B).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will consist of both a clinical and translational part. During the study,&#xD;
      re-assessments (radiologic assessment, blood and QoL) will be conducted for all trial subject&#xD;
      of the trial every 3 months. Tumor biopsies will be collected at screening (baseline sample)&#xD;
      and in case of relapse of disease if a new tumor sample is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the re-assessments is detection of relapse either radiologically or within&#xD;
      the translational material (blood samples with ctDNA dynamics and tumor - if available from&#xD;
      relapses). CT scans of thorax/abdomen and/or MRI scans will be performed every 3 months&#xD;
      within the 2 years after randomization. After the first two relapse-free years, intervals&#xD;
      should be stretched to 6 months in the third and following years after study start.&#xD;
      Structured follow-up for up to 60 months after randomization should be maintained for both&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Arm A receive additive study drug intervention (mFOLFOXIRI or mFOLFOX-6) for up&#xD;
      to six months (12 cycles) after randomization with additional clinical and safety&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
