  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) was recently discovered as a novel and independent risk factor&#xD;
      for promoting atherosclerosis while it is generated from dietary carnitine through the&#xD;
      metabolism of gut microbiota for decades. Allicin, the major compound in raw garlic juice, is&#xD;
      a naturally antimicrobial phytochemical found in raw garlic juice and easily acquired from&#xD;
      the diet. Investigators' previous study suggests dietary allicin reduces the transformation&#xD;
      of L-carnitine to TMAO through the impact on gut microbiota in mice. Therefore, it is worth&#xD;
      investigating whether raw garlic juice intake could reduce the TMAO productivity of human gut&#xD;
      microbiota as well as modulate gut microflora. Investigators plan to recruit 10 TMAO&#xD;
      producers to receive garlic juice for one week. The plasma and urine TMAO concentration will&#xD;
      be measured by the LC-MS, and the gut microbiota composition will be analyzed by the&#xD;
      next-generation sequencing, through bioinformatics analysis. Investigators expected after&#xD;
      intake garlic juice for one week, it could prevent the cardiovascular disease risk via gut&#xD;
      microbiota modulation and reduction of plasma and urine TMAO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening of the TMAO producer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The healthy participants were recruited, the criteria as follows: (1) age ≥ 20 years old; (2)&#xD;
      no exposure to antibiotics, probiotics, or carnitine supplements within the previous month;&#xD;
      (3) have no history of chronic diseases including, diabetes mellitus, myasthenia gravis,&#xD;
      chronic renal disease, hyperparathyroidism, epilepsy, and severe anemia; (4) Participants&#xD;
      were excluded from the study if they reported recent gastrointestinal discomfort (such as&#xD;
      abdominal pain or diarrhea). To screening the TMAO producer, Investigators use the oral&#xD;
      carnitine challenge test (OCCT) method which previously exhibited better efficacy than&#xD;
      fasting plasma TMAO to identify the TMAO producer phenotype. All of the participants fasted&#xD;
      at least 8 hours before performing OCCT. 1500 mg of L-carnitine (3 tablets, General Nutrition&#xD;
      Centers, Inc., USA) orally administrated to the participants. The blood and urine of&#xD;
      participants were collected at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours after carnitine intake. Participants&#xD;
      with plasma TMAO ≧ 10 μM after OCCT were defined as high TMAO producers and proceeded into&#xD;
      the garlic juice intervention test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Garlic Juice Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-TMAO producers asked to consume 55 mL of raw garlic juice (48 mg of allicin equivalent)&#xD;
      once a day during dinner for one week. High-TMAO producers suggested consuming the garlic&#xD;
      juice with a meal. The high-TMAO producers were free to choose their diet, no restriction on&#xD;
      the type of food. After one week of raw garlic juice intervention, the second OCCT was&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
