      The principal objectives of the study are to evaluate early and mid-term fixation of the&#xD;
      REDAPT revision hip stem and acetabular cup as measured by stem subsidence and proximal cup&#xD;
      migration at 2 and 5 years post-surgery through model-based RSA. Secondary objectives&#xD;
      include; evaluate the progression of migration between 1 and 2 years and between 2 and 5&#xD;
      years, assess pre- to post-surgery patient improvement in function and health status,&#xD;
      evaluate femoral and acetabular radiolucency at 2 and 5 years, and assess patterns of stem&#xD;
      migrate on for different revision scenarios (preservation of the trochanters and extended&#xD;
      trochanteric osteotomy).&#xD;

      This is a prospective, single arm, consecutive series study of patients undergoing revision&#xD;
      hip arthroplasty. Patients will be grouped based on the revision implants they receive during&#xD;
      surgery. Patients who receive a full hip revision (stem and cup), will be counted in both&#xD;
      study groups. The two study groups are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. femoral stem revision (n=30 hips)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. acetabular cup revision (n=22 hips)&#xD;

    <description>The Oxford Hip Score (OHS) is a patient self-administered 12-item questionnaire with each question having a Likaert-like response option. Each item is scored from 0 to 4, and the items are summated, with lower total scores indicating poorer performance. The OHS measures pain and general activities of daily living.</description>
