  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess weight gain of preterm infants (gestational age lower than&#xD;
      32 weeks) fed infant milk formula with about 60% beta-palmitate (EX_IMF) vs infant milk&#xD;
      formula with similar macronutrient, mineral and fatty acid composition but lower amounts of&#xD;
      beta-palmitate (ST_IMF). Own mother milk (OMM) fed infants will serve as reference group.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large number of low birth weight infants during their hospital stay experience poor growth&#xD;
      and this has been linked to reduced neurodevelopment scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several enriched infant milk formulas are available for preterm infants who cannot be fed&#xD;
      human milk. The use of infant milk formulas (IMF) enriched with triglycerides similar to&#xD;
      human milk lipids have shown to be associated with better fatty acid and mineral intestinal&#xD;
      absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial, preterm infants (gestational age&#xD;
      lower than 32 weeks), who can not be fed human milk, will be randomized to receive IMF with&#xD;
      high or low amounts of beta-palmitate (about 60% vs 10%, respectively). A non-randomized own&#xD;
      human milk-fed group will be included as a reference. Patients will be on the study diet as&#xD;
      soon as possible after birth and till 36 weeks of gestation. Neurodevelopment follow-up will&#xD;
      be performed at 24 months corrected age.&#xD;
