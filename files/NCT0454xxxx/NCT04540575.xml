  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the US, the burden of very low birth weight (VLBW; &lt;1500 g) birth is borne&#xD;
      disproportionately by black (non-Hispanic black/African American) mothers who are 2.2-2.6&#xD;
      times more likely than nonblack mothers to deliver VLBW infants. This disparity is amplified&#xD;
      because black VLBW infants are significantly less likely to receive mother's own milk (MOM)&#xD;
      feedings from birth until neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) discharge than nonblack&#xD;
      infants, which adds to the lifelong burden of VLBW birth with increased risk of morbidities&#xD;
      and greater costs. Pumping is associated with out-of-pocket and opportunity costs that are&#xD;
      borne by mothers, unlike donor human milk and formula, which are paid for by NICUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This innovative trial will determine the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing the&#xD;
      disparity in MOM feedings and provide an economic analysis of the interventions, yielding&#xD;
      critical data impacting generalizability and likelihood of implementation of results. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that mothers who receive intervention will have greater pumping&#xD;
      volume and duration and their infants will be more likely to receive MOM at NICU discharge&#xD;
      compared to mothers who receive standard of care lactation care and their infants.&#xD;

      In the US, the burden of very low birth weight (VLBW; &lt;1500 g) birth is borne&#xD;
      disproportionately by black (non-Hispanic black/African American) mothers who are 2.2-2.6&#xD;
      times more likely than nonblack mothers to deliver VLBW infants. This disparity is amplified&#xD;
      because black VLBW infants are significantly less likely to receive mother's own milk (MOM)&#xD;
      feedings from birth until neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) discharge than nonblack&#xD;
      infants, which adds to the lifelong burden of VLBW birth with increased risk of morbidities&#xD;
      and greater costs. Even though black mothers of VLBW infants initiate MOM provision at rates&#xD;
      similar to nonblack mothers and have similar goals to sustain MOM provision through to NICU&#xD;
      discharge, there is a significant disparity in MOM feedings at NICU discharge. Only the&#xD;
      mother can mitigate the disparity in MOM feedings at NICU discharge for the VLBW infant by:&#xD;
      1) sustaining breast pump use (6-8 times/day) for the entire NICU hospitalization (average =&#xD;
      73 days), and 2) transporting the MOM that is pumped in the home to the NICU for infant&#xD;
      feedings. Pumping is associated with out-of-pocket and opportunity costs that are borne by&#xD;
      mothers, unlike donor human milk and formula, which are paid for by NICUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ReDiMOM randomized controlled trial will implement and evaluate an intervention (NICU&#xD;
      acquires MOM) developed to offset the aforementioned costs that serve as barriers to&#xD;
      sustaining MOM feedings. The intervention includes free hospital-grade electric breast pump,&#xD;
      pickup of MOM, and payment for opportunity costs. The intervention will be evaluated in&#xD;
      comparison to the current standard of care (mother provides MOM). Data will be collected from&#xD;
      several sources including REDCap surveys, data extraction from the electronic medical record&#xD;
      and hospital decision support/financial cost accounting system, smart breast pump data and&#xD;
      measurement of pumped MOM volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This innovative trial will determine the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing the&#xD;
      disparity in MOM feedings and provide an economic analysis of the interventions, yielding&#xD;
      critical data impacting generalizability and likelihood of implementation of results. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that mothers who receive intervention will have greater pumping&#xD;
      volume and duration and their infants will be more likely to receive MOM at NICU discharge&#xD;
      compared to mothers who receive standard of care lactation care and their infants.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Mothers will be randomized into one of two groups after enrollment. Group 1, or &quot;Mother Provides Mother's Own Milk (MOM)&quot;, will receive the standard of care. Group 2, or &quot;NICU Acquires MOM&quot;, will receive the intervention. Two levels based on gestational age (extremely preterm &lt; 28 weeks vs. very preterm 28-31 6/7 weeks, with approximately 50% expected in each group based on historical Rush University NICU births) will be crossed with three racial/ethnic categories (black, Hispanic, and white). The stratified random allocation table will be integrated into the baseline demographic questionnaire programmed in REDCap, allowing both patient and interviewer to be blind to condition until the end of the consent process and interview.</intervention_model_description>
