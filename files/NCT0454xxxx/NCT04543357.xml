  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will include male and female participants who live or work in the same household&#xD;
      as a participant in the Phase 3 interventional study, C3391003. Up to 5 participants from the&#xD;
      same household may be enrolled. The objective is to estimate the likelihood of NAb&#xD;
      seroconversion to AAV9 in household contacts of a participant in study C3391003 who is&#xD;
      treated with PF-06939926 gene therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single center study to include approximately 50 to 250 participants is designed to&#xD;
      estimate the likelihood of NAb seroconversion to AAV9 because of exposure to shed viral&#xD;
      vector material released by a DMD participant treated with PF-06939926 in study C3391003.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will undergo a blood draw provided by a Home Health Care Vendor at&#xD;
      three home visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maintain the blinded nature of study C3391003, all C3391007 study participants and&#xD;
      investigators as well as the sponsor will remain blinded to the Cohort assignment of the&#xD;
      C3391003 study participant in the same household until C3391003 becomes unblinded.&#xD;
      Additionally, the detailed individual results will be considered sensitive clinical data and&#xD;
      will not be shared with the participants, investigators, or the Sponsor until study C3391003&#xD;
      becomes unblinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of participation in the study is up to 4 months, including up to 48 days&#xD;
      for the screening/baseline period and up to 66 days after dosing of investigational product&#xD;
      in the C3391003 participant of the same household.&#xD;
