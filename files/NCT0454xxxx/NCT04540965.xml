  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to formally evaluate the impact of famotidine, an H2R antagonist, on&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics of telaglenastat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in up to 22 healthy volunteers, who meet all of the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. The study is double-blinded, randomized 2-way&#xD;
      crossover in design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive four 200 mg tablets of telaglenastat either in the presence or absence&#xD;
      of 20 mg famotidine (H2R-antagonist) with a 4-day wash-out period in between each regimen.&#xD;
