  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled,&#xD;
      non-inferiority clinical study in women aged 35 to 42 years. This study will investigate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of Progesterone-IBSA to support euploid embryo blastocyst implantation&#xD;
      and early pregnancy after frozen embryo transfer (FET) in a modified natural cycle as a&#xD;
      treatment for infertile women. Subjects will be randomized to receive either active&#xD;
      Progesterone-IBSA or Crinone 8% for luteal and early pregnancy support and these two groups&#xD;
      will be compared.&#xD;
