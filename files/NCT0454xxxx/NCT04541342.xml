      Osteoarthritis of the knee is a common problem causing significant knee pain and disability.&#xD;
      Medial compartment osteoarthritis is predisposed to by varus deformity of the knee. High&#xD;
      tibial osteotomy is a well-established method for treatment of medial unicompartmental knee&#xD;

      Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by erosion of the articular&#xD;
      cartilage, hypertrophy of the bone at the margins and subchondral sclerosis. Osteoarthritis&#xD;
      of the knee is a common problem causing significant knee pain and disability. Medial&#xD;
      compartment osteoarthritis is predisposed to by varus deformity of the knee. High tibial&#xD;
      osteotomy is a well-established method for treatment of medial unicompartmental knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis and correction of varus deformity. It is a joint preserving procedure&#xD;
      especially preferred in young patients for whom arthroplasty is not desirable. The procedure&#xD;
      promotes regeneration by causing lateral shift of the weight-bearing axis, thus decreasing&#xD;
      load on the medial compartment and widening the medial joint space. The methods for Ø§igh&#xD;
      tibial osteotomy include opening-wedge osteotomy and closed wedge osteotomy. An opening-wedge&#xD;
      osteotomy has become increasingly popular compared to the other technique. One of the&#xD;
      disadvantages of this technique is that the plate is placed subcutaneously on the medial&#xD;
      aspect of the proximal tibia. Many of the patients complains of irritation through the plate&#xD;
      and wish metal removal after healing of the osteotomy. Few papers assessed regeneration of&#xD;
      the articular cartilage after medial opening-wedge osteotomy.&#xD;

    <description>By use of Outerbridge classification of chondral lesions during arthroscopy, comparison will be made between cartilage status before and after high tibial osteotomy according to the Outerbrigde classification which classifies cartilage lesions into grades of 0 through IV. Grade 0 signifies normal cartilage.&#xD;
Grade I chondral lesions are characterized by softening and swelling, which often require tactile feedback with a probe or other instrument to assess. Grade II lesion describes a partial-thickness defect with fissures that do not exceed 0.5 inches in diameter or reach subchondral bone.&#xD;
Grade III is fissuring of the cartilage with a diameter &gt; 0.5 inches with an area reaching subchondral bone.&#xD;
The most severe is Grade IV, which includes erosion of the articular cartilage that exposes subchondral bone.</description>

    <description>It is a joint preserving procedure especially preferred in young patients for whom arthroplasty is not desirable. The procedure promotes regeneration by causing lateral shift of the weight-bearing axis, thus decreasing load on the medial compartment and widening the medial joint space.Many of the patients complains of irritation through the plate and wish metal removal after healing of the osteotomy.All patients will undergo initial arthroscopy before high tibial osteotomy (HTO). During arthroscopy, debridement of the degenerate tissues and meniscal tears if present will be performed. Then opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy (OWHTO) will be performed and fixed by a plate system. Second-look arthroscopy will be conducted at the time of plate removal after healing of the osteotomy. This will be after about 6 months up to one year.</description>
