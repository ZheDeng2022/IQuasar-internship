  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a video visit with an advanced practice provider&#xD;
      (Nurse Practitioner or Physician Assistant) within 7 days of discharge from Hospital Internal&#xD;
      Medicine services will increase patient compliance with medication, self-management and home&#xD;
      supports after hospital discharge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to discharge, patients will be referred by Hospital Internal Medicine (HIM) teams to&#xD;
      the PEARL team and screened for study eligibility. Eligible patients who provide oral consent&#xD;
      to participate. Participants will be randomized 1:1 with comparisons between &quot;Usual care&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;Usual care + Video-visit&quot; arms. Participants randomized to the intervention arm will&#xD;
      participate in a 15-20 minute Video visit (using Zoom®) with an advanced practice provider&#xD;
      (APP; nurse practitioner or physician assistant in HIM) approximately 2-5 days after&#xD;
      discharge. The telephone follow-up will occur 3-6 days after discharge. If a patient has a&#xD;
      Video visit, the telephone follow-up will be scheduled for after the Video visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is standard practice for HIM teams to make and coordinate outpatient appointments and&#xD;
      activities including radiologic procedures for discharging patients. During this study, usual&#xD;
      care will continue for patients in each arm. The intervention (Video-visit) is in addition to&#xD;
      and not in place of the usual standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If issues/concerns beyond the scope of the video visit or telephone follow-up arise, then the&#xD;
      PEARL APP will direct these to the discharging hospitalist team/supervising physician, or the&#xD;
      participant's primary care provider (PCP) consistent with current standards of practice and&#xD;
      management of post-discharge issues. Issues re-directed to the discharging hospitalist team&#xD;
      or other providers will be documented in the Video-visit encounter. If the APP deems the&#xD;
      clinical situation urgent or emergent, the APP will refer the patient to emergency services,&#xD;
      or if needed ask the patient his/her location and contact 911. The APP will also immediately&#xD;
      notify the study PI or co-PI who are both hospitalists and familiar with the practice. The&#xD;
      APP will also notify the discharging hospitalist team.&#xD;
