    <textblock>
      A pilot study for individuals with Type 1 Diabetes who are willing to add an SGLT-2i&#xD;
      (Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitor) in combination with placebo or a GRA (Glucagon&#xD;
      Receptor Antagonist) to their current diabetes treatment regimen. There will be 15 study&#xD;
      visits over approximately 14 weeks in this cross-over study design. Treatment &quot;A&quot; consists of&#xD;
      an SGLT-2i + GRA for 4 weeks and treatment &quot;B&quot; consists of an SGLT-2i + placebo for 4 weeks.&#xD;
      All participants will complete both treatment &quot;A&quot; and treatment &quot;B&quot; with a 6-week washout&#xD;
      period in between the treatments. Testing includes 3 insulin withdraw challenges, 3 muscle&#xD;
      biopsies, 3 fat biopsies, 3 vascular ultrasounds along with blood collection and vitals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, cross-over, multi-dose study designed to&#xD;
      elicit pilot data for a larger project. To accomplish the specific aims proposed, a single&#xD;
      clinical trial will be conducted in which a maximum of 12 subjects with T1D, who are&#xD;
      otherwise healthy, will be treated with an oral SGLT-2i (Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2&#xD;
      Inhibitor), 10mg dapagliflozin taken daily in combination with a GRA (Glucagon Receptor&#xD;
      Antagonist), 70mg REMD-477 subcutaneous injection once a week or placebo (subcutaneous&#xD;
      injection to match the volume of REMD-477) once a week. There will be two treatments:&#xD;
      Treatment &quot;A&quot; consists of an SGLT-2i + GRA for 4 weeks and Treatment &quot;B&quot; consists of an&#xD;
      SGLT-2i + placebo for 4 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to either start with&#xD;
      Treatment A or Treatment B for the first 4 weeks of treatment. After completing the first&#xD;
      treatment group, participants will be washed off all study drug for 6 weeks. After the&#xD;
      washout period, participants will complete 4 weeks of dosing with the opposite treatment they&#xD;
      received during the first 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 15 study visits as outlined below:&#xD;
