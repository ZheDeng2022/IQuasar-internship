  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot study is to develop and test a couple-based intervention to increase&#xD;
      sun protection practices. First, the investigators will develop the intervention website, Sun&#xD;
      Safe Partners online. Next, the investigators will gather feedback and preferences for&#xD;
      content in a small sample of couples who do not regularly engage in sun protection practices.&#xD;
      The investigators will also gather preliminary information regarding the impact of the&#xD;
      couple-based intervention.&#xD;

      Aim 1: To develop and evaluate the feasibility of a couple-based sun protection intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To examine the impact of the couple-based sun protection intervention on sun&#xD;
      protection practices, individual attitudes, relationship perspective on sun protection, and&#xD;
      couples' discussion with each other and their supportive communications about sun protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To develop and refine a SunSafe Partners online intervention. This process includes&#xD;
      refining existing intervention content drawn from the first phase of this pilot research as&#xD;
      well as formative and usability studies to obtain user-generated feedback on additional&#xD;
      content and the approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To gather pilot data on participation in and evaluations of the Sun Safe partner's&#xD;
      intervention from Aim 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: Web-based intervention called Sun Safe Partners Online&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: Generic Online Sun Safety Information intervention- 4 links emailed to participants&#xD;
