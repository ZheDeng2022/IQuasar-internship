      Objective: This 3-year multisite RCT will determine the effectiveness of a targeted&#xD;
      multidomain intervention (T-MD) (anxiety/mood, cognitive, migraine, ocular, vestibular; and&#xD;
      sleep, autonomic) compared to usual care (behavioral management) in military-aged civilians&#xD;
      with complex mTBI.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective single-blinded two-group multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a&#xD;
      targeted multi-domain intervention in military-aged civilians with complex mTBI will be&#xD;
      conducted at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Sports Concussion Program (UPitt)&#xD;
      and Inova Sports Concussion Clinic. During year 1 the investigators will obtain appropriate&#xD;
      contract and research agreements, and institutional, site-specific, and Human Research&#xD;
      Protection Official (HRPO) Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals for the trial. This&#xD;
      study will enroll 250 military-aged civilians with a diagnosed complex mTBI from UPitt (125)&#xD;
      and Inova (125). Upon enrollment, participants will complete a comprehensive multidomain&#xD;
      evaluation of symptoms and impairment that will inform an adjudication process to determine&#xD;
      affected clinical profiles and targeted interventions. Participants will then be randomized&#xD;
      to either the T-MD or usual care intervention arm. The T-MD group will receive targeted&#xD;
      interventions (cognitive behavioral therapy, cognitive accommodations/activities, behavioral&#xD;
      regulation for headache/migraine, oculomotor exercises, behavioral sleep intervention,&#xD;
      vestibular rehabilitation, graded exertion) for affected clinical profiles based on the&#xD;
      adjudication process, whereas usual care will only receive behavioral management strategies&#xD;
      (e.g., sleep, nutrition, hydration, activity, stress management). In-clinic treatment&#xD;
      sessions will be complemented with at-home activities and compliance will be monitored using&#xD;
      a text-based tool. Data collection will include demographic data, medical history, health&#xD;
      care utilization (the number of visits and utilization costs), and length of time to return&#xD;
      to activity (RTA). Primary outcomes for Aim 1 will be assessed at baseline, 2-week, 4-week,&#xD;
      and 3-month post-intervention intervals. Secondary outcomes for Aim 1 will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, 2-week, and 4-week post-intervention intervals, with select outcomes being measured&#xD;
      again at 3-months. The investigators will also determine if participants are recovered (i.e.,&#xD;
      medically cleared for full return to activity) at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 3 months&#xD;
      post-intervention. Additionally, the investigators will tabulate each participant's&#xD;
      healthcare utilization and related costs using electronic health record (EHR) at the&#xD;
      conclusion of participation in the study protocol. For Aims 2 and 3, in years 2-3, concurrent&#xD;
      measures of brain activation will be obtained (i.e., CBF) in the cerebral cortex using fNIRS&#xD;
      for all participants at enrollment and 4 weeks-post intervention. Primary outcome measures&#xD;
      for Aims 2 and 3 will be oxygenated (activation) and deoxygenated (deactivation) hemoglobin&#xD;
      in regions of interest in the cerebral cortex at rest. Secondary outcomes will include the&#xD;
      same fNIRS measures during cognitive and exertion activities. We will control for the time&#xD;
      since injury in all analyses. For Aim 1, a linear mixed model will be used to compare primary&#xD;
      and secondary outcomes between groups, while accounting for covariates. For Aim 2, a linear&#xD;
      mixed model will be used to compare brain regions of interest, while accounting for&#xD;
      covariates. For Aim 3, bivariate and partial correlational analyses will be conducted.&#xD;

    <description>NSI is a 22 item symptom scale, participants will rate the severity of their symptoms on a 5 point likert scale (0, none/rarely ever present to 4, very severe, almost always present). The NSI total score is a sum of the 22 items (range 0-88).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>The PGIC will be measured from baseline to 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>PGIC is a self-reported assessment of change. Participants rate their impression of how much better they feel on a 7 point likert scale. It is a 1 item survey, with higher scores representing no change and associated with feeling worse. (Responses 1=much improved, 2=minimally improved, 3=no change, 4=minimally worse, 5=much worse, 6=very much worse).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>fNIRS will be conducted two times, once baseline and again at the 4 week visit.</time_frame>
    <description>fNIRS will be used to record changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (activation) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deactivation) in participants. fNIRS will assess 3 broad regions of interest: left and right temporal, occipital. It will measure bilateral areas of the inferior frontal, dorsal-lateral prefrontal, and frontal regions of the brain including Brodmann areas as well as the middle frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and extrastriate visual cortical regions. fNIRS will be done in 2 different paradigms: 1) at rest, and 2) during cognitive activity. At rest measurements will occur while participants are seated, and last about 2 minutes. For the cognitive activity, participants will perform the ImPACT test while wearing the fNIRS unit, and last 20 minutes. We will compare brain activation and deactivation in ROIs across the two points and between rest and cognitive activity paradigms. We will also examine task specific changes within the cognitive test paradigm.</description>

    <description>The VOMS assesses impairment via patient report symptom provocation following each of 5 test components (smooth pursuits, horizontal/vertical saccades, convergence, horizontal and vertical vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) and visual motor sensitivity (VMS). Patients verbally rate changes in headache, dizziness, nausea, and fogginess after each test, as well as report their baseline symptoms. Symptoms in each area are rated on scale 0 (none) to 10 (severe). Scores on any VOMS item of 2+ reflects a positive screening cut-off for vestibular and/or ocular motor impairment.</description>

    <measure>Modified Balance Error Scoring System (mBESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>mBESS will be measured from baseline to 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The mBESS measures postural stability and consists of three stances including feet side by side, a tandem stance, and a single-leg stance on the non-dominant leg. The three stances are performed for 20 seconds each and completed with eyes closed and hand on the iliac crests. Errors include lifting hands off the iliac crests, opening the eyes, stepping, stumbling, or falling, moving the hip into more than a 30 degree of flexion or abduction, lifting the forefoot or heel, or remaining out of the testing position for more than 5 seconds. Each error equals 1 point, with higher scores indicating worse performance. Score ranges from 0-30 (maximum of 10 errors per each stance).</description>

Participants indicate on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) the level of symptom severity for each item. The CP screen yields an average factor and modifier scores, with higher scores indicative of worse symptom severity, score range is 0-87.</description>
