  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a worldwide&#xD;
      epidemic that continues to grow significantly causing new infections and related deaths per&#xD;
      year. Chronic HIV infection in adults continues to be characterized by increased development&#xD;
      and transmission of resistant virus and issues associated with long-term toxicity of&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART). The current paradigm in the treatment of HIV involves life-long&#xD;
      therapy with multiple antiretrovirals (ARVs). This dependency on medical therapy requires a&#xD;
      need for continuous improvement on the durability, tolerability and convenience of all&#xD;
      antiretroviral classes. This is a Phase IIIb, randomized, open-label, active-controlled,&#xD;
      multicenter, parallel-group, non-inferiority study (SOLAR: Switch Onto Long Acting Regimen).&#xD;
      It is designed to assess the antiviral activity and safety of a two-drug regimen of CAB LA +&#xD;
      RPV LA administered every 2 months (Q2M) compared with maintenance of BIK. Approximately 654&#xD;
      adult HIV-1 infected participants who are on the stable ARV regimen BIK will be randomized in&#xD;
      a 2:1 ratio to either be switched to the CAB LA + RPV LA regimen or continue BIK through 12&#xD;
      months. The study will continue with an Extension Phase after Month 12 Oral Lead-In (OLI) and&#xD;
      BIK/Month 11 Direct to Injection (D2I).&#xD;

At the Month 1 visit, last dose of oral CAB + RPV will be given followed by the first CAB LA 600 mg + RPV LA 900 mg intramuscular (IM) injection (within 2 hours of the final oral dose). The second IM injection with CAB LA 600 mg and RPV LA 900 mg will be administered at Month 2 followed by the same Q2M until Month 12. In D2I, at Day 1, eligible participants will receive the first injection of CAB LA 600 mg + RPV LA 900 mg as initial loading dose. The second and third injections (CAB LA 600 mg + RPV LA 900 mg) will be administered at Month 1 and Month 3 followed by the same Q2M until Month 11.</description>

&#xD;
          -  A change in dosing scheme of the same drug from twice daily to once daily will not be&#xD;
             considered a change in ART regimen if data support similar exposures and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A change in formulation from multiple class regimens to single treatment regimens (of&#xD;

             believes the risk of seizure recurrence is low. All cases of prior seizure history&#xD;
             should be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to enrolment.&#xD;

                  serofast RPR result (persistence of a reactive nontreponemal syphilis test&#xD;
                  despite history of adequate therapy and no evidence of re-exposure) may enroll&#xD;
                  after consultation with the Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants with primary syphilis or early latent secondary syphilis (acquired&#xD;
                  within the preceding year) who have a positive RPR test and have not been treated&#xD;
                  may be treated during the screening period and if completion of antibiotic&#xD;
                  treatment occurs during the screening period, may be allowed entry after&#xD;
                  consultation with the Medical Monitor. If antibiotic treatment cannot be&#xD;
                  completed before the screening window ends, participants may be rescreened once&#xD;

             excluded, however Investigators must carefully assess if therapy specific for HCV&#xD;

             from any liver biopsy, Fibroscan, ultrasound, or other fibrosis evaluation, history of&#xD;
             cirrhosis or other decompensated liver disease, prior treatment, and timing/plan for&#xD;
             HCV treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. In the event that recent biopsy or imaging data is not available or inconclusive, the&#xD;
             fibrosis (Fib)-4 score will be used to verify eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
