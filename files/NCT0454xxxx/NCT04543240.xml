      This is a study examining the use of Integra™ for the treatment of lower extremity wounds to&#xD;
      better understand the relationship between bacteria contamination levels and post-operative&#xD;
      complications. Wounds requiring operative application of Integra™ alone or Integra™ followed&#xD;
      by a planned subsequent application of a STSG will be enrolled into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tolerance of Integra™ to bacterial bioburden at the time of application will be&#xD;
      determined by observing their respective postoperative wound complications and correlating&#xD;
      these findings with quantitative bacterial counts, qualitative culture results, and bacterial&#xD;
      and wound protease levels at the time of Integra™ alone application or Integra™ followed by&#xD;
      STSG application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then be followed until complete healing has occurred or until 16 weeks,&#xD;
      whichever comes first.&#xD;

    <description>Quantitative CFUs will be obtained by obtaining tissue from the wound at the time of debridement from otherwise discarded tissue. After tissue cultures are obtained and sent to a designated microbial lab for analysis. Tissue culture is to be obtained from the central aspect of the wound bed. These cultures will be processed and analyzed for research purposes. Qualitative cultures will be obtained as per SOC and sent to the local lab per customary fashion.&#xD;
Qualitative bacterial protease and human inflammation protease indications will be obtained by sampling and testing two separate wound fluid swabs on investigational devices; WOUNDCHEKTM Bacterial Status and WOUNDCHEKTM Protease Status. Bacterial Status detects enzymes that are present when bacteria have become pathogenic while Protease Status detects enzymes present when the wound is in a chronically inflamed state. The tests will be obtained from Woundchek Labs.</description>
