  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Strabismus is a common ophthalmic problem in Egypt that usually requires surgical correction.&#xD;
      This surgery primarily aims to improve alignment of visual axis but may be required only for&#xD;
      cosmetic reasons. General anesthesia is mandatory for most cases however a concomitant local&#xD;
      anesthetics administration is preferable to improve patient satisfaction, decrease&#xD;
      postoperative analgesic requirements and reduce post-operative pain. Oculocardiac reflex is a&#xD;
      noted serious complication that accompanies such surgeries and may be life threatening.&#xD;
      Oculocardiac reflex (OCR) is one of the main challenges that face anesthesiologists during&#xD;
      strabismus surgery. The incidence of OCR varies from 16 to 82 % in strabismus surgeries and&#xD;
      this wide range does depend on the anesthetic agents, premedications, and the definition of&#xD;
      OCR being used. Maintenance of adequate depth of anesthesia and the use of anti-cholinergic&#xD;
      is the mainstay to reduce this risk. OCR is usually defined as a decrease in heart rate of&#xD;
      more than 20 % from the baseline. This reflex is triggered by the pressure on the extra&#xD;
      ocular muscles (EOM) or eyeball, orbital hematoma or trauma, the afferent limb is from&#xD;
      orbital contents to ciliary ganglion then to the sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve near&#xD;
      the fourth ventricle through the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. The main&#xD;
      response of this reflex is transmitted through the vagus to the heart. This vagal stimulation&#xD;
      leads to a decrease in heart rate (sinus bradycardia), contractility and arrhythmias such as&#xD;
      atrioventricular block, ventricular fibrillation up to cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of the OCR decreases with age and tends to be more pronounced in young healthy&#xD;
      patients. It has been suggested that the anesthetic agents used during surgery influence the&#xD;
      incidence of OCR. To date, the only successful method to interrupt an OCR is to stop the EOM&#xD;
      traction, and then proceed with caution as surgery continues. Depth of anesthesia is another&#xD;
      presumed factor having an impact on reducing of OCR incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The response to surgical stimulus can be minimized or stopped with the help of peribulbar&#xD;
      block.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be performed from July 2019 to February 2020 at Fayoum University hospital&#xD;
      after approval of the local institutional ethics committee and local institutional review&#xD;
      board. The study design will be prospective, randomized, parallel groups, controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial. A detailed informed consent will be signed by the eligible participants before&#xD;
      recruitment and randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization &amp; blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be done by using computer-generated random numbers that will be placed in separate&#xD;
      opaque envelopes that will be opened by study investigators just before the surgery. Neither&#xD;
      the participants, the study investigators, the attending clinicians, nor the data collectors&#xD;
      will be aware of groups' allocation till the study end. The Consolidated Standards of&#xD;
      Reporting Trials (CONSORT) recommendations for reporting randomized, controlled clinical&#xD;
      trials will be followed. This is the randomized case-control study. 30 patients will be&#xD;
      randomly divided into 2 study groups .each group contains 15 patients; Group GA: Total 15&#xD;
      cases who will receive general anesthesia only, i.e., without peribulbar block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group GB: Total 15 cases who will receive general anesthesia with peribulbar block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative preparations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      History taking, physical examination and investigation will be done according to local&#xD;
      protocol designed to evaluate the patients which include complete blood count and coagulation&#xD;
      profile. All cases will have a routine pre-operative check-up, starve for 6 h for solids and&#xD;
      2 hours for clear fluids and water. Written informed consent will be signed by adult patients&#xD;
      or parents of pediatric participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative technique and management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival to the operating room standard monitors (Pulse oximeter, Noninvasive blood&#xD;
      pressure monitoring, and Electrocardiogram) will be applied and continued all over the&#xD;
      operation and a peripheral intravenous (IV) cannula (20G) will be inserted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After adequate pre-oxygenation, Induction will be accomplished with the injection of propofol&#xD;
      2 mg/kg and Fentanyl 1 µg/kg IV. Endotracheal intubation will be facilitated by the&#xD;
      intravenous injection of 0.5 mg/kg atracurium. General anesthesia will be maintained by&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation with oxygen and air (50:50), isoflurane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in peribulbar block group will receive lidocaine 2%, bupivacaine 0.5% and&#xD;
      hyaluronidase with total volume 0.06 ml/kg keeping the ratio 1: 1 between lidocaine combined&#xD;
      with hyaluronidase and bupivacaine by 24 Gauge needle after induction of general anesthesia&#xD;
      and before start of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative OCR with decrease of heart rate more than 20% from baseline. If happened it&#xD;
      will be managed by asking the operator to stop the surgical traction and giving 0.01 mg/kg of&#xD;
      atropine. If cardiac arrest was identified, resuscitation will be according to advanced&#xD;
      cardiac life support (ACLS) protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative Nausea and vomiting will be treated by ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg intravenously&#xD;
      over 15 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative monitoring, Pain control and follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of surgery, Participant will be transferred to postoperative anesthesia care unit&#xD;
      (PACU) with standard monitoring applied. Pain will be evaluated by visual analog score (VAS)&#xD;
      score from (0_ 100) (where; zero = no pain, 100=worst imaginable pain) assessed at 2 ,4, 6&#xD;
      ,12 ,24 and after 24 h.&#xD;
