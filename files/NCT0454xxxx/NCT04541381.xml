  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Doctors leading this study hope to find out if giving study participants' genetic information&#xD;
      to cancer care providers will help personalize chemotherapy dosing decisions and decrease&#xD;
      common chemotherapy side effects. Doctors leading the study will collect genetic information&#xD;
      from study participants using pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing/genotyping. Pharmacogenomics is&#xD;
      the study of how the differences in our genes can affect our unique response to medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized study, which means that participants in this study will be assigned to&#xD;
      one of two different groups randomly (as if &quot;by flip of a coin&quot;): a &quot;pharmacogenomics/PGx&#xD;
      testing&quot; group or &quot;control group&quot;.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Receive Dose Modifications/Changes</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the impact of potential PGx (pharmacogenomics testing) results on chemotherapy dosing during the first treatment cycle. Doctors leading the study will determine this by comparing how much each study participant's chemotherapy dosage changes (known as dose intensity deviation rates) during the first treatment cycle to dosage rates among a control group of participants who will receive standard chemotherapy treatment without any guidance based on PGx test results.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Report Grade 3 Toxicities/Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>To determine if giving doctors participant-specific dosing information based on PGx (pharmacogenomics) test results will affect how often study participants report negative side effects during treatment. The potential effect of this genetic information on drug toxicity will be measured by collecting data on the number of reported adverse events (negative side effects of CTCAE Grade 3 or higher ) among study participants.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Drug Dose Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>To determine if sharing PgX (pharmacogenomics) information from study participants has any impact on drug dose intensity. Researchers will determine this by reviewing chemotherapy orders and dosing information for each study participant during their treatment course.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>To determine progression free survival (how long participants stay alive without their cancer getting worse) by tumor type and disease. Each participant's tumor response will be assessed based on re-staging scans and progress notes throughout the participants' course of treatment.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to the control group will not take a genotyping/PGx test during the start of treatment and will instead receive standard chemotherapy without their doctors receiving any genetic information based on the participants' PGx test results. Blood samples for participants in this group will be stored and tested for genotyping six months later after treatment (or earlier if the participant experiences side effects).</description>

    <description>Participants enrolled in the pharmacogenomics (PgX) testing group will give a blood sample for immediate genotyping/PGx testing. Once the results from these tests are in, cancer doctors caring for each participant will have immediate access to the participant's genetic test results and can make dosing decisions/changes to the participant's chemotherapy prescription based on genetic information found in their PGx test results.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who receive ongoing cancer care at the University of Chicago Medical&#xD;
             Center and plan to receive fluoropyrimidine and/or irinotecan as part of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have previously been exposed to the planned chemotherapy agent at any&#xD;
             time (fluoropyrimidine and/or irinotecan).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects enrolled in an investigational trial which would preclude dose modifications&#xD;
             of fluoropyrimidine and/or irinotecan chemotherapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have undergone, or are being actively considered for, bone marrow, liver&#xD;
             or kidney transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of or active blood cancer (e.g., leukemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic kidney disease (as confirmed by clinical laboratory values) due to the risk of&#xD;
             decreased drug excretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Liver dysfunction (confirmed by clinical laboratory values) due to the risk of&#xD;
             decreased drug metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to understand and give informed consent to participate.&#xD;
