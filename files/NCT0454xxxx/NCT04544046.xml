  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a program that entails remote monitoring and home-based&#xD;
      care for people with cancer who are receiving chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants receiving treatment for cancer often require multiple care visits and may&#xD;
      experience significant symptoms and side-effects related to the cancer and the cancer&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is evaluating if a program that involves remote monitoring and home-based&#xD;
      care may improve the quality of life, ability to manage symptoms, and overall care of&#xD;
      individuals during cancer treatment. Remote monitoring is broadly defined as a way of monitor&#xD;
      outside of conventional clinical settings (e.g. in the home) that often utilizes technology&#xD;
      to increase access to care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomized into one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Usual Care or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supportive Oncology Care at Home&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 300 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
