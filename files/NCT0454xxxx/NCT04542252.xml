      To evaluate the effect of coadministered cyclosporine on the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      brincidofovir following simultaneous administration of SyB V-1901 with cyclosporine, or&#xD;

      This study is an open-label, randomized and crossover study designed to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of cyclosporine on the pharmacokinetics of SyB V-1901. Healthy adult subjects will receive an&#xD;
      IV dose of SyB V-1901 alone, simultaneous administration of SyB V-1901 with cyclosporine, and&#xD;
      coadministration of cyclosporine at 2 hours after completion of SyB V-1901 infusion. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized to one of two groups, to receive the treatment sequence of&#xD;
      assigned group.&#xD;
