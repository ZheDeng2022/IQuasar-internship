  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain pressure threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline and immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT) is one of these tests and it is defined as the minimum force applied which induces pain. The measurement shall be carried out by using an algometer (pressure device that induces mechanical stimuli) is to standardize the amount of pressure applied in the neck region. The reliability of pressure pain thresholds according to raters or measurement frequencies is relatively high</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Temporal sumation</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline and immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Temporal summation is a somatosensory measure that is performed by making small punctures in the area of interest.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Electrodermal activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline and immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Electrodermal Activity will be measured through the use of two electrodes that recorded changes in conductance through the skin located at the back of the dominant hand</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiration Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline and immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Respiration Rate will be measured through a pressure transducer located in the centre of the chest, where it was fixed by a strap.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline and immediately post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Heart Rate will be measured by three electrodes located in the left area of the chest. One of the electrodes was placed in the middle zone while a second electrode was positioned on the lateral side, and a third one on the lower left side, below the first electrode.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Salivary stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline and immediately post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The Salivary Stress Test is a study that assesses fatigue and the type of stress (acute, moderate or chronic) presented by the subject.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual and Kinesthetic Motor Imagery Ability</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline and immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Visual and Kinesthetic Motor Imagery Ability will be measured with Movement Imagery Questionnaire-Revised (MIQ-R). MIQ-R has four movements repeated in two subscales, a visual and a kinesthetic one. Additionally, a score between 1 and 7 is assigned, with 1 representing difficulty in picturing the motor image or difficulty in feeling the movement previously made, and 7 representing the maximum ease. The internal consistencies of the MIQ-R have been consistently adequate with Cronbach's Î± coefficients ranging above 0.84 for the total scale, 0.80 for de visual subscale and 0.84 for the kinesthetic subscale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The degree of physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of physical activity was objectified through the The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) questionnaire, which allows the subjects to be divided into three groups according to their level of activity, which can be high, moderate, and low or inactive. The IPAQ consists of 7 questions about the frequency, duration and intensity of activity (moderate and intense) performed in the last seven days, as well as walking and sitting time on a workday. The IPAQ scoring protocol assigns the following MET values to walking, moderate, and vigorous intensity activity: 3.3 METs, 4.0 METs, and 8.0 METs, respectively.</description>
