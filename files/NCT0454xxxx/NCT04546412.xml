      This study will assess if there are microtubule cytoplasmic features specifically associated&#xD;
      with oocyte vitrification.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Successful fertilization is heavily dependent upon inherent qualities of the oocytes, and&#xD;
      thus reliant upon the fidelity of oocyte maturation. Reduced oocyte developmental competence&#xD;
      is one of the main reasons for the decreased potential of in-vitro-produced embryos.&#xD;
      Approximately 8,6% to 15% of all infertility patients produce at least one meiotically&#xD;
      incompetent oocyte. There are also extreme cases of women which generate oocytes with&#xD;
      complete or predominant failure to complete meiosis. These oocytes arrest and do not complete&#xD;
      meiosis in response to exogenous final maturation and ovulation triggering. The incidence of&#xD;
      this is unknown, and given the complexity of the processes involved in oocyte maturation, it&#xD;
      has been difficult to define the key events or morphological features underlying oocyte&#xD;
      competence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increasing amount of evidence in the past years has suggested that the microtubule (MT)&#xD;
      cytoskeleton may have an important role in providing the oocyte with competence potential.&#xD;
      Oocyte maturation involves major rearrangements of the MT cytoskeleton. It is well known the&#xD;
      importance of forming a proper microtubule meiotic spindle for chromosome segregation upon&#xD;
      meiosis. Moreover, MTs seem to be important for the redistribution of different organelles&#xD;
      upon maturation. However, the exact functional significance of this reorganization and how&#xD;
      MTs influence competence through the repositioning of these organelles is largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main MT organizing center in eukaryotic cells is the centrosome. Indeed, centrosomes are&#xD;
      essential for the formation of the mitotic MT bipolar spindle. Interestingly, in the vast&#xD;
      majority of female eggs these structures are eliminated, and the meiotic spindle does not&#xD;
      contain centrosomes. A recent study in the lab organism Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly),&#xD;
      showed that interrupting this elimination, forcing the maintenance of centrosomes up to&#xD;
      meiosis, led to female infertility. Both meiosis and the first nuclear divisions upon&#xD;
      fertilization showed abnormal MT spindles with abnormal chromosome congression. This shows&#xD;
      that proper spaciotemporal MT organization is likely to have important implications on oocyte&#xD;
      competence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this research group is to analyze the MT cytoskeleton of oocytes from&#xD;
      women which, upon assisted reproductive technologies, generate a high percentage of arrested&#xD;
      embryos. In order to do this, the MT features of already-available surplus and unused oocytes&#xD;
      which are vitrified and available for research purposes will be compared. These oocytes were&#xD;
      donated from cycles in which a low (&lt;20% the fertilized embryos) and high (&gt;20% the&#xD;
      fertilized embryos) incidence of arrested embryos was seen. Previous studies have posited&#xD;
      that oocyte vitrification and warming may expose the oocyte to a variety of physical and&#xD;
      chemical processes which may impact on their structural and genomic integrity. Therefore,&#xD;
      this initial feasibility pilot study will investigate potential structural consequences for&#xD;
      the oocytes of the vitrification procedure used in house.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, it will be assess whether the Cryotop® - Open System induces specific MT features which&#xD;
      may be absent in fresh oocytes. In case that both fresh and vitrified oocytes (derived from&#xD;
      the same patient - sibling oocytes study) show a similar MT cytoskeleton organization, a&#xD;
      collection of cryopreserved oocytes donated for research purposes will be used in the planned&#xD;
      future studies of this research group.&#xD;
