      Evaluation of the individual cardiovascular risk profile of patients with non-alcoholic fatty&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in western&#xD;
      industrialized countries. Globally, but also in Germany, the current prevalence of NAFLD in&#xD;
      the adult population is about 20-30% with a continuing upward trend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main cause of death in patients with NAFLD include cardiovascular events and the major&#xD;
      risk factor for the occurrence of cardiovascular events is arterial hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides absolute systolic and diastolic blood pressure values, disturbances of circadian&#xD;
      blood pressure variability seem to be of particular relevance for the occurrence of&#xD;
      cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (24-h-ABPM) has been established as the most&#xD;
      reliable, non-invasive method to diagnose arterial hypertension. 24-h-ABPM complements office&#xD;
      blood pressure measurement by the option of characterizing the circadian blood pressure&#xD;
      profile and is superior to it in terms of predicting total mortality and cardiovascular&#xD;
      mortality. Under- or overestimation of the actual blood pressure level during individual&#xD;
      measurements in everyday clinical practice can be avoided by using 24-h-ABPM and special&#xD;
      hypertension phenotypes such as white coat hypertension or masked hypertension can be&#xD;
      identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, modern 24-h-ABPM devices allow a simultaneous pulse wave analysis (PWA) to&#xD;
      evaluate central hemodynamic parameters such as central aortic blood pressure, systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure augmentation and pulse wave velocity. Using these functional parameters of pulsatile&#xD;
      hemodynamics, it is possible to determine the extent of vascular damage and the&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk of the individual patient much earlier and more precisely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the epidemiological relationship between hypertension and cardiovascular morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality in patients with NAFLD is well known, arterial hypertension and its special&#xD;
      subtypes are still under- or misdiagnosed in this risk group or not sufficiently controlled&#xD;
      when diagnosis has been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we analyse the frequency of arterial hypertension and associated special&#xD;
      subtypes (masked hypertension, white-coat hypertension) and altered functional hemodynamics&#xD;
      in NAFLD patients using 24-h-ABPM and PWA. In addition we analyse serological biomarkerst to&#xD;
      evaluate the individual cardiovascualr risk profile. Healthy persons without NAFLD as well as&#xD;
      patients with other chronic liver diseases serve as controll and comparison group,&#xD;
      respectiveley.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After successful characterization of the patient-specific cardiovascular risk profile, the&#xD;
      development and establishment of a multimodal prevention program for NAFLD patients is&#xD;
      planned. Central aspects of this interdisciplinary concept include counseling and guidance on&#xD;
      lifestyle modifications (weight reduction, increase of physical activity, etc.) and&#xD;
      optimization of the adjustment of cardiometabolic comorbidities (especially diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      type 2, lipid metabolism disorders).&#xD;
