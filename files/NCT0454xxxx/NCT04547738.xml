  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Filarial nematodes modulate the host immune response to promote regulatory and T helper type&#xD;
      2 immune responses, which were shown to influence concomitant infections. Indeed, several&#xD;
      studies showed that increased susceptibility and worsened disease course of HIV, tuberculosis&#xD;
      (TB) and malaria in filarial endemic regions. Moreover, the investigators demonstrated that&#xD;
      M. perstans infections polarize and suppress immune responses with likely consequences for&#xD;
      concomitant infections and vaccine-induced protection. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      observed altered frequencies of natural killer and regulatory T and B cells in filarial and&#xD;
      M. tuberculosis co-infected individuals and that M. perstans influences CD4+ T cell function&#xD;
      and immune responses upon purified protein derivative antigen stimulation. Nevertheless, the&#xD;
      consequences of manifestation of TB disease and influence on TB vaccination remains unknown.&#xD;
      Thus, the trial aim to address two main questions with high clinical relevance: 1) Does&#xD;
      filarial infection influence disease severity and recovery in tuberculosis patients? 2) Does&#xD;
      filarial infection influence Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-induced protection against disease&#xD;
      progression in vaccinated children?&#xD;
