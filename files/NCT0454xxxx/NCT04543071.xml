    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if combination treatment with cemiplimab,&#xD;
      motixafortide, gemcitabine, and nab-paclitaxel is effective in decreasing the size of the&#xD;
      tumor(s), if it will prolong life in patients, and if it's safe. The treatment consists of&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy (gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel) which is FDA approved and is standard&#xD;
      treatment for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Participants will receive&#xD;
      immunotherapy (cemiplimab) which activates the body's immune system to attack cancer cells.&#xD;
      Cemiplimab is FDA approved for treatment of skin cancer but not for pancreas cancer.&#xD;
      Participants will also receive Motixafortide, a new medication which has shown in the&#xD;
      laboratory to help immunotherapy work better. Motixafortide has been tested together with&#xD;
      immunotherapy (Pembrolizumab), and chemotherapy (5-Fluorouracil and liposomal Irinotecan) and&#xD;
      was deemed safe to test additional patients. Motixafortide has not been tested with the&#xD;
      specific immunotherapy (Cemiplimab) and chemotherapy (gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel) which&#xD;
      participants will receive and is being tested in this clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreas adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive pancreatic cancer for which little progress&#xD;
      has been made towards effective treatment. This is a Phase 2 open-label, multi-center study&#xD;
      for patients with treatment-naïve metastatic PDAC. The goal of the study is to assess the&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of a CXCR4 antagonist (motixafortide), (cemiplimab), gemcitabine and&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel compared based on the response rate to historical controls in first line&#xD;
      metastatic PDAC. Subjects will be treated with 5 days of motixafortide daily alone in the&#xD;
      priming phase, followed by motixafortide twice a week, cemiplimab once every three weeks and&#xD;
      and standard of care chemotherapy (gemcitabine and nabpaclitaxel).&#xD;

&#xD;
         25. History of other malignancy Patient may not have a history of malignancy other than&#xD;
             PDAC within two years prior to screening, with the exception of those with a&#xD;
             negligible risk of metastasis or death (e.g., 5- year overall survival of &gt; 90%), such&#xD;
             as adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, non-melanoma skin carcinoma,&#xD;
             localized prostate cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, or Stage I uterine cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Recent vaccination: Patients may not have been treated with a live, attenuated vaccine&#xD;
             within four weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipate the need for&#xD;
             such a vaccine during treatment with cemiplimab or within five months after the last&#xD;
             dose of cemiplimab.&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. History of severe allergic anaphylactic reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies&#xD;
             or fusion proteins&#xD;
&#xD;
         28. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drug excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
         29. Recent immunosuppressive treatment: Patients may not have been treated with systemic&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medication (including, but not limited to, corticosteroids,&#xD;
             cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, calcineurin inhibitors, and&#xD;
             anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents) within two weeks prior to initiation of study&#xD;
             treatment, or anticipate the need for systemic immunosuppressive medication during the&#xD;
             course of the study, with the following exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Patients who received a one-time pulse dose of systemic immunosuppressant&#xD;
             medication are eligible for the study after approval from the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         30. Pregnancy: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because there is an unknown,&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events to the fetus. Breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued prior to start of treatment because there is an unknown, but potential&#xD;
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         31. Other contraindicated conditions Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical&#xD;
             examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding that contraindicates the use of an&#xD;
             investigational drug, may affect the interpretation of the results, or may render the&#xD;
             patient at high risk from treatment complications in the opinion of the treating&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         32. Uncontrolled psoriasis, porphyria, proximal myopathy or neuropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
         33. Severe depression Subjects hospitalized for depression within the past two years, or&#xD;
             who have prior suicidal attempts will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         34. Has received transfusions of blood products (including platelets or red blood cells)&#xD;
             within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         35. Patients who received mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone), corticosteroids for&#xD;
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, or low-dose corticosteroids for&#xD;
             orthostatic hypotension or adrenal insufficiency are eligible for the study if&#xD;
             receiving equivalent to ≤ 10 mg of prednisone daily (10mg prednisone is equivalent to&#xD;
             either cortisone - 50mg; hydrocortisone - 40mg; triamcinolone - 8mg; prednisolone -&#xD;
             10mg; methylprednisolone - 8mg; betamethasone - 1.5mg; or dexamethasone - 1.5mg).&#xD;
             Patients receiving &gt; 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent per day for greater than five&#xD;
             days within 28 days of starting study related therapy are not eligible. Steroids&#xD;
             administered prior to gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel should be administered as per&#xD;
             standard institutional guidelines.&#xD;
