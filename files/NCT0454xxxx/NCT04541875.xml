  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use the Medication Adherence Reasons Scale (MAR-Scale) to&#xD;
      determine the extent of non-adherence to specific medications indicated to treat cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis, hemophilia (A or B), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, myasthenia gravis, and sickle&#xD;
      cell disease, and to identify the top patient-reported reasons for non-adherence. Internal&#xD;
      reliability of the MAR-Scale will also be assessed in each condition.&#xD;
