  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amphoteric regulatory protein (AREG), a member of epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, is&#xD;
      expressed in many tumors.Our study confirmed that the expression of AREG in the serum of&#xD;
      patients with pancreatic cancer is significantly higher than that of patients with benign&#xD;
      pancreatic diseases and healthy people, which is expected to become a new early serum marker&#xD;
      of pancreatic cancer. The serum concentration of AREG was detected by traditional ELISA and&#xD;
      compared with CA-199, which was a conventional tumor marker of pancreatic cancer. Next, we&#xD;
      compare the advantages of using sensor to detect AREG compared with ELISA.&#xD;

      Serum was collected ： pancreatic cancer : healthy control =200:200 Clinical data were&#xD;
      collected: age, gender, diagnosis, cancer stage, CA199 level at initial diagnosis,&#xD;
      histopathological type, etc. The informed consent of the subjects was obtained before the&#xD;
      study, and all experimental procedures were approved by ethics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Draw a summary table of patient characteristics. The level of AREG was detected by ELISA kit&#xD;
      and compared with CA199.&#xD;
