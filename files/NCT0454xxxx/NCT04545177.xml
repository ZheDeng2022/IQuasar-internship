  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent experiments are giving researchers insight into the changes (mutations) that occur in&#xD;
      an individual brain tumor cell compared to a normal cell. Currently, we do not have enough&#xD;
      knowledge about how uniform these changes are throughout a single brain tumor and if&#xD;
      different regions of a brain tumor have different groupings of changes. By obtaining multiple&#xD;
      samples of the tumor from various regions during surgery, it will allow researchers to better&#xD;
      understand these changes, with the hope that they will lead to new discoveries in the&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors.&#xD;

      This is a single site, interventional cohort study to assess the feasibility of the NICO&#xD;
      Myriad and Tissue Preservation System (TPS) to collect and preserve biologically active&#xD;
      tissue in 5 prospectively-enrolled participants with Glioblastoma (GBM) undergoing surgical&#xD;
      resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the viability of tumor tissue obtained by&#xD;
      the NICO Myriad and Tissue Preservation System (TPS) via an automated, standardized&#xD;
      methodology in participants undergoing surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory objective of this study is to assess the spatial genomic and transcriptomic&#xD;
      heterogeneity of GBM tumors in 3 locations via preoperative annotation and stereotactic&#xD;
      guidance&#xD;
