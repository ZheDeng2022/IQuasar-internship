  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to explore the optimal AI value for isolating the pulmonary&#xD;
      veins and achieving left ventricular apex and mitral isthmus block. Patients with atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation who are scheduled to undergo catheter ablation will be randomized to different&#xD;
      groups, then every group receive circumferential pulmonary vein isolation with different AI&#xD;
      values. The relevant indicators such as the proportion of pulmonary vein single-circle&#xD;
      isolation, operation time, the incidence of complications, and the proportion of recurrence&#xD;
      of atrial fibrillation and other atrial arrhythmias after 1 year were collected.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial. In this part,a total of 90&#xD;
      patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who are scheduled for catheter ablation were&#xD;
      randomly divided into 3 groups, 30 patients in each group. For the first group, the AI target&#xD;
      value for the front wall and the top wall is 550, and the rear wall and the lower wall are&#xD;
      400. For the second group, the AI target values for the front wall and the top wall are 500,&#xD;
      the rear wall and the lower wall are 350. For the third group, the AI target values for the&#xD;
      front wall and top wall are 450, the rear wall and the lower wall are 300. The pressure value&#xD;
      at each point is 5-15 g, and the distance between adjacent ablation points is less than 5 mm.&#xD;
      The relevant indicators such as single-circle isolation rate of the pulmonary vein, operation&#xD;
      time, the left atrial operation time, and the supplemental ablation site are recoded. The&#xD;
      incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications such as stroke, pericardial&#xD;
      tamponade and steam pop during ablation are observed. Dynamic electrocardiography is&#xD;
      performed during the follow-up period to evaluate the proportion of sinus rhythm within 1&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
