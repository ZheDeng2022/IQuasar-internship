  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung ultrasonography (LUS) is fast and easy technique. it also has high reliability, so it&#xD;
      has started to be used more in evaluating respiratory distress in the neonatal period. The&#xD;
      most important feature of LUS is being radiation-free. Three LUS findings that show&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome were described. They were white lung appearance, lack of&#xD;
      preserved areas and loss of pleural integrity. The sensitivity of these findings was found to&#xD;
      be 98-100% and the specificity 92-100%. A few studies have shown that surfactant need can be&#xD;
      determined by LUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was observed that lung findings were more severe in LUS performed in the early period&#xD;
      because of non-completed fetal lung fluid clearence, but the findings could be improved&#xD;
      during follow-up. Therefore, it is not known when the earliest time of LUS shows the actual&#xD;
      clinical condition and course of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was planned to find the most reliable and earliest US time. Evaluation with LUS&#xD;
      was done at 30 minutes and repeated at 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours of life. The LUS findings would be&#xD;
      compared with x-ray findings and the correlation of surfactant need with LUS findings would&#xD;
      also be investigated.&#xD;
