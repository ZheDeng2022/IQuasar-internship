  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People living with HIV (PLHIV) who require admission to hospital in WHO Africa region have&#xD;
      poor outcomes. TB is very common in this group, but can be difficult to diagnose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CASTLE trial aims to determine whether systematic screening for tuberculosis using&#xD;
      digital chest X-ray with computer-aided diagnosis (DCXR-CAD) plus urine lipoarabinomannan&#xD;
      testing with Fujifilm SILVAMP TB LAM (FujiLAM) plus usual care can improve admission outcomes&#xD;
      for hospitalised PLHIV, compared to usual care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is a single centre, unblinded, cluster-randomised (by day of admission) trial of&#xD;
      DCXR-CAD plus FujiLAM plus usual care vs. usual care alone for screening for TB in unselected&#xD;
      adult PLHIV admitted to a district general hospital in Malawi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the proportion of people starting TB treatment by the time of death or&#xD;
      hospital discharge. The secondary outcomes are all-cause mortality at 56 days from enrolment,&#xD;
      proportion of people starting TB treatment within 24 hours from enrolment, and proportion of&#xD;
      people with undiagnosed TB. In the CASTLE study we collect a single sputum sample for M. tb&#xD;
      culture from participants and undiagnosed TB specifically refers to a person who did not&#xD;
      start TB treatment by the time of death or discharge from hospital and has a M. tb cultured&#xD;
      from their sputum sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alongside the two trial arms, a third smaller diagnostic cohort arm (1 in 9 of admission days&#xD;
      / trial clusters) will explore the range of underlying infectious pathology. The diagnostic&#xD;
      cohort does not contribute to trial outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the usual care arm will receive no specific trial intervention.

    <description>Participants randomized to the intervention arm will receive TB screening using DCXR-CAD and urine FujiLAM. The CAD score and FujLAM results will be appended into their medical notes for treating clinicians to see. If patients have a CAD score above a pre-determined threshold the study team will attempt to collect sputum for Xpert Mtb/Rif. Chest X-ray images will be available for clinicians to view. This is in addition to usual care (detailed above).</description>
