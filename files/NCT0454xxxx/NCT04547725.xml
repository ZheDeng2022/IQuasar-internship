  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Approximately 15% of gastric adenocarcinoma patients presents with peritoneal&#xD;
      carcinomatosis (PC) at the first encounter and is regarded as an unresectable and end-stage&#xD;
      disease. The recommended treatment with palliative chemotherapy alone yields a poor clinical&#xD;
      efficacy. Emerging evidences suggest the survival benefits of complete cytoreductive surgery&#xD;
      (CRS) combined with normothermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (N-IPEC) for gastric&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma with limited PC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the 6-month disease control rate (DCR) of complete CRS combined with&#xD;
      N-IPEC and systemic chemotherapy for gastric adenocarcinoma with limited PC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods: Patients having gastric adenocarcinoma with PCI ≤ 10 (Arm-A) or&#xD;
      positive peritoneal wash cytology (CY1/P0) (Arm-B) will be enrolled. Patients with other&#xD;
      distant metastasis, including brain, lung, liver, bone, will be excluded. All patients should&#xD;
      undergo ≥ D2 gastrectomy and complete CRS followed by N-IPEC (paclitaxel] and systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy (high-dose fluorouracil and cisplatin [P-HDFL], or capecitabine and oxaliplatin&#xD;
      [CAPOX]). N-IPEC (paclitaxel) will be administered in combination with systemic P-HDFL or&#xD;
      CAPOX on day 1,8,15 or day 1,8 for each cycle, respectively. The disease status will be&#xD;
      evaluated every 12 weeks based on the computed tomography scan, and the clinical evaluation&#xD;
      (outpatient follow-up) will be performed every 2 weeks for whom receiving P-HDFL and every 3&#xD;
      weeks for whom receiving CAPOX. Patients will receive maximal 6 cycles N-IPEC with P-HDFL or&#xD;
      8 cycles N-IPEC with CAPOX. After N-IPEC is discontinued, P-HDFL or CAPOX will be continued&#xD;
      alone until disease progression or death. The primary endpoint of this study is 6-month DCR,&#xD;
      and the secondary endpoints include 6-month response rate for ascites, 1-year&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), 3-year PFS and OS, and safety&#xD;
      profiles. Based on Simon's minimax two-stage design, this trial will be carried out in two&#xD;
      stages. In stage I, a total number of 13 (Arm-A) / 16 (Arm-B) patients is accrued. If there&#xD;
      are ≤ 6 (Arm-A) / ≤ 14 (Arm-B) progression-free among these 13 (Arm-A) / 16 (Arm-B) patients,&#xD;
      the study will be early stopped. Otherwise, additional 17 (Arm-A) / 2 (Arm-B) patients will&#xD;
      be accrued in stage II, resulting in a total number sample size of 30 (Arm-A) / 18 (Arm-B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected result: A ≥ 75% (Arm-A) / ≥ 95% (Arm-B) 6-month DCR could be achieved for gastric&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma patients with limited PC (Arm-A) / with CY1P0 (Arm-B) via this treatment&#xD;
      strategy (complete CRS + N-IPEC + P-HDFL or CAPOX) -i.e., if there are ≥ 21 (Arm-A) / ≥ 16&#xD;
      (Arm-B) progression-free among the 30 (Arm-A) / 18 (Arm-B) enrolled patients, we will reject&#xD;
      the null hypothesis and claim that the treatment is promising.&#xD;

      Background: Approximately 15% of gastric adenocarcinoma patients presents with peritoneal&#xD;
      carcinomatosis (PC) at the first encounter and is regarded as an unresectable and end-stage&#xD;
      disease. The recommended treatment with palliative chemotherapy alone yields a poor clinical&#xD;
      efficacy and long-term prognosis. Emerging evidences suggest the survival benefits of&#xD;
      complete cytoreductive surgery (CRS) combined with intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IP) for&#xD;
      gastric adenocarcinoma with limited PC. Previous studies focused on the CRS combined with&#xD;
      hyperthermic IP chemotherapy (HIPEC); however, the high morbidity and mortality rates of&#xD;
      HIPEC have raised a safety concern and limited the clinical application. The normothermic IP&#xD;
      chemotherapy (N-IPEC), on the other hand, is a safer and gentler type of IP chemotherapy, and&#xD;
      has gained in popularity and been evaluated in many recent clinical trials. The criteria for&#xD;
      patient selection and standard protocol of complete CRS combined with N-IPEC and systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy remain to be determined. Moreover, treatment efficacy regarding this strategy is&#xD;
      still suboptimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the 6-month disease control rate (DCR) of complete CRS combined with&#xD;
      N-IPEC (paclitaxel) and systemic chemotherapy (high-dose fluorouracil and cisplatin;&#xD;
      [P-HDFL], or capecitabine and oxaliplatin [CAPOX]) for gastric adenocarcinoma patients with&#xD;
      limited PC (peritoneal carcinomatosis index [PCI] ≤ 10) (Arm-A) or positive peritoneal wash&#xD;
      cytology (CY1/P0) (Arm-B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods: Patients having resectable advanced gastric adenocarcinoma with limited&#xD;
      PC (PCI ≤ 10) (Arm-A) or positive peritoneal wash cytology (CY1/P0) (Arm-B) will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Patients with distant metastasis other than PC, including brain, lung, liver, bone, will be&#xD;
      excluded. All patients should undergo D2 or more extensive gastrectomy and complete CRS&#xD;
      followed by N-IPEC (paclitaxel) and systemic chemotherapy (P-HDFL or CAPOX). N-IPEC with&#xD;
      paclitaxel 20 mg/m2 will be administered in combination with systemic P-HDFL or CAPOX on day&#xD;
      1,8,15 or day 1,8 for each cycle, respectively. Peritoneal cytology will be collected at the&#xD;
      surgery and on day 1 of each treatment cycle. The disease status and ascites amount will be&#xD;
      evaluated every 12 weeks based on the computed tomography scan, and the clinical evaluation&#xD;
      (outpatient follow-up) will be performed every 2 weeks for whom receiving P-HDFL and every 3&#xD;
      weeks for whom receiving CAPOX. Patients will receive maximal 6 cycles N-IPEC with P-HDFL&#xD;
      (total 18 courses of N-IPEC) or 8 cycles N-IPEC with CAPOX (total 16 courses of N-IPEC).&#xD;
      After N-IPEC is discontinued, P-HDFL or CAPOX will be continued alone until disease&#xD;
      progression or death. The primary endpoint of this study is 6-month DCR, and the secondary&#xD;
      endpoints include 6-month response rate for ascites, 1-year progression-free survival (PFS)&#xD;
      and overall survival (OS), 3-year PFS and OS, and safety profiles. Based on Simon's minimax&#xD;
      two-stage design, this trial will be carried out in two stages. In stage I, a total number of&#xD;

      progression-free among these 13 (Arm-A) / 16 (Arm-B) patients, the study will be early&#xD;
      stopped. Otherwise, additional 17 (Arm-A) / 2 (Arm-B) patients will be accrued in stage II,&#xD;
      resulting in a total number sample size of 30 (Arm-A) / 18 (Arm-B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected result: A ≥ 75% (Arm-A) / ≥ 95% (Arm-B) 6-month DCR could be achieved for gastric&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma patients with limited PC (Arm-A) / with CY1P0 (Arm-B) via this treatment&#xD;
