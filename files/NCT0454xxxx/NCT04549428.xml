          -  Signed Informed Consent Form&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic (Stage IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NSCLC as per the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No sensitizing EGFR mutation (L858R or exon 19 deletions), ALK fusion oncogene or ROS1&#xD;
             rearrangement detected&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Progressing to one line of chemotherapy defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A platinum-doublet.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. In case of patients being ineligible for platinum-containing regimens but&#xD;
                  otherwise compliant with the other inclusion-exclusion criteria of the present&#xD;
                  study, at least one line of mono-chemotherapy is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. As an exception, patients with oligoprogression to anti PD-1 agents alone for&#xD;
                  whom the investigator considers local treatment of metastases and continuation of&#xD;
                  immunotherapy appropriate (i.e. would not be eligible for 2nd line treatment) may&#xD;
                  be enrolled without a previous line of chemotherapy. In this case, approval by&#xD;
                  the Project Leader is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Progressing to an anti-PD-1 agent, either associated to chemotherapy or as monotherapy&#xD;
             (e.g., pembrolizumab or nivolumab)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with treated, asymptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases are&#xD;
             eligible, provided they meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Measurable disease outside CNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Only supratentorial and cerebellar metastases allowed (i.e., no metastases to&#xD;
                  midbrain, pons, medulla or spinal cord).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. No ongoing requirement for corticosteroids as therapy for CNS disease;&#xD;
                  anticonvulsants at a stable dose allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. No stereotactic radiation within 7 days or whole-brain radiation within 14 days&#xD;
                  prior to initiating study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. No evidence of interim progression between the completion of CNS-directed therapy&#xD;
                  and the screening radiographic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with new asymptomatic CNS metastases detected at the screening scan must&#xD;
             receive radiation therapy and/or surgery for CNS metastases. Following treatment,&#xD;
             these patients may then be eligible without the need for an additional brain scan&#xD;
             prior to initiating study treatment, if all other criteria are met, including clinical&#xD;
             confirmation of no evidence of interim disease progression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease by RECIST v1.1. Previously irradiated lesions can only be&#xD;
             considered as measurable disease if disease progression has been unequivocally&#xD;
             documented at that site since radiation and the previously irradiated lesion is not&#xD;
             the only site of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Oligoprogressive disease defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A minimum of 1 and a maximum of 4 progressing lesions (with up to 3 total organs&#xD;
                  and 3 lesions per organ, except skeletal lesions) as assessed by a Positron&#xD;
                  Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT) scan (contrast enhanced).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Definition of progression is made by RECIST 1.1 criteria (new lesions or&#xD;
                  increased pre-existing ones).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Patients with additional non-progressing lesions according to RECIST 1.1 are&#xD;
                  accepted, but non-progressing lesions according to RECIST 1.1 with 6% to 19%&#xD;
                  increase in diameter, should also be included in the radiation scheme, provided&#xD;
                  the limit of lesions/diameter/organs is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate hematologic and end organ function, defined by the laboratory results&#xD;
             obtained within 14 days prior to initiating study treatment (see §7.1 of the protocol&#xD;
             for full details).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For female patients of childbearing potential agreement to remain abstinent (refrain&#xD;
             from heterosexual intercourse) or to use highly effective form(s) of contraceptive&#xD;
             methods that result in a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year when used consistently and&#xD;
             correctly during the treatment period and for at least 5 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             atezolizumab.&#xD;
