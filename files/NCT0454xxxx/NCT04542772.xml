  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Canada, the number of stroke survivors is equivalent to the size of one of the four&#xD;
      Atlantic Provinces. The incident rate of stroke has been increasing steadily since 1995. The&#xD;
      majority of the stroke survivors lose upper extremity function, resulting in diminished&#xD;
      activities of daily living (ADL). Many therapeutic interventions are recommended to improve&#xD;
      upper extremity function or ADLs of stroke survivors, however, Mirror Therapy (MT),&#xD;
      inexpensive intervention, can be self-administered by stroke survivors with intact cognition.&#xD;
      Thus, the research question is whether a self-administered MT technique improves acute stroke&#xD;
      patients' upper extremity motor function and recovery?&#xD;

    <time_frame>Assessment will be completed at 2 points: Pre-test assessment will be done within 48 hours of stroke admission and post-test assessment will be done at 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Scores of &lt; 31 corresponded with 'no to poor' upper extremity capacity, 32 to 47 represented 'limited capacity', 48 to 52 represented 'notable capacity' and 53 to 66 represented 'full' upper extremity capacity.</description>

During Mirror Therapy education, the patients will be educated or shown how to perform MT and the patients will complete the recommended exercises on their own for 30 minutes/day for 5 days a week/ for 4 weeks. Standard Mirror Therapy Protocol will be followed.</description>
