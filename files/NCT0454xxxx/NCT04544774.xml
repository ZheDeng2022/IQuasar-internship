  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective multicentric academic NAPT study aims to compile a database of all patients&#xD;
      who initiate immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NAPT will take place before, during and after AIT to evaluate the cost and effectiveness&#xD;
      of the treatment. The study consists of 4 visits and 2 telephone contacts that are repeated&#xD;
      annually for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in 2 hospitals: UZ Leuven and AZ ST. Jan Brugge on the&#xD;
      consultation Ear, Nose and Throat Diseases (ENT) and the department of Internal Medicine /&#xD;
      Allergology&#xD;
