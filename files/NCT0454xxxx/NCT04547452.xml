  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy, and more than 70% of newly diagnosed&#xD;
      HCC patients already have advanced disease. Sorafenib and lenvatinib are recommended as&#xD;
      first-line options for advanced HCC. The PD-1 monoclonal antibody，such as nivolumab and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, have been approved to treat the patients with advanced HCC by the FDA.&#xD;
      Combining radiotherapy with immune checkpoints showed promising response rates and improved&#xD;
      survival in several solid tumor types. The purpose of this randomized study is to determine&#xD;
      whether stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) combined with sintilimab (an anti-PD-1&#xD;
      antibody) will improve the response to the anticancer treatment compared to sintilimab alone&#xD;
      in patients with advanced HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 84 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at West China&#xD;
      Hospital, Sichuan University.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 84 HCC patients who are failure from the first line Sorafenib or lenvatinib&#xD;
      treatment will be randomized to two treatment arms using a 1:1 ratio: SBRT + PD-1 arm or PD-1&#xD;
      alone arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both arms will receive sintilimab administered intravenously at 200 mg every 3&#xD;
      weeks. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) using volumetric arc therapy. The prescribed&#xD;
      dose is 30-54 Gy in 3-6 fractions over 1-2 weeks. In the SBRT + PD-1 arm, sintilimab is&#xD;
      administered intravenously at 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 1 year. The first course of&#xD;
      sintilimab will be given within 4-6 weeks after completion of SBRT.&#xD;
