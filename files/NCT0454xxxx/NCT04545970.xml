    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of an anti-aging serum to improve the appearance of expression lines as&#xD;
      well as overall skin health of aging skin after 12 weeks of twice-daily use in female&#xD;
      subjects, aged 35-60, compared to placebo. A total of 55 subjects completed study&#xD;
      participation which included 33 subjects in the active group and 22 subjects in the placebo&#xD;
      group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial is being conducted to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of the anti-aging serum when used over the course of 12 weeks by&#xD;
      women with mild to moderate fine lines, wrinkles and overall photodamage on the global face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy and tolerability will be assess through clinical grading at baseline, weeks 4, 8,&#xD;
      and 12. Efficacy evaluation on fine lines and wrinkles through clinical grading will also be&#xD;
      performed at 15 minutes post product application. Self-assessment questionnaires and VISIA&#xD;
      photography will be completed at baseline, weeks 4, 8, and 12. 3D PRIMOS photography will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline, weeks 8 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 55 subjects completed study participation which included 33 subjects in the active&#xD;
      group and 22 subjects in the placebo group.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Randomization will occur by assignment to either the active group or placebo group using a randomization table prepared prior to the start of the study by a non-participating staff member at the office of the investigator. Subjects will be assigned a number in numerical order as enrolled. The unblinded staff member will take a set of products from one of two groups of labeled active product vs. placebo and fill in the patient number and distribution date on the bottles to be dispensed to the subject.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Efficacy Graded by Griffiths' Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint will be the Investigator Clinical Grading using Modified Griffith's 10-point Scale. A decrease in scores at Day 28, Day 56 and Day 84 in comparison to baseline indicates an improvement for the indicated parameter.The efficacy parameters will be assessed globally on each subject's face using a modified Griffiths' 10-point scale according to the following numerical definitions (half-point scores may be used as necessary to more accurately describe the skin condition):&#xD;
0 = none (best possible condition); 1 to 3 = mild; 4 to 6 = moderate;7 to 9 = severe (worst possible condition). The lower the score equates to the best possible outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Tolerability: scores</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary tolerability endpoint will be the Investigator Tolerability Assessment of Erythema, Edema and Dryness. A decrease in scores or lack of significant increase at Day 28, Day 56 and Day 84 in comparison to Baseline indicates tolerability/safety of the test material. Four point scale with a lower score indicating a better outcome.&#xD;
Example for Erythema:Erythema 0 = None No erythema of the treatment area&#xD;
= Mild Slight, but definite redness of the treatment area&#xD;
= Moderate Definite redness of the treatment area&#xD;
= Severe Marked redness of the treatment area</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Tolerability: scores</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary tolerability endpoint will be the Subject Tolerability Assessment of Burning, Itching and Stinging. A decrease in scores or lack of significant increase at Day 28, Day 56 and Day 84 in comparison to Baseline indicates tolerability/safety of the test material. Four point scale with a lower score indicating a better outcome.&#xD;
Example Burning. 0 = None No burning of the treatment area&#xD;
= Mild Slight burning sensation of the treatment area; not really bothersome&#xD;
= Moderate Definite warm, burning of the treatment area that is somewhat bothersome.&#xD;
= Severe Hot burning sensation of the treatment area that causes definite discomfort and may interrupt daily activities and/or sleep</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self Assessment Questions</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary efficacy endpoints will be the Self-Assessment Questionnaire and the Subject Treatment Satisfaction and Ease of Use Questionnaire. A decrease or increase in response values at Day 28, Day 56 and Day 84 indicates an improvement compared to baseline response values. Subjects are asked to rate based on a scoring system of the following: from 5 (completely agree) to 1 (completely disagree). The best outcome is to Completely Agree with the statement/ question being asked.</description>
