  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional dyspepsia is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) encountered&#xD;
      in clinical practice. Functional dyspepsia is a clinical syndrome characterized by chronic&#xD;
      and recurrent gastroduodenal symptoms in the absence of any organic or metabolic disease that&#xD;
      is likely to explain the symptoms. Functional dyspepsia has a high incidence in the&#xD;
      population. A recent research showed that FD is present in 11% of the Italian general&#xD;
      population. It dramatically reduces a patient's quality of life, with an economic impact due&#xD;
      to frequent clinical consultations, medication, and time off work. Although some experts&#xD;
      recommend exercise as a first-line treatment for functional dyspepsia, there is little data&#xD;
      on the relationship between exercise and functional dyspepsia, which needs to be confirmed by&#xD;
      further research. Investigators designed this randomized controlled study to assess the&#xD;
      effect of exercise on patients with functional dyspepsia based on Rome IV criteria.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Regular physical activity and exercise may be a way of life to reduce low levels of&#xD;
      inflammation throughout the body, thereby reducing the risk of developing chronic diseases.&#xD;
      Multiple studies have shown that after regular exercise, markers of inflammation and&#xD;
      oxidative stress are reduced, while markers of inflammation and antioxidants are increased,&#xD;
      reflecting the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rome IV was introduced in 2016. Rome IV introduced more precisely define the minimal&#xD;
      thresholds for frequency and severity of each individual symptom, primarily for scientific&#xD;
      purposes, but data still need to be collected to define thresholds based on the frequency&#xD;
      and/or severity of symptoms that impair quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although some experts recommend exercise as a first-line treatment for functional dyspepsia,&#xD;
      there is little data on the relationship between exercise and functional dyspepsia, which&#xD;
      needs to be confirmed by further research. Investigators designed this randomized controlled&#xD;
      study to assess the effect of exercise on patients with functional dyspepsia based on Rome IV&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
