    <textblock>
      This phase I trial investigates how well a healthy eating program works in improving outcomes&#xD;
      in patients with bladder cancer. The behavioral dietary program consists of educational&#xD;
      materials, live phone calls, and interactive voice response phone messages. Participating in&#xD;
      the healthy eating program may improve eating habits and/or reduce the risk of bladder cancer&#xD;
      from coming back.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Develop an evidence-based behavioral intervention to increase cruciferous vegetable&#xD;
      intake, with the goal of attaining desirable urinary isothiocyanates (ITC) levels effective&#xD;
      for anti-cancer activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Conduct a feasibility pilot of our dietary behavioral intervention through a hybrid I&#xD;
      implementation randomized controlled design in 80 non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC)&#xD;
      survivors, where the treatment group (n=40) will receive an evidence-based telephone&#xD;
      intervention to increase cruciferous vegetable intake and the control group (n=40) will&#xD;
      receive a general fruit and vegetable intake intervention based on National Cancer Institute&#xD;
      (NCI) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To ascertain the level of gene expression changes in urinary exfoliated epithelial cells&#xD;
      (due to the intervention) as a surrogate for intermediate efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Engage the clinical care providers of patients enrolled in our intervention to ascertain&#xD;
      the barriers and facilitators of intervention implementation within clinical practice through&#xD;
      conducting 20 semi-structured interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM I: Develop an evidence-based behavioral intervention using a systematic process&#xD;
      consisting of information gathering, discussion groups, and mock intervention delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A (HEALTHY EATING PROGRAM A): Patients receive mailed educational materials about the&#xD;
      importance of consuming cruciferae, setting healthier eating goals, and the importance of&#xD;
      keeping track of what they eat. Patients also receive one phone call from study staff to make&#xD;
      sure they understood the educational materials received and 11 interactive voice response&#xD;
      (IVR) phone messages over 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B (HEALTHY EATING PROGRAM B): Patients receive mailed educational materials about general&#xD;
      fruit and vegetable intake, setting healthier eating goals, and the importance of keeping&#xD;
      track of what they eat. Patients also receive one phone call from study staff to make sure&#xD;
      they understood the educational materials received and 11 IVR phone messages over 6 months.&#xD;

    <description>Will be evaluated via ribonucleic acid-sequencing (RNA-seq) as a surrogate for intermediate efficacy, conducted at Roswell Park's Genomics Shared Resource using NextSeq500 platform (Illumina Inc.). Will summarize changes between pre- and post-intervention for both arms and calculate point estimates and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals.

    <description>Interviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, checked for accuracy and entered into a software program for the management of text data (e.g. NVivo 12).
