  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized clinical study, we aim to evaluate the effects of Teethmate Desensitizer&#xD;
      on postoperative sensitivity when applied underneath the composite restoration by comparing&#xD;
      it with the negative control group.&#xD;

      For the purpose of statistical preliminary analysis, the part related to the comparison of&#xD;
      the dependent two sample means (t test) was used in the G * power 3.1 program. The power of&#xD;
      the test was taken as 90%, margin of error 5% and effect size 0.50. The total sample size was&#xD;
      found to be 44. In this study, the required number of participants was determined to be at&#xD;
      least 44, since the split-mouth technique in which both the experimental and the control&#xD;
      groups will be used in each patient, and the number of participants to be included in the&#xD;
      study was determined as 50 considering the ''drop-outs'' that may occur during the study.&#xD;
      Then, randomization will be achieved using the blocked randomization technique. Randomization&#xD;
      will be done on www.sealedenvelope.com website. For blocked randomization, the seed number&#xD;
      will be 12345 and the block width will be 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After applying to Başkent University Faculty of Dentistry, dental caries are detected as a&#xD;
      result of the clinical and radiological examination, and female or male volunteers to be&#xD;
      included in the study will be selected among the patients who are referred to the Department&#xD;
      of Restorative Dentistry for treatment. Participation in the study is on a voluntary basis&#xD;
      and the participants who accept the invitation will have the Informed Consent Form read and&#xD;
      signed. If deemed necessary, the participants will be given oral hygiene motivation and&#xD;
      initiatives will be started after their oral hygiene is achieved to a satisfactory level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting treatment of individuals diagnosed with caries clinically and radiologically,&#xD;
      the vitality of the relevant teeth will be measured using a vitalometer (Model D624, Parkell&#xD;
      Inc, New York, USA). After the opening of 2 cavities in each participant, the cavities will&#xD;
      be isolated, and Teethmate Desensitizer will be applied randomly to one of the two cavities.&#xD;
      In order to ensure randomization, the randomization list prepared using the program on&#xD;
      www.sealedenvelop.com will be put in an opaque envelope. When the application will be made,&#xD;
      the envelope will be opened. Then, calcium hydroxide (Dycal, Dentsply Sirona, York, USA) will&#xD;
      be applied to the point where the pulp is closest to it. Restorations will be performed after&#xD;
      the matrix system (mylar strip, crab or Tofflemire) is applied when necessary according to&#xD;
      the cavity type. All cavities one-step self-etch an adhesive (Clearfil SE Bond, Kuraray&#xD;
      Noritake, Tokyo, Japan) LED light applied according to the user instructions (Ledmax Cordless&#xD;
      550 Benlioğlu Dental, Ankara, Turkey)&gt; 1,500mw / cm2 for 10 seconds polymerized. The cavities&#xD;
      will be restored using an oblique incremental technique with a universal composite resin&#xD;
      filling material (Filtek Z250, 3M Espe, St. Paul, MN, USA). Each composite resin layer will&#xD;
      be polymerized for 20 seconds using the same LED light source. Finishing and polishing of the&#xD;
      restorations will be done using diamond finishing burs, tires and polishing discs (Soflex, 3M&#xD;
      Espe, St. Paul, MN, USA). Restoration will be done by a single operator (LK). After the&#xD;
      restoration, patients will be given two forms, one for each tooth, where they will record&#xD;
      their daily pain levels for a week, and how to register on this form will be explained&#xD;
      (Appendix-3). These forms given to the participants will include a Numerical Rating Scale&#xD;
      (NRS) with values between 0-4 and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of 0-100mm for 1 week. When&#xD;
      patients will be called to the control appointment after a week, the forms in which they&#xD;
      score the sensitivity level will be taken back. 6 weeks after the restorations are applied,&#xD;
      the patients will be invited to a control appointment and the restorations will be checked.&#xD;
      At the one-week and six-week control appointments, the restorations will be evaluated by&#xD;
      another physician (KY). At the end of the sixth week, the vitality of the teeth will be&#xD;
      checked with the same vitalometer, if the tooth is vital, then for evaluating the&#xD;
      postoperative sensitivity, a cooling spray will be applied (Ice Spray, Picdare SpA, Casnate&#xD;
      con Bernate, Italy) to the middle of the buccal surfaces using the cotton pellets for 5&#xD;
      seconds. The postoperative hypersensitivity will be evaluated and recorded according to VAS&#xD;
      on a new registration form where the patient has no previous measurements. During the&#xD;
      six-week study, patients will be asked not to use any pain medication, and if the participant&#xD;
      uses painkillers during the study, the participant will be excluded from the study.&#xD;

    <description>Progress of postoperative hypersensitivity will be evaluated by using Visual Analog Scale. The Visual Analogue Scale will consist of a straight 10-cm-line with the endpoints defining extreme limits such as 'no pain at all' and 'pain as bad as it could be'. The patient will be asked to mark his pain level on the line between the two endpoints. The distance between 'no pain at all' and the mark then defines the subject's pain will be measured.</description>

    <description>Progress of postoperative hypersensitivity will be also evaluated by using Numerical Rating Scale with five possibilities for the patient to state how much sensitivity there is in each tooth. The patients will have the option of saying whether the sensitivity was equal to 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), 3 (considerable), or 4 (severe).</description>
