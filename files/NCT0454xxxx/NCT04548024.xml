      Our aim is to assess whether changes in CO, CI and SVR as measured using the Biobeat&#xD;
      wearable, wireless, non-invasive device during IV diuretic administration in an outpatient&#xD;
      setting among CHF patients correlate with short-term clinical change measured using symptoms&#xD;
      questionnaires, change in weight and urine output. We will also assess the correlation&#xD;
      between baseline values of those parameters and long-term clinical outcomes, measured by HF&#xD;
      hospitalizations and the change in disease perception and quality of life reported in&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is a common clinical syndrome resulting from structural and/or functional&#xD;
      cardiac abnormality. It affects 2.2% of American adults and over 12% of Americans â‰¥80 years&#xD;
      of age, and its total cost in the US was estimated at $30.7 billion in 2012. As prevalence&#xD;
      and overall cost are expected to considerably rise in the coming years, HF continues to&#xD;
      constitute a major burden to global health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HF is characterized with a progressive course of disease with high hospital readmission&#xD;
      rates, which account for a major portion of the economic burden. Improving the management of&#xD;
      congestion has been a crucial component in the efforts to reduce hospitalizations. Congestion&#xD;
      is a cardinal manifestation of HF, presenting with dyspnea, orthopnea, and edema due to&#xD;
      volume overload. Diuretics remain a cornerstone in the management of congestion; however,&#xD;
      there are no clear guidelines on how to adjust their administration. Guidelines recommend&#xD;
      monitoring of daily weight changes, but efficacy is debatable. Thus, there is a pressing need&#xD;
      to find reliable markers to promptly recognize deteriorations and help tailor diuretic&#xD;
      treatment to prevent them. To date, European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommend&#xD;
      two invasive monitoring approaches to guide management, one based on invasive wireless&#xD;
      pulmonary artery pressure monitoring and the other on utilizing data from Implantable&#xD;
      Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs). Hemodynamic monitoring using invasive right heart&#xD;
      catheterization has not shown benefit in management of HF decompensations, and nowadays is&#xD;
      reserved only for specific clinical scenarios. In the field of non-invasive monitoring,&#xD;
      research efforts have focused on analyzing lung impedance, ECG , and heart sounds with some&#xD;
      promising results; a recent study utilized machine learning to generate a personalized alert&#xD;
      system, but with a limited number of parameters monitored. Nevertheless, their algorithm's&#xD;
      success in predicting hospitalizations reflects the importance of recognizing the&#xD;
      heterogeneity of HF and the advantages of an individualized approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will examine the use of a non-invasive, user-friendly device (BB-613WP,&#xD;
      Biobeat Technologies LTD, Petah Tikva, Israel), in advanced HF patients receiving IV diuresis&#xD;
      in a hospital outpatient clinic. The device can derive measurements of several parameters,&#xD;
      including cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI), blood pressure (BP) and systemic vascular&#xD;
      resistance (SVR) using photoplethysmography (PPG) technology, and has been tested in several&#xD;
      clinical trials. We wish to assess if CO, CI and SVR can be utilized as markers for HF&#xD;
      clinical course, so they can ideally be used to intervene and modify treatment prior to a&#xD;
      deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature describing the effects of diuresis on CO and SVR is rather limited and&#xD;
      archaic. Most studies found a reduction in CO and a rise in SVR after diuresis, but some&#xD;
      describe the opposite, and some describe a response changing over time. This can be explained&#xD;
      when considering that the pathophysiology underlying the effects of volume status on cardiac&#xD;
      performance in HF is complex. The classically described Frank-Starling principle states that&#xD;
      contractility peaks at a muscle length that allows for optimal overlap of actin and myosin&#xD;
      filaments and maximal calcium ions sensitivity. Up to a certain point, the longer the muscle&#xD;
      is (represented as larger EDV, end diastolic volume), the higher the force of contraction.&#xD;
      But beyond that length, the contractile force decreases. Since different patients are&#xD;
      characterized with different levels of cardiac filling, volume reduction induced by diuresis&#xD;
      may have a different impact on CO, depending on the position on the Frank Starling curve. For&#xD;
      instance, impaired ventricular filling in HF with preserved ejection fraction can reduce&#xD;
      systolic function, due to less effective contraction in low EDV. Similarly, SVR, which is&#xD;
      inversely proportional to CO, is likely to be affected differently. Our primary objective is&#xD;
      to assess whether the changes in CO, CI and SVR during IV diuretic administration correlate&#xD;
      with short-term clinical change measured using symptoms questionnaires, change in weight and&#xD;
      urine output. Our secondary objective is to assess the correlation between baseline values of&#xD;
      those parameters and long-term clinical outcomes, measured by HF hospitalizations and the&#xD;
      change in disease perception and quality of life reported in questionnaires.&#xD;
