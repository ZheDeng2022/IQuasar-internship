    <textblock>
      This study is to analyse the demographics and microbiological factors concerning patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardio surgical intervention using CPB complicated with bloodstream infection&#xD;
      (BSI) postoperatively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infectious complications after cardiovascular surgery, especially in operations that use&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), is associated with significant morbidity and increase in&#xD;
      peri-operative mortality. Prolonged CPB usage could be predictive for early bloodstream&#xD;
      infection following cardia surgery. This study is to analyse the demographics and&#xD;
      microbiological factors concerning patients undergoing cardio surgical intervention using CPB&#xD;
      complicated with bloodstream infection (BSI) postoperatively.&#xD;
