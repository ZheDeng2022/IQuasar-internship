  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will test the effects of a telehealth counseling program on reducing alcohol use&#xD;
      and improving HIV viral control among people with HIV who drink heavily. In total, 600 heavy&#xD;
      drinkers with HIV will be assigned to either (a) a single session of brief counseling on&#xD;
      alcohol use or (b) brief counseling plus referral to a telehealth counseling program that&#xD;
      includes multiple sessions of counseling by videoconferencing and text messaging support. To&#xD;
      understand the effects of the program, participants' alcohol use, HIV outcomes, and health&#xD;
      will be assessed over a 2-year period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to test the real-world effectiveness of the ReACH&#xD;
      (Reducing Alcohol use and related Comorbidities in HIV care) telehealth counseling protocol&#xD;
      in a pragmatic Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation randomized trial. The study will&#xD;
      recruit 600 heavy-drinking PLWH from four federally-qualified health centers in&#xD;
      geographically distinct regions across the U.S, which provide services to over 14,000 PLWH.&#xD;
      Upon completing enrollment, participants will be randomized to receive either single-session&#xD;
      brief intervention (BI) by phone with referral to local treatment when appropriate or BI plus&#xD;
      referral to ReACH telehealth counseling (TC). Participants will complete follow-ups through&#xD;
      24 months after baseline to assess longer-term changes in drinking and health outcomes. The&#xD;
      study will test the hypothesis that TC compared to BI will result in (a) reduced number of&#xD;
      drinks consumed per week and frequency of heavy drinking and (b) increased odds of having an&#xD;
      undetectable viral load at 12- and 24-month follow-ups. Secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      self-reported ART adherence, engagement in condomless sex with non-exclusive partners,&#xD;
      frequency of other substance use, phosphatidylethanol levels (a biomarker of recent alcohol&#xD;
      use), and Veterans Aging Cohort Study index scores. The study also will examine potential&#xD;
      moderators of TC effectiveness. As a secondary aim, implementation measures corresponding to&#xD;
      aspects of the Dynamic Sustainability Framework will be assessed including implementation&#xD;
      outcomes of acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility guided by Proctor's&#xD;
      Implementation Outcomes Framework. Thus, this pragmatic Hybrid Type 1 trial will help&#xD;
      establish the real-world effectiveness of the ReACH TC intervention while also providing key&#xD;
      implementation-related measures and outcomes that will inform future ReACH TC scale up and&#xD;
      sustainability.&#xD;
