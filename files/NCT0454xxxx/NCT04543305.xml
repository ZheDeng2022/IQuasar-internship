  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 dose-escalation study of PRT1419, a myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1)&#xD;
      inhibitor, in patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to define the dosing schedule, maximally tolerated dose and/or estimate the optimal&#xD;
      biological dose to be used in subsequent development of PRT1419.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation Phase 1 study of PRT1419, a MCL1&#xD;
      inhibitor, evaluating patients in two cohorts as part of a 28-day treatment cycle in adult&#xD;
      patients with multiple myeloma (MM), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      (AML), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or&#xD;
      MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) overlap syndrome. Cohort A will evaluate PRT1419&#xD;
      administered as monotherapy in patients with either AML, CMML and/or high-risk MDS or MDS/MPN&#xD;
      overlap. Cohort B will evaluate PRT1419 administered as monotherapy in patients with NHL or&#xD;
      MM. The study will employ a &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation design. The dose may be escalated until a&#xD;
      dose limiting toxicity is identified.&#xD;
