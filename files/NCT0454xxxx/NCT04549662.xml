    <textblock>
      This is a 1:1:1 randomized controlled blinded superiority trial to evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      perioperative immunosupplementation on immune function following resection of pancreatic or&#xD;
      periampullary adenocarcinoma. Two variations of immunosupplementation will be compared to&#xD;
      control nutritional supplement containing whey protein with an additional teaspoon (tsp) of&#xD;
      placebo oil. These variations will be 1) a powdered formula containing whey protein and&#xD;
      arginine (Active A) with an additional tsp of lipid bolus containing omega-3 fatty acids, and&#xD;
      2) a powdered formula containing whey protein and arginine (Active A) with an additional tsp&#xD;
      of placebo oil which does not contain omega-3 fatty acids. The control nutritional supplement&#xD;
      will be a powdered formula containing whey protein with an additional tsp of placebo oil.&#xD;
