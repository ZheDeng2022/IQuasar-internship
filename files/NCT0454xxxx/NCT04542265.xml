  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to investigate health effects of oats and oat derived components, in&#xD;
      human intervention studies, with the purpose to build new knowledge for development of&#xD;
      cardiometabolic protective foods&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal is to increase the knowledge which can be used for the development of food&#xD;
      products with anti-diabetic properties, with the purpose to facilitate healthier food choices&#xD;
      for people. More specifically the primary purpose of this project is to evaluate effects in&#xD;
      healthy humans on cardiometabolic test markers of oat and oat based product. The new&#xD;
      knowledge will form a base for the development of oat based food products with added health&#xD;
      values.&#xD;
