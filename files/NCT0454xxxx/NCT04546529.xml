  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Pain is the frequent&#xD;
      non-motor symptom that significantly compromises the quality of life, affecting 80% of&#xD;
      patients during the course of the disease. There is currently no evidence-based treatment for&#xD;
      PD-related pain in general. Nociceptive pain is the most frequent pain in PD an is frequently&#xD;
      musculoskeletal in nature. Epidural spinal cord stimulation is known to provide analgesic&#xD;
      effects in several types of pain syndromes. Here we test analgesic effects of a non-invasive&#xD;
      trans-spinal magnetic stimulation as an add-on treatment for nociceptive (musculoskeletal)&#xD;
      pain directly related to Parkinson disease.&#xD;

      Background: pain is frequent non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD) that significantly&#xD;
      compromises the quality of life, affecting 80% of patients during the course of the disease.&#xD;
      Nociceptive pain is the most frequent subtype, mainly musculoskeletal in nature. There is&#xD;
      currently no evidence-based treatment for PD-related pain in general. The present study tests&#xD;
      the effectiveness and safety of non-invasive trans-spinal magnetic stimulation (TsMS) to&#xD;
      treat musculoskeletal pain directly related to PD in a sham-controlled randomized approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods: this is a randomized, sham-controlled trial including 40 subjects, aged&#xD;
      between 18 and 85 years, with musculoskeletal pain directly related to PD, that will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive TsMS active or TsMS sham in a 1:1 ratio. Enrollment will take place at&#xD;
      the Pain Center of the University of São Paulo and Movement Disorders Center of the&#xD;
      University of São Paulo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have decided to perform an interim analysis when 24 patients will be included in the trial&#xD;
      in order to assess safety and calculate effect size of the active intervention, after meeting&#xD;
      with the research and statistical board. A decision will thereafter be made to, either: 1:&#xD;
      halt the study due to futility, 2: continue the study with a new target sample size based on&#xD;
      the calculations made with the effect from the n= 24 sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: the study hypothesis is that non-invasive trans-spinal magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      is superior to sham and it is safe to use that device in patients with nociceptive&#xD;
      (musculoskeletal) pain in PD.&#xD;
