    <textblock>
      The study is investigating if following the low glutamate diet for 1 month, as compared to&#xD;
      care as usual, can improve seizure frequency, severity, and duration; cognitive functioning;&#xD;
      and/or quality of life in children with epilepsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is estimated to effect 470,000 children within the U.S. About a third of epilepsy&#xD;
      patients are refractory. For these patients, dietary therapy is an alternative option.&#xD;
      However, current dietary therapies present issues with compliance, palatability, adverse&#xD;
      events, and providing necessary nutrients for brain growth and development during childhood.&#xD;
      A dietary option that can improve tolerability, increase compliance, and reduce or eliminate&#xD;
      adverse effects, while also optimizing nutrient intake, is critical for the advancement of&#xD;
      dietary therapy options in epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glutamate is found in the diet as a flavor enhancer; and is also an important&#xD;
      neurotransmitter in the body which mediates seizure activity. Dietary sources of free&#xD;
      glutamate are common and include numerous food additives (including many hidden sources) and&#xD;
      some items which naturally contain higher amounts of glutamate. The low glutamate diet&#xD;
      reduces the consumption of free glutamate, while optimizing dietary micronutrient and&#xD;
      antioxidant intake, which can protect against the negative effects caused by high glutamate&#xD;
      concentrations in the brain. Additionally, the low glutamate diet is balanced, nutritious and&#xD;
      palatable, with no side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is investigating if following the low glutamate diet for 1 month can improve&#xD;
      seizure frequency, severity, and duration; cognitive functioning; and/or quality of life, in&#xD;
      children with epilepsy. Participation in the study will be done virtually and over a 2- or 3-&#xD;
      month study period, depending on group randomization. All participants will have the&#xD;
      opportunity to undergo dietary training and follow the diet.&#xD;

    <description>Parents will be asked to complete the Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy Questionnaire (QOLCE-55). This 55-question quality of life questionnaire has been validated for children ages 4 and older and is used to assess the participant's cognitive, emotional, social, and physical functioning.</description>

    <measure>The effect of a 1-month low-glutamate diet on cognitive functioning in children with epilepsy.</measure>

    <description>Cognitive function will be assessed via CNSVS, a computerized neurocognitive testing software.</description>

    <measure>Examine change in resting state brain waves after 1-month on the low glutamate diet</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1 month post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Electroencephalography (EEG) will be offered to all participants. Four minutes of eyes-closed and eyes-open resting state EEG data will be recorded at the end of the baseline, wait-listed control, and active intervention periods in a sound-attenuated, air-conditioned room. Participants will sit in a comfortable chair in front of a computer monitor. For eyes-closed recordings, participants will be instructed to sit as still as possible, while staying relaxed but awake. For eyes-open recordings, participants will be instructed to sit as still as possible and to focus on a fixation point on the screen while keeping blinking to a minimum, if possible. Participants will be monitored to make sure they are complying with condition instructions. Mean power (total power of frequency band/width of frequency band) and relative power (absolute power of frequency band/total power or percent) will be calculated for delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma, high gamma, and total power.</description>
