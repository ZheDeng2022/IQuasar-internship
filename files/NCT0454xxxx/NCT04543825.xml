  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT) have a high risk for cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (CVD). Frailty is a frequent condition among LT candidates. Together, CVD and frailty are&#xD;
      major causes of morbidity and mortality before and after LT. Conventional methods to diagnose&#xD;
      and predict CVD in LT candidates lack sensitivity and clinically relevant application.&#xD;
      However, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) can directly estimate coronary artery&#xD;
      disease, cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, and indirectly assess frailty. Such versatility of CPET&#xD;
      has caused it to become the standard of care in many LT centers outside of the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preliminary work that will be used to fund a more definitive study (RO1), the&#xD;
      investigators plan to investigate CVD and frailty in LT candidates, both from existing&#xD;
      standard of care (SOC) methods and CPET. The investigators expect results to improve the&#xD;
      current capacity to assess and prognosticate CVD and frailty in LT, ultimately changing&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

      proposal will pursue the following Specific Aims (SA):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Prospectively determine agreement between cardiopulmonary exercise testing and cardiac&#xD;
      stress testing (SOC), for the identification of subclinical coronary artery disease in liver&#xD;
      transplant candidates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Prospectively determine agreement between cardiopulmonary exercise testing and&#xD;
      dobutamine stress echocardiogram (SOC), for the identification of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy in&#xD;
      liver transplant candidates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Prospectively determine agreement between peak oxygen consumption from cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      exercise testing and the liver frailty index or the six-minute walk test (SOC), for the&#xD;
      identification of frailty in liver transplant candidates.&#xD;
