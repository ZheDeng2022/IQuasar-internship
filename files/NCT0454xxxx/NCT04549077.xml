    <textblock>
      In this project, the investigators seek to understand the role of endothelial cells in Cystic&#xD;
      Fibrosis (CF) lung disease. This objective will be achieved by conducting a cross sectional&#xD;
      clinical study to define the morphology of the pulmonary circulation across a range of lung&#xD;
      function coupled with a mechanistic study of the effect of dysfunctional cystic fibrosis&#xD;
      transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in endothelial cells on vasculogenesis, epithelial&#xD;
      morphogenesis and epithelial CFTR function. Toward that end, the investigators propose the&#xD;
      following hypotheses; (a). Loss of pulmonary small blood vessels begins early in the CF lung&#xD;
      and worsens with disease progression, (b).VEGFR2-CFTR interactions happen at the plasma&#xD;
      membrane of endothelial cells and is likely to be involved in transendothelial ion transport&#xD;
      (c) impaired VEGFR2-CFTR interactions on the endothelial cells will have a profound effect on&#xD;
      vasculogenesis, epithelial morphogenesis and ion transport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first hypotheses will be tested through this clinical study. The following 2 hypotheses&#xD;
      will be tested through laboratory studies that do not involve human subjects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary disease in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is characterized by progressive loss of functional&#xD;
      gas exchange units that eventually results in respiratory failure. In CF lung disease,&#xD;
      remodeling of pulmonary blood vessels, and vascular growth of bronchial blood vessels leading&#xD;
      to systemic vascularization of the lung are the principal characteristics of pulmonary&#xD;
      vascular disease. Studies have demonstrated that abnormal perfusion is present in up to 85%&#xD;
      of 1 year old CF infants and only 17% of the perfusion deficits could be explained by mucus&#xD;
      plugging or bronchial wall abnormalities at this age. Based on the investigators' state of&#xD;
      the art method to reconstruct the pulmonary vasculature from non-contrast high resolution CT&#xD;
      scan of the lungs, the investigators demonstrated that the blood volume in small vessels&#xD;
      begins to decline when lung function is still in the normal range and worsens with increase&#xD;
      disease severity. Furthermore, the investigators have also demonstrated that systemic&#xD;
      vascularization of the lungs by the bronchial circulation begins at a FEV1% of 100.&#xD;
      Preclinical studies of pulmonary endothelium revealed that delivering vascular endothelial&#xD;
      growth factor receptor (VEGFR) antagonist to rats leads to air space enlargement and pruning&#xD;
      of the pulmonary arterial tree. Thus, there is a central unanswered question as to whether&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular disease (vascular remodeling and systemic vascularization) are just a&#xD;
      squeal of parenchymal destruction or whether they contribute to the loss of alveolar gas&#xD;
      exchange units and decline in lung function. In this proposal, the investigators will&#xD;
      accomplish the following aims: 1) describe the morphology of the pulmonary vasculature across&#xD;
      a wide range of lung function and relate the findings to functional outcomes, 2) examine&#xD;
      mechanism of early loss of small blood vessels in CF patients as it relates to endothelial&#xD;
      CFTR dysfunction. In addition, the investigators will study the changes in the pulmonary&#xD;
      circulation after the initiation of triple combination therapy Trikafta (elexacaftor,&#xD;
      ivacaftor, and tezacaftor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a case control study of 93 cystic fibrosis patients and 100 age and gender matched&#xD;
      controls. CF patients (cases) will be recruited from two cystic fibrosis centers, Cincinnati&#xD;
      Children's Hospital and Riley Children's Hospital. Controls will be subjects from the&#xD;
      oncology service without lung disease who had CT scan of the chest to rule out pulmonary&#xD;
      metastasis. 31 subjects of the 93 subjects enrolled will receive a second evaluation 6 months&#xD;
      after starting a clinically prescribed corrector / modulator of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane&#xD;
      Conductance Protein Regulator (Trikafta) that was approved by the FDA in October, 2019 for&#xD;
      patients with CF ages 12 and up. If FDA approval for use of Trikafta for ages 6-11 years of&#xD;
      age is obtained, this patient age range will also be eligible for the second evaluation at 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
