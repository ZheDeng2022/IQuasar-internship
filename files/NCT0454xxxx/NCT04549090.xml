  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The challenge to achieve adequate analgesia has led to the development of directed,&#xD;
      multi-modal protocols specific to management of post-laparoscopy pain in effort to decrease&#xD;
      the amount of additional administration of narcotic medication. While several non-opioid&#xD;
      regiments have been found to be effective, opioid medications still play a significant role&#xD;
      in early postoperative analgesia. Given the adverse side effects of narcotic medications,&#xD;
      regional blocks utilizing local anesthetic agents and has been shown to improve overall pain&#xD;
      control in this time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Truncal abdominal nerve blocks are useful for pain control in abdominal and pelvic surgeries.&#xD;
      More recently, the utilization of the quadratus lumborum (QL) block has effectively&#xD;
      alleviated somatic and visceral pain in the upper and lower abdomen. The QL block provides&#xD;
      analgesia spanning from the T4 to L1 dermatomal levels in the thoracolumbar plane to provide&#xD;
      a broad sensory level analgesic effect. The approach involves injecting local anesthetic&#xD;
      under ultrasound guidance into the plane posterior to the quadratus lumborum muscle and&#xD;
      middle layer of thoracolumbar fascia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the utility of the QL block in controlling somatic pain, this study aims to determine&#xD;
      whether the QL block is an effective analgesic adjunct in the control of postoperative pain&#xD;
      period, specifically with regards to patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Prospective Cohort observational study. All patients that meet criteria for participation in&#xD;
      this study will be screened: patients scheduled to undergo a laparoscopic hysterectomy for&#xD;
      benign conditions by attending physicians in the division of Minimally Invasive Gynecologic&#xD;
      Surgery. Based on surgeon's preference, and patient's consent, the patient is offered a QL&#xD;
      block or not. Our aim is to follow the patient's pain scores post op and amount of oral pain&#xD;
      medication used whether they received QL block or not. If the patient received the QL block&#xD;
      then they will be considered part of the study arm. If the patient did not receive the QL&#xD;
      block then they will be considered part of the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The QL block is best thought of as a volume or compartment block in that volumetric spread of&#xD;
      LA along the fascial plane is associated with efficacy in blocking the thoracolumbar nerves&#xD;
      between T7-L1. It can be reasonably assumed that this compartment is the same across patients&#xD;
      and is not affected by the amount of subcutaneous or central fat present in the obese&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a block is to be performed, the QL block will be performed using a 21G x 100mm Stimuplex&#xD;
      needle under ultrasound guidance using a curvilinear probe. Subjects will be positioned in&#xD;
      the semi-lateral position to facilitate access into the plane posterior to the quadratus&#xD;
      lumborum muscle and middle layer of thoracolumbar fascia. The QL block will be administered&#xD;
      via an in-plane approach and local anesthetic will be injected between the quadratus lumborum&#xD;
      muscle and the middle layer of the thoracolumbar. The QL block will be in the operating room&#xD;
      after induction prior to starting the scheduled surgical procedure. If the block is&#xD;
      performed, it will include 20ml of 0.25% bupivacaine and 5ml of liposomal bupivacaine&#xD;
      (Exparel) per side. The block will be done bilaterally therefore a total of 40ml of 0.25%&#xD;
      bupivacaine and 10ml of liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel) will be administered.&#xD;
