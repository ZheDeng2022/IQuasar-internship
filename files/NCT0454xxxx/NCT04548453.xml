    <textblock>
      Patients receiving oxytocin for induction or augmentation of labor will be studied with&#xD;
      uterine EMG. The results of the EMG will be converted to an oxytocin-associated uterine&#xD;
      stimulation index (uSI), which is intended to guide decisions for changing the dose of&#xD;
      oxytocin. An expert panel will review the results of the oxytocin dosing actions, then&#xD;
      assigned optimized actions throughout the labor. The uSI will be correlated with the optimal&#xD;
      dosing actions.&#xD;

      Background. Oxytocin stimulates the uterus, increases the strength and frequency of uterine&#xD;
      contractions and facilitates delivery. The &quot;dose&quot; of oxytocin is the rate of IV infusion. In&#xD;
      a typical labor where oxytocin is used, many dosing adjustments are performed over many&#xD;
      hours. Finding the correct dose for a given patient is challenging because some women respond&#xD;
      rapidly to low doses of oxytocin, others require high doses. The correct dose is important&#xD;
      because the risks of adverse outcomes increase when doses are either too low or excessive.&#xD;
      The dosing actions increase, hold, decrease or stop are typically performed every 30 minutes&#xD;
      during oxytocin administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing actions are performed based on the current level of simulation caused by the current&#xD;
      dose. To assess the level of stimulation, current methods rely heavily on the output of the&#xD;
      fetal monitor, which produces contraction frequency and fetal heart rate. Additional&#xD;
      information for dosing decisions is obtained from subjective assessments such uterine&#xD;
      palpation. Subjective measures are used because there is no objective method available to&#xD;
      reliably guide a dosing action. Subjectivity is a major contributor to the long duration of&#xD;
      labor for inductions and the high rate of excessive uterine stimulation with any oxytocin&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The uterine stimulation index (uSI) is an objective measure of the current level of&#xD;
      stimulation caused by the current dose of oxytocin in individual patients and can be used to&#xD;
      guide oxytocin dosing actions. uSI is based on an electromyography (EMG) signal that is&#xD;
      proportional to the effects of oxytocin on the uterine muscle. uSI is calculated from&#xD;
      multichannel EMG to obtain a representative sampling of the effects of oxytocin on entire&#xD;
      uterus. The range of values for uSI is from 0 (no oxytocin effects) to 10 (maximal oxytocin&#xD;
      effects). Low values of uSI guide the end-user to increase the current dose of oxytocin.&#xD;
      Intermediate values of uSI guide the end-user to hold the current dose. High values of uSI&#xD;
      guide the end-user to decrease the current dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to establish the ranges of uSI values that correspond to the&#xD;
      dosing actions increase, hold and decrease. To establish these ranges, 51 subjects will&#xD;
      undergo current methods of dosing while having multichannel EMG recorded. uSI values will not&#xD;
      be available to end-users, so all subjects will receive dosing actions determined by standard&#xD;
      of care using current method. After delivery, a panel of experts will retrospectively assess&#xD;
      each dosing action based on the outcome of the dosing action. These &quot;optimized dosing&#xD;
      actions&quot; will then be correlated with the uSI value obtained at that time. This process&#xD;
      produces paired data of optimized actions and uSI values. From the clustering of the uSI&#xD;
      values, the ranges of uSI can be matched to the dosing actions increase, hold and decrease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a second goal, human factors will be studied with questionnaires and end-user interviews&#xD;
      to improve the methods used for recording multichannel EMG during labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure. Patients receiving oxytocin for clinical indications will be approached for&#xD;
      participation. After obtaining consent, up to 8 proprietary EMG sensors will be placed over&#xD;
      the subject's abdomen, spanning most of the surface of the uterus. Additionally, one ground&#xD;
      sensor and one noise rejection sensor will be placed. Multichannel EMG recordings will be&#xD;
      obtained throughout the labor, although the results of the EMG will not be available to the&#xD;
      obstetrical providers. Subjects will be managed using current methods of monitoring and&#xD;
      standard of care for oxytocin dosing decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the recording, the EMG sensors will be removed from the subject. Data&#xD;
      will be analyzed after delivery, producing uSI values as a function of time for the duration&#xD;
      of the labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An expert panel will be assembled, composed of clinicians trained in the art of obstetrics&#xD;
      and managing oxytocin. The progress of labor will be assessed by examining the fetal monitor&#xD;
      strip (i.e. uterine contractile activity and the fetal heart rate over time), cervical&#xD;
      changes, and the dosing actions performed. No less than 72 hours after delivery the neonate's&#xD;
      and subject's medical records will be reviewed to identify complications of the delivery that&#xD;
      may have occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expert panel will assess each dosing action as optimal or not optimal. An example of a&#xD;
      not optimal action would be increasing the dose and causing uterine tachysytole. In this&#xD;
      example, &quot;hold&quot; will be assigned as the optimized dosing action. Each subject will have a&#xD;
      list of optimized dosing actions and the time they were performed. Optimized dosing actions&#xD;
      will then be linked with uSI values observed at that time, creating a paired data set of uSI&#xD;
      values and optimal dosing actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimized dosing actions increase, hold and decrease will be correlated with uSI values&#xD;
      and the range of uSI values that correspond with each dosing action will be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-users will be interviewed 1 to 72 hours after delivery of the baby. The interview will&#xD;
      identify barriers to EMG recording may influence the effectiveness of the information&#xD;
      provided by the multichannel EMG recording.&#xD;
