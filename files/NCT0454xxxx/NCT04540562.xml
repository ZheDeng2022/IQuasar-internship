  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the effects of a mobile self-management app in&#xD;
      clinical practice for recently discharged COPD patients on application use, self-management,&#xD;
      anxiety and depression, expectations and experiences, patients' and health care&#xD;
      professionals' satisfaction and hospital readmissions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Usability testing techniques were used to receive feedback on a prototype of the app, before&#xD;
      starting the feasibility study. Patients were recruited from a large teaching hospital. The&#xD;
      COPD app provided patients with an 8 week self-management program. The application had three&#xD;
      views: timeline, information page, and contact page. The start date was each patients' date&#xD;
      of discharge. The timeline was classified in 8 weeks, and each week included the lung&#xD;
      exacerbation plan, daily and extra medication, information and education and questionnaires.&#xD;
      The first week also included a video of a pulmonologist explaining the purpose of the app and&#xD;
      additional information about the functionalities of the COPD app. The timeline consisted of&#xD;
      the lung exacerbation action plan, medication overview, weekly questionnaires and monitoring,&#xD;
      and consultations (video consultation after 4 weeks and face-to-face consultation after 8&#xD;
      weeks).&#xD;

    <description>Questionnaires were used to assess satisfaction, information and user-friendliness of the app. The items were rated on a 7 point scale, varying from 1 (totally disagree) to 7 (totally agree). Overall satisfaction was rated on a scale from 1 (very unsatisfied) to 10 (very satisfied). Multiple response questions were used to assess if patients missed information in the app. Suggestions for improvement were asked using an open question. Yes/no questions were used to assess satisfaction with video consultation(s) (additional requested video consultations, problems and time saving).</description>
