  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective for this non-interventional study is to assess the quality of life of&#xD;
      melanoma patients under adjuvant treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib in real world&#xD;
      setting in Portugal through disease specific FACT-M questionnaire and generic EQ-5D-3L&#xD;
      questionnaire.The secondary study objectives are to assess the usage of adjuvant dabrafenib&#xD;
      and trametinib in clinical practice and to evaluate clinical outcomes in patients that start&#xD;
      adjuvant treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib. In addition, this study aims to explore if&#xD;
      treatment discontinuation affects clinical outcomes in real-world practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prospective registration of completely resected high-risk stage III melanoma patients&#xD;
      treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in the adjuvant setting will be based on collaboration&#xD;
      with 8 centers of excellence on melanoma patients treatment, according to their expertise and&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from participating centers in the routine setting. This will be&#xD;
      done only if the decision about starting treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib has already&#xD;
      been made. All patients that comply with the inclusion criteria and that start treatment with&#xD;
      dabrafenib+ trametinib during the recruitment period will be considered to participate in the&#xD;
      study, at investigator discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health related quality of life will be assessed by FACT-M and EQ-5D-3L questionnaire after&#xD;
      treatment initiation in a quarterly base, according to clinical practice, including the first&#xD;
      visit after treatment completion.&#xD;

FACT-M is a specific version of FACT questionnaire validated for patients with any stage of melanoma and includes items related to physical, functional, social and emotional well-being, and specific concerns of melanoma patients and melanoma patients undergoing surgery. The FACT-M Total Score (FACT-M TS) ranges from 0 to 172. Higher scores represent a better quality of life.</description>

    <description>Health-related quality of life in melanoma patients defined as the mean difference in EQ-5D-3L score.&#xD;
EQ-5D-3L is a descriptive questionnaire comprising five dimensions regarding mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has three response levels of severity: no problems, some problems, extreme problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by checking the box next to the most appropriate response level of each of the five dimensions.</description>
