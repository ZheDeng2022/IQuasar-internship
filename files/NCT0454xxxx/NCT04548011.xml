      The objective of this trial is to assess acupuncture of different treatment frequency on&#xD;
      improving quality of life in patients with functional dyspepsia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effect of treatment frequency of acupuncture on the functional dyspepsia is unclear. In&#xD;
      this study, 60 participants with FD will be recruited and randomly allocated (using a 1:1:1&#xD;
      allocation ratio) into three times a week group, once a week group and waiting for treatment&#xD;
      group. Participants will receive acupuncture treatment at bilateral Zhongwan（CV12）,&#xD;
      Tianshu（ST25）, Neiguan（PC6）, Liangqiu（ST34）, Yanglinquan（GB34）, Zusanli（ST36）and&#xD;
      Taichong（LR3) of different treatment frequency for 4 weeks. This trial is designed to analyze&#xD;
      the acupuncture of different treatment frequency on improving quality of life in patients&#xD;
      with FD and to provide evidence for the establishment of acupuncture treatment quantization&#xD;
      standard of FD.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome is the score change in Nepean Dyspepsia Life Quality Index （NDLQI）compared with baseline at week 4. The NDLQI is a scale of 25 items about the quality of the patients' life with a ranging score of 1-4 of each item. The higher scores indicates a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>The total score change in Symptom Index of Dyspepsia （SID） compared with baseline at weeks 4, 8 and 12. SID is a four-rate scale with a ranging score of 0-4 of each dyspepsia symptoms (postprandial distension; early satiety; epigastric pain; and epigastric burning). The higher scores indicates a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>The acupuncture treatment strategies in this study are based on traditional Chinese medicine theory and opinions from the acupuncture experts. The acupoints are bilateral Zhongwan（CV12）, Tianshu（ST25）, Neiguan（PC6）, Liangqiu（ST34）, Yanglinquan（GB34）, Zusanli（ST36）and Taichong（LR3）.All the acupoints will be localized according to the Nomenclature and Location of Acupuncture Points of the People's Republic of China. During the acupuncture treatment, the participants will be in supine position. After 75% alcohol pads sterilizing the skin around the acupoints routinely, the acupuncturists will use sterile disposable steel needles (0.3 mm×40 mm; Huatuo Brand, Suzhou Medical Appliance, China) to insert into the acupoints above. The acupoints will be inserted vertically at 13-40 mm with the manipulation of steady small lifting, thrusting, and twirling 3 times to induce a sensation of de qi (sourness, numbness, and heaviness).</description>
