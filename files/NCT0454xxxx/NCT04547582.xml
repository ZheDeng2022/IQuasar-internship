  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this study are to provide sensory information to amputees and reduce phantom&#xD;
      limb pain via electrical stimulation of the lumbar spinal cord and spinal nerves. The spinal&#xD;
      nerves convey sensory information from peripheral nerves to higher order centers in the&#xD;
      brain. These structures still remain intact after amputation and electrical stimulation of&#xD;
      the dorsal spinal nerves in individuals with intact limbs and amputees has been demonstrated&#xD;
      to generate paresthetic sensory percepts referred to portions of the distal limb. Further,&#xD;
      there is recent evidence that careful modulation of stimulation parameters can convert&#xD;
      paresthetic sensations to more naturalistic ones when stimulating peripheral nerves in&#xD;
      amputees. However, it is currently unclear whether it is possible to achieve this same&#xD;
      conversion when stimulating the spinal nerves, and if those naturalistic sensations can have&#xD;
      positive effects on phantom limb pain. As a first step towards those goals, in this study,&#xD;
      the investigators will quantify the sensations generated by electrical stimulation of the&#xD;
      spinal nerves, study the relationship between stimulation parameters and the quality of those&#xD;
      sensations, measure changes in control of a prosthesis with sensory stimulation, and quantify&#xD;
      the effects of that stimulation on the perception of the phantom limb and any associated&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;

      During the study, FDA-cleared spinal cord stimulator leads will be placed in the lumbar&#xD;
      epidural space of lower limb amputees and steered laterally towards the dorsal spinal roots&#xD;
      under fluoroscopic guidance. This approach is essentially identical to the FDA-cleared&#xD;
      procedure in which these devices are placed in the lumbar epidural space for treatment of&#xD;
      intractable low back and leg pain. In that procedure, it is common clinical practice to place&#xD;
      2-3 leads temporarily in the epidural space through a percutaneous approach and perform a&#xD;
      multiday trial to determine if the patient experiences any pain reduction from spinal cord&#xD;
      stimulation. Following the trial, the percutaneous leads are surgically removed, and the&#xD;
      patient is referred to a neurosurgeon for permanent surgical implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, in this study, the device will be tunneled percutaneously through the skin and&#xD;
      anchored in place. Using the stylet included with the spinal cord stimulator leads, the&#xD;
      devices will be steered laterally under fluoroscopic guidance to target the dorsal spinal&#xD;
      nerves. During lab experiments, the leads will be connected to an external stimulator. In&#xD;
      this study, the devices will remain in the epidural space for up to 90 days and will be&#xD;
      surgically removed. Throughout the study, the investigators will perform a series of&#xD;
      psychophysical evaluations to characterize the sensory percepts evoked by epidural&#xD;
      stimulation, along with functional evaluations of the effects of stimulation on the ability&#xD;
      to control a prosthetic limb. In addition, the investigators will perform surveys to&#xD;
      characterize changes in phantom limb sensation and pain that occur during stimulation.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in phantom limb pain using the McGill Pain Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The McGill Pain Questionnaire is a questionnaire used to evaluate the severity of pain experienced by the participant. The questionnaire is scaled, with a minimum and maximum pain score of 0 and 78, respectively. The higher the score on the questionnaire, the more intense the pain felt by the participant. A lower score would therefore represent a decrease in experienced phantom limb pain.&#xD;
Before placement of the spinal cord stimulator leads, investigators will document the subject's description of their history of perceived phantom limb. Investigators will ask them to periodically update their perception of the limb throughout experimental sessions, as well as within a month after the device has been removed.</description>

Using either a virtual prosthetic limb or an instrumented prosthesis, stimulation of the spinal roots will be modulated based on signals recorded from the limb.</description>

&#xD;
          1. Subjects must have an amputation of one lower limb, at a level between the ankle and&#xD;
             knee joints. Minor amputation of the contralateral limb (i.e. toes or partial foot) is&#xD;
             not exclusionary.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Subjects must be between the ages of 22 and 70 years old. Participants outside this&#xD;
             age range may be at an increased medical risk and have an increased risk of fatigue&#xD;
             during testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Subjects must not have an allergy to contrast medium or renal failure that could be&#xD;
             exacerbated by the contrast agent used in MRIs. For this study, renal insufficiency&#xD;
             will be determined through blood work and defined as BUN of 30 or less and Creatinine&#xD;
             of 1.5 or less.&#xD;

             (BSI-18) who have undergone discussions with and been deemed unsuitable by the&#xD;
             Principal Investigator, a study physician, and a psychologist&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects may not have a cardiac pacemaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects may not have a cardioverter defibrillator.&#xD;
