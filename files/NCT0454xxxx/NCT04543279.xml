  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fostamatinib may improve thrombocytopenia in myelofibrosis patients with severe&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia (platelet &lt;50,000/microL) and allow them to initiate treatment with a JAK2&#xD;
      inhibitor, ruxolitinib. Additionally, fostamatinib monotherapy may also improve myelofibrosis&#xD;
      related symptoms and splenomegaly.&#xD;

After the first cycle, if no major dose related safety issue is observed and the platelet count is less than 50K/microL, then the fostamatinib dose will be increased to 150 mg BID for the next 2 cycles; otherwise the dose may be continued at 100 mg BID.</description>

Patients who do not reach platelet count of at least 50K/microL but who achieve clinical benefit per the treating provider may continue on single agent fostamatinib for up to 12 total treatment cycles. If these patients achieve a sustained platelet count of ≥ 50K/microL at any point prior to Cycle 10 Day 1, then they may be eligible to enroll in Part B of the study and continue treatment with fostamatinib and ruxolitinib for the remainder of the study.</description>

             disease, or chronic diarrhea that is not well controlled and could interfere with&#xD;
             absorption of oral medication or be exacerbated by study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hepatic cirrhosis or severe pre-existing hepatic impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled coagulopathy or bleeding disorder.&#xD;
