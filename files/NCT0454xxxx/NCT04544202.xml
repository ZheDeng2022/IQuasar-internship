      The purpose of this Treatment Plan is to allow access to trametinib and dabrafenib for&#xD;
      eligible high-risk BRAF mutation-positive patients in the adjuvant treatment of melanoma&#xD;
      after surgical resection. The patient's Treating Physician should follow the suggested&#xD;
      treatment guidelines and comply with all local health authority regulations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The requesting Treating Physician submitted a request for access to drug (often referred to&#xD;
      as Compassionate Use) to Novartis which was reviewed and approved by the medical team&#xD;
      experienced with the drug and indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This program will provide access to patients until:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participating countries have received marketing authorization and product is&#xD;
           commercially available and accessible to all participating patient(s) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alternative treatment options are available and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In case of changes in the safety profile or a lack of overall efficacy of the product.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has or is willing to give consent to the Treating Physician in accordance with the&#xD;
             local regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has the following diagnosis: Completely resected (R0) histologically confirmed&#xD;
             high-risk (stage III) cutaneous melanoma with confirmed BRAF V600E/K activating&#xD;
             mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients presenting with initial resectable lymph node recurrence after a diagnosis of&#xD;
             Stage I or II melanoma are eligible. Patients with an unknown primary melanoma are not&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. All clinical trials that the patient might qualify for have been ruled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Is receiving care at a clinical site with a Treating Physician who has experience with&#xD;
             administering investigational agents for patients with this condition, or the patient&#xD;
             is willing and/or able to travel to a site and receive treatment under the guidance of&#xD;
             physician with this experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Is able to retain oral medication and swallow tablets/capsules (appropriate exceptions&#xD;
             allowed for patients who are unable to swallow tablets/capsules - this is subject to&#xD;
             availability of alternative (liquid) oral formulations).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Is not eligible for participation in any of the IMP's ongoing clinical trials or has&#xD;
             recently completed a clinical trial that has been terminated and, after considering&#xD;
             other options (e.g., trial extensions, amendments, etc.), the clinical team has&#xD;
             determined that treatment is necessary and there are no other feasible alternatives&#xD;
             for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 3 (or equivalent)&#xD;
             and is in stable clinical condition. NOTE: patient in rapidly deteriorating clinical&#xD;
             condition prior to start of therapy should not be considered for this program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Does not require treatment with prohibited concomitant medications (please refer to&#xD;
             the IB or approved label/SmPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Women of childbearing potential must have had a negative serum Î²-human chorionic&#xD;
             gonadotropin (HCG) pregnancy test within 7 days prior to starting dabrafenib and&#xD;
             trametinib treatment. Subjects with a positive pregnancy test result must be excluded&#xD;
             from the program. Subjects with a negative pregnancy test result must agree to use an&#xD;
             effective contraception method as described below throughout the treatment period and&#xD;
             for a total of 4 months following the last dose of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Contraceptive Methods for Females of Childbearing Potential:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An intrauterine device with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vasectomized partner who is sterile prior to the female patient's entry into the&#xD;
             Compassionate Use program, and this male is the sole sexual partner for that female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete abstinence from sexual intercourse for 14 days prior to first dose of&#xD;
             treatment, through the dosing period, and for at least 4 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             treatment. Abstinence is only acceptable when in line with the preferred and usual&#xD;
             lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
             symptothermal, post-ovulation methods, etc.) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods&#xD;
             of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Double-barrier contraception: condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault&#xD;
             caps) with vaginal spermicidal agent (foam/gel/cream/suppository).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Hormonal-based methods (e.g., oral contraceptives) are not permitted as contraception&#xD;
        due to potential drug-drug interactions with dabrafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Females Not of Childbearing Potential Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically&#xD;
        incapable of becoming pregnant) is defined as any female who has had a documented&#xD;
        hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy (ovariectomy), bilateral tubal ligation or tubal&#xD;
        occlusion, or is post-menopausal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A practical definition accepts menopause after 1 year without menses with an appropriate&#xD;
        clinical profile; e.g., age appropriate, &gt;45 years in the absence of hormone replacement&#xD;
        therapy (HRT). In questionable cases, the patient must have a follicle stimulating hormone&#xD;
        (FSH) value &gt;40 mIU/mL and an estradiol value &lt;40 pg/mL (&lt;140 pmol/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female patients determined not to be post-menopausal must use adequate contraception, as&#xD;
        defined immediately above for females of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female subjects who are lactating must discontinue nursing prior to the first dose of&#xD;
        program treatment and must refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and for 4&#xD;
        months following the last dose of program treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If a subject becomes pregnant during the treatment period of the program, the treatments&#xD;
        should be stopped immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Written patient informed consent must be obtained by the Treating Physician prior to start&#xD;
        of treatment in accordance with the applicable local regulatory requirements.&#xD;
