    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and effect of crescent doses of capsaicin upon serial transcranial&#xD;
      Doppler (TCD) markers of cerebral blood flow (CBF). Methods We performed serial TCD testing&#xD;
      in 30 healthy volunteers divided into five equal groups. Capsaicin doses ranged from 33 to&#xD;
      165 μMol. We recorded peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities in the middle cerebral&#xD;
      artery (MCA), arterial pressure, and perceived pungency (PP) in five minutes intervals up to&#xD;
      20 minutes. We then calculated the mean velocity (MV), the pulsatility index (PI), and the&#xD;
      CBF index.&#xD;

      Subjects We studied 30 healthy volunteers. Call for volunteer flyers were distributed among&#xD;
      undergraduate students of the local faculty of medicine. Interested individuals made an&#xD;
      appointment to get more information. Those willing to participate signed the informed consent&#xD;
      form (ICF) and received instructions to refrain from eating or drinking at least one h before&#xD;
      the TCD measurements, and not to eat spicy food for one day before testing. The volunteers&#xD;
      were normotensive, not smoking, not taking any medication, and did not have any oral cavity&#xD;
      disorder. We consecutively tested 6 participants for each dose of capsaicin alternating the&#xD;
      stimulated side of the palate. Therefore, half of the participants in each dose group&#xD;
      received stimulation on either left or right side of the palate. Chemical stimuli From an&#xD;
      initial 0.1% capsaicin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) stock solution in 95% ethanol; we&#xD;
      prepared solutions with 33, 66, 99, 132 and 165 μMol/ml by diluting the stock solution with&#xD;
      distilled water. One milliliter of each dilution was pipetted on to 2 cm filter paper&#xD;
      squares. Then, the filter papers were let dry. Immediately before application, they were&#xD;
      rehydrated with 1 milliliter of distilled water. The rehydrated filter paper was applied and&#xD;
      remained stationary on the subject's hemi palate's posterior surface during TCD measurements.&#xD;
      Participants were instructed not to swallow and to avoid touching the paper filter with their&#xD;
      tongue for the 20 minutes of the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TCD testing With a TCD device (Philips Sonos 7500®), we recorded peak systolic velocity (PSV)&#xD;
      and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) through the temporal&#xD;
      window of the stimulated side. First, we obtained a basal recording and an immediate&#xD;
      recording after stimulation, followed by serial recordings every five minutes and up to 20&#xD;
      minutes. At each time point, we also registered: systolic pressure (SP), diastolic pressure&#xD;
      (DP), and perceived pungency (PP) on a visual analog scale. TCD markers of cerebral blood&#xD;
      flow From the initial measurements we calculated: Mean velocity (MV) = EDV + [(PSVEDV) / 3],&#xD;
      pulsatility index (PI) = PSV - EDV / MV, mean arterial pressure (MAP) = ((2 * DP) + SP) / 3&#xD;
      and, the CBF index (CBFi).&#xD;
&#xD;
      , CBFi = (MAP * 10) / 1.47^PI. Statistical analysis Shapiro Wilkins W-Test were performed.&#xD;
      Because the data did not follow a normal distribution, the results of the continuous&#xD;
      variables are described as median and ranges. The categorical variables are described as&#xD;
      tables of absolute and relative frequencies, and the comparisons between the groups of&#xD;
      subjects (according to the dose of capsaicin) were carried out with chi-square tests. To&#xD;
      compare the variables studied between the groups of subjects (according to the different&#xD;
      doses of capsaicin), Mann-Whitney U-Test tests were used. In order to make comparisons of the&#xD;
      baseline state with the changes observed in the study variables over time, various Wilcoxon&#xD;
      signed-rank tests were performed.The relationship between pungency ratings and MV response&#xD;
      was evaluated by Spearman's rho test. The level of statistical significance was set at 0.05.&#xD;
