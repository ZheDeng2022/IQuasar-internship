  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The legitimate need for opioid medications for acute pain management in pediatric trauma&#xD;
      patients is recognized, however, the high dose and duration of opioid drugs prescribed by&#xD;
      medical providers has been associated with an increased risk of opioid abuse and chronic use&#xD;
      by patients. The overarching goal of application is to assess opioid use and outcomes of&#xD;
      pediatric patients treated for either burn injuries or knee arthroscopy procedures at a large&#xD;
      academic pediatric medical center before and after Ohio opioid prescription rules for acute&#xD;
      pain were implemented on August 21, 2017. Also, to evaluate patient use of opioids at 90-days&#xD;
      post-treatment.&#xD;

      This study has a prospective and retrospective component. Phase 1 involves a retrospective&#xD;
      chart review will be performed among pediatric patients undergoing burn care or knee&#xD;
      arthroscopy at our institution to determine a whether there was a reduction in prescribed&#xD;
      opioid medications following the 2017 Ohio opioid prescription law. A 24-month pre-law period&#xD;
      (August 1st, 2015, to August 31st, 2017) and 24-month post-law period (September 1st, 2017,&#xD;
      to August 31st 2019) will be compared. This phase will include 300 patients (n=150 burn,&#xD;
      n=150 knee arthroscopy) evenly divided between the pre-law and post-law periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 involves a prospective patient telephone survey 90 days after burn care or knee&#xD;
      arthroscopy procedure to assess the association of opioid prescribing, consumption and amount&#xD;
      of left-over medications, and pain control status after 90 days. This phase will include 100&#xD;
      patients (n=50 burn, n=50 knee arthroscopy) recruited via convenience sampling.&#xD;
