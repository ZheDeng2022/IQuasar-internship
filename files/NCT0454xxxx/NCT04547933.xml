  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Storage symptoms include frequency, urgency, nocturia and incontinence. Based on bladder&#xD;
      diaries, we could get the objective data of the above symptoms. To the best of our knowledge,&#xD;
      there is lack of correlation of quality of life with lower urinary tract symptoms based on&#xD;
      bladder diaries. Thus, we aimed to perform the study.&#xD;

      The bladder diaries and the King's Health Questionnaires of all consecutive women with lower&#xD;
      urinary tract symptoms who visited urogynecologic clinics in a tertiary referral center, were&#xD;
      reviewed. Based on bladder diaries, women with at least one episode of urgency and urinary&#xD;
      incontinence (UI) were allocated to the overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) -wet group. Women&#xD;
      with at least one episode of urgency but without incontinence were allocated to the OAB-dry&#xD;
      group. Women with at least one episode of UI but without urgency were allocated to the UI&#xD;
      group. Women with more or equal to 2 episodes of nocturia but without urgency and UI were&#xD;
      allocated to the nocturia group. Women with more or equal to 8 episodes of daytime frequency&#xD;
      but without urgency, UI and nocturia were allocated to the frequency group. Otherwise, normal&#xD;
      group. Analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction was used to perform statistical&#xD;
      analysis for between-group comparisons.&#xD;
