  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to elucidate if a novel biomaterial containing gelatin, manuka&#xD;
      honey, and hydroxyapatite enhances secondary intention healing when compared to conventional&#xD;
      secondary intention healing for surgical defects after Mohs micrographic surgery on the head&#xD;
      and distal lower extremities (below the knee). This novel biomaterial has already been FDA&#xD;
      cleared for surgical wounds.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Secondary intention healing (SIH) is often underutilized and has several advantages compared&#xD;
      to primary surgical repair. Wound care is minimal, bleeding and infection are rare, and risks&#xD;
      associated with primary closure (e.g. hematoma, suture granuloma, graft or flap failure) are&#xD;
      non-existent. Importantly, SIH facilitates surveillance of tumor recurrence, whereas flaps&#xD;
      and grafts may bury residual tumor. When used in appropriate anatomical locations, SIH leads&#xD;
      to high patient satisfaction. However, SIH requires regular wound care that can be cumbersome&#xD;
      to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior studies utilizing biologic dressings have shown patients report better quality of life&#xD;
      during the post-operative period related to less pain, decreased dressing changes, and faster&#xD;
      healing times. Biologic dressings provide an alternative to surgical autografts and eliminate&#xD;
      the risks associated with graft harvesting (e.g. pain, infection, and scarring). For many&#xD;
      patients, the cosmetic outcome following healing is important. However, cosmetic outcome with&#xD;
      SIH is variable and depends on many factors, namely location (e.g. concavities favorable),&#xD;
      skin laxity, and underlying musculature. Exuberant granulation tissue, hypopigmented and&#xD;
      telangiectatic scars are the most frequent adverse cosmetic outcomes with SIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novel biomaterial APIS® (SweetBio, Inc. Memphis, TN) is an advanced synthesis of gelatin,&#xD;
      manuka honey, and hydroxyapatite bioengineered to protect wounds, manage exudate, and&#xD;
      maintain a moist environment. It is FDA cleared (FDA number K1827250) for wound management&#xD;
      across 9 indications including surgical wounds. It has been used successfully in a small case&#xD;
      series of 8 patients for post-operative Mohs surgical wounds on the head and distal lower&#xD;
      extremities. Time to complete re-epithelialization was 6 weeks (42 days), suggesting a&#xD;
      reduction in healing time compared to standard SIH times for the leg and head of 127 and 57&#xD;
      days, respectively. Use of this novel biomaterial to enhance SIH is hypothesized to reduce&#xD;
      healing times when compared to standard SIH wound care. This provides a useful option to aid&#xD;
      SIH in sites like the lower legs, where healing can be prolonged due to intrinsic factors&#xD;
      (e.g., cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes) or extrinsic factors&#xD;
      (e.g., increased risk of surgical site infection following dermatologic surgery at sites&#xD;
      below the knee).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, comparative studies evaluating augmented SIH compared to conventional SIH in&#xD;
      dermatologic surgery are limited. This study aims to evaluate whether use of a novel&#xD;
      biomaterial enhances SIH, particularly in shortening time to complete re-epithelialization.&#xD;
      Patients undergoing Mohs micrographic surgery amenable to SIH on the head and distal lower&#xD;
      extremities will be randomized into one of four groups (standard SIH or biomaterial APIS®&#xD;
      enhanced SIH on the head or distal lower extremities). Patients will have regularly scheduled&#xD;
      follow-up with questionnaires at each visit. The investigators aim to evaluate whether use of&#xD;
      this novel biomaterial decreases complete re-epithelialization times, reduces infection&#xD;
      rates, and improves cosmetic outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Complete wound re-epithelialization is defined by epidermal regrowth covering entire post-operative defect. Patients will be seen in office 14 days post-operative, then every 14 days thereafter until complete re-epithelialization is achieved. Patients will also submit photos via Vanderbilt HIPAA compliant Box at regular follow-up intervals (post-operative day 7 then every 14 days thereafter until complete re-epithelialization is achieved). Time elapsed from surgery date to complete re-epithelialization will be noted in days.&#xD;
