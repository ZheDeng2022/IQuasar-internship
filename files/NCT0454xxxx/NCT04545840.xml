    <textblock>
      The Neodent® Zirconia Implant is designed for the treatment of oral endosteal implantation&#xD;
      for the functional and aesthetic rehabilitation, allowing for treatment of patients with&#xD;
      different bone qualities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to assess the success and survival rates of implantable devices&#xD;
      of the Zirconia System, in order to confirm the long-term safety and clinical performance of&#xD;
      implants and abutments of the Zirconia System in daily dental practice setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Devices will be used according to standard routine in daily practice, according to&#xD;
      manufacturer indications in the IFU. Patients will be followed for 36 months after implant&#xD;
      placement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study protocol was reviewed and approved by an Ethics Committee (CE) in Brazil. The&#xD;
      sample will be prospectively and consecutively selected and will consist of patients who are&#xD;
      18 years of age or older, who are in need of and who qualify for single dental implants&#xD;
      placement in the posterior maxilla region with Neodent® Zirconia. Informed consent in writing&#xD;
      will be obtained from each patient participating in the study prior to any study related&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this study will be analyzed descriptively, sample size calculation was not performed. To&#xD;
      generate reliable results, a total number of 30 implants was assumed to be sufficient.&#xD;
      Estimating a rate of 1 implant per patient and a drop-out rate of 15%, a sample size of 36&#xD;
      patients resulting in an estimated number of 36 implants is thought to be sufficient to allow&#xD;
      for a descriptive analysis of clinical outcome data up to 36 months after implant placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment provided to the subjects will be the responsibility of an appropriately qualified&#xD;
      dental practitioner to provide the relevant patient care under clinical study conditions.&#xD;
      Zirconia Implants will be placed under local anesthesia and with adequate bone bed&#xD;
      preparation in posterior maxilla region. More than one implant can be placed in the same&#xD;
      patient, as long as the subject presents natural teeth adjacent to the implant site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after implant placement, the final placement torque will be registered. The&#xD;
      immediate loading will be applied within 48 hours with the insertion of a provisional&#xD;
      prosthesis made from intraoral scanning or scanning of dental casts obtained by conventional&#xD;
      impression. The insertion torque shall reach at least 35 N.cm and the subject must have&#xD;
      physiologic occlusion to immediate loading. If the patient does not reach the minimum torque&#xD;
      (35 N.cm), the patient will be followed until the study end but will not be considered to&#xD;
      final statistic or, a different implant line would be placed and the study termination form&#xD;
      will be filled. The principal investigator will choose how to procedure in this situation.&#xD;
      The selection of the prosthetic component shall be conducted according to the need of each&#xD;
      subject and to the manufacturer's instructions (IFU). The final prosthesis will be placed 2&#xD;
      months after implant loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data concerning the studied variables will be collected following the procedures and&#xD;
      assessments plan by fulfilling the Case Report Form (CRF), in the following stages: screening&#xD;
      (First visit); TP - Implant(s) placement and impression/scanning for temporary prosthesis&#xD;
      preparation; T0 - Implant(s) loading (up to 48h after placement); TF - Final prosthesis&#xD;
      placement (2 months ± 1 week after loading); T6, T12, T24, T36 - 6, 12, 24 e 36 ± 1 month,&#xD;
      respectively, after loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized digital periapical radiographs will be obtained in a usual daily practice&#xD;
      frequency, as determined by the investigator: at pre-operative, to assess the ridge height&#xD;
      and width of the supporting bone and locate major anatomical features; in post-surgery (TP)&#xD;
      and in T0, TF, T6, T12, T24 and T36 to verify prosthesis adaptation and osseointegration.&#xD;
      Computed tomography scans will be obtained from the region of interest prior to surgery, for&#xD;
      the selection of the implant to be inserted.&#xD;
