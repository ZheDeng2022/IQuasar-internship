&#xD;
          -  Participant must be of first to third generation Japanese descent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must be otherwise healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical&#xD;
             history, vital signs, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening and&#xD;
             Day-1. Any abnormalities, must be considered not clinically significant and this&#xD;
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by&#xD;

             performed at screening and Day-1. If the results of the serum chemistry panel&#xD;
             including hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, the&#xD;
             participant may be included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities or&#xD;
             deviations from normal to be not clinically significant or to be appropriate and&#xD;

             participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must have a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kilogram per meter&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Concomitant or Previous Medical Therapies Received: Participant is currently enrolled&#xD;
             in an investigational study or has received an investigational intervention (including&#xD;

             (whichever is longer)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant or Previous Medical Therapies Received: Has received over the counter&#xD;
             medications (including vitamins/multivitamins supplements, corticosteroids,&#xD;
             acetaminophen/paracetamol, aspirin, decongestants, antihistamines and other&#xD;
             non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and herbal medication (including, but not&#xD;
             limited to, herbal tea, St. John's Wort, and cannabidol) within 2 weeks prior to first&#xD;
             study intervention administration unless approved by the investigator and sponsor&#xD;
             medical monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infections or Predisposition to Infections: has an active acute or clinically&#xD;
             significant chronic infection&#xD;
