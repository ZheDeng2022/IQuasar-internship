  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the electrophysiological properties of the heart conduction&#xD;
      system in patients with (increased risk of) ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTA) and sudden&#xD;
      cardiac arrest, and in a control cohort. The electrophysiological properties will be measured&#xD;
      with the relatively new technique ECG-Imaging (ECGI). Moreover, clinical data of subjects&#xD;
      will be gathered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By combining the data from the data gathering and the results of ECGI, the investigators hope&#xD;
      to increase mechanistic understanding of and risk stratification for VTAs. The investigators&#xD;
      aim to be able to identify patients at risk of an arrhythmic event, and aim for better&#xD;
      treatment strategies in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ECGI combines electrical body-surface mapping with 256 electrodes placed on the thorax with a&#xD;
      CT-scan obtaining the anatomy of the heart and torso, hereby able to reconstruct local&#xD;
      electrograms, activation and recovery times. In recent research, ECGI provided numerous extra&#xD;
      insights into normal cardiac electrophysiology, but also electrophysiological disorders and&#xD;
      disease. The results strongly suggest that ECGI can play a pivotal role in further&#xD;
      characterizing arrhythmia mechanisms, therefore could do so for VTAs, leading to diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment improvement. Moreover, ECGI seems to have the potential to detect&#xD;
      arrhythmogenic substrate in individuals before their first event, offering the possibility to&#xD;
      diagnose and treat patients before sudden cardiac arrest occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the BREACH-ECGI study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECGI will be used to noninvasively characterize the epicardial electrophysiological substrate&#xD;
      and triggers of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with (increased risk of) VTAs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A control cohort. Results will be evaluated for increased mechanistic understanding and&#xD;
           risk stratification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, clinical data of subjects will be gathered. These data will be analyzed to&#xD;
      determine their prognostic value in terms of arrhythmia risk&#xD;
