  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim for this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a 16-week realistic&#xD;
      community-delivered Baduanjin training program compared to a waitlist control intervention,&#xD;
      in improving functional outcomes among pre-frail and frail older adults in Singapore. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that participants that receive 16-week of BDJ training will have significant&#xD;
      improvement in physical function (including balance, muscle strength, and endurance);&#xD;
      alleviate exhaustion; reduce risk of falling and fear of falling; potentially reverse&#xD;
      frailty; reduce depression; and improve quality of life, potentially with greater&#xD;
      improvements in area(s) for individuals with lower baseline measures. Whereas, participants&#xD;
      in the waitlist control group, will have insignificant changes to their baseline measures.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Knee Extension Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and after 16-weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Knee extension strength is measured using a digital dynamometer gauge. Prior to performing the test, leg dominant is determined by asking participants which is their dominant leg or which leg they would predominantly use when performing a task. For the assessment, participants will be asked to extend their leg against the spring gauge while seated with the hip and knee joint angles positioned at 90°. Maximal force is recorded in kilograms.</description>

    <measure>Change in Maastricht Vital Exhaustion Score (MQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and after 16-weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Maastricht vital exhaustion score (MQ) is a short questionnaires that requires between 5 to 10 minutes for completion. MQ is a validated tool to assess feelings of &quot;vital exhaustion&quot;, which has three defining characteristics: (1) feeling of excessive fatigue and lack of energy, (2) increased irritability, and (3) feelings of demoralization.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and after 16-weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) is a short, easy to administer tool that measures the fear of falling in older population during social and physical activities inside and outside the home. The level of concern is measured on a four point Likert scale (1=not at all concerned to 4=very concerned). The 16-item FES-I is a well validated and feasible measure to assess fear of falling in older persons, and predicts future risks of falls.</description>

    <measure>Change in Physiological Profile Assessment. (PPA - Short Form)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and after 16-weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA) is a valid and reliable measure of balance function and fall risk, is feasible for older adults to undertake, and can quantify changes in specific physical components contributing to falls in response to BDJ training. PPA comprises a series of five sensorimotor assessments: edge contrast sensitivity, lower limb proprioception, knee extension strength, hand reaction time, and postural sway. These five components will be weighted to compute a composite PPA fall risk score: high composite PPA scores indicate high risk of falling.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hand Grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and after 16-weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Hand-grip dynamometer was found to be a valid tool in clinical and research practice, and is an easy, quick, and inexpensive way of assessing HGS in older adults. Prior to performing the hand-grip strength test, hand dominance is determined by asking participants which hand they use for writing or which hand they would predominantly use when performing a task. HGS is measured in kilograms by taking the average of the two dominant handgrip attempts using a Jamar Plus + Digital Hand Dynamometer.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 6-meter Fast Gait Speed Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and after 16-weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of the gait speed test is to measure the participant's fastest speed while walking and mobility. Fast gait speed is determined across a distance of 6 meter, which is marked on the floor with tape. Subjects are allowed to use their usual walking aid. Two trails will be administered, time (in seconds) will be recorded for each trial. The average speed of two trails will be recorded as the fast gait speed.</description>

    <measure>Change in Time Up and Go test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and after 16-weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Time Up and Go test (TUG) is a reliable and valid test for quantifying functional mobility for frail elder person. The participant is observed and timed while he rises from an arm chair, walks 3 meters, turns, walks back, and sits down again. As the test is quick, and requires no special equipment or training, it is widely used in studies as a physical assessment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 30 seconds Sit-to-stand (STS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and after 16-weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Sit-to-stand (STS) test is a commonly used functional performance measure in clinical research and practice. STS performance is influenced by multiple physiological and psychological processes and represents a particular transfer skill, rather than a proxy measure of lower limb strength. In 30 seconds STS, participants will be asked to rise from the chair as fast as possible with their arms fold across their chest and the number of times they are able to perform sit-to-stand successfully within 30 seconds will be recorded. The performance of this test is suggested to be influenced by factors associated with balance, muscle strength, lower extremity endurance, and mobility as well.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Frailty Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and after 16-weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Frailty score of the participants will be assessed based on the five criteria by Fried in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). The five criteria (modified for this pilot study) include: unintentional weight loss &gt;10 lbs (4.5kg) and/or BMI of &lt;18.5 in the last 6 months measured by self-report, weakness measured by knee extension strength, slowness measured by 6-m gait speed, exhaustion measured by questionnaire (SF-12), and physical inactivity measured by LASA Physical Activity Questionnaire. One-point is assign for the presence of each component, and based on the individual's total score, participants are categorized as frail (3-5 points), pre-frail (1-2 points), and robust (0 point). Reduction in frailty during the study is defined as a transition to a lower frailty category from baseline over 3 months.</description>

    <measure>Change in EuroQol-Five Dimensions (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and after 16-weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is one of the most commonly used generic health quality of life (QoL) status measurement, and its good validity and reliability have been reported in various health conditions. In this study, EQ-5D will be used as a standardized instrument for measuring generic health-related QoL.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and after 16-weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>GDS is a 30-item self-report assessment used to identify depression in the elderly. One point is assigned to each answer and the cumulative score is rated on a scoring grid. The grid sets a range of 0-9 as &quot;normal&quot;, 10-19 as &quot;mildly depressed&quot;, and 20-30 as &quot;severely depressed&quot;.</description>

    <intervention_name>Baduanjin exercise program</intervention_name>
    <description>Baduanjin (BDJ), also known as Eight-Section Brocades, is one of the forms of traditional Chinese Qigong exercises, characterized by symmetrical physical posture, movements, mindfulness, and breathing. Its primary focus is on the release of 'Qi' or internal body energy with the intent of improving health outcomes. BDJ encompasses eight simple movements involving combinations of postures, meditation, slow relaxing movements, and breathing exercises. It is a low intensity exercise, which have been found to improve range of motion, strength and general health. The simplicity and low intensity level is ideal for older adults to practice at home using instructional videos.</description>
