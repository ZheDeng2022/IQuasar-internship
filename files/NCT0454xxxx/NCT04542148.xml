  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a fundamental gap in understanding the maternal and neonatal effects of antenatal&#xD;
      corticosteroid (ACS) administration in women with threatened preterm birth (PTB) who have&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Since the initial discovery of ACS for neonatal benefit in&#xD;
      1972, more than 40 randomized controlled trials have been performed evaluating its efficacy.&#xD;
      However, none of these trials have included women with T2DM. While ACS have been shown to&#xD;
      reduce neonatal morbidity associated with PTB in non-diabetic women, the side effects of ACS&#xD;
      (maternal hyperglycemia and fetal hyperinsulinemia) may mitigate the neonatal benefit of ACS&#xD;
      in women with T2DM. Before neonatal benefit of ACS can be evaluated in this population, the&#xD;
      first step is to optimize maternal glycemic control after ACS. Previous studies evaluating&#xD;
      maternal hyperglycemia after ACS have been limited by small sample size, retrospective study&#xD;
      design, or insufficient glucose data. Use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial provides a unique opportunity to overcome these challenges. Our&#xD;
      long-term goal is to improve maternal and child health among women with T2DM as an&#xD;
      independently funded clinical researcher. The research objectives of this proposal are to&#xD;
      test the efficacy of three treatment strategies at achieving maternal glycemic control after&#xD;
      ACS and evaluate the association between maternal glycemic control and neonatal outcomes. Our&#xD;
      central hypothesis is that treatment with a continuous insulin infusion will improve maternal&#xD;
      glycemic control, which is key to improving neonatal outcomes, but at the cost of less&#xD;
      patient satisfaction and more health resource utilization. This hypothesis will be tested by&#xD;
      pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Test the efficacy of three treatment strategies&#xD;
      (addition of sliding scale insulin, up-titration of home insulin, and continuous insulin&#xD;
      infusion) at achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and 2) Quantify the association&#xD;
      between maternal glycemic control after ACS and neonatal morbidity. Completion of these aims&#xD;
      will determine the optimal strategy to achieve maternal glycemic control after ACS and inform&#xD;
      a larger, multicenter trial to improve neonatal outcomes among women with T2DM and threatened&#xD;
      PTB.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible, consenting women with insulin-treated T2DM receiving ACS at 24 0/7 - 36 5/7 weeks'&#xD;
      gestation for threatened PTB will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 1)&#xD;
      addition of sliding scale insulin to their home insulin regimen, 2) up-titration of their&#xD;
      home insulin regimen, or 3) discontinuation of their home insulin regimen and initiation of a&#xD;
      continuous insulin infusion. The randomization sequence will be created by the study&#xD;
      statistician in a permuted block design, and assignments will be centrally allocated using&#xD;
      the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) application. Study investigators will be masked&#xD;
      to the randomization sequence and varying block sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of treatment group, all women will receive Dexcom G6 Professional CGM for 10 days&#xD;
      or hospital discharge. The device will be applied by research staff or if desired, by the&#xD;
      patient herself, under direct supervision by research staff. The CGM sensor will be applied&#xD;
      to the patient's abdomen away from skin folds, where there is hair, near the waistband or&#xD;
      areas of scarring, tatoos, irritation or open wounds. An additional waterproof adhesive will&#xD;
      be applied to help prevent the sensor from being dislodged and finally the transmitter will&#xD;
      be attached. The patient will be provided a handout with instructions for care. The&#xD;
      Professional CGM device will ensure both patients and providers are masked to CGM data, which&#xD;
      will be used for research purposes only as CGM is not readily available to guide insulin&#xD;
      titration in most clinical settings. Capillary blood glucose testing, the method routinely&#xD;
      used in clinical practice, will be used to guide insulin titration for each treatment group.&#xD;
      Women assigned to the sliding scale insulin group will continue their home insulin regimen&#xD;
      and receive supplemental insulin as needed for post-prandial hyperglycemia based on capillary&#xD;
      blood glucose testing 4 times daily (fasting and 1-hour post-prandial) for 5 days after ACS.&#xD;
      Women assigned to the up-titration of home insulin group will have their home insulin dosages&#xD;
      increased based on an algorithm with capillary blood glucose testing 4 times daily and&#xD;
      additional sliding scale insulin as needed for post-prandial hyperglycemia. For example, if a&#xD;
      woman's baseline insulin regimen includes a total of 70 units of daily insulin (NPH 30 units&#xD;
      in the morning (qAM), NPH 10 units at bedtime (qPM), and Aspart 10 units with each meal),&#xD;
      then on day 2 after ACS she will receive 50% more or 105 units total (NPH 45 units qAM, NPH&#xD;
      15 units qPM, and Aspart 15 units with each meal). Women assigned to the continuous insulin&#xD;
      infusion group will have their home insulin discontinued and receive a continuous insulin&#xD;
      infusion based on hourly capillary blood glucose testing for 5 days after ACS. Given the high&#xD;
      acuity of insulin infusion management these women will be monitored on L&amp;D, but women in the&#xD;
      other two treatment groups may be managed on L&amp;D or on the Antepartum unit at the discretion&#xD;
      of the primary provider. Regardless of treatment group, all women will be allowed to eat as&#xD;
      long as it is deemed safe by the primary provider. If women assigned to receive the sliding&#xD;
      scale insulin group or the up-titration of home insulin group are made nil per os (NPO) at&#xD;
      any time after enrollment, they will be placed on the continuous insulin infusion per&#xD;
      protocol with hourly capillary blood glucose testing. Once a diet is resumed, they will be&#xD;
      switched back to the insulin algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the study intervention, all women will complete the Diabetes Treatment&#xD;
      Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) to assess satisfaction with their insulin treatment&#xD;
      strategy. The DTSQ is one of the most widely used treatment questionnaires as it is&#xD;
      internationally validated and approved by the World Health Organization and International&#xD;
      Diabetes Federation and available in over 100 different languages. The questionnaire is&#xD;
      composed of 8 questions, each of which are scored on a scale ranging from 0 (&quot;very&#xD;
      dissatisfied or inconvenient&quot;) to 6 (&quot;very satisfied or convenient&quot;). The first section&#xD;
      assesses treatment satisfaction and includes 6 questions that ask about 1) satisfaction with&#xD;
      treatment, 2) flexibility, 3) convenience, 4) understanding of diabetes, 5) recommend&#xD;
      treatment to others, and 6) willingness to continue. The second section consists of 2&#xD;
      questions that assess the burden of hyper- and hypoglycemia. Overall treatment satisfaction&#xD;
      is measured by the sum of the scores on the first 6 questions, and a higher score indicates&#xD;
      higher satisfaction (maximum score of 36). The DTSQ is particularly well-suited for use in&#xD;
      this study because it is able assess treatment satisfaction regardless of the specific&#xD;
      treatment method, and it is easy to answer without placing a large burden on patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other than glycemic management during the 5 days after ACS, antenatal care (fetal testing,&#xD;
      maternal laboratory evaluation, timing and mode of delivery) will be at the discretion of the&#xD;
      primary obstetric provider. Umbilical cord blood will be collected at delivery and stored at&#xD;
      the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) for analysis at the conclusion of the trial.&#xD;
      After birth, all neonates born to women with T2DM have a heelstick performed to measure&#xD;
      capillary blood glucose as part of standard of care. Additional neonatal care after birth&#xD;
      will be at the discretion of the primary neonatal provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive baseline maternal data and maternal and neonatal outcomes will be abstracted&#xD;
      from the UAB electronic medical record and Professional CGM devices. Additionally, measures&#xD;
      of health resource utilization will be collected such as duration of time on labor and&#xD;
      delivery, number of capillary blood glucose tests, treatments administered such as insulin,&#xD;
      intravenous fluids, and dextrose for hypoglycemia.&#xD;
