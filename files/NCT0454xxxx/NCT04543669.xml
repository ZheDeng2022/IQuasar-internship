  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recruitment of individuals primed during childhood with TdaP (tetanus, diphtheria , acellular&#xD;
      pertussis) vaccine, and administration of an Adacel booster with blood sample collection at&#xD;
      various time points before and after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of blood sample volumes will be large enough to allow assessment and comparison of&#xD;
      multiple assays that evaluate cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses and other biomarkers&#xD;
      following the administration of pertussis vaccinations. The ultimate objective would be to&#xD;
      utilize these validated assays for evaluation of pertussis clinical trial results or&#xD;
      development of new pertussis vaccine formulations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pertussis, known as &quot;whooping cough&quot;, is caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis which&#xD;
      was discovered over a century ago. Human vaccines were developed in the subsequent two&#xD;
      decades and routine childhood immunization has been practiced for over 60 years. Yet, B.&#xD;
      pertussis remains a significant cause of morbidity in children and adults worldwide.&#xD;
      Globally, about 20-40 million cases of pertussis are reported each year, with about 400,000&#xD;
      cases being fatal. The incidence of pertussis is highest and the severity the greatest in&#xD;
      children under 6 months of age. Vaccination and natural infection are not protective for&#xD;
      life, and the reason is unclear. The epidemiologic features of B. pertussis infections in&#xD;
      older individuals who are only partially immune from prior infections and immunizations are&#xD;
      not well understood. Clarification is important, in light of studies that suggest that&#xD;
      pertussis is a cause of prolonged cough illness in adults who serve as the reservoir of B.&#xD;
      pertussis and are the major source of infection for infants in whom the disease has&#xD;
      substantial morbidity and mortality. With the considerable increase in cases and outbreaks,&#xD;
      there is an imminent need for improved immunogenic and efficacious pertussis vaccines, paired&#xD;
      with the best tools to evaluate vaccines and vaccine programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VaxDesign has proposed two studies for acellular vaccine primed (acP) versus whole cell&#xD;
      vaccine primed (wcP) donors, to further develop and validate a number of practical assays for&#xD;
      use as biomarkers and to define a baseline readout for pertussis vaccinations from these two&#xD;
      cohorts. In addition, these assays will be optimized to use the small blood volumes that are&#xD;
      routinely available from clinical studies. In contrast to measuring humoral immune responses,&#xD;
      the cell mediated immune response (CMI) is a substantially more challenging parameter to&#xD;
      assess and thus the sample volumes required for the study must be large enough to allow the&#xD;
      multiple different assessments. In this study, samples will be taken to evaluate&#xD;
      transcriptomics, and humoral and cellular immunity over a one month period following&#xD;
      vaccination. The collaboration with the Canadian Center for Vaccinology (CCfV) offers a&#xD;
      unique opportunity of easily accessing acellular vaccine primed individuals.&#xD;
