  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A unique approach for cancer treatment employing intratumoral diffusing alpha radiation&#xD;
      emitter device as a neo-adjuvant therapy in men with prostate cancer&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is planned as a prospective, open-label, one arm, single center trial, designed to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility and safety of intratumoral DaRT seeds implantation for the treatment&#xD;
      of local prostate cancer prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach combines the advantages of local intratumoral irradiation of the tumor, as used&#xD;
      in conventional brachytherapy, with the power of the alpha radiation emitting atoms, that&#xD;
      will be introduced in quantities considerably lower than radiation therapy already used in&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate lesions with histopathological confirmation of adenocarcinoma will be treated using&#xD;
      DaRT seeds in a neo-adjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility will be assessed by the successful delivery of DaRT seeds into the intratumoral&#xD;
      environment. In addition, objective response rate will be assessed both by imaging and&#xD;
      pathology.&#xD;
