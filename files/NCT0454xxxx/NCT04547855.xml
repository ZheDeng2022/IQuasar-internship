  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently,6 cycles of Temozolomide adjuvant chemotherapy after concurrent radiotherapy and&#xD;
      Temozolomide chemotherapy(STUPP regimen)for newly diagnosed postoperative GBM can increase&#xD;
      the 2-year and 5-year overall survival rates of patients to 26.5% and 9.8%, respectively.&#xD;
      However, most patients are still unable to avoid tumor recurrence and death.Anlotinib is an&#xD;
      efficient multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that effectively block the migration&#xD;
      and proliferation of endothelial cells and reduce tumor microvascular density by targeting&#xD;
      VEGFRs, FGFRs, PDGFRs. It has been proved to be safe and effective in advanced lung&#xD;
      cancer(including NSCLC,SCLC)after second-line standard chemotherapy failure,and advanced soft&#xD;
      tissue sarcoma after anthracycline-containing chemotherapy failure.Here, we prepared to&#xD;
      evaluate whether the combination of dose-dense Temozolomide and Anlotinib can preferably&#xD;
      improved survival of the first recurrent or progressive GBM after STUPP regimen.&#xD;
