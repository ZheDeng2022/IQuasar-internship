  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to pilot a 10-week resistance and functional movement&#xD;
      intervention targeting proximal muscles in 40 people with MS. The investigators will assess&#xD;
      implementation feasibility (recruitment, fidelity, retention, satisfaction), collect pilot&#xD;
      data for key walking function outcomes, and examine movement-pattern and activity behavior&#xD;
      mechanisms. Walking function will be measured by walking capacity (6-Minute Walk Test - 6MWT)&#xD;
      and PA quantity (average steps/ day over 10 days). Movement-pattern mechanisms will be&#xD;
      measured using 3D motion capture analysis (pelvis and trunk kinematics). Activity behavior&#xD;
      mechanisms will be measured by patient-reported outcome questionnaires (perception of walking&#xD;
      ability, self-efficacy, and readiness to change).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be a prospective cohort in 40 people with MS with one baseline and&#xD;
      one follow-up assessment after a 10-week functional resistance training intervention. The&#xD;
      screening and outcome assessments will take place in the CU Interdisciplinary Movement&#xD;
      Science Lab and intervention will occur in the CU Physical Therapy Program gym. Both&#xD;
      facilities have the necessary space and equipment for outcomes assessment and intervention,&#xD;
      respectively. The PI will perform the initial screening and deliver the intervention. In&#xD;
      order to limit testing bias, all functional tests, patient-reported outcomes, and motion&#xD;
      capture data collection will be performed by an experienced research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive 14 one-on-one supervised intervention visits over 10 weeks.&#xD;
      Intervention frequency will mimic clinical practice, starting at 2x/ week in clinic (2x/ week&#xD;
      independently) for four weeks and tapering to 1x/ week in clinic (3x/ week independently) for&#xD;
      the final six weeks. Participants will be prescribed 5 categories of resistance exercises,&#xD;
      and each category will have a series of exercises to select from. Two will target hip&#xD;
      abduction (lying down and standing), two will target trunk muscles (sidelying/ forward&#xD;
      planks, resisted trunk rotation), and one will target functional resistance training for the&#xD;
      hip and trunk during walking-related tasks such as multi-directional resisted walking. Dosing&#xD;
      will be based on guidelines for MS. Strengthening exercises will begin with 3 sets of 12-15&#xD;
      reps at 15 rep-max load (RM) and progress to 3 sets of 8-10 reps at 10-12 RM. Endurance&#xD;
      exercises requiring a static hold will progress from 3 sets of 15-20 second holds to&#xD;
      30-second holds. Functional resistance will be dosed to improve muscular endurance: 3 sets of&#xD;
      15-20 reps based on form fatigue. Progression will be achieved by modifying body position,&#xD;
      and/or adding cuff weights or resistance bands. Exercises will take 30-45 minutes to&#xD;
      complete. Upper extremity use to maintain balance will be allowed as needed.&#xD;
