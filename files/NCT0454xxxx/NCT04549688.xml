  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PSA (Prostate-specific antigen) testing has significantly increased the number of men&#xD;
      diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) and especially patients with low and intermediate risk&#xD;
      disease. The effect of radical treatment (treatment of the entire prostate gland) in these&#xD;
      risk groups is disputable while the risk of adverse effects, with erectile dysfunction and&#xD;
      urinary incontinence, is not. Active surveillance (AS) has been developed as an alternative&#xD;
      to radical treatment with the aim of avoiding or delaying radical treatment by closely&#xD;
      monitoring for signs of tumor progression. Active surveillance is regarded as the treatment&#xD;
      of choice for low-risk prostate cancer. Focal therapy may have a crucial role in improving&#xD;
      active surveillance protocols for patients with intermediate localized prostate cancer. Focal&#xD;
      eradication of the index-tumor may delay or avoid indefinitely radical treatment for this&#xD;
      patient group while significantly reducing treatment-related side effects. Improved&#xD;
      MRI-diagnostics and MRI/ ultrasound fusion technology have optimized tumor mapping and&#xD;
      classification and this in turn has made partial treatment of the prostate a feasible&#xD;
      treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective cohort study. Patients with intermediate (high-risk) localized&#xD;
      PCa and a visible index tumor will be treated with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to show that there is a significant effect of focal treatment on&#xD;
      surveillance biopsies and a reduced conversion to radical treatment, without compromising&#xD;
      survival outcomes compared to historical controls (retrospective cohort). A cohort from the&#xD;
      more than 450 patients included in the local AS-protocol with MRI at Vestfold hospital trust&#xD;
      since 2009 will serve as controls.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      1 Needs description It is unclear if eradication with focal treatment of the index-tumor of&#xD;
      patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer followed by active surveillance can reduce&#xD;
      the need for radical, whole-gland treatment of the prostate and thereby treatment side&#xD;
      effects. It is important for urologists and patients to know if focal treatment of prostate&#xD;
      cancer is both a safe and effective treatment option. If proven so, focal treatment of&#xD;
      prostate cancer can be offered as a viable, intermediate treatment option for a large group&#xD;
      of patients who currently only have the choice between either surveillance or radical&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, there is an unmet need to document the outcome of focal treatment in selected patients&#xD;
      with prostate cancer, both in terms of efficacy and safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Hypotheses, aims and objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Hypothesis: Focal treatment of biopsy-verified, localized, MRI-visible, intermediate-risk&#xD;
      (and high-risk fo elderly patients) prostate cancer is a safe and effective treatment option.&#xD;
      Side effects following focal treatment are transient and mild compared to established and&#xD;
      well-documented radical treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Aims of the study: To investigate if focal treatment of localized prostate cancer&#xD;
      followed by MRI-supplemented active surveillance conveys sufficient tumor control to enable&#xD;
      patients to continue indefinitely in this follow-up protocol without the need to convert to&#xD;
      radical treatment, with none or mild side effects and without compromising oncological&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eradication of the signal tumor (&lt;20% positive biopsies in the treated area after one&#xD;
           year)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low conversion rates to radical treatment (&lt;20%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Good long-term oncological results (&lt;5% metastasis and &lt;1% prostate cancer deaths at 10&#xD;
           years)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Good functional results (&lt;10% of patients with long-term side effects on erectile&#xD;
           function and continence)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the ability of MRI to predict biopsy results during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health-related quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, single-arm, case-control cohort study with consecutive patients&#xD;
      with intermediate-risk, MRI-visible prostate cancer treated focally with HIFU. Participants&#xD;
      will be compared to historical controls (patients observed with AS at SiV 2009-2017). The&#xD;
      study design follows the international multidisciplinary consensus on trial design for focal&#xD;
      therapy in PCa (28, 29). Patients will primarily be recruited from Vestfold-Telemark County&#xD;
      but recruitment from other institutions in Norway is encouraged. More formal referral&#xD;
      arrangements will be sought with Aleris (Oslo), Telemark Hospital Trust and Vestre Viken&#xD;
      Hospital Trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Project arrangements, method selection and analyses From a scientific and methodological&#xD;
      point of view a randomized, parallel-group study would have been preferable with patients&#xD;
      receiving either AS+ (HIFU) or simple AS follow-up. However, experience from several&#xD;
      investigative centers have shown that randomization is difficult to carry out in practice.&#xD;
      This is because patients are aware of the HIFU possibility, and, if randomized to standard&#xD;
      treatment, often refuse participation and demand HIFU treatment. This problem would likely be&#xD;
      exacerbated in this study, where the control group would be offered only follow-up while&#xD;
      study arm patients receive tumor-directed treatment with presumed few side-effects.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators have learned from own historic controls that AS is &quot;good&#xD;
      medicine&quot; for merely half of the patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer after 5&#xD;
      years. Since it is difficult, based on today's diagnostic tools, to identify patients that&#xD;
      will not progress significantly over time, some form of tumor-directed treatment for all&#xD;
      patients is sensible. Finally, patients in the historical control group were diagnosed and&#xD;
      risk-classified by the same parameters and diagnostic tools that are currently in use.&#xD;
      Follow-up of these patients was also very similar to the one outlined for the study patients.&#xD;
      The investigators are not aware of any significant change in clinical practice that would&#xD;
      suggest that the historical controls at the study institution are not representative of&#xD;
      current patients with intermediate risk profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are interested in focal treatment of prostate cancer are aware of the radical&#xD;
      treatment alternatives but are skeptical of the side effects. These patients want to know&#xD;
      their risk of progression (metastasis and death), the risk of having to undergo radical&#xD;
      treatment at a later stage and the short-term and long-term side effects if they choose focal&#xD;
      treatment. We believe that this study will provide these answers for a representative&#xD;
      Norwegian patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these considerations, the investigators believe that the best and most ethical&#xD;
      design is the one proposed here, where all eligible patients receive the same treatment and&#xD;
      are then compared to a historical control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population and Power-estimate Approximately half of active surveillance patients (50%)&#xD;
      experience progression of their disease during 5-10 years follow-up (9). This correlates with&#xD;
      the outcome of historical AS patients at the study institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators estimate that only 20% of the newly diagnosed AS patients receiving HIFU&#xD;
      will experience a progression of their disease after 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to detect such a reduction in progression rate, the trial will need to include 194&#xD;
      patients. With 20% expected dropouts, the number of patients needed to include in the HIFU&#xD;
      cohort will be 245.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculations are based on the ClinCalc program&#xD;
      (http://clincalc.com/stats/samplesize.aspx).&#xD;
