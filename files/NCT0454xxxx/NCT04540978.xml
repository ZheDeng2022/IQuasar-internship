  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Being active early after stroke prevents secondary complications, reduces hospital length of&#xD;
      stay and improves long-term functional outcomes. Early mobilization and early rehabilitation&#xD;
      are the means to achieve activity at the early phase post-stroke. Performance of out-of-bed&#xD;
      activity at an acute care setting is partially dependent on the routines used in the acute&#xD;
      care setting, however, knowledge the knowledge about associations between clinical routines&#xD;
      and the characteristics of out-of-bed activity is limited. Also, there is limited knowledge&#xD;
      about institutional barriers to such activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, the goal of the current study is, in acute hospital inpatient setting, to: 1)&#xD;
      characterize stroke patients' activity according to shifts (i.e. morning and evening), 2)&#xD;
      test associations between out-of-bed activity and patients' clinical status and 3) identify&#xD;
      barriers to activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective observational study that monitors physical activity in people&#xD;
      after stroke while they in an acute stroke care setting, and records berries for out-of-bed&#xD;
      activity including being in sitting or standing and walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are included if they admitted to the hospital within 48 hours of symptom onset,&#xD;
      passed routine initial neurologic and nursing examinations within 48 hours of admission, and&#xD;
      have score of 5-18 on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Patients are&#xD;
      excluded if they had hemorrhagic stroke, and if they have heart failure, acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome, unstable hemodynamics and fractures, or if they are terminally ill.&#xD;
