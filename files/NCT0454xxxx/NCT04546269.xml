      Patients where placement of a single implant will be treated by senior dental students under&#xD;
      close supervision of experienced spcialists. All implant treeatments will be categorized as&#xD;
      &quot;straight forward&quot;according to the SAC classification. The patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      have the implants placed using a fully guided or a convetionally guided protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome parameters include accuracy of implant placement compared to an ideal implant&#xD;
      position, patient- and student-reported outcome.&#xD;

      Study design and participants The study is designed with two commonly used procedures for&#xD;
      implant placement. Two well-known, but different workflows are used: a digital using&#xD;
      primarily a digital workflow and a conventional workflow using primarily an analog procedure.&#xD;
      In our daily student education, the latter has been used, but to examine the feasibility and&#xD;
      quality of using a full digital work, the present study will compared two accepted and&#xD;
      documented workflows. For making a reliable comparison, a prospective, randomized clinical&#xD;
      study is planned within our normal schedule for student education. Thirty-six patients are&#xD;
      already recruited and pre-screened to clinical teaching in implant dentistry on from the&#xD;
      September to December 2019 on Department of Odontology. All 36 patients in the need of&#xD;
      implant-supported single tooth restorations and without any contraindications for implant&#xD;
      dentistry. All cases are selected to be &quot;straight-forward&quot; cases possible to be rehabilitated&#xD;
      by dental students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample calculation (Power of the study): A sample size of 28 subjects (14 in each group) is&#xD;
      needed to detect a difference in patient-reported outcome (VAS-scale values for digital&#xD;
      versus analog impression) of 30 % , with a 5 % risk of type I and 20 % risk of type II errors&#xD;
      and SD = 2. With a maximum drop-out of up to 8 patient a sample size of 36 is endeavored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria for this study are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients of more than 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with a need of one or more single-tooth implants in the molar or the premolar&#xD;
           region&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Natural healthy neighboring teeth without need of restorations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sufficient bone-volume for placing an implant without bone- or soft tissue augmentation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heavy smokers (more than 10 cigarettes per day)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uncontrolled diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metabolic bone disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of radiotherapy of the head and neck&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recent chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of drugs inﬂuencing bone or soft tissue healing (e.g. high doses of antiresorptive&#xD;
           medication, steroids or anti-inflammatory drugs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional oral surgery in the region of interest&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The patients in the digital group (test) will be treated following a digital&#xD;
      workflow and the analog group (control) will be treated with the same workflow as the&#xD;
      students have used the last three years in the student educational program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Workflow Study groups Digital Test (T) , n=18 Analog Control (C), , n=18 Pre-examination&#xD;
      CBCT, Limited to two neighboring teeth at both side or 4 teeth mesially for the distal&#xD;
      implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A bite index with a thickness of 3-5 mm will be used to stabilize and separate the jaws&#xD;
      during scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;

      mesially for the distal implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A bite index with a thickness of 3-5 mm will be used to stabilize and separate the jaws&#xD;
      during scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional analog impression Planning The SIMPLANT™ (Dentsply) software will be used. The&#xD;
      DCOM-file from CBCT and STL-file from IOS will be downloaded to Dentsply, Simplant Academy&#xD;
      service center. In cooperation with dentists and students, the most optimal placement of&#xD;
      implants will be planned. Based on this treatment plan, a &quot;Tooth-supported Simplant Guide&quot;&#xD;
      for surgical procedure will be milled. The stone model prepared from the conventional analog&#xD;
      impressions will be used. In the toothless regions, an acrylic tooth of the proper size will&#xD;
      be placed on the most optimal position and fixed on the stone model with wax-up technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A customized acrylic surgical guide will be ordered and produced by dental technician. The&#xD;
      CBCT will be used for planning the best position of implants and will be used for visual&#xD;
      guidance during implant insertion (Soft ware: Planmeca Romexis®).&#xD;

      Randomization Thirty-six sealed, opaque envelopes containing the letters T or C, representing&#xD;
      test (fully digital workflow) and control (conventional workflow) group, will be used. At the&#xD;
      first visitation at the Section of Oral Rehabilitation, patients will be informed about the&#xD;
      allocation and the treatment procedure. The patients will draw an envelope and the name of&#xD;
      the participants will be written on the envelope and the envelope will be opened. Clinical&#xD;
      photographs of smile line, front region, premolar/molar region at both sides and occlusal&#xD;
      planes will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedures After a primary visitation of the patients by an oral surgeon at the&#xD;
      Section of Oral Surgery. In both test (nT=18) and control group (nC=18) Cone Beam Computed&#xD;
      Tomography (CBCT; Viso Planmeca, Finland) will be taken of the implant region and the&#xD;
      SIMPLANT™ (Dentsply) software will be used to plan the implant position. In the test group a&#xD;
      fully guided procedure with a surgical guided with metal sleeves produced based on the STL&#xD;
      file from the software. In the control group, an analog surgical guide without metallic&#xD;
      sleeves and with relatively high freedom of movements will be used be the student during&#xD;
      implant surgery. The patients group C and T will be going through implant insertion&#xD;
      procedures as listed in Table 1. The surgical guides produced for the group T and C will be&#xD;
      used during the surgical procedure of implant insertion. After healing of implants, the&#xD;
      patients will be referred to the Section of Oral Rehabilitation for prosthetic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prosthetic procedures Ten to fourteen weeks after implant placement, the implants will be&#xD;
      clinically tested for osseointegration, and impressions will be taken. To evaluate the&#xD;
      patient satisfaction and convenience with the digital versus the analog technique, all 36&#xD;
      patients will try the digital as well as the analog impression. CEREC intraoral scanners will&#xD;
      be used for the digital technique, and conventional impression techniques will be used for&#xD;
      the analog technique. For intraoral scanning, scan bodies will be used, and the implant&#xD;
      region, antagonistic teeth and occlusal registrations will be performed. The analog&#xD;
      impressions include the use of implant pick-ups and Impregum (3M, ESPE) for impression of the&#xD;
      actual arch, Blue Mousse (Parkell, USA) for occlusal registration, and Alginate&#xD;
      (ALGINoplast®, Kulzer GmbH, Hanau, Germany) for the opposite arch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prosthetic restorations will be screw-retained crown-abutments designed using CAD/CAM&#xD;
      technique on either stereolithographic models for the test participants (digital technique),&#xD;
      or on gypsum cast-models for the participants in the control group (conventional technique) .&#xD;
      The participants will be recalled to follow-up examinations 4 weeks after crown fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome - Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Accuracy of guided implant surgery After implant placement all 36 patients will have a&#xD;
           new CBCT of the implant region and an overlay of the two CBCT´s (before and after&#xD;
           implant placement) will be used for measuring deviations between the planned implant&#xD;
           position and the real implant position: Apical deviation (mesio-distally,&#xD;
           bucco-lingually), Marginal deviation (mesio-distally, bucco-lingually) to test for&#xD;
           accuracy of the two methods. Measurements will be performed in the computer software,&#xD;
           where DICOM files from CBCT´s can be transferred to STL-files from IOS's.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prosthetic quality of the implant-supported restoration&#xD;
&#xD;
           Technical outcome: The following prosthetic quality criteria is registered for the&#xD;
           crown-abutments screw into the fixtures:&#xD;
