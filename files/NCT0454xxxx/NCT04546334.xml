      This randomized clinical study will be carried out on 72 patients admitted to the pain clinic&#xD;
      in Tanta University Hospitals with post-herpetic neuralgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases presenting to the Pain Clinic with acute pain due to postherpetic neuralgia in thoracic&#xD;
      and/or lumbar dermatomes with numerical rating scale (NRS) of 6 or more and they will be&#xD;
      randomly divided, using the closed envelop method, into three equal groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A (24 patients): Patients will be subjected to the routine medical treatment of post&#xD;
      herpetic neuralgia as controls (Pregabalin, acyclovir, and paracetamol) and sham erector&#xD;
      spinae plane block Group B (24 patients): Patients will be subjected to erector spinae block&#xD;
      by bupivacaine (2 - 2.5 mg/kg, with a maximum of 175 mg/dose) together with medical&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C (24 patients): Patients that will subjected to erector spinae block by bupivacaine (2&#xD;
      - 2.5 mg/kg, with a maximum of 175 mg/dose with the addition of MgSO4 (equivalent to 100 mg))&#xD;
      together with medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome will be the efficacy of pain relief Secondary outcome will be the frequency&#xD;
      of pain and the consumption of analgesics.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This comparative randomized controlled study will be conducted on 72 patients of both gender&#xD;
      suffering from post-herpetic neuralgia and presented at Pain Clinics of Tanta University&#xD;
      Hospitals for a period of 9 months (September 2020- June 2021) that will be started&#xD;
      immediately after obtaining Ethical Committee approval. An informed written consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from all the participants, all patients data will be confidential and will be used&#xD;
      for the current study only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 72 cases with post herpetic neuralgia will be included in the current study, and&#xD;
      they will be randomly divided, using the closed envelop method, into three equal groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A (24 patients): Patients will be subjected to the routine medical treatment of post&#xD;
      herpetic neuralgia as controls (Pregabalin, acyclovir, and paracetamol) and sham erector&#xD;
      spinae plane block Group B (24 patients): Patients will be subjected to erector spinae block&#xD;
      by bupivacaine (2 - 2.5 mg/kg, with a maximum of 175 mg/dose) together with medical&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C (24 patients): Patients that will subjected to erector spinae block by bupivacaine (2&#xD;
      - 2.5 mg/kg, with a maximum of 175 mg/dose with the addition of MgSO4 (equivalent to 100 mg))&#xD;
      together with medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Management of the patients Before intervention, all cases will be subjected to complete&#xD;
           history taking, physical examination, and routine laboratory and radiological&#xD;
           investigations (if other causes rather than post herpetic neuralgia are suspected). Pre&#xD;
           intervention pain will be evaluated by NRS and recorded for all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements An assistant resident will help in obtaining and recording our&#xD;
           measurements. All the patients will undergo regular follow up visits that will be&#xD;
           arranged throughout the upcoming 3 months following injection as every week in the first&#xD;
           month, then, every 2 weeks in the next two months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Demographic data: including age, gender, associated morbidities, and site of&#xD;
                post-herpetic neuralgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Duration of analgesia will be defined as the analgesia starting from the&#xD;
                performance of the block until the first analgesic requirement or reporting a pain&#xD;
                score of 4/10.(9)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Frequency of pain&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Numerical rating score NRS (0- 10 metric score to assess the severity of pain where&#xD;
                0= no pain and 10 = severe pain)&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Dose of pregabalin consumed per day to relief pain&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Dose of other analgesics required to control pain.&#xD;
