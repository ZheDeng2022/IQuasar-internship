  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that a behavioral intervention tool adapted for the US military population&#xD;
      will be acceptable and associated with a decrease in incident sexually transmitted infection&#xD;
      (STI)/HIV rates and high-risk sexual behaviors, and increased self-reported condom use&#xD;
      compared to the standard of care at the Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM) Preventive Medicine&#xD;
      clinic and the Fort Bragg Department of Public Health (part of Womack Army Medical Center).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the Execution Phase which will be conducted as a multi-site randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. A previous Formative Phase study was conducted under a separate protocol which has&#xD;
      been completed with preliminary data indicating positive outcomes. Participants in both arms&#xD;
      will meet the same inclusion/exclusion criteria and will be randomized into the intervention&#xD;
      and control arms at a ratio of 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention arm will receive the KISS (Knocking out Infections through Safer sex and&#xD;
      Screening) intervention program in addition to standard STI prevention counselling routinely&#xD;
      provided by military medical treatment facilities. The control arm will receive only standard&#xD;
      STI prevention counselling. Both arms will receive follow-up educational messages via short&#xD;
      message service (SMS)/text messaging monthly for 10 months, and have follow-up study visits&#xD;
      at 6 months and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The KISS intervention is a 2-hour, small group (6-12 individuals) class-based interactive,&#xD;
      educational session based on Social Cognitive Theory and the Theory of Gender and Power. The&#xD;
      intervention is an adaptation of the HORIZONS intervention, which has shown efficacy are&#xD;
      reducing sexual risk behavior and incident STIs among adolescents in the USA. HORIZONS has&#xD;
      been reviewed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Prevention Synthesis Research&#xD;
      team and designated a CDC top-tier (Tier I) evidence-based intervention (EBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To enroll in the study, participants must be categorized as &quot;high risk&quot; as determined by a&#xD;
      positive test for an STI within the previous 180 days or has had STI screening during this&#xD;
      time frame (specifically gonorrhea (GC), chlamydia (CT), M. genitalium, syphilis and/or HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be recruited from Madigan Army Medical Center (Madigan) Preventive&#xD;
      Medicine Clinic and the Womack Army Medical Center (Womack) Preventive Medicine Clinic in Ft.&#xD;
      Bragg, North Carolina (NC). In addition, promotional flyers for recruitment will be placed in&#xD;
      public areas on both bases, and will be promoted through approved social media channels.&#xD;
      Subjects may also refer up to 5 friends or colleagues for screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled in the intervention arm will complete a total of four visits and those&#xD;
      in the control arm will complete a total of three visits. Over the course of the study,&#xD;
      participants in both groups will be asked to provide biological specimens and complete&#xD;
      knowledge/behavioral surveys three times (at baseline, 6 and at 12 months). Those in the&#xD;
      intervention group will also attend the KISS EBI (Evidence Based Intervention) program. Both&#xD;
      arms will receive monthly (months 2-11) follow up text messages, but the content will defer&#xD;
      between the two arms. Those in the intervention arm, will receive SMS/text messages targeting&#xD;
      prevention maintenance interventions (PMI) messages reiterating information received during&#xD;
      the EBI session. Those in the control arm, will receive SMS/text messages that will contain&#xD;
      general health information.&#xD;
