  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-stroke cognitive impairment is common in stroke survivors. Cognitive function is related&#xD;
      to walking ability. The dual task walking is required for daily activities, however, such&#xD;
      ability is even more challenging than single walking for people with stroke. The purpose of&#xD;
      present study is to investigate the effects of combining cognitive and treadmill training on&#xD;
      cognitive function and dual task walking performance in chronic stroke patients with&#xD;
      cognitive impairment.&#xD;

      This is a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial with pre- and post-measurements. 24&#xD;
      subjects will be recruited, and randomly assigned to one of two groups: cognitive training&#xD;
      during treadmill training group (experimental group) and treadmill training group (control&#xD;
      group). The intervention for both group will be 30 minutes per session, 3 sessions per week&#xD;
      for a total of 4 weeks. Statistical data analysis will use the SPSS 25.0. Baseline&#xD;
      characteristics will be analyzed using independent t-test or Chi-square test. Repeated&#xD;
      measures two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's post-hoc analysis will be used to&#xD;
      compare between time and groups. The significant level is set at 0.05.&#xD;

    <description>Treadmill training includes warming up for 3 minutes, training for 25 minutes, and relaxing for 2 minutes. The speed of the treadmill during the warm-up and relaxation period is based on the participant's Borg's rating of perceived exertion (RPE) 7-9 points (very slight to very slight), and the RPE during the training period does not exceed 10~12 points (slight), and ensures that patients can be cognitively trained at the same time. The cognitive training tasks will be projected on the screen and the participant have to answer the task orders during treadmill training simultaneously.</description>
