  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary infection is a critical disease threatening human health. With the extensive use of&#xD;
      antibiotics, the incidence of clinical drug resistance has been on the rise significantly in&#xD;
      recent years. Once drug resistance occurs, we will see a high mortality rate due to scarce&#xD;
      therapies and a poor prognosis. It is almost impossible to surmount the severe pulmonary&#xD;
      infection caused by drug-resistant bacteria only by upgrading antibiotics. The commonly used&#xD;
      supportive therapies clinically, such as glucocorticoids and immunomodulators, also lack&#xD;
      forceful medical evidence. Therefore, it is urgent to explore new treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesenchymal stem/progenitor cell exosomes are nano-sized vesicles secreted by mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem/progenitor cells under certain conditions, which contain a lot of proteins, lipids and&#xD;
      nucleic acids with tissue repair and immunomodulatory functions.&#xD;

      Mesenchymal stem/progenitor cell exosomes are nano-sized vesicles secreted by mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem/progenitor cells under certain conditions, which contain a lot of proteins, lipids and&#xD;
      nucleic acids with tissue repair and immunomodulatory functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, it has been confirmed that stem cells can visibly improve the pathological changes&#xD;
      of lungs caused by infection, lighten pulmonary edema, reduce protein exudation, mitigate&#xD;
      alveolar inflammation, and remove bacteria. Thus, it brings new hope for the treatment of&#xD;
      pulmonary infection caused by extensively drug-resistant bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were treated, in the research project, with well-suited noninvasive haMPC-Exos&#xD;
      aerosol inhalation, in an attempt to verify the efficacy and safety of haMPC-Exos treatment&#xD;
      with pulmonary infection caused by gram-negative bacilli resistant to carbapenems.&#xD;
