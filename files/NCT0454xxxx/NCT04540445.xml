      The purpose of this study is to gather information and compare the potential use of&#xD;
      pupillometry to identify concussions and post concussive syndrome with standard age&#xD;
      appropriate assessments. The study will compare concussed pediatric patients 5-17 years of&#xD;
      age recruited from the emergency department within 72 hours following injury with age and&#xD;
      gender matched non-concussed pediatric patients recruited from primary care clinics.&#xD;
      Assessment of both concussed and non-concussed subjects will take place at the initial&#xD;
      enrollment visit and will be repeated at 1-2 weeks for the concussed subjects and at 12-14&#xD;
      weeks for both groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of disability and death in children. In&#xD;
      both pediatric and adult populations, concussion is the most prevalent type of TBI and can&#xD;
      result in persistent post-concussive symptoms. Early recognition and treatment of concussion&#xD;
      is critical to the prevention of long-term sequelae and has recently become a national&#xD;
      public-health priority. Comprehensive assessment and diagnosis of concussion commonly&#xD;
      includes the use of a multimodal approach using a graded symptoms checklist, neurocognitive&#xD;
      testing, and balance assessment. An objective biomarker to definitively diagnose concussion&#xD;
      would revolutionize its management-allowing for accurate and immediate determination of&#xD;
      return to play/duty, decreasing unnecessary exposure to radiation, and reducing the overall&#xD;
      cost of care. Considering the paucity of evidence regarding the use of pupillary light reflex&#xD;
      in concussed children and the lack of a biomarker for concussion, further examination of the&#xD;
      use of objective pupillary metrics in this population is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to gather information and compare the potential use of&#xD;
      pupillometry to identify concussions and post concussive syndrome with standard age&#xD;
      appropriate assessments. The proposed study design is prospective, longitudinal case-control&#xD;
      consisting of two distinct cohorts: concussed participants and healthy control participants.&#xD;
      All concussion management decisions will be determined independent of the study by the&#xD;
      healthcare provider(s). Trained personnel performing follow-up assessments will use&#xD;
      established clinical criteria to notify appropriate healthcare provider and/or study team&#xD;
      member of any clinical concerns or unanticipated events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will compare concussed pediatric patients 5-17 years of age recruited from the&#xD;
      emergency department within 72 hours following injury with age and gender matched&#xD;
      non-concussed pediatric patients recruited from affiliated primary care and adolescent&#xD;
      clinics. Assessment of both concussed and non-concussed subjects will take place at the&#xD;
      initial enrollment visit and will be repeated at 1-2 weeks for the concussed subjects and at&#xD;
      12-14 weeks for both groups. Age appropriate assessment will include the Post-Concussion&#xD;
      Symptom Inventory (PCSI), Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS), pupillometry, Immediate&#xD;
      Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT), and Balance Error Scoring System&#xD;
      (BESS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives are to examine the acute (&lt;72 hours), subacute (1-2 week), and&#xD;
      long-term (12-14 weeks post-injury) longitudinal association among pupillary metrics,&#xD;
      standardized neurocognitive tests, and objective balance assessment in pediatric patients&#xD;
      with concussion versus controls. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of pupillometer data as an objective biomarker to aid in the identification of concussion and&#xD;
      post-concussive syndrome in children. Results will generate new knowledge regarding the&#xD;
      clinical utility of pupillometers in this patient population. We will explore the period that&#xD;
      best differentiates concussion and controls.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The association between NPi®-200 pupillometer measurements (including variables such as size, latency, constriction velocity, dilation velocity, etc.) and concussed/control status over time.</measure>
    <time_frame>For concussed subjects: the first measurement will be within 72 hours of sustaining injury, then repeated at 1-2 weeks and at 12-14 weeks post injury. For control subjects: the first measurement will be at enrollment and repeated at 12-14 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>NPi®-200 pupillometer is a hand-held portable infrared device which provides quantitative pupillary measurements by taking 30 pictures per second of the pupil's response to light stimulus for a duration of 3 seconds. A patient's pupil measurement (including variables such as size, latency, constriction velocity, dilation velocity, etc.) is compared against a normative model of pupil reaction to light and automatically graded by the Neurological Pupil Index (NPi™) on a scale of 0 to 5. Pupillary measurements will be obtained for the right and left eye.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The association between the NeurOptics PLR-3000 pupillometer measurements (including variables such as size, latency, constriction velocity, dilation velocity, etc.) and concussed/control status over time.</measure>
    <time_frame>For concussed subjects: the first measurement will be within 72 hours of sustaining injury, then repeated at 1-2 weeks and at 12-14 weeks post injury. For control subjects: the first measurement will be at enrollment and repeated at 12-14 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The NeurOptics PLR-3000 pupillometer is a hand-held portable infrared device which provides quantitative pupillary measurements by taking 30 pictures per second of the pupil's response to light stimulus for a duration of 6 seconds. Pupillary data, such as constriction velocity, latency, pupil size before and after the reflex, dilation velocity, time to reach 75% of initial resting diameter after constriction (T75) are calculated automatically at the end of each measurement. Pupillary measurements will be obtained for the right and left eye.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The association between the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI) &amp; Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS) and concussed/control status over time.</measure>
    <time_frame>For concussed subjects: the first measurement will be within 72 hours of sustaining injury, then repeated at 1-2 weeks and at 12-14 weeks post injury. For control subjects: the first measurement will be at enrollment and repeated at 12-14 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>PCSI assesses post-concussion symptoms based on patient and parent/teacher report. This inventory focuses on four areas that may be affected after concussion: cognitive, emotional, physical, and sleep. There are age-specific forms available for children between 5-7 years old, 8-12 years old, and 13-18 years old. This tool has been found to have moderate to high (0.62 to 0.84) inter-rater reliability for child reports and internal consistency across the three reports.&#xD;
PCSS is also a self-reported assessment of post-concussion symptoms. This report, which is part of the widely used Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) Versions 3 and 5 and Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Test (ImPACT), quantifies symptom severity (rank 22 different possible post-concussion symptoms on 7 point Likert scale). Similar to the PCSI, the PCSS includes symptoms from four areas: cognitive, emotional, physical, and sleep.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The association between the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT®) &amp; ImPACT® Pediatric assessment and concussed/control status over time.</measure>
    <time_frame>For concussed subjects: the first measurement will be within 72 hours of sustaining injury, then repeated at 1-2 weeks and at 12-14 weeks post injury. For control subjects: the first measurement will be at enrollment and repeated at 12-14 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>ImPACT® and ImPACT® Pediatric will both be used in this study. ImPACT® is a computerized data collection and neuropsychological testing tool commonly used for baseline and post-injury testing in athletes (12-59 years of age) at risk for sports-related concussion. Subjects participate in neuropsychological tests which assess attention, verbal memory, visual memory, visual processing speed, and reaction times. ImPACT® will be used to evaluate study patients ≥12 years old. ImPACT® Pediatric is an examiner-administered iOS-based battery of neuropsychological tests designed to measure neurocognitive functioning in children ages 5-11. ImPACT® Pediatric is administered on an iPad and is a neurocognitive test for management of pediatric concussions. ImPACT® Pediatric will be used to evaluate patients &lt; 12 years old. Outcome variables will be obtained from ImPACT® and include data to evaluate: verbal memory, visual memory, visual processing speed, and reaction time.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The association between the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) scores and concussed/control status over time.</measure>
    <time_frame>For concussed subjects: the first measurement will be within 72 hours of sustaining injury, then repeated at 1-2 weeks and at 12-14 weeks post injury. For control subjects: the first measurement will be at enrollment and repeated at 12-14 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) provides an objective score for a patient's postural stability. The patient is instructed to stand in three different stances, first on a solid surface and then a foam surface, for 20 seconds each. The examiner records the number of errors, as predefined by the scoring system, during each stance. The maximum score is 60 and a higher score correlates with worsening postural stability. This test has demonstrated good test-rest reliability (0.87-0.97 intraclass correlations), low to moderate sensitivity (0.34 to 0.64), and high specificity (0.91). Sensitivity is increased when this test is used in conjunction with a graded symptom checklist.</description>
