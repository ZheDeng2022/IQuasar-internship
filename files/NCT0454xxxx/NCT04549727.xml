  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite a greater understanding of NEC physiopathology, modest progress has been done in&#xD;
      terms of intervention and prevention of the disease over the past three decades, being the&#xD;
      mortality rate unchanged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators intend to leverage our knowledge and technical expertise developed with fetal&#xD;
      enteroids to further investigate the processes leading to NEC by deriving and performing&#xD;
      functional studies on human intestinal enteroids generated from intestinal resection for&#xD;
      therapeutic reasons in NEC and non-NEC patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Generate a tissue biorepository composed of: enteroids and other lamina propria cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparative studies of the gene expression profile of tissue, epithelial enteroids and&#xD;
           underlying lamina propria of NEC, non-NEC, hypoxic and non-hypoxic infants&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In vitro functional studies for the evaluation of critical factors in NEC&#xD;
           pathophysiology&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. In vitro functional studies to identify the activation of processes leading to&#xD;
           intestinal epithelium necroptosis and/or apoptosis in bacteria challenged and hypoxic&#xD;
           conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Correlative studies of the impact of perinatal variables on the intestinal barrier&#xD;
           functionality at baseline and challenged with pathogens&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. In vitro comparison of the intestinal barrier functionality in infants complicated by&#xD;
           condition of prenatal hypoxia versus non hypoxic infants&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Validation the NEC enteroids as an in vitro model for the identification of treatments&#xD;
           and prevention of NEC&#xD;

        Investigators will use surgically-resected intestinal samples from NEC patients and&#xD;
        gestational age-matched non-NEC surgical controls with intestinal resection for other&#xD;
        reasons than NEC to conduct various analysis. For comparative studies, Investigators aim to&#xD;
        grow enteroids from intestinal tissues freshly collected from preterm and term babies with&#xD;
        an age limit of 44 weeks of postmenstrual age (PMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group 1: intestinal samples from small and/or large bowel in NEC preterm and term babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group 2 (Control group): Age- and intestinal area-matched (small and/or large bowel) No NEC&#xD;
        babies, which have surgical resection for other reason than NEC&#xD;
