  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is a cardiac arrhythmia commonly encountered in a primary care setting.&#xD;
      Current screening is limited to pulse palpation and ECG confirmation when an irregular pulse&#xD;
      is found. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation will, however, still be difficult to pick up. With&#xD;
      the advent of smartphones, screening could be more cost-efficient by making use of simple&#xD;
      applications, lowering the need for intensive screening to discover (paroxysmal) atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cluster randomized trial will examine the effect of using a smartphone-based application&#xD;
      such as FibriCheck® on the detection rate of atrial fibrillation in a Flemish general&#xD;
      practice population. This study will be conducted in 22 primary care practices across the&#xD;
      Flanders region of Belgium and will last 12 months. Patients above 65 years of age will be&#xD;
      divided in control and intervention groups on the practice level. The control group will be&#xD;
      subjected to standard opportunistic screening only, while the intervention group will be&#xD;
      prescribed the FibriCheck® app on top of this opportunistic screening. The difference in&#xD;
      detection rate between control and intervention groups will be calculated at the end of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use the online platform INTEGO for pseudonymized data collection and&#xD;
      analysis, and risk calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smartphone applications might offer a way to cost-effectively screen for (paroxysmal) atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation in a primary care setting. This could open the door for the update of future&#xD;
      screening guidelines.&#xD;

    <description>The detection rate of AF in both the control and intervention group will be calculated after 4 weeks. A significant difference in both groups will be noted. Compared with previous studies of similar design (32-34), we will realistically assume a 2-fold increase in the detection rate of AF in the intervention group to be significant.</description>

    <description>In every cluster designated as a control group, patients aged 65 or older will be selected according to the inclusion criteria. The difference here is that patients will be given the standard opportunistic screening instead: pulse palpation and a 12-lead ECG when an irregular rhythm is found. This is current best practice.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient is 65 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient has an electronic medical record (EMR) in the practice. This EMR contains&#xD;
             all the patient information, for instance regarding medical history and medication and&#xD;
             is managed by the general practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. If the patient will be prescribed the FibriCheck® app, he/she signs the relevant&#xD;
             patient consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient has already been diagnosed with AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient is already under anticoagulant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient has a pacemaker. Active pacing during measurements influences the results&#xD;
             obtained with the FibriCheck® app (26).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient is unable to use the FibriCheck® application independently due to&#xD;
             cognitive disorders, functional limitations, visual impairments…&#xD;
