      This study assesses the effect of sequential radiation and durvalumab immunotherapy given as&#xD;
      treatment prior to surgery with radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this phase II study, patients who are either not eligible or declined to have chemotherapy&#xD;
      prior to surgery for muscle-invasive bladder cancer may consent and enrol to study. Patients&#xD;
      will have single 8 Gy hypofractionated radiation to bladder followed by 3 cycles of&#xD;
      durvalumab immunotherapy prior to radical cystectomy. This study will assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability, pathological and radiological response, and immune biological correlatives to&#xD;
      understand the effect of radiation and durvalumab.&#xD;
