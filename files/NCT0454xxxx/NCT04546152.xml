      This is a prospective, multicenter, observational, open label, two-arm, crossover, PMCF&#xD;
      clinical trial for demonstration of the safety and efficacy of the HA-based dermal fillers&#xD;
      HYAPROF® SOFT and HYAPROF® BALANCE for restoration of the facial volume and contour. Besides&#xD;
      safety aspects, evaluated immediately after the treatment, 4 weeks, 3 and 6 months after the&#xD;
      treatment, the performance of the demal fillers are evaluated in the 3 and 6 months follow-up&#xD;
      by using GAIS and WSRS.&#xD;
