  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this observational registry is to evaluate the safety of the&#xD;
      easyEndoTM Universal Linear Cutting Stapler and reloads from Ezisurg Medical when used to&#xD;
      create anastomoses during standard and robot-assisted laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass&#xD;
      (RYGB) surgery. Stapler performance during surgery as well as post-operative pain and the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy of the procedures will be determined as secondary objectives.&#xD;

    <description>The Modified PADSS guarantees safe discharge. PADSS is based on the assessment of 6 criteria: vital signs (including blood pressure, pulse, temperature and respiratory rate), ambulation, nausea / vomiting, pain, surgical bleeding and fluid intake / output. Each criterion is given a score from 0 to 2. Patients scoring ≥ 9 are considered fit for discharge, provided that the score for vital signs is not lower than 2 and that none of the other five criteria is 0, even if the total score reaches 9.</description>
