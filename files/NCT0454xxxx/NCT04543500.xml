  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deficits in emotional cognitive control are present in a number of clinical psychiatric&#xD;
      populations including depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Deficits in this domain of function&#xD;
      limit one's ability to focus attention on goal directed activities while inhibiting reactions&#xD;
      to irrelevant emotional stimuli, and this contributes to the symptoms of these disorders and&#xD;
      makes individuals less likely to be successful in existing treatments. The left dorsolateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex (LDLPFC) and its connectivity with other regions (i.e., dorsal anterior&#xD;
      cingulate cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, insula, amygdala) is thought to play a&#xD;
      central role in facilitating emotional cognitive control. However, past research has&#xD;
      primarily utilized correlational approaches that limit conclusions about the directionality&#xD;
      of these relationships. Enhancing our understanding of the neural underpinnings of emotional&#xD;
      cognitive control could be valuable for informing treatment for populations with deficits in&#xD;
      these processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study utilizes a neuromodulatory approach called real-time functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) whereby participants observe their own neural&#xD;
      activity in the moment and are taught to self-regulate this activity. Healthy adult&#xD;
      participants will be trained to increase neural activity in LDLPFC while involved in mental&#xD;
      tasks involving emotional cognitive control processes. The mental tasks will include&#xD;
      counting, remembering words, or planning events while viewing negatively-valenced emotional&#xD;
      words (e.g., kill, death, threat). This study will use an experimental approach with&#xD;
      participants being randomized to either LDLPFC rtfMRI-nf or control rtfMRI-nf where&#xD;
      participants receive neural feedback from a region not involved with emotional cognitive&#xD;
      control processes. Resting-state fMRI scans and behavioral testing sessions will take place&#xD;
      before and after rtfMRI-nf.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are to examine the impact of LDLPFC rtfMRI-nf on: (1) LDLPFC activity&#xD;
      during emotional cognitive control and (2) LDLPFC functional connectivity with other brain&#xD;
      regions during rest. Additionally, this study will examine the neural correlates of emotional&#xD;
      cognitive control independent of rtfMRI-nf. Thus, the final specific aim is to (3)&#xD;
      Investigate relationships between individual differences in LDLPFC engagement, cognitive&#xD;
      control performance, trauma history, and sleep quality. To facilitate the relevance of these&#xD;
      findings to clinical populations, trauma exposure and sleep quality will be explored as&#xD;
      moderators of neural change across time for those in the rtfMRI-nf group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To these ends, this study will use rtfMRI-nf to experimentally investigate the relationship&#xD;
      between LDLPFC activity and emotional cognitive control as well as investigate these neural&#xD;
      mechanisms independent of rtfMRI-nf. This research will improve our understanding of&#xD;
      emotional cognitive control and demonstrate whether this is a modifiable target for&#xD;
      intervention in populations with deficits in this domain of function.&#xD;
