    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of Mesenchymal Stromal Cell (MSC)&#xD;
      implantation on pulp and periapical regeneration of immature teeth with pulp necrosis and&#xD;
      chronic apical periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-traumatic pulp necrosis prevents root development in children and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The multipotent ability of MSC to differentiate into bone-forming cells (osteoblasts)&#xD;
           and dentin-forming cells (Odontoblast) has allowed the development of protocols to&#xD;
           induce dental pulp regeneration in preclinical models and patients with immature teeth&#xD;
           with pulpal necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPACT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Worldwide, post-traumatic pulp necrosis in children and adolescents constitutes a health&#xD;
           problem in the endodontic area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment with MSC would provide an effective therapeutic alternative to patients with&#xD;
           pulp necrosis and incomplete root formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The possible pulp and periapical regeneration of immature teeth induced by MSC would&#xD;
           have a huge impact on the treatment of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility for EMC implant study Age: 6 to 16 years Sex: Male or Female Healthy volunteers&#xD;
      accepted: NO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT GROUPS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, the implantation of MSC will be performed in patients with immature&#xD;
      teeth with pulpal necrosis with apical periodontitis, who will receive the appropriate&#xD;
      endodontic treatment (according to the guidelines of the American Association of Endodontics)&#xD;
      and implantation of allogeneic BM-MSC . This group will be compared with the history made in&#xD;
      the Postgraduate Endodontics of the Universidad Central de Venezuela (UCV) and with&#xD;
      international case series made by revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up of each patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical controls (facial evaluation, gingival evaluation, apical palpation, horizontal&#xD;
           and vertical percussion, cold and heat sensitivity tests) will be carried out on days 0,&#xD;
           7, 30, 90, 180 and 364. Additionally, a clinical evaluation will be carried out at the&#xD;
           two years post-implantation of MSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Radiological controls will be carried out on days 0, 7, 30, 90, 180 and 364.&#xD;
           Additionally, they will be carried out two years post-implantation of MSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A tomographic evaluation will be performed when was evident periapical repair in a&#xD;
           periapical radiograph. To measure root formation, root canal narrowing and verification&#xD;
           the periapical repair in 3D.&#xD;

      The endodontic procedure in the patients included in this study will focus on cases of pulp&#xD;
      necrosis with apical periodontitis without evidence of infectious processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS. Reagents Murine monoclonal antibodies, directed against human&#xD;
      differentiation antigens (CD34, CD45, CD14, CD90, CD73, CD29, CD49b, CD166), conjugated to&#xD;
      fluorescein isothiocyanate (CFI) or phycoerythrin (PE) were purchased from BD Biosciences&#xD;
      (USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isolation and culture of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) obtained from human bone marrow. In&#xD;
      the present study, isolated EMFs from bone marrow (BM) from patients with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      post-traumatic nonunion (failure of a bone union at fracture sites) will be used. These cells&#xD;
      were transplanted into the pseudoarthrosis site to induce bone regeneration in these&#xD;
      patients. The protocol for bone regeneration through EMF transplantation was carried out at&#xD;
      the University Hospital of Caracas, Hospital Universitario de Los Andes, Hospital Pérez de&#xD;
      León II and has the approval of the Bioethics Committees of each institution and each patient&#xD;
      through informed consent. In this protocol, the BM of each patient was isolated by a puncture&#xD;
      in the iliac crest. This procedure was performed in the operating room, under anesthesia and&#xD;
      by a medical specialist. The MO aspirate was placed in alpha-MEM medium (Invitrogen, USA)&#xD;
      with heparin (Sanofi Aventis). The mononuclear cells were separated by centrifugation on a&#xD;
      Ficoll-Hypaque gradient (GE Healthcare, Sweden) and cultured in alpha-MEM-Chang medium&#xD;
      (Irvine Scientific, USA) enriched with 20% autologous serum. These cells were kept in culture&#xD;
      in a controlled environment at 37ºC and 5% CO2. After 72 hours, non-adherent cells were&#xD;
      eliminated, and a basal culture medium (alpha-MEM-Chang / 20% autologous serum) was added.&#xD;
      Their adherence to the plastic isolated the MSCs. Culture medium exchanges were made until&#xD;
      reaching a confluence close to 70-80%. The MSCs were expanded by pealing the cultures,&#xD;
      following the process described above. Microbiological examinations were performed after&#xD;
      obtaining the BM and before performing the MSC implantation. After using MSC, a batch of&#xD;
      these cells were cryopreserved at -70 -C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phenotypic characterization of MSC. Phenotypic characterization studies of MSC were carried&#xD;
      out by flow cytometry. For which the MO adherent cells were detached from the culture flask&#xD;
      by using trypsin-like enzymes. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with antibodies&#xD;
      specific for MSC markers (CD90, CD73, CD105, CD29, CD166 and CD49b) and hematopoietic (CD34,&#xD;
      CD45 and CD14). Cytometric analysis of the expression markers showed that 100% of the cells&#xD;
      used for transplantation in each patient were MSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSC differentiation studies. The multipotential differentiation capacity of MSCs was examined&#xD;
      by culturing these cells in osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiation media,&#xD;
      following a methodology similar to that previously described. Briefly, the MSCs were detached&#xD;
      and seeded in 24-well culture plates at a cell density of 5x104 per well, proceeding to add&#xD;
      the corresponding differentiation medium. For osteogenic differentiation, MSCs were cultured&#xD;
      in the presence of basal medium enriched with dexamethasone (100nM, Biotech), ascorbic acid&#xD;
      (10mM, Sigma), inorganic phosphate (1.8mM, Merck) and beta-glycerol phosphate (2mM, Sigma).&#xD;
      For chondrogenic differentiation, cells were cultured in a commercial medium for chondrocytes&#xD;
      (Cell Application, USA) and for differentiation towards the adipogenic lineage the commercial&#xD;
      medium NH Adipodiff Human (Miltenyi, USA) was used. In all cases, the cells were kept in&#xD;
      culture for 21-28 days with medium changes every 4-5 days. To demonstrate the changes&#xD;
      associated with the differentiation process, the cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde&#xD;
      (Merck, USA) and specific stains were performed for each case. Briefly, alizarin red to&#xD;
      detect calcium deposition (evidence of osteogenesis), Alcian blue to detect proteoglycans&#xD;
      (evidence of chondrogenesis), and oil red (Oil Red) to see lipids (evidence of adipogenesis).&#xD;
      In all cases, microscopic observation and photographic registration were carried out. For&#xD;
      endothelial differentiation (CEn), EMFs were cultured in MCDB 131 medium (Invitrogen, USA)&#xD;
      enriched with 10% autologous serum, 10µg / ml of human epidermal growth factor (hu-EGF, R&amp;D)&#xD;
      and hydrocortisone (1µg / ml, Sigma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSC implantation in patients with pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis. All MSC processing&#xD;
      procedures will be carried out in the cleanroom of the IVIC Cell Therapy Unit following the&#xD;
      standards of good manufacturing practice (GMP). Allogeneic BM-MSC from patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with post-traumatic nonunion and treated with implantation of these cells will be used to&#xD;
      induce bone regeneration. The MSC to be used in this protocol have previously been&#xD;
      phenotypically and functionally characterized. The MSC will be thawed, grown and expanded as&#xD;
      previously described. A part of the cells will be kept in a medium for MSCs, and another part&#xD;
      will be cultured in endothelial differentiation medium (CEM-Endo). Once the required number&#xD;
      of MSCs and MSCs-Endo have been reached, a suspension of these cells (75,000 cells from each&#xD;
      of them) will be placed in sterile culture tubes containing DMEM-F12 culture medium, without&#xD;
      phenol red, supplemented with 20% autologous serum. Each tube containing MSC / MSC-Endo will&#xD;
      be transported in a small biological sample transport cellar, at room temperature, to the&#xD;
      Dentistry Service of the Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Científicas (IVIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under sterile conditions, the patient will be locally anesthetized in the affected tooth&#xD;
      area; the root canal of the affected tooth will be exposed and prepared to perform the MSC /&#xD;
      MSC-Endo / PRP implant. At the same time, the culture medium supernatant is removed from each&#xD;
      tube and the CEM / CEM-Endo &quot;button (pellet)&quot; is resuspended in autologous platelet-rich&#xD;
      plasma (PRP). Subsequently to the MSC / Endo / PRP suspension, 5% CaCl2 and thrombin will be&#xD;
      added. Immediately, and before the clot forms, 20 microliters of the CEM / CEM-Endo / PRP&#xD;
      suspension will be placed in the root canal, covered with a collagen membrane. Subsequently,&#xD;
      the obturation procedure with bioceramics will be carried out at the level of the pulp&#xD;
      chamber, ionomeric glass to protect the bioceramic and later composite resin to restore the&#xD;
      tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-implantation clinical evaluation of EMF&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical controls (facial evaluation, gingival evaluation, apical palpation, horizontal&#xD;
           and vertical percussion, cold and heat sensitivity tests) will be carried out on days 0,&#xD;
           7, 30, 90, 180 and 364. Additionally, a clinical evaluation will be carried out at the&#xD;
           two years post-implantation of EMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Radiological controls will be carried out on days 0, 7, 30, 90, 180 and 364.&#xD;
           Additionally, they will be carried out two years post-implantation of mesenchymal&#xD;
           stromal cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A tomographic evaluation will be performed when the periapical repair will be evident in&#xD;
           a periapical radiograph.&#xD;
