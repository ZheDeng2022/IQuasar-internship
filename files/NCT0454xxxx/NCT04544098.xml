  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at whether it is practical and safe to give Lutathera directly into an&#xD;
      artery of the liver (hepatic intraarterial infusion). The researchers will compare the&#xD;
      effects of hepatic intraarterial infusion in the liver with the effects of the standard&#xD;
      approach (intravenous infusion in the arm). The researchers will also determine whether&#xD;
      Lutathera is effective against participants' cancer.&#xD;
