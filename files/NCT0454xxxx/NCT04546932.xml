      This was a double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial. 62 patients were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive either lung-protective ventilation (LPV) with a tidal volume (Vt) of 7&#xD;
      ml/kg ideal body weight (IBW), 10 cmH2O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) combined with&#xD;
      regular recruitment maneuvers or conventional ventilation (CV) with a Vt of 10 ml/kg IBW, 0&#xD;
      cmH2O in PEEP and no recruitment maneuvers. The primary endpoints were the intraoperative&#xD;
      fluctuation of Cdyn and Cstat, the intra- and postoperative changes in pulmonary oxygenation&#xD;
      function including OI, A-aO2. The secondary endpoints were the alteration on chest x-ray,&#xD;
      modified Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (mCPIS), and the incidence of PPCs on the first&#xD;
      postoperative day&#xD;

      Study population. We performed a randomized, double-blind controlled trial at Vietnam&#xD;
      National Cancer Hospital from January 2020 to July 2020. The trial protocol was approved by&#xD;
      the medical ethics committee of Vietnam Military Medical University and Vietnam National&#xD;
      Cancer Hospital, simultaneously written informed consent was obtained from all patients&#xD;
      before inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding technique. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either&#xD;
      lung-protective ventilation (LPV group) or conventional ventilation (CV group) at a ratio of&#xD;
      1:1. The randomization was performed using the R program with the &quot;runif&quot;, &quot;as.integer&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;int&quot; and &quot;replace&quot; functions. As a result, a list of random numbers was created in each&#xD;
      group. The patients were numbered according to their orders of hospital registration and then&#xD;
      were allocated into the group of their numbers. The intervention protocol was stored in&#xD;
      sealed, opaque numbered envelopes. An anesthesiologist who did not involve in the study set&#xD;
      the ventilator in accordance with the protocol in the envelopes. Another anesthetist who was&#xD;
      in charge of the patient collected data during surgery. The surgeons taking part in the&#xD;
      procedures and patients were not informed of the ventilator setting. Physicians in&#xD;
      post-anesthesia care unit who were not responsible for intraoperative care carried out the&#xD;
      postoperative evaluation. The analysis of the postoperative chest X-ray was completed by a&#xD;
      radiologist who was not involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard procedure. All patients fasted for 12 hours before the procedure but still consumed&#xD;
      clear water until 2 hours prior to surgery in order to avoid preoperative dehydration.&#xD;
      Participants were premedicated with intravenous midazolam 1-2 mg 30 minutes before the&#xD;
      surgery. In the operating room, a radical arterial cannula was inserted to monitor invasive&#xD;
      blood pressure, collect blood gas sample, and measure the pulse pressure variation (PPV)&#xD;
      index to guide intraoperative fluid therapy. The ASA standards for monitoring such as pulse&#xD;
      oximeter, capnography, electrocardiography, thermometer were applied prior to the insertion&#xD;
      of an epidural catheter at level T7-T12 for postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients received intravenous fentanyl 2 µg/kg, lidocaine 40 mg, propofol 2 mg/kg, and&#xD;
      rocuronium 1 mg/kg for the induction. Intubation was performed 90 seconds after the&#xD;
      administration of muscle relaxant and then 8 mg dexamethasone was injected. Anesthesia was&#xD;
      maintained using sevoflurane of which the concentration was justified to achieve the&#xD;
      end-tidal concentration within the range of 1,4-1,8 in oxygen and the PRST score less than 3.&#xD;
      If the PRST score was greater than 3, then an additional bolus dose of 20-30 mg propofol and&#xD;
      25-50 µg fentanyl was injected along with increasing sevoflurane concentration. On the&#xD;
      contrary, if signs of deep anesthesia were presented (PRST score=0, blood pressure decreased&#xD;
      by more than 20% of the baseline values, bradycardia), then the sevoflurane concentration was&#xD;
      cut down and 100 ml of crystalloid solution was rapidly infused within 2 minutes. A bolus&#xD;
      dose of 100-200 µg phenylephrine was added if the blood pressure was still less than 20% of&#xD;
      the baseline value in spite of these above-mentioned steps. Rocuronium was continuously&#xD;
      infused at the rate of 10 µg/kg/min. The solution of bupivacaine 0,1% combined with fentanyl&#xD;
      2 µg/ml was infused via the epidural catheter at the rate of 5 ml/hour after a loading dose&#xD;
      of 5 ml prior to skin incision. Normothermia was maintained during surgery. The&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum was implemented by CO2 insufflation at a pressure of 12 mmHg with room&#xD;
      temperature in all patients. The intraoperative fluid was managed based on the goal-directed&#xD;
      fluid therapy with a crystalloid solution. In brief, no additional fluids were provided if&#xD;
      PPV was lower than 10%, otherwise, additional boluses of 250 ml ringer lactate solution were&#xD;
      given over 10-15 minutes. After each bolus dose, PPV was re-assessed and further bolus was&#xD;
      administered until reaching a PPV of lower than 10 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous 8 mg ondansetron was injected 30 minutes before the end of surgery to prevent&#xD;
      postoperative nausea and vomiting. Rocuronium infusion was stopped 30 minutes before&#xD;
      abdominal closure. The neuromuscular blockade was reversed in the postoperative care unit&#xD;
      using intravenous neostigmine 40-60 µg/kg combined with atropine 0,5 mg. Patients were&#xD;
      extubated when they met the extubation criteria (spontaneous tidal volume &gt; 6 ml/kg and&#xD;
      respiratory rate = 12-20 breath/minute, SpO2&gt;95%, normocarbia, body temperature &gt; 350C,&#xD;
      positive gag reflexes and ability to follow a verbal command, hemodynamic stability without&#xD;
      vasopressor support and ability to lift their heads and hold for 30 seconds [23]).&#xD;
      Postoperative epidural analgesia for 48 hours was executed using bupivacaine 0,1% combined&#xD;
      with fentanyl 2 µg/ml at a speed of infusion 5-10 ml/hour to maintain a visual analogue scale&#xD;
      (VAS) score &lt; 3. If the score was greater than 3, then a bolus dose 5 ml of the anesthetic&#xD;
      solution was provided along with an increase in the speed of infusion. After extubation,&#xD;
      patients were oxygenated via nasal cannula 3-5 ml/minute (1 ml/minute raises the FiO2 by 3%)&#xD;
      to keep the SpO2&gt;95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventilation protocol. Mechanical ventilation protocol was performed on the anesthesia machine&#xD;
      GE healthcare carestation 620. The patient's ideal body weight was predefined according to&#xD;
      formula: 45.5 + 0.91×[height(cm)-152.4] for women or 50 + 0.91×[height(cm)-152.4] for men. In&#xD;
      both groups, the mechanical ventilation was set up at the volume-controlled mode, inspiration&#xD;
      to expiration ratio of 1:2. After being lifted to 100% in the induction period, FiO2 was&#xD;
      maintained at the level of 40% until extubation. Respiratory rate (starting with 18&#xD;
      breaths/minute) was justified to keep the end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) in the normal&#xD;
      range of 35-40 mmHg. In the CV group, the tidal volume was set at 10 ml/kg IBW without PEEP&#xD;
      and RM. In contrast, in the LPV group, patients were provided with a tidal volume of 7 ml/kg&#xD;
      IBW and an intraoperative 10 cmH2O in PEEP. Simultaneously, in the LPV group, alveoli were&#xD;
      recruited applying a stepwise increase in PEEP (from 4 to 10 cmH2O for 3 breaths, 10 to 15&#xD;
      cmH2O for 3 breaths, and 15 to 20 cmH2O for 10 breaths) with maximum PIP = 50 cmH2O [24]. The&#xD;
      recruitment maneuvers were performed right after intubation, 30 minutes after CO2&#xD;
      insufflation, then every hour, and finally before extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data source and collection. The demographic characteristics including age, gender, height,&#xD;
      weight, BMI, ASA physical status and history of coexisting diseases, and smoking were&#xD;
      recorded. Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, SpO2, EtCO2, core temperature) were also&#xD;
      recorded at 15 minutes intervals throughout the surgery. The volume of intravenous infusion&#xD;
      (crystalloid, colloid solution), blood loss, urine output, total dose of anesthetics,&#xD;
      fentanyl, and muscle relaxant were recorded as well. The dynamic compliance (Cdyn) was&#xD;
      measured directly on the ventilator, while the static compliance (Cstat) was calculated in&#xD;
      accordance with the pre-defined formula as Vt/(plateau pressure of the respiratory system -&#xD;
      PEEP) with the plateau pressure measured during the normal ventilation setting using an&#xD;
      inspiratory pause at 10% of the inspiratory time. Both types of pulmonary compliance were&#xD;
      recorded at H0 (after intubation), H1 (30 minutes after pneumoperitoneum), H2 (1 hour after&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum), H3 (2 hours after pneumoperitoneum), Hkt (10 minutes after&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum stopped) and Hro (before extubation). Arterial blood samples were withdrawn&#xD;
      from the radical arterial cannula for blood gas analysis before induction, 1 hour after&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum, and day 1 after operation. The pulmonary oxygenation index (OI) and the&#xD;
      alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (A-aO2) was calculated respectively as OI= PaO2/FiO2 and&#xD;
      A-aO2= (PB-PH2O)×FiO2 -PaCO2/R - PaO2 where PB (atmospheric pressure) was 760 mmHg, PH2O&#xD;
      (saturated vapor pressure at room temperature) was 47 mmHg, and the R (respiration quotient)&#xD;
      was 0.8. SpO2 in the first postoperative day was measured in the room air (the nasal oxygen&#xD;
      catheter was removed for 10 min) with the patient in bed. If SpO2 dropped to lower than 90%,&#xD;
      the measurement was stopped and the supplemental oxygen was immediately re-provided via the&#xD;
      nasal cannula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre- and postoperative (day 1) chest radiography was obtained at the bedside and was analyzed&#xD;
      in a blinded way by a radiologist who did not get involved in the study. Pathological chest&#xD;
      X-ray was defined as the presence of at least one of the following: an increase in thickness&#xD;
      of the interstitium, atelectasis, pleural effusion, localized or diffused infiltrates, and&#xD;
      other chest radiological alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (mCPIS). The modified original version of the&#xD;
      Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score described by pelosi et al. (2008) was applied in the first&#xD;
      postoperative day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs). PPCs were defined by the European&#xD;
      Perioperative Clinical Outcome (EPCO) definitions .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary endpoints. Our hypothesis was that the intraoperative lung-protective&#xD;
      ventilation strategy could improve the pulmonary mechanics, oxygenation function, and&#xD;
      ameliorate early postoperative pulmonary complications. The primary endpoints were the&#xD;
      intraoperative fluctuation of Cdyn and Cstat, the intra- and postoperative changes in&#xD;
      pulmonary oxygenation function including OI, A-aO2. The secondary endpoints were the&#xD;
      alteration on chest x-ray, mCPIS, and the incidence of PPCs on the first postoperative day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. The sample size was calculated in accordance with the formula: n=&#xD;
      (2×C)/δ2 +1 with δ=|µ1-µ2|/σ, where n is the sample size in each group, µ1= mean of OI in the&#xD;
      LPV group, µ2 = mean of OI in the CV group, σ is the common standard deviation and c = 7.9&#xD;
      for 80% power. Based on the study of Xin Pi (2015) whose primary outcome was the OI after 2&#xD;
      hours of ventilation in the two groups was 382.21 ± 88.03 µg and 450.10 ± 70.29 µg&#xD;
      respectively. Replacing µ1=382.21, µ2=450,10, σ=88,03 in the formula, n was equal to 27,5 for&#xD;
      each group, which represented that the minimum sample size for each group was at least 28&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was completed using SPSS software version 20.0 (IBM, USA) on an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat basis. Whether variables distributed normally was tested with the&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk test. Continuous variables were compared applying either&#xD;
      Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test, depending on the characteristics of the&#xD;
      distribution of the variable, and consequently were presented as mean ± SD or median and&#xD;
      interquartile range (25-75%) as appropriate. As for categorical variables, the χ2 test was&#xD;
      employed for comparison and the Fisher exact test was used for small frequencies. All the&#xD;
      tests were two-tailed, and statistical significance was accepted at p&lt;0,05.&#xD;
