      This study will assess safety and feasibility of infusing genetically modified autologous T&#xD;
      cells transduced to express a chimeric antigen receptor targeting the B cell surface antigen&#xD;
      Cluster of Differentiation 19 (CD19)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, pilot, phase 1 study to determine the safety profile of anti-CD19&#xD;
      CAR-T cell infusion in participants with R/R B-cell NHL. The dose-finding cohorts in this&#xD;
      study will evaluate and define the safe dose of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells. Using a &quot;3+3&quot; design,&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled sequentially to each dose level. A dose expansion will then&#xD;
      occur at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose levels that have not exceeded the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 36 participants will be enrolled and treated. Each subject will provide consent and be&#xD;
      evaluated for study eligibility. Eligible subjects will undergo apheresis with collection of&#xD;
      autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells that will be used to generate CAR-T cells. The&#xD;
      CAR T cells will be produced using the Miltenyi Prodigy and an FDA compliant Lentigen CD19&#xD;
      targeted lentiviral vector. After successful generation of the anti-CD19 CAR-T cells (drug&#xD;
      product (DP)), subjects will undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy with fludarabine and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide followed by 2-5 days of rest. A single infusion of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells at&#xD;
      the starting dose of 5 x 105 cells/kg will be given on Day=0. Following treatment with DP,&#xD;
      subjects will be followed on this study for 12 months for safety, disease status, and&#xD;
      survival. For long term follow-up, participants will be followed for 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants whose dose does not meet the target dose, enrollment into a conforming&#xD;
      product low-dose cohort, at minimum dose level - 1 and that has not exceeded the MTD will&#xD;
      occur. This conforming product low-dose cohort will be evaluated for toxicity and efficacy of&#xD;
      those lower dose levels as part of the primary safety and secondary objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants whose CAR-T product does not meet the pre-specified release criteria,&#xD;
      enrollment into a non-conforming product cohort, at a minimum dose level - 1 and that has not&#xD;
      exceeded the MTD will occur. This non-conforming product cohort will be evaluated for&#xD;
      toxicity and efficacy of the non-conforming product cohort as part of the exploratory&#xD;
      objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the safety of administering chimeric antigen receptor T cells targeting&#xD;
           CD-19 to patients with relapsed or refractory CD19+ B-cell nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for this cellular therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the safety and toxicity of cell collection and infusion of CAR-T cells&#xD;
           targeting CD19 in patients with relapsed or refractory CD19+ B cell NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor T cells targeting CD-19 in&#xD;
           patients with relapsed or refractory CD19+ B cell NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the feasibility of CD19 CAR T cell manufacturing for patients with relapsed&#xD;
           or refractory CD19+ B cell NHL of local manufacturing and ability to produce adequate&#xD;
           quantities of vector positive T-cells&#xD;
