    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial aimed to determine the subacute blood pressure effects of&#xD;
      pharmacologically-treated elderly hypertensive patients after a single session of water&#xD;
      aerobic exercise.&#xD;

      A randomized clinical trial with a crossover design was conducted at an aquatic center and an&#xD;
      exercise physiology laboratory. All subjects read and signed an informed consent form before&#xD;
      participating in the study. Additionally, this study follows the recommendations as proposed&#xD;
      by the CONSORT Statement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimum sample size was determined based on a previous study conducted by our research&#xD;
      group. We estimated a sample size of 24 individuals for a 5% significance level, power of&#xD;
      95%, and a 10 mmHg difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP). The inclusion criteria were&#xD;
      age between 65 and 85 years; practice exercise (almost 3 days-week); use of anti-hypertensive&#xD;
      drugs; systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≤160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≤100 mmHg&#xD;
      documented by a physician. The exclusion criteria were body mass index (BMI) &gt;35 kg/m2;&#xD;
      decompensated diabetes mellitus and/or cardiac failure; active smoker; any febrile condition&#xD;
      and/or infectious diseases; cardiovascular event in the 3 months preceding the study;&#xD;
      hepatopathy; physical or mental limitations that prevent exercising.Participants were&#xD;
      recruited using local media advertisement. The potential participants were asked to attend an&#xD;
      on-site visit before the experiment. In this visit, the study procedures were explained and&#xD;
      they those who agreed to participate signed an informed consent form. Then, they were&#xD;
      interviewed using a questionnaire and information on medical history and symptoms among&#xD;
      others was collected, and in sequence they underwent physical and medical evaluations with&#xD;
      measurements (weight, height, BMI, BP).The included participants were then assigned to either&#xD;
      the experimental protocol (EP) or the control protocol (CP) with 48 hours between sessions.&#xD;
      Randomization was performed by digital system (www.randomization.org) at a 1:1 allocation&#xD;
      ratio and participants were assigned to either exercise or control session. All sessions&#xD;
      occurred at the same time (10 to 11 am) with 2 days between sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EP consisted of one water aerobic exercise session carried out at the aquatic center in a&#xD;
      1.4 m-deep swimming pool with water at an average temperature of 28.5°C, with a average air&#xD;
      temperature of 30°C. The EP was a continuous session of dynamic water aerobic exercise which&#xD;
      consisted of a dynamic warm-up period (5 minutes), an active exercise period at the&#xD;
      established intensity of HR (35 minutes), and a cooldown period (5 minutes) to total 45&#xD;
      minutes. Heart rate (HR) was continuously measured with heart monitors (Polar, RS 800 CX®,&#xD;
      USA) to confirm the intensity of the exercise. The EP intensity was calculated according to&#xD;
      the formula proposed by Kruel et al. (2014) [27] for exercise in an aquatic. Besides, we used&#xD;
      the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale to measure exercise intensity level in those&#xD;
      participants on β-blockers, exercising around number 13 of the scale during active exercise.&#xD;
      Water aerobic exercises included flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction of upper and&#xD;
      lower limbs. It was a continuous session with no rest between.The CP was a 45-min session of&#xD;
      no exercise. It was also held at the aquatic center in environment conditions similar to&#xD;
      those of the exercise session. During this session, the participants remained seated or&#xD;
      standing as desired, and were allowed to read, talk and drink water, but did nothing else.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure was measured with the patient seated using an internationally validated&#xD;
      semi-automatic BP monitor (Omron 705-CP, Matsusaka, Japan) following techniques adopted by&#xD;
      The Seventh Report [1]. BP was measured before the session (Pre); immediately after (Min-0)&#xD;
      and every 10 minutes until 60 minutes after the protocols had been performed (Min-10, Min-20,&#xD;
      Min-30, Min-40, Min-50 and Min-60). The measurements were repeated at 2-minute intervals and&#xD;
      the calculation of the mean of the two measurements.&#xD;
