  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Globally, neonatal mortality remains unacceptably high, with little change in the death rate&#xD;
      in the first 28 days of life since 1990, despite reductions in under-5 mortality of up to 50%&#xD;
      over the same period. In 2014, neonatal deaths accounted for 44% of all deaths in children&#xD;
      under 5 with neonatal infection accounting for over a third of all deaths. Group B&#xD;
      Streptococcus (GBS) is a major cause of septicemia and meningitis in infants globally and a&#xD;
      cause of severe adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in up to 50% of meningitis survivors. It&#xD;
      can also lead to sepsis in pregnant women. GBS acquisition occurs through vertical&#xD;
      transmission in 15%-50% of infants born to a vaginally/rectally colonized mother. Maternal&#xD;
      colonization is a prerequisite for early onset (EO) and a risk factor for late onset (LO)&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our proposal will provide these critical data in Uganda (a country with high neonatal disease&#xD;
      burden) in a 12 month pilot study to determine: the burden of GBS disease in a cohort of&#xD;
      mother/infant pairs and establish an active surveillance platform for monitoring of early and&#xD;
      late onset neonatal infection in term and preterm infants in Uganda and compare this to the&#xD;
      burden known for other African countries. This provides essential data on GBS disease&#xD;
      outcomes from a high-HIV burden African cohort reflecting the usual standard of care in a low&#xD;
      income, highly deprived urban environment. This pilot study will establish minimum disease&#xD;
      estimates in the Ugandan cohort to determine the feasibility of a cohort study over three&#xD;
      years to determine the level of antibody against GBS in cord blood from pregnancies where&#xD;
      women are GBS colonized and non-colonized but whose infants do not develop GBS disease in the&#xD;
      first three months of life and compare this to the level in the blood of infants who develop&#xD;
      GBS disease. We will compare these results with those from other African countries such as&#xD;
      South Africa to enable a robust estimate of potential sero-correlates of protection from&#xD;
      natural infection against the most common GBS-disease-causing serotypes.&#xD;
