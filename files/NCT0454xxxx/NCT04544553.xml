      Brief Summary: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of visual impairment and has&#xD;
      major public health implications globally and especially in countries such as India where the&#xD;
      prevalence of diabetes is high. With timely screening and intervention, the disease&#xD;
      progression to blindness can be prevented but several barriers exist to the provision of&#xD;
      care. The long term aim is to identify the barriers to DR screening and to plan potential&#xD;
      interventional strategies. From the qualitative study, the reasons such as lack of awareness&#xD;
      or knowledge, distance to travel, lack of reminder system were identified as a reason for&#xD;
      poor follow-up. This lead to the development of interventional strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a randomized, investigator-masked clinical trial that was conducted in a tertiary&#xD;
      eye care centre in South India. Consecutive patients with diabetes who were residents in&#xD;
      Chennai and its vicinity of approximately 100 km radius and who were undergoing repeated&#xD;
      intravitreal injections for DME were recruited into the trial. The aim of the study is to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of SMS informational reminders among patients with Diabetic macular&#xD;
      edema for the follow-up. They study consists of 2 groups, SMS reminder group receives the&#xD;
      reminders 1 week and 2 days prior to the scheduled appointments with the concerned doctor on&#xD;
      a particular date and time, whereas other group does not receive any reminders for the&#xD;
      appointment schedule. After the follow-up, the patients will be screened for the attendance&#xD;
      at the review visit.&#xD;
