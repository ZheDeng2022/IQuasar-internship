  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many individuals with osteoarthritis (OA) (up to 45%) are referred to an orthopaedic surgeon&#xD;
      for a joint replacement prematurely or will not be candidates for surgery. These individuals&#xD;
      need appropriate (non-operative) care to help reduce their pain and enhance their mobility.&#xD;
      We are studying the use of innovative technology to help physicians give physical activity&#xD;
      advice for patients to become more active and provide free online resources to help patients&#xD;
      understand OA self-management and exercise, especially when they have barriers to accessing&#xD;
      formal care. Individuals with OA that are referred to a specialized clinic will receive one&#xD;
      of three interventions: usual care (handout on resources), a physical activity prescription&#xD;
      by a doctor, or the prescription and a link to a free web-based platform (website) on&#xD;
      non-operative management of OA with patient education and exercise videos. Our goal is to&#xD;
      help with non-operative management strategies to improve quality of life, reduce pain,&#xD;
      improve mobility, and possibly delay or prevent a joint replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis is a condition where people feel joint pain or stiffness. Joints are the body&#xD;
      parts where two bones join together with softer material (cartilage) between them. In&#xD;
      osteoarthritis, this cartilage wears down. It is the biggest cause for disability worldwide.&#xD;
      Helping people with osteoarthritis starts with education, physical activity, and&#xD;
      physiotherapy. Doctors can also prescribe braces, injections or medications. For severe&#xD;
      osteoarthritis when nothing else helps, surgery can be done to replace the joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doctors often refer patients for surgery too soon. Skipping steps of care may mean&#xD;
      unnecessary surgery and longer wait times. The Musculoskeletal Rapid Access Clinic (now&#xD;
      called Clinic) in London was set up to solve these problems. They screen patients before&#xD;
      referring them to a surgeon, and do not refer almost half of patients. Our goal is to support&#xD;
      these patients with new ways to make their non-surgical treatment better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first way is through physical activity 'prescription'. It works well for other chronic&#xD;
      conditions and patients say it helps. We don't know how well it works for people with&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. Most doctors have little time, training or experience for prescribing&#xD;
      physical activity. Technology can make it easier for doctors and patients. We have designed a&#xD;
      tool to help doctors prescribe physical activity and a smartphone app to track patient&#xD;
      activity. We have also created a free website. This includes patient education, exercise&#xD;
      videos, and virtual physiotherapy. This can be important for individuals who can't access&#xD;
      in-person care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide and affects more than 4.4&#xD;
      million Canadians. Current evidence-based guidelines for OA management recommend weight&#xD;
      management, patient education, physical activity, physiotherapy (PT), bracing,&#xD;
      viscosupplementation, and anti-inflammatory/pain medications prior to joint replacement&#xD;
      surgery. Unfortunately, current practice trends are not consistent with these guidelines, as&#xD;
      nearly half of patients with OA referred to orthopedic surgeons do not require total joint&#xD;
      arthroplasty (TJA) at the time of initial consultation. Through the Southwest Musculoskeletal&#xD;
      Rapid Access Clinic (RAC), approximately ten referrals (20%) are rejected each day due to OA&#xD;
      criteria not met, and a further 20% are assessed as non-operative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to identify individuals with 'mild to moderate' OA and optimize their first-line&#xD;
      non-operative management, starting with physical activity and education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity prescriptions are effective in increasing patient levels of physical&#xD;
      activity, and 93% of patients surveyed want advice on physical activity from their&#xD;
      physicians; but it is underused.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians cite lack of time and inadequate training as barriers. Electronic screening of&#xD;
      physical activity behaviours can save time for physicians, and the use of digital health&#xD;
      tools can improve physical activity levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient education and physiotherapist-led group exercise therapy programs have shown to delay&#xD;
      progression of knee OA symptoms and improve pain and function; however, two of the most&#xD;
      significant barriers to accessing exercise programming is the cost (~approximate $425-475 per&#xD;
      6-8-week session) and accessibility to attend the exercise session (proximity to facility,&#xD;
      remote/rural communities, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Need for a Solution that targets both Providers and Patients Screening for baseline&#xD;
      physical activity levels and including educational components significantly increase&#xD;
      intervention effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have previously tested the feasibility of implementing an e-health tool to support&#xD;
      physical activity counselling by physicians during patients' periodic health review. We will&#xD;
      adapt and implement this tool, Physical Activity and App Prescription (PARx) to screen and&#xD;
      provide tailored resources for physical activity in the setting of OA. We will use tablet&#xD;
      computers and email, directly linked with the electronic medical record (EMR), to engage&#xD;
      patients in contemplating their own physical activity levels, start conversations with their&#xD;
      healthcare providers (in this case, primary care physicians with additional training in sport&#xD;
      and exercise medicine), and support customized, patient-centered health care. After patients&#xD;
      enter their information, they will receive evidence-based behavioural change supports to help&#xD;
      them meet their goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The automated algorithm assesses current activity level, risk factors/comorbidities and&#xD;
      readiness for change. Based on the answers provided, patients are risk-stratified and&#xD;
      tailored resources will be provided to the patient and to their clinician in the form of&#xD;
      decision support tools embedded in the EMR. This will include the novel implementation of an&#xD;
      exercise tracking platform via the smartphone app (myrecovery.ai).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The web-based platform Joint Management (JM) is a free, readily accessible evidenced-based&#xD;
      resource focusing on non-operative management strategies for mild to moderate hip and knee&#xD;
      OA. The platform will include exercise programming (videos, pictures, and descriptions of the&#xD;
      exercises) and patient education (benefits of exercise, lifestyle modifications, nutrition,&#xD;
      injections, etc.), to assist the patient engage in self-management. JM will also include the&#xD;
      option for (paid) virtual access to PTs, who can provide individualized support,&#xD;
      recommendations and exercise programming via the platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creating customized physical activity plans with automated reminders and other supports&#xD;
      addresses the problem of self-efficacy in providers by developing an evidence-based automated&#xD;
      method, while also addressing the issue of patient adherence by using tailored behaviour&#xD;
      change techniques, through assessing readiness for change, and helping patients create new&#xD;
      habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The motivation for JM is to create a free, online evidence-based OA education and exercise&#xD;
      programming resource for those that are not able to afford or access community-based exercise&#xD;
      programs. The virtual PT option will help optimize patient's experience with the web-based&#xD;
      platform, offering support and personalized recommendations regarding management of their&#xD;
      condition and exercise programming tailored to their specific abilities, preferences, and&#xD;
      needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why this is Innovative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evidence for using patient-reported measures and functional outcomes to guide quality&#xD;
      improvement for personalized OA care in a systematic manner is in an early stage, meaning&#xD;
      that this project can not only impact healthcare delivery and translate new knowledge into&#xD;
      medical practice but help position Western University as a leader in this area. The novel&#xD;
      technologies (PARx and JM) are innovative tools informed by patient priorities and&#xD;
      co-designed with our patient partners, specifically geared towards 1) developing new and more&#xD;
      personalized treatment approaches, 2) developing more effective self-management tools, and 3)&#xD;
      reducing disparities in vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations. To this end, we will share&#xD;
      our findings broadly with our patient partners and reach out to these harder-to-reach groups&#xD;
      in particular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED OUTCOMES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health Outcomes: We expect to increase patients' physical activity and improve outcomes for&#xD;
      individuals with mild to moderate OA. We aim to optimize non-operative management of OA&#xD;
      symptoms and therefore possibly delay and/or prevent the need for TJA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Academic Outcomes: We expect to develop a model of physical activity prescription and patient&#xD;
      education that can be scaled up for implementation in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Societal Outcomes: Both novel technologies have the potential to be implemented across&#xD;
      Canada, targeting modifying disease progression and, ideally, delaying or preventing TJA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovative Technology 1: Physical Activity (PA) and App Prescription (Rx) (PARx) Physical&#xD;
      Activity and App Prescription (PARx): Tablet/email software (REDCap) is used to collect&#xD;
      physical activity data from patient input and prompt intervention by providers. The automated&#xD;
      algorithm assesses current activity level, risk factors/comorbidities and readiness for&#xD;
      change. Based upon their answers, patients will be risk-stratified and tailored resources&#xD;
      will be provided to them in the form of a personalized prescription and free smartphone app&#xD;
      (myrecovery.ai) to track activity levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovative Technology 2: Joint Management (JM) Joint Management (JM): This is a free online&#xD;
      evidence-based OA education and exercise programming resource for those that are not able to&#xD;
      afford or access community-based exercise programs, with a virtual physiotherapy (PT) option&#xD;
      to offer support and personalized recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the proposed study is to 1) determine if PARx and JM will improve pain,&#xD;
      increase physical activity levels, and improve functional outcomes in patients with mild to&#xD;
      moderate hip or knee OA&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does the use of novel technology (PARx) affect patient reported outcomes in individuals&#xD;
           with mild to moderate hip or knee OA?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does PARx influence activity levels in individuals with mild to moderate hip or knee OA?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does the use of novel technology (PARx and JM) affect patient reported and functional&#xD;
           outcomes in individuals with mild to moderate hip or knee OA?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What are the experiences and perceptions of patients and physicians during this process?&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measure and compare A1) patient reported outcomes (pain, joint stiffness, disability, quality&#xD;
      of life, disease knowledge, self-efficacy, depression, and fatigue), A2) physical activity&#xD;
      levels, and A3) functional outcomes with those that have access (PARx and JM) and those that&#xD;
      do not have access (usual care) to the technology. Determine A4) participant and physician&#xD;
      experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that access to technology-facilitated physical activity prescription (PARx)&#xD;
      and access to the web-based platform (JM) will H1) improve patient reported outcomes (pain,&#xD;
      joint stiffness, disability, quality of life, disease knowledge, self-efficacy, depression,&#xD;
      and fatigue), H2) increase PA levels, and H3) improve functional outcomes in individuals with&#xD;
      mild to moderate hip or knee OA compared to usual care. We hypothesize that access to JM will&#xD;
      result in a greater improvement than PARx alone.&#xD;
