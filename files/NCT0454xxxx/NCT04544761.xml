    <textblock>
      This study aims to quantify resilience in survivors of a spinal cord injury. The study will&#xD;
      consist of structured interviews and self-reported surveys. We will look for common themes&#xD;
      between participants at different stages of injury (1-5 years, 5-15 years, &gt;15 Years).&#xD;

      The goal of this project is to broaden the understanding of the lived experience of aging&#xD;
      with a disability, from the perspectives of individuals with physical disabilities resulting&#xD;
      from spinal cord injury (SCI). The specific objectives of this project are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Learn how people with SCI attain and maintain optimal quality of life as they age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Understand how people with SCI develop resilience as they grow older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Understand how individual quality of life is related to the degree and mechanism of&#xD;
           resilience among people with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Learn which resources and practices have been most helpful and useful to people with SCI&#xD;
           as they age with their disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assess personal, behavioral, and environmental factors that contribute to resilience and&#xD;
           quality of life among people aging with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Refine and confirm a holistic model for the relationships among the concepts of&#xD;
           resilience, quality of life, and person-centered factors (resources, behaviors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through in-depth interviews and detailed surveys, we will explore how people with SCI attain&#xD;
      and maintain optimal quality of life as they age, and how their quality of life relates to&#xD;
      resiliency as they traverse the path of aging with SCI. We will explore with participants the&#xD;
      resources and practices that have been most helpful and useful to them as they age with their&#xD;
      disability.&#xD;
