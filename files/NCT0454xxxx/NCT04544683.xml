      Study Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is intended to monitor outcomes for 1 year following cervical TFESI. Based on&#xD;
      current clinic volume and enrollment rates into a current study of cervical epidural&#xD;
      injections that is nearing completion, we conservatively estimate a study enrollment period&#xD;
      of 18 months and a total period of 2.5 years from enrollment to final follow-up data&#xD;
      collection. If the study were to theoretically start enrolling in July 2019, we would&#xD;
      anticipate completion by February 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the proportion of patients with an 80% or greater improvement in arm and neck&#xD;
           numerical rating scale pain (NRS) score following an initial cervical transforaminal&#xD;
           steroid injection (TFESI) at 4 weeks post-injection and the duration of response up to&#xD;
           12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the proportion of patients with a 50%-79% improvement in arm and neck NRS&#xD;
           score following an initial cervical TFESI at 4 weeks post-injection and the duration of&#xD;
           response up to 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the proportion of patients with less than 50% improvement in arm and neck NRS&#xD;
           score following an initial cervical TFESI at 4 weeks post-injection and the duration of&#xD;
           response up to 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine the proportion of patients with an initial injection plus up to 3 additional&#xD;
           injections that maintain 80% or greater, as well as 50-79%, improvement in arm and neck&#xD;
           NRS score for up to 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Determine the proportion of patients with a clinically significant change in function&#xD;
           defined by a minimally clinically significant change (MCIC) (≥10 point improvement ) or&#xD;
           30% improvement in Neck Disability Index (NDI) score following an initial cervical TFESI&#xD;
           at 4 weeks post-injection and the duration of response up to 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Determine the proportion of patients with clinically significant improvement in the&#xD;
           Medication Quantification Scale (MQS III) score (≥6.8 point change , equivalent to 10&#xD;
           oral morphine equivalents ) following an initial cervical TFESI at 4 weeks&#xD;
           post-injection and the duration of response up to 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Determine the proportion of patients with clinically significant improvement in the&#xD;
      categorical EuroQol 5 Dimensions tool (EQ-5D) defined by ≥0.03 following an initial cervical&#xD;
      TFESI at 4 weeks post-injection and the duration of response up to 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Compare patient demographic, clinical, and imaging characteristics between response groups&#xD;
      and perform predictive modeling to better understand variables that increase the likelihood&#xD;
      of a successful clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Report adverse effects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background and Project Justification: Neck pain is now the fourth leading cause of years lost&#xD;
      to disability, shortly after back pain, depression, and arthralgia. Cervical radiculopathy, a&#xD;
      common cause of neck and radiating arm pain, is estimated to afflict 83:100,000 individuals&#xD;
      yearly. Age-related cervical spondylosis and disc herniation are the most common causes, with&#xD;
      the C6 and C7 nerve roots most frequently affected. In general, patients who experience new&#xD;
      onset radicular pain tend to improve within 4-6 months, with complete recovery in over 80% of&#xD;
      patients by 24-36 months. However, a significant proportion of patients experience severe&#xD;
      pain and associated functional impairment despite conservative care, which often prompts&#xD;
      physician directed interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cervical transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) is a target-specific treatment for&#xD;
      refractory radicular pain. Analgesic mechanisms for epidural steroid administration include&#xD;
      reducing inflammation at the nerve root, reducing nociceptive input from somatic nerves,&#xD;
      stabilization of neural membranes, and blockade of C fiber activity in the dorsal root&#xD;
      ganglion . Previously, this procedure was associated with rare but catastrophic neurologic&#xD;
      injury, though to be related to inadvertent deposit of particulate steroid into the vertebral&#xD;
      artery or radiculomedullary arteries, both of which traverse through or close to the cervical&#xD;
      neuroforamina . Since the physician community has adopted new guidelines that include the use&#xD;
      of only non-particulate steroid during cervical TFESI , neurologic infarction has not been&#xD;
      reported in the literature. When the Spine Intervention Society (SIS) clinical practice&#xD;
      guidelines are employed, large cohort study demonstrates zero prevalence of serious&#xD;
      complications associated with this procedure .&#xD;
&#xD;
      While high-quality outcome literature demonstrates both efficacy and effectiveness for&#xD;
      analogous use of this intervention in the lumbar spine, far fewer studies have addressed&#xD;
      clinical outcomes associated with cervical TFESI in which appropriate procedure technique ,&#xD;
      outcome measurement, data analysis, and results interpretation have been reported . Outcome&#xD;
      literature reporting on the use of cervical TFESI is limited by small sample size,&#xD;
      retrospective design with loss of follow-up, lack of categorical data analysis, and a failure&#xD;
      to stratify results by demographic and clinical variables that potentially influence pain and&#xD;
      functional outcomes. Further, outcome literature reports on the effect of particulate steroid&#xD;
      injectate during cervical TFESI is no longer relevant to appropriate clinical practice in the&#xD;
      context of unequivocal guidelines. Pragmatic studies with a cervical TFESI arm in which&#xD;
      dexamethasone was use do allow for some insight regarding success rates associated with this&#xD;
      procedure; calculates of success rates in these studies arms demonstrate responder rates of&#xD;
      60% achieving &gt;50% pain relief (CI95 35-85%) at 4 weeks, 55% achieving &gt;50% (CI95 43-67%) at&#xD;
      8 weeks, and 65% achieving &gt;50% at 12 weeks (CI95 48-81%). These responder rates are&#xD;
      encouraging, but limited by wide 95% confidence intervals due to small sample size. Prior&#xD;
      systematic review has concluded that the evidence for treatment benefit of radicular pain by&#xD;
      cervical TFESI is of very low quality due to multiple limitations in study design introducing&#xD;
      risk of bias, but does overall suggest approximately 50% patients experience 50% relief of&#xD;
      radicular pain for at least 4 weeks after cervical TFESI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional clinical outcome literature is needed, particularly given recent policy decisions,&#xD;
      such as that of Oregon State in relation to ending coverage of epidural steroid injections at&#xD;
      any spinal level. Without expansion of the evidence-basis for this important procedure, there&#xD;
      is a risk that this treatment option may be taken away from patients suffering from cervical&#xD;
      radicular pain by further policy change. A sham-controlled trial, similar to the Ghahreman&#xD;
      study, would be ideal; however, due to cost considerations germane to a study designed and&#xD;
      conducted in a manner that would prevent any possible criticism from the larger medical&#xD;
      community, we instead propose a high-quality, large prospective cohort study as a significant&#xD;
      contribution to the literature. Even the best designed trials, such as Dreyfuss' 2006 study,&#xD;
      have been underpowered to definitively demonstrate effectiveness; notably, the lower bound of&#xD;
      the 95% confidence interval of the proportion of treatment responders in this study was 35%.&#xD;
      The investigators aim to conduct a large enough cohort study narrow the 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval of the proportion of responders substantially. Preliminary data from our center&#xD;
      demonstrates a responder rate of 55% at 4-week follow-up (n=22), based on a definition of&#xD;
      ≥50% improvement in index pain (Appendix A). These data represent analysis of consecutive&#xD;
      patients who underwent cervical TFESI for unilateral radicular pain as a part of a different&#xD;
      prospective outcome study at our center, nearing completion. This responder rate represents a&#xD;
      conservative estimate of what might be expected in the proposed work, as the current study&#xD;
      includes less stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, the investigators intend to use the results of this study as foundational data from&#xD;
      which to propose a randomized controlled study through a large federal funding mechanism. It&#xD;
      is imperative that such a trial be conducted by investigators who are experienced with this&#xD;
      procedure and understand the appropriate standards for the design and interpretation of the&#xD;
      results of a study of a treatment intervention for pain. Our spine research group is&#xD;
      well-positioned for this, and we absolutely welcome the input and mentorship of the Spine&#xD;
      Intervention Society Research Division, Board of Directors, and other leadership towards this&#xD;
      mutual goal.&#xD;
