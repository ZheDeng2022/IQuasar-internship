  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) is an exhausting pain syndrome that immensely affects quality&#xD;
      of sexual life, and consequently negatively affects quality of life. Low intensity shock wave&#xD;
      therapy produces physical forces that lead to pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of low-intensity shockwave therapy in&#xD;
      patients with provoked vestibulodynia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A double-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled, prospective study of 32 women. The&#xD;
      treatment protocol included a series of treatments, performed twice a week for 6 weeks. Each&#xD;
      treatment consisted of 500 pulses of low intensity shockwaves (0.09 mJ/〖mm〗^2 ) using the&#xD;
      &quot;Medispec ED-1000®&quot; shock wave generator or sham.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study was a single center, double-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled, prospective&#xD;
      study. Study eligibility criteria were treatment at the Neuro-urology Unit in Rambam Medical&#xD;
      Center, during January 2018 - January 2020 and a diagnosis of PVD. PVD diagnosis was based on&#xD;
      description of the pain and on a positive cotton swab test15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women were randomized at a 2:1 ratio to treatment or sham groups. The treatment protocol&#xD;
      included a series of treatments, performed twice a week for 6 weeks, for a total of 12&#xD;
      sessions. Each treatment consisted of 500 pulses of low intensity shockwaves (0.09&#xD;
      millijoul/〖mm〗^2 ) using the &quot;Medispec ED-1000®&quot; shock wave generator. The sham protocol&#xD;
      included the same treatment protocol without shock wave generator activation. The patients&#xD;
      were evaluated three times throughout the trial by an investigator blinded to the group&#xD;
      allocation: before the first treatment, and one and three months after the twelfth treatment.&#xD;
      Pain was assessed by both subjective and objective measures. The primary outcome measure was&#xD;
      a change in dyspareunia, as assessed by scores on the 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS)&#xD;
      (range 0-10 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures for evaluating pain were increases in pain threshold and&#xD;
      tolerance, assessed by a quantitative validated algometer test16, 17, the Wong-Baker pain&#xD;
      FACES scale (range 0-10)18, the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) (range 2-38)19 and the&#xD;
      Patients' Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC) (first component range 0-7; 0=no change,&#xD;
      7=a great deal better; second component range 0-10; 0=much better and 10=much worse)20. The&#xD;
      PGIC assessed the self-reported impression of a general change due to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The algometer applied was a very basic and simple device that was assembled and used at our&#xD;
      unit after validating its safety, accuracy, and adequacy in evaluating introitus pain vs&#xD;
      control (doctorate dissertation). For assessing the pain threshold with the algometer, radial&#xD;
      pressure (mmHg) was applied by progressively inflating a cylindrical balloon inserted in the&#xD;
      introitus. The participant was required to report the first painful sensation, and this&#xD;
      pressure, defined as the threshold pressure, was registered. The measurement was performed&#xD;
      sequentially 4 times and the average of the measured pressures was considered the first pain&#xD;
      threshold). Finally, for pain tolerance measurement, the participant was again asked to&#xD;
      report when she had reached her pain limit (1-10 on the verbal scale ) upon continuous&#xD;
      pressure&#xD;
