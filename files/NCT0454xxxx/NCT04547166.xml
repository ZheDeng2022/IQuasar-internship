      Patients with confirmed unresectable metastatic/recurrent colorectal adenocarcinoma who have&#xD;
      not received systemic anti-neoplastic therapy for metastatic/recurrent lesions will be&#xD;
      included in this study.Approximately 6-12 patients will be enrolled in the Part I (Safety&#xD;
      Run-in Period).Approximately 100 patients will be enrolled in the Part II (Phase II study, 50&#xD;
      in the test group and 50 in the control group).Approximately 654 patients will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the Part III (Phase III study, 327 in the test group and 327 in the control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II (Phase II study): Approximately 40 study sites in China will participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part III (Phase III study): A total of approximately 75 study sites in 7 countries(including&#xD;
      China, the United States, Brazil, Indonesia, Russia, Poland, Spain, etc.) will participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a screening period (up to 28 days), a treatment period (3-week cycle,&#xD;
      up to 2 years), and a follow-up period (including a safety follow-up period, and a survival&#xD;
      follow-up every 12 weeks).&#xD;
