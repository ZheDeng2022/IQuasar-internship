  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancers are the third most common type of cancer in the world. Peritoneal&#xD;
      carcinomatosis and intraabdominal acid development occur in advanced stages of colorectal&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that the immune system plays an important role in tumor development or tumor&#xD;
      eradication. Among the mechanisms of escape from the immune system, changes in the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment play an important role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune checkpoints are molecules that have become popular especially after the Nobel Prize in&#xD;
      2018, and are important in revealing the relationship between cancer and the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, it is aimed to evaluate whether there is a difference in intraabdominal ascites&#xD;
      fluid immune checkpoints level in patients with advanced colorectal cancer patients compared&#xD;
      to patients without malignancy.&#xD;

      Colorectal cancers are the third most common type of cancer in the world. Peritoneal&#xD;
      carcinomatosis and intraabdominal acid development occur in advanced stages of colorectal&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that the immune system plays an important role in tumor development or tumor&#xD;
      eradication. The role of the immune system in colorectal cancers has been demonstrated with&#xD;
      the effects of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and immune control points on TILs or&#xD;
      immune control point ligands on patient survival, especially in recent studies. Studies in&#xD;
      the literature usually include immunological examinations of patient blood or tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune checkpoints are molecules that have become popular especially after the Nobel Prize in&#xD;
      2018, and are important in revealing the relationship between cancer and the immune system.&#xD;
      Programmed Cell Death Protein-1 (PD-1) and its ligand, PD-L1, is an immune checkpoint that&#xD;
      acts by blocking T cell receptor signal transduction and auxiliary stimuli. T cell&#xD;
      immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3) are mostly expressed on T cells, Tregs, dendritic&#xD;
      cells, B cells, macrophages, natural killer cells (NK) and mast cells that produce&#xD;
      interferon-(10). Impairment in regulation of TIM-3 expression has been associated with&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases. High TIM-3 expression is associated with suppression of T cell responses&#xD;
      and T cell depletion, which is characterized by loss of T cell functions during chronic viral&#xD;
      infections and during tumor development. With the clinical success of immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors such as ipilimumab and nivolumab for melanoma and lung cancer, immune checkpoints&#xD;
      have attracted more attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many publications in the literature evaluating immunological markers from ascites&#xD;
      fluid samples for various reasons. In these studies, T and B cell subtypes were examined from&#xD;
      ascites fluid samples taken from patients with ascites, especially ovarian cancer and liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis. In the only study on gastrointestinal cancers, immunophenotyping was performed in&#xD;
      intraabdominal ascites and blood in 22 advanced gastrointestinal tumor patients and some cell&#xD;
      subgroups were associated with worse clinical outcome. In the literature, there is no study&#xD;
      on cytokine analysis from intra-abdominal ascites fluids specific to colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, it is aimed to evaluate whether there is a difference in intraabdominal ascites&#xD;
      fluid immune checkpoints level in patients with advanced colorectal cancer patients compared&#xD;
      to patients without malignancy.&#xD;
