  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A low FODMAP diet (LFD) has become a standard treatment in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)&#xD;
      patients. Compliant adherence to a LFD is challenging. The investigator looked at the effect&#xD;
      of a LFD compared to a less restrictive low lactose diet (LLD) in a randomized cross-over&#xD;
      trial with IBS patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder. It affects 10 - 20% of&#xD;
      the adult population. Pharmaceutical therapy as bulking agents, anticholinergics,&#xD;
      antispasmodics, and antidiarrheals are mostly unsatisfactory and many gastroenterologists&#xD;
      recommend therefore dietary management. Most patients note that various foods elicit&#xD;
      abdominal symptoms and therefore restrict their diet .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The low fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet&#xD;
      has currently the greatest evidence for efficacy in IBS. The rationale behind the LFD is the&#xD;
      exclusion of poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates which would create an osmotic load,&#xD;
      drag fluid into the small intestine and would be fermented by the colonic microbiome, both&#xD;
      leading to abdominal distention and increased luminal influx. FODMAPs do not cause symptoms&#xD;
      in healthy adults as they neither show these abnormalities in gut physiology nor suffer from&#xD;
      visceral hypersensitivity .&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not known however whether change in symptoms is induced by a reduction in all FODMAPs&#xD;
      or simply a single component as for example lactose. If there is a lactase deficiency, as it&#xD;
      is the case in 2-20% of Central- / Northern Europeans, lactose cannot be hydrolysed and&#xD;
      causes the above mentioned symptoms. Many IBS patients avoid lactose, even though only few&#xD;
      have a lactase deficiency. Lactose intolerance but not lactase deficiency is more frequent in&#xD;
      patients with IBS. The investigator wanted to examine if the demanding LFD is more effective&#xD;
      than elimination of lactose alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study, comparing in detail the effects of low FODMAP versus low lactose diet in IBS&#xD;
      patients is a novelty, analysing a clinically highly relevant topic.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from gastrointestinal symptoms in Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS symptom severity score) from Baseline to &quot;post intervention diet&quot;.</measure>
    <time_frame>The IBS SSS was assessed at the end of the run in period and at the end of the intervention diets (low lactose and low FODMAP diet) at day 14, 35 and 77.</time_frame>
    <description>The symptom severity score (IBS-SSS) is a validated score to evaluate the severity of an IBS. The five subscores for abdominal pain (severity and frequency), abdominal distension, satisfaction with stool habits and interference of IBS with daily life were each rated on a VAS (visual analogue scale) 0-100 mm scale and added up to a maximal sum of 500. A total score of 75 - 175 was regarded as mild, 175 - 300 as moderate and &gt; 300 as severe IBS.</description>

    <description>First, there was a run-in period (day 1-14), during which patients were randomly assigned by computer-generated bloc randomization to either the LLD or the LFD for 21 days (day 15-35). A dietician educated the participants on the first interventional diet. This phase was followed by a wash-out period of 21 days (day 36-56) with resumption of a normal balanced daily-life diet before crossing over to the alternate interventional diet (day 57-77). There were visits at the end of the washout phase with an instruction on the second interventional diet and at the end of the study.</description>
