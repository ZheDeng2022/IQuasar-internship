  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic juvenile arthritis includes 20% of patients with arthritis with enthesitis or&#xD;
      juvenile spondyloarthropathy. This is treated with anti-inflammatory drugs and then followed&#xD;
      by biotherapy with DMARDs (Drugs Modifying the Activity of Rheumatic Disease) if the former&#xD;
      are insufficient. Methotrexate (MTX) may also be used before these biotherapies. Recently, in&#xD;
      adults, a particular profile of intestinal microbiota has been shown to alter the&#xD;
      availability of MTX making it in efficient. Knowing that pediatric patients with juvenile&#xD;
      spondyloarthropathy have an imbalance of their intestinal flora (dysbiosis) the investigators&#xD;
      wanted to explore whether DMARDs could have a similar impact on the microbiota of these young&#xD;
      patients and alter the response to treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The JADAS CRP clinical score will be used to rate the degree of activity of the disease. The Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS) is a recently developed composite tool for scoring disease activity in juvenile idiopathic arthritis. It is a composite disease activity score including four measures:&#xD;
the physician's global assessment of disease activity;&#xD;
the parent/guardian's or patient's global assessment of overall wellbeing;&#xD;
number of joints with active arthritis; and&#xD;
C-reactive protein (CRP) which has been determined as an alternative inflammatory marker to the Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate ESR. JADAS-CRP was calculated similarly to the original JADAS as the simple sum of its four components, yielding a global score of 0-40, 0-57 and 0-101 depending on the joint count used for the JADAS10-CRP, JADAS27-CRP and JADAS71-CRP, respectively.</description>

    <description>The JADAS CRP clinical score will be used to rate the degree of activity of the disease. The Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS) is a recently developed composite tool for scoring disease activity in juvenile idiopathic arthritis. It is a composite disease activity score including four measures:&#xD;
the physician's global assessment of disease activity;&#xD;
the parent/guardian's or patient's global assessment of overall wellbeing;&#xD;
number of joints with active arthritis; and&#xD;
C-reactive protein (CRP) which has been determined as an alternative inflammatory marker to the Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate ESR. JADAS-CRP was calculated similarly to the original JADAS as the simple sum of its four components, yielding a global score of 0-40, 0-57 and 0-101 depending on the joint count used for the JADAS10-CRP, JADAS27-CRP and JADAS71-CRP, respectively.</description>
