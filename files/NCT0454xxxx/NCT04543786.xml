      The goal of this study is to investigate the role of transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation&#xD;
      on spinal cord excitability in lower limb amputees. In this study, the investigators will&#xD;
      quantify the spinal cord excitability determined by 1) reflexes and electromyography, and 2)&#xD;
      phantom limb pain using self-reported pain assessments. The investigators will assess these&#xD;
      measures of spinal excitability in lower limb amputees before and after transcutaneous spinal&#xD;
      cord stimulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this work is to investigate the changes in the spinal cord resulting from&#xD;
      limb amputation. Limb amputation results in an extreme form of peripheral nerve injury.&#xD;
      Damage to peripheral nerves, such as with neuropathy, crush injuries, nerve transection, or&#xD;
      limb amputation often results in chronic pain, which may be associated with altered&#xD;
      excitability of spinal sensorimotor pathways. These spinal pathways become hyperexcitable due&#xD;
      to a lack of sensory input, which causes tonic disinhibition of descending circuits and&#xD;
      spontaneous activity in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Spinal excitability can be measured&#xD;
      using the H-reflex, in which electrical stimulation of muscle spindle Ia afferents activates&#xD;
      spinal motoneurons via the myotatic reflex, as well as the posterior root-muscle (PRM)&#xD;
      reflex, which is elicited by transcutaneous stimulation over the dorsal roots and is&#xD;
      considered to be half of the H-reflex, excluding the peripheral primary afferents, but with&#xD;
      multiple root activation. Spinal excitability has not been measured in amputees but may offer&#xD;
      a potential biomarker for PLP. Neuromodulation may restore normal spinal excitability and&#xD;
      reduce PLP, thus offering the potential to improve the quality of life in individuals with a&#xD;
      lower limb amputation. The results of this study will provide the foundation for future&#xD;
      development of a neuroprosthesis to restore spinal excitability and reduce PLP in individuals&#xD;
      with a lower limb amputation. Subjects will undergo 5 testing and stimulation sessions in 1&#xD;
      week. An additional 3 days of recording sessions may be necessary if a phantom limb pain&#xD;
      episode does not occur during normal testing days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Quantify spinal excitability. A lack of sensory input results in spinal&#xD;
      hyperexcitability through several pathways including tonic disinhibition of descending&#xD;
      circuits and spontaneous activity in the DRG. Spinal cord excitability is directly related to&#xD;
      reflex modulation; impaired or enhanced reflex modulation indicates abnormal spinal cord&#xD;
      excitability. Spinal cord excitability will be determined in people with a lower limb&#xD;
      amputation using the H-reflex and posterior root-muscle (PRM) reflex. The H-reflex is&#xD;
      elicited with electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves, exciting muscle spindle Ia&#xD;
      afferents projecting to spinal motoneurons via the myotatic reflex. Stimulation of the&#xD;
      peripheral nerves also elicits a direct motor (M) wave. The PRM reflex is elicited by&#xD;
      electrical stimulation of the posterior roots on the back. It is considered to be half of the&#xD;
      H-reflex, excluding the peripheral motor efferents, but activates multiple dorsal roots.&#xD;
      Reflex amplitude and latency, threshold, recruitment curves, and rate-dependent depression&#xD;
      will be measured and compared to intact controls. The investigators hypothesize that H and&#xD;
      PRM reflex hyperexcitability will be present in the residual limb of amputees with PLP. These&#xD;
      results will provide insight into the role of limb amputation on spinal cord health and&#xD;
      excitability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Characterize the effects of transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation on spinal&#xD;
      cord excitability and phantom limb pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuromodulation of sensorimotor pathways using transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation&#xD;
      (TENS), dorsal root ganglia stimulation (DRGS), and epidural spinal cord stimulation (eSCS)&#xD;
      to reduce phantom limb pain have been explored with mixed results. The most promising methods&#xD;
      for pain reduction were DRGS or laterally-placed eSCS, indicating that the DRG and dorsal&#xD;
      roots are optimal targets for reducing PLP. However, these methods require surgical&#xD;
      implantation of electrodes. Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) is a non-invasive&#xD;
      method for stimulating the dorsal roots in a similar way as eSCS. Through activation of the&#xD;
      primary afferents, tSCS may inhibit pain pathways and reduce the hyperexcitability that leads&#xD;
      to chronic pain. tSCS in people with spinal cord injury has been shown to restore spinal&#xD;
      inhibition and reduce H-reflex hyperexcitability. The investigators hypothesize that tSCS can&#xD;
      reduce PLP through modulation of sensorimotor pathways. By comparing the H- and PRM reflex&#xD;
      excitability recorded from the residual limb before and after each session of tSCS, a&#xD;
      potential mechanism of PLP could be elucidated. H- and PRM reflex modulation, and any&#xD;
      differences in the extent of modulation for each, can further inform on the mechanisms of&#xD;
      tSCS and how it modulates sensorimotor pathways. The investigators will also quantify the&#xD;
      subjects' experience of PLP before and after the 5 days of tSCS and correlate their pain&#xD;
      experiences with spinal excitability measures. The investigators will use a visual analog&#xD;
      scale and the McGill Pain Questionnaire to assess changes in pain perception. The&#xD;
      investigators will also use an algometer to determine changes in local pain threshold.&#xD;
