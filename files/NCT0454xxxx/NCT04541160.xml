      This is a randomized study that sought to compare the rule-out capacity and antibiotics&#xD;
      prescriptions associated with two different diagnostic imaging strategies (ultra-low-dose&#xD;
      chest computed tomography versus chest radiography) in a group of healthy adults presenting&#xD;
      to the emergency department (ED) with suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between October 2017 and December 2018, we prospectively enrolled consecutive adult patients&#xD;
      with suspected community-acquired pneumonia based on at least one respiratory symptom and&#xD;
      focal auscultatory findings and at least one sign related to infection, for whom no&#xD;
      definitive diagnosis was possible by clinical judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients were randomly assigned to their imaging evaluation in a 1:1 ratio to either&#xD;
      ultra-low-dose chest computed tomography (ULDCT) or the standard evaluation strategy using&#xD;
      conventional chest radiography (CR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study sought to compare the rule-out capacity and antibiotics prescriptions associated&#xD;
      with those two different diagnostic imaging strategies (ULDCT versus CR) in a group of&#xD;
      healthy adult patients presenting to the ED with suspected CAP.&#xD;

        A total of 211 patients were included from the 237 eligible ones. Sixteen patients refused&#xD;
        to sign the informed consent form and five were excluded due to technical errors during&#xD;
        image acquisition. Two patients exhibited BMIs higher than 35 and did not fulfil the&#xD;
        inclusion criteria; three patients could not be reached for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Among the 211 patients included, 98 (46.45%) were imaged by CR and 113 (53.55%) by ULDCT.&#xD;
        There were no significant differences among patients in the CR and ULDCT groups concerning&#xD;
        age, gender, height, weight, and BMI.&#xD;
