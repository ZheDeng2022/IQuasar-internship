  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dysphagia and the intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) are common and&#xD;
      outcome-relevant neuromuscular complications in critically ill patients, especially after&#xD;
      prolonged mechanical ventilation, sepsis and multi-organ failure. However, the impact of&#xD;
      these two complications on the clinical course of critically ill patients needs further&#xD;
      investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the standard diagnostic procedure to detect and grade the acquired dysphagia&#xD;
      using the fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) and the Medical Research&#xD;
      Council sum score (MRC-ss) to detect ICU-AW are time-consuming and strongly dependent on&#xD;
      patient compliance. An early and easy-to-use detection of these neuromuscular complications&#xD;
      is currently difficult to be achieved in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuromuscular ultrasound (NMUS) and the measurement of neuromuscular damage blood biomarkers&#xD;
      became increasingly interesting for clinical researchers in the recent years due to their&#xD;
      broad availability and their simple and non-invasive application. However, the value of these&#xD;
      new diagnostic tests to evaluate dysphagia and ICU-AW needs to be verified.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this single-center observational study the investigators aim to evaluate neuromuscular&#xD;
      ultrasound and blood biomarkers of neuromuscular damage as innovative diagnostic features for&#xD;
      the detection, monitoring and prognostication of dysphagia and ICU-AW in critically ill&#xD;
      patients. A detailed neurological examination, NMUS as well as blood biomarker measurements&#xD;
      (e.g. Myl3, TNNI1, FABP-3) will be longitudinally performed at study day 1 (day of study&#xD;
      inclusion), day 3, day 10 and day 17 after study inclusion. The neurological examination&#xD;
      comprises the use of validated scales (GCS, RASS, mRS) and scores (MRC-ss) to assess&#xD;
      consciousness, neurological disability and muscle strength as well as the the examination of&#xD;
      the reflex status. Using a standardized in-house NMUS protocol the facial (masseter muscle),&#xD;
      submental (digastricus muscle, mylohyoid muscle), cervical (sternocleidomastoid muscle) and&#xD;
      extremity muscles (biceps brachii, brachiradialis, quadriceps femoris, tibialis anterior) as&#xD;
      well as the vagus nerve will be assessed repeatedly. Additionally, a FEES as the current gold&#xD;
      standard diagnostic for dysphagia will be performed at study day 10 or as soon as possible&#xD;
      (depending on the ability of the patient to cooperate with the examiner) after study day 10&#xD;
      to detect and grade the dysphagia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will be reevaluated at day 90 after study inclusion with regard to&#xD;
      functional disability and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, healthy volunteers will be recruited and assessed in the same way as patients&#xD;
      including a clinical examination, NMUS, laboratory testing and FEES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothezise that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  acquired dysphagia due to critical illness (not caused by central nervous system damage)&#xD;
           is more likely in patients with ICU-AW&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the outcome in patients with a combination of ICU-AW and dysphagia is worse compared to&#xD;
           patients with only one of these entities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NMUS is able to detect and monitor dysphagia and ICU-AW in critically ill patients who&#xD;
           are at risk of neuromuscular dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  specific blood biomarker levels correlate with the severity of neuromuscular impairment&#xD;
           and are of value to identify patients with ICU-AW and acquired dysphagia&#xD;
