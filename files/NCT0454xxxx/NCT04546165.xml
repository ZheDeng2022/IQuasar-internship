  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tension-type headache (TTH) causes a significant negative impact on working and daily life&#xD;
      due to the reduction in work productivity and family and social activities causes. There is&#xD;
      evidence that manual therapy and exercise reduce nociceptive input from the cervical spine&#xD;
      and surrounding muscles, the use of manual therapy in TTH management&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increased cranio-cervical muscle sensitivity is the most prominent finding in TTH. Also, neck&#xD;
      pain is markedly more common in individuals with TTH compared with the control population&#xD;
      (88.4%, and 56.7%, respectively). Therefore, current research on the pathogenesis of TTH&#xD;
      focuses on the role of musculoskeletal disorders in the cervical spine and the facilitation&#xD;
      of nociceptive pain processing. It has been suggested that peripheral sensitivity of&#xD;
      nociceptors in cranio-cervical muscles and other cervical structures, as well as sensitivity&#xD;
      of nociceptive pain pathways in the central nervous system (CNS) due to long-term nociceptive&#xD;
      stimuli may play a role in development and chronification of TTH&#xD;

    <measure>Headache Frequency (HF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline in Headache Frequency Score to 1 month and 3 months</time_frame>

    <description>The self-evaluation of pain severity of headache and neck pain during rest and activity in the previous week was calculated using a 10-cm VAS scale, where 0 in the left corner of the scale represented 'no pain' and 10 in the right corner represented 'the worst pain that could be imagined'</description>

    <measure>Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline in Headache Impact Test-6 Score to 1 month and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The total score was calculated in HIT-6, which consisted of 6 questions with 5 answer options for each (never: 6 points, rarely: 8 points, sometimes: 10 points, very often: 11 points, always: 13 points). A total score of 36 means best and 78 means worst in terms of headache</description>

    <measure>Neck Disability Index (NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline in Neck Disability Index Score to 1 month and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The NDI consists of 10 questions about pain disability in the neck region (&quot;no disability&quot; = 0, and &quot;full disability&quot; = 5). The total NDI score was calculated, with 0 showing the best score and 50 showing the worst score.</description>

    <measure>Pressure-Pain Threshold (PTT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline in Pressure-Pain Threshold Score to 1 month and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>PPT measurements were performed using a mechanical pressure algometer on the temporalis anterior muscle The feeling of pressure was gradually increased until it turned into pain or discomfort, at which point the pressure value was recorded.</description>

    <description>HLVA manipulation was performed for 8 sessions (twice a week for four weeks) using a segment-specific technique for segmental dysfunctions of the upper cervical spine. . By bringing the cervical spine to light flexion and about 15-20ยบ lateral flexion without any rotational motion, the middle finger of the manipulating hand provided deep contact, and an HVLA thrust was applied out of the rotational slack by applying a deep force from the dorsal to the ventral direction</description>

    <description>Suboccipital inhibition was performed for 8 sessions (twice a week for four weeks) as a combined muscle and soft tissue inhibition technique. While the patient was in the supine position, the physician sitting at the top end of the table placed the fingers of both hands on the patient's suboccipital region</description>

    <description>Patients were asked to exercise at least three days a week during treatment. The exercise program, which lasted 20 to 30 minutes, included cervical range of motion (ROM) exercises to warm-up and cool-down, and then stretching exercises of cervical and upper thoracic spine muscles (trapezius, levator scapula, sternocleidomastoid) and strengthening exercises (cervical isometric contraction and concentric contraction of the deep cervical flexor muscles).</description>
