    <textblock>
      Voriconazole is a drug used to treat invasive fungal infections. The amount of voriconazole&#xD;
      in a person's blood helps to determine how effectively it treats an infection, and how safe&#xD;
      it is. Patients respond differently when receiving the same dose - some clearly benefit,&#xD;
      other patients experience side effects, and others see limited improvement in their&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voriconazole is broken down in the liver mainly by an enzyme called CYP2C19, before being&#xD;
      excreted from the body. The activity of CYP2C19 differs between people because of variation&#xD;
      in the DNA that encodes the body's instructions to make CYP2C19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If CYP2C19 activity is very high, voriconazole blood levels may remain below the target range&#xD;
      when a patient receives a standard dose of voriconazole, which may be insufficient to treat&#xD;
      their infection. By contrast, decreased CYP2C19 activity due to genetic variation may result&#xD;
      in excessively high voriconazole blood levels, predisposing to serious side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, knowing a patient's CYP2C19 genetic makeup is very important for predicting their&#xD;
      response to voriconazole. Thus, the investigators aim to determine the influence of genetic&#xD;
      variation in CYP2C19 on the frequency and severity of side effects related to voriconazole,&#xD;
      and on the effectiveness of voriconazole for treating serious fungal infections. The findings&#xD;
      from this study will contribute to determining the optimal dose of voriconazole that patients&#xD;
      with different genetic variants in CYP2C19 should be started on, and will take us one step&#xD;
      closer to both understanding the genetic structure of CYP2C19 in the Turkish population, and&#xD;
      to 'personalised medicine'.&#xD;

      Rationale for the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the incidence of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in patients with hematological&#xD;
      malignancies has decreased by half, its mortality rate still remains of substantial clinical&#xD;
      concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voriconazole is the first line therapy for the treatment of IA. Since it has a narrow&#xD;
      therapeutic window, the high inter/intra-individual variability and nonlinear&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is recommended to optimize clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. Voriconazole is metabolized principally by CYP2C19 (cytochrome P450 enzyme) and, to&#xD;
      a lesser extent, by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 enzymes. Among the various covariates, CYP2C19 genetic&#xD;
      variability is the major determinant that contributes to interindividual variability of&#xD;
      voriconazole. While the poor metabolizers are more susceptible to toxicity, the risk of&#xD;
      treatment failure in ultra-metabolizers are considered to be higher. TDM improve the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of voriconazole treatment. The appropriate time for TDM is after the first few&#xD;
      days (2-5 days) of initiation of standard treatment. However some adverse drug reactions&#xD;
      (ADRs) and deviation from the therapeutic range may occur until the TDM is done. Starting&#xD;
      with pharmacogenetic-guided dose would ensure safer and more effective therapy until the TDM&#xD;
      is performed and would lead to less frequent TDM with decreased treatment costs. Furthermore,&#xD;
      pharmacogenetic test results can also be used when interpreting the optimal dose of other&#xD;
      drugs that is metabolized with the same enzyme. The individual pharmacogenetic data also&#xD;
      enables safer and cost-effective therapy adjustments in the future, too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, primary objective of the study is to determine the influence of CYP2C19 genetic&#xD;
      polymorphisms on the frequency and severity of ADRs related to voriconazole during the study&#xD;
      period in a Turkish university hospital. The secondary objective is to determine the&#xD;
      influence of CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms on the effectiveness of voriconazole in this&#xD;
      setting. Our study will fill this gap by assessing the influence of CYP2C19 polymorphisms on&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of voriconazole that is being used in patients with a hematologic&#xD;
      malignancy to treat an IA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be drawn from patients aged 18 and over that are hospitalized in&#xD;
      Dokuz Eylul University Hospital Hematology Service due to a hematological malignancy, and are&#xD;
      receiving voriconazole for the management of an IFI, which is diagnosed based on EORTC/MSG (&#xD;
      European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer / Mycosis Study Group) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.Data and sample collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.1.Data collection: At baseline, demographics and clinical information will be recorded&#xD;
      from all patients directly and complemented from their medical records. All patients will be&#xD;
      followed up by the research team daily for the first 7 days following voriconazole&#xD;
      initiation, and then on days 14, 30 and 60. All follow up will be initially via assessment of&#xD;
      medical records, with additional data input from the patient directly. The medical records&#xD;
      include: the electronic hospital record system (PROBEL), paper-based patient records and&#xD;
      other patient follow-up- documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During routine clinical care, ADRs are monitored daily by a hematology fellow and/or an&#xD;
      infectious disease specialist. On days one to seven following voriconazole initiation, the&#xD;
      investigators will record these clinical evaluations daily; they will also capture these data&#xD;
      on days 14 and 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants that had either started voriconazole active treatment before they were&#xD;
      recruited, or were recruited during the maintenance phase of their voriconazole regimen, the&#xD;
      research team will assess their medicals records retrospectively between the point of&#xD;
      recruitment and day one of their active voriconazole treatment to detect ADRs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On days 30 and 60, patient survival will be recorded by review of patient records only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment response (efficacy) will be determined based on the EORTC/MSG consensus criteria&#xD;
      30. These data will be obtained at all follow up points (from day one to seven, and days 14,&#xD;
      30 and 60).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up scheme and the consort flow diagram regarding the protocol are attached in the&#xD;
      appendix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.2.Sample collection: 1.1.2.1.Samples fo PGx analysis: For PGx analysis, participants will&#xD;
      donate one 9 mL blood sample collected into an EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid) tube on&#xD;
      day one whilst blood samples are being taken from the patient for daily routine clinical&#xD;
      purposes (without requiring any other needle insertion). Samples for PGx analysis will be&#xD;
      coded and stored securely in the Department of Medical Pharmacology at the DEUTF. The samples&#xD;
      will be stored -80 celsius degree until used up. PGx analysis will be performed in the&#xD;
      Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology at the University of Liverpool at the end&#xD;
      of the study. Participants and physicians will not be informed of the participant's genotype&#xD;
      as this is an observational study. The participant's clinical care will not be affected in&#xD;
      any way by taking part in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.2.2.Samples for voriconazole concentration determination The second 9 mL blood sample&#xD;
      will be collected into a red cap tube on the fifth day (9th dose) of treatment before the&#xD;
      morning voriconazole dose, again whilst blood is being collected as part of routine clinical&#xD;
      care (without requiring any other needle insertion) to determine the trough voriconazole&#xD;
      concentration at steady state. This blood sample will be centrifuged and the serum stored in&#xD;
      the Department of Medical Pharmacology at the Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine.&#xD;
      When follow up is completed for a given patient, this serum sample will be transferred to an&#xD;
      accredited laboratory in Istanbul, Turkey, with maintenance and assurance of the cold chain&#xD;
      during sample transportation to guarantee sample integrity.&#xD;
