        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Otherwise healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs,&#xD;
             and 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening. Any abnormalities must be&#xD;
             considered not clinically significant and this determination must be recorded in the&#xD;
             participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Otherwise healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening and&#xD;
             Day 1. If the results of the serum chemistry panel, hematology, or urinalysis are&#xD;
             outside the normal reference ranges, the participant may be included only if the&#xD;
             investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically&#xD;
             significant or to be appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This&#xD;
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by&#xD;
             the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative highly sensitive serum&#xD;
             beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta hCG) at screening and a negative urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test on Day -1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A woman must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of assisted&#xD;
             reproduction during the study and for a period of 90 days post study intervention&#xD;
             administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A male participant must agree not to donate sperm for the purpose of reproduction&#xD;
             during the study and for a minimum of 90 days after receiving the last dose of study&#xD;
             intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any clinically significant medical illness or medical disorders the&#xD;
             investigator considers should exclude the participant, including (but not limited to),&#xD;
             neuromuscular, hematological disease, immune deficiency state, respiratory disease,&#xD;
             hepatic or gastrointestinal disease, neurological or psychiatric disease,&#xD;
             ophthalmological disorders, neoplastic disease, renal or urinary tract diseases, or&#xD;
             dermatological disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of malignancy before screening. Exceptions are squamous and basal cell&#xD;
             carcinomas of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or a malignancy which is&#xD;
             considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has or has had a serious infection (example: sepsis, pneumonia, or pyelonephritis), or&#xD;
             have been hospitalized or received intravenous (IV) antibiotics for a serious&#xD;
             infection during the 4 months prior to the screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is currently enrolled in an investigational study or has received an investigational&#xD;
             intervention (including investigational vaccines or devices) 5 half-lives or 8 weeks&#xD;
             prior to screening (whichever is longer)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received prescription medications within 2 weeks prior to first study intervention&#xD;
             administration&#xD;
