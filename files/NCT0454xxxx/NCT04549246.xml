    <textblock>
      This study is an observational registry study evaluating the clinical outcomes of grid&#xD;
      therapy. Subjects will be screened at outpatient clinic visit appointments and interested&#xD;
      qualified subjects will be consented and offered participation in this study. Once consent&#xD;
      has been obtained, baseline adverse event and QOL data will be collected and subjects will&#xD;
      undergo grid therapy and follow-up at 2-4 weeks (for toxicity), and 3-6 months (for&#xD;
      toxicities and radiographic control) then per clinical discretion up to 1 year. Patients will&#xD;
      be evaluated according to the physician's standard practice and discretion. Patient data will&#xD;
      be drawn from the patients' medical records and reported by means of a web-based electronic&#xD;
      data collection (EDC) system. Patients will be considered &quot;on study&quot; until 60 months of&#xD;
      observation has occurred, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, or study closure. See&#xD;
      below for the clinical visit flowchart for data collected at baseline and standard clinic&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;

    <description>Grid therapy allows for high doses of radiation to be delivered over several spatially distinct, small regions. This permits regions of very high dose to a large tumor away from critical structures, which could be beneficial in both palliative and definitive treatments. Additionally, allowing for high doses to be delivered could pose a benefit for radioresistant histologies.</description>

          -  Patients with tumors of the head and neck, thorax, abdomen, pelvis, and extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological confirmation of oncologic diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completed oncologic imaging (per discretion of treating physician)&#xD;

          -  Provide informed written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any of the following because this study involves an agent that has known genotoxic,&#xD;
             mutagenic and teratogenic effects:&#xD;

             of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or&#xD;
             interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the&#xD;
             prescribed regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunocompromised patients and patients known to be HIV positive and currently&#xD;
             receiving antiretroviral therapy. NOTE: Patients known to be HIV positive, but without&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
