  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancers are the third most common type of cancer in the world. Peritoneal&#xD;
      carcinomatosis and intraabdominal acid development occur in advanced stages of colorectal&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that the immune system plays an important role in tumor development or tumor&#xD;
      eradication. Differentiation of T cells towards Th2 and regulatory T cells is also reported&#xD;
      to be effective in tumor progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the mechanisms of escape from the immune system, changes in the tumor microenvironment&#xD;
      play an important role. The role of regulatory T lymphocytes, a subgroup of T cells that play&#xD;
      a regulatory role by suppressing the function of other T lymphocytes, is to reduce the&#xD;
      chronic immune response against viruses, tumors and patients's own antigens. The common&#xD;
      feature of all Tregs is that they secrete one or more anti-inflammatory molecules such as&#xD;
      IL-10, TGFβ or IL-35. High levels of Tregs have been found in peripheral blood, tumor tissue&#xD;
      and lymph nodes in patients with malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, it is aimed to evaluate whether there is a difference in intraabdominal ascites&#xD;
      fluid T helper cytokine levels in patients with end-stage colorectal cancers compared to&#xD;
      patients without malignancy.&#xD;

      Colorectal cancers are the third most common type of cancer in the world. Peritoneal&#xD;

      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;

      and lymph nodes in patients with malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of the immune system in colorectal cancers has been demonstrated with the effects of&#xD;
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and immune control points on TILs or immune control&#xD;
      point ligands on patient survival, especially in recent studies. Studies in the literature&#xD;
      usually include immunological examinations of patient blood or tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many publications in the literature evaluating immunological markers from ascites&#xD;
      fluid samples for various reasons. In these studies, T and B cell subtypes were examined from&#xD;
      ascites fluid samples taken from patients with ascites, especially ovarian cancer and liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis. In the only study on gastrointestinal cancers, immunophenotyping was performed in&#xD;
      intraabdominal ascites and blood in 22 advanced gastrointestinal tumor patients and some cell&#xD;
      subgroups were associated with worse clinical outcome. In the literature, there is no study&#xD;
      on cytokine analysis from intra-abdominal ascites fluids specific to colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, it is aimed to evaluate whether there is a difference in intraabdominal ascites&#xD;
      fluid cytokine level in patients with end-stage colorectal patients compared to patients&#xD;
      without malignancy.&#xD;
