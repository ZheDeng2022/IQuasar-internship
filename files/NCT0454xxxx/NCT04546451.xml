  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive decline represents a major threat among the deleterious effects of population&#xD;
      aging. The investigators propose to conduct an RCT on the subpopulation of MCI patients, and&#xD;
      examine whether intensive musical or psychomotor group interventions can improve their&#xD;
      cognitive and sensorimotor functioning, as well as induce brain plasticity, compared to a&#xD;
      passive healthy control group, matched for age, gender and education level. The 2 training&#xD;
      regimens will take place twice a week over 6 months and will be provided by professionals in&#xD;
      each field.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Regular cognitive training can boost or maintain cognitive and brain functions&#xD;
      known to decline with age. Most studies administered such cognitive training on a computer&#xD;
      and in a lab setting. However, everyday life activities, like musical practice or physical&#xD;
      exercise that are complex and variable, could be more successful at inducing transfer effects&#xD;
      to different cognitive domains and maintaining motivation. &quot;Body-mind exercises&quot;, like Tai&#xD;
      Chi or psychomotor exercise, may also positively affect cognitive functioning in the elderly.&#xD;
      We will investigate the influence of active music practice and psychomotor training over 6&#xD;
      months in Mild Cognitive Impairment patients from university hospital memory clinics on&#xD;
      cognitive and sensorimotor performance and brain plasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods We aim to conduct a randomized controlled multicenter intervention study on 32 Mild&#xD;
      Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients (60-80 years), divided over 2 experimental groups: 1)&#xD;
      Music practice; 2) Psychomotor treatment. Controls will consist of a passive test-retest&#xD;
      group of 16 age, gender and education level matched healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training regimens take place twice a week for 45 minutes over 6 months in small groups,&#xD;
      provided by professionals, and patients should exercise daily at home. Data collection takes&#xD;
      place at baseline (before the interventions), 3, and 6 months after training onset, on&#xD;
      cognitive and sensorimotor capacities, subjective well-being, daily living activities, and&#xD;
      via functional and structural neuroimaging. Considering the current constraints of the&#xD;
      ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, recruitment and data collection takes place in 2 waves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion We will investigate whether musical practice or psychomotor exercise in small&#xD;
      groups can improve cognitive, sensorimotor and brain functioning in MCI patients, and&#xD;
      therefore provoke benefits for their daily life functioning and well-being.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Telephone Screening Instrument (COGTEL)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This test can be applied by telephone or face-to-face (in this study we will apply the face-to-face method). The outcome consists of increase or less decrease (experimental group 1 or 2 vs. the control group) of the total weighted score at the COGTEL test directly after the 6 months interventions as compared to directly before the interventions.&#xD;
The COGTEL test provides a main weighted score of core cognitive function, it comprises 6 subtests covering prospective memory, short- and long-term verbal memory, working memory (digit span), verbal fluency and inductive reasoning.&#xD;
COGTEL main weighted score: COGTEL Total score = 7.2 x Prospective Memory score + 1.0 x Verbal Short-Term Memory score + 0.9 x Verbal Long-Term Memory score + 0.8 x Working Memory score + 0.2 x Verbal Fluency score + 1.7 x Inductive Reasoning score&#xD;
