      Percutaneous Interruption of the Coracohumeral Ligament for the treatment of Frozen Shoulder.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic inflammation of the shoulder joint capsule and its associated structures can lead to&#xD;
      clinically significant symptoms, including insidious onset of pain, and ultimately&#xD;
      restricting range of motion. Although the underlying mechanism for adhesive capsulitis (AC)&#xD;
      is not well defined, some studies suggest that fibroblast proliferation and thickening of the&#xD;
      coracohumeral ligament (CHL) is a proposed mechanism for which AC and subsequent prolonged&#xD;
      immobilization and symptoms present (1, 2, 3). Other studies suggest that it is due to a&#xD;
      combination of capsular fibrosis and inflammation within the synovium, and other focus on the&#xD;
      fact that thickening of the CHL is responsible for limiting external rotation in patients&#xD;
      affected by adhesive capsulitis (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AC coined frozen shoulder by Codman in 1934 [2), has an estimated prevalence of 2-3% in the&#xD;
      general population, with ages 40-70 affected most commonly, and predominantly women. While&#xD;
      the precise etiology remains undefined, it can be secondary to trauma or an idiopathic&#xD;
      etiology and has been found to have an incidence as high as 20% in diabetic patients, with&#xD;
      worse functional outcomes when compared to non-diabetic patients. Hypothyroidism and&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disease have also been shown to be associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      developing AC (4). AC is typically a clinical diagnosis. However, both magnetic resonance and&#xD;
      ultrasonography have consistently shown thickening of the CHL (1). Several studies have&#xD;
      compared arthrographic evidence of findings in adhesive capsulitis, and many reported a&#xD;
      thickening of the CHL in cases of frozen shoulder as compared to control subjects (2). In a&#xD;
      study implementing shear-wave elastography (SWE), the CHL in patients diagnosed with adhesive&#xD;
      capsulitis was thicker and stiffer (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions aimed at improving AC and CHL damage, clinical symptomatology, as well as&#xD;
      histopathological findings range from rest and physical therapy, local injections and&#xD;
      hydrodilation, to advanced surgical interventions (4, 5). These surgical options include&#xD;
      manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) and arthroscopic capsulotomy. MUA is an aggressive&#xD;
      mobilization of the joint in an effort to lyse adhesions and to stretch the contracted&#xD;
      glenohumeral capsule. Despite potential benefits, MUA has been associated with superior&#xD;
      labral anterior and posterior (SLAP) lesions, bankart lesions, capsular tears, hemarthrosis,&#xD;
      and even humeral or glenoid fractures (4). Arthroscopic capsulotomy allows for direct&#xD;
      visualization of the CHL and confirmation of the diagnosis of AC, and several studies have&#xD;
      shown improvement in pain relief as well as range of motion (4). However, patients who did&#xD;
      not benefit from this intervention were women, typically over the age of 50, with a past&#xD;
      medical history of diabetes mellitus. CHL resection has also been described as a potential&#xD;
      treatment option for AC (6, 7), with current therapy limited to a surgical approach.&#xD;
      Management of refractory disease through arthroscopic capsular release has been shown to&#xD;
      improve pain and increase range-of-motion (8, 9, 4). A sequela of arthroscopic surgery is&#xD;
      postoperative persistent AC, which some surgeons attempt to prophylactically prevent with&#xD;
      adequate postoperative pain control so that the patient can participate in a physical therapy&#xD;
      program. The potential limitations of current conservative management and IRB NUMBER:&#xD;
      2020-11998 IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/17/2020 sequelae of surgical approaches have prompted&#xD;
      additional novel therapies. International have researchers developed an ultrasound guided&#xD;
      technique with a scalpel incision of the CHL to address this need. Scalpel use is not the&#xD;
      standard of care for interventional musculoskeletal pain treatments and our team decided to&#xD;
      improve this limitation. Blades and scalpels limit US visibility, thus marginalizing the&#xD;
      safety of the procedure. Our team used a percutaneous, ultrasound visible, needle shaped,&#xD;
      tissue cutting device to lesion the CHL while improving upon the potential safety concerns.&#xD;
      The tool, TENEXÂ®, is widely used by Pain physicians to perform percutaneous tenotomies and&#xD;
      has been described in the management of various tendinous pathologies (10, 11, 12, 13, 14,&#xD;
      15).; this device was selected because the gross architectural similarities of tendon and&#xD;
      ligament suggest that the CHL could be modified by this tool. Our novel procedure was&#xD;
      performed on cadavers to provide proof of concept&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors performed cadaveric dissection in 8 cadaveric shoulders with the hypothesis that&#xD;
      sonographically guided percutaneous dissection will result in sectioning of the coracohumeral&#xD;
      ligament. In this study we found that complete sectioning was reproducibly achieved in 7&#xD;
      minutes with approximately 250 passes of the device. This was the desired outcome for&#xD;
      improving the shoulder ROM (16). This shows proof of concept and we want to perform this&#xD;
      procedure in living subjects for validation. If the results are positive patients can have an&#xD;
      outpatient procedure in the interventional pain clinic with desirable results. This cadaveric&#xD;
      technique study has already been submitted to Pain Medicine journal for publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above proof of concept above this procedure was performed in living&#xD;
      subjects. A peer reviewed paper was submitted based on data from these subjects. 7 patients&#xD;
      were selected for the publication as these patients had follow-ups as requested by the&#xD;
      reviewer. In these patients the average improvement in external rotation was 40 degrees and&#xD;
      the average abduction improvement was 31 degrees. All patients retained this improvement in&#xD;
      shoulder ROM at follow-up visits. Of note, one patients follow-up visit was 116 after the&#xD;
      procedure and her improvement in ROM was 60 and 110 in external rotation and abduction&#xD;
      respectively. Given these outcomes the authors decided to do a prospective RCT.&#xD;
