      Brief Summary: Improving care of the injured (trauma care) is a way to the large burden of&#xD;
      injury in low- and middle-income countries. The important initial period of trauma care is&#xD;
      often chaotic and prone to errors. The World Health Organization created a Trauma Care&#xD;
      Checklist (TCC), which improved key performance indicators of care at tertiary hospitals but&#xD;
      encountered factors which decreased its uptake. The investigators propose the use of a model&#xD;
      Trauma Intake Form (TIF) with potential to achieve the benefits of the TCC, but with&#xD;
      automatic usage and with accompanying improvements in documentation for key elements of care.&#xD;
      It is especially oriented for smaller hospitals. The investigators propose a pragmatic&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial with introduction of the TIF at 8 hospitals sequentially, with&#xD;
      start times randomized by stepped-wedge design. Specifically, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      determine the effectiveness the TIF to function as a checklist for increasing the appropriate&#xD;
      use of key performance indicators during care of the injured in emergency units of&#xD;
      non-tertiary hospitals in Ghana, as assessed by independent observers; to determine the&#xD;
      percent of injured patients with adequate data on initial assessment before vs. after&#xD;
      introduction of the TIF in emergency units of non-tertiary hospitals in Ghana; and to&#xD;
      increase the capacity of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and the&#xD;
      network of non-tertiary hospitals in southern Ghana to undertake high-quality trauma care&#xD;
      research, including clinical trials.&#xD;

      Background: Injuries constitute an important public health problem in Ghana and other low-&#xD;
      and middle-income countries (LMIC). The large burden of injury can be reduced by&#xD;
      strengthening the process of care (1). The period of initial assessment and care of the&#xD;
      injured has been identified as having the potential for significant errors (2, 3). Quality&#xD;
      improvement efforts can reduce these errors (4, 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic approach to the initial assessment and care of the injured ensures early&#xD;
      detection of life-threatening conditions, prompting timely performance of necessary&#xD;
      interventions (6, 7). The WHO Trauma Care Checklist (TCC), specifically developed for the&#xD;
      early assessment and care of injured patients, led to improvements in key performance&#xD;
      indicators of care as well as a decrease in mortality (1). Despite the usefulness of&#xD;
      checklists in surgical practice, many countries report low usage rates (8-11). One unique&#xD;
      barrier with the TCC is its application at the end of the initial trauma assessment, by which&#xD;
      time some members of the trauma team may have left (12). Other approaches that would trigger&#xD;
      more automatic use of the checklist might achieve the objectives of the TCC while improving&#xD;
      compliance to its use. The Trauma Intake Form (TIF) to be tested in this study has been&#xD;
      designed to achieve this goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional functionality of the TIF is improving data recording for both better immediate&#xD;
      clinical care and better ability to conduct quality improvement programs. Data elements&#xD;
      needed for this purpose were created through a Delphi process to develop a set of key&#xD;
      performance indicators that were deemed to be accurate proxies of quality trauma care, simple&#xD;
      to measure and feasible to collect at non-tertiary hospitals of LMICs (13). The TIF was&#xD;
      created as a means of operationalizing key performance indicators by building them into the&#xD;
      clinical chart of injured patients undergoing initial care in emergency units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extent to which a systematic approach is employed in the initial assessment of injured&#xD;
      patients arriving at emergency units of district and regional hospitals in Ghana is unknown.&#xD;
      With successful training of emergency health service providers in the use of the TIF and its&#xD;
      subsequent adoption, improvements in systematic assessment and care of the injured in these&#xD;
      hospitals can be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 1. To determine the effectiveness of the TIF to function as a checklist for&#xD;
      increasing the appropriate use of key performance indicators during care of the injured in&#xD;
      emergency units in district and regional hospitals in Ghana, as assessed by independent&#xD;
      observers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The TIF will increase the appropriate use of key performance indicators by&#xD;
      significant and clinically meaningful levels. For example, we expect the TIF to increase the&#xD;
      percent of all injured patients whose blood pressure is checked at arrival by a minimum of&#xD;
      8%, and increase the percent of those with heart rate checked by a minimum of 8%. For&#xD;
      seriously injured patients, we expect the TIF to improve the achievement of additional key&#xD;
      performance indicators by clinically meaningful levels. For example, we expect the TIF to&#xD;
      increase the percent of patients with chest examination by a minimum of 8%, increase the&#xD;
      percent of patients with hemoperitoneum ruled out by a minimum of 12%, and improve the&#xD;
      percent of patients with examination of all distal pulses by a minimum of 13%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 2. To determine the percent of injured patients with adequate data on initial&#xD;
      assessment before vs. after introduction of the TIF in emergency units in district and&#xD;
      regional hospitals in Ghana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis. The TIF will increase documentation of important clinical data on injured&#xD;
      patients (including all of the following: time of injury, mechanism of injury, respiratory&#xD;
      rate at presentation, heart rate at presentation, blood pressure at presentation,&#xD;
      consciousness level at presentation, temperature at presentation, and time of disposition) by&#xD;
      at least 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 3. To increase the capacity of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and&#xD;
      Technology and the network of district and regional hospitals in to undertake high-quality&#xD;
      trauma care research, including clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods A pragmatic randomized clinical trial will be carried out at 8 district and regional&#xD;
      hospitals in Ghana. The intervention to be tested is the TIF to be used in recording&#xD;
      information about injured patients during their initial assessment and care and which is&#xD;
      designed to decrease omission of critical steps in care and so to improve care and also&#xD;
      record keeping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unit of randomization will be hospitals and a stepped-wedge design will be used to select&#xD;
      which hospitals will start use of the TIF at what time. We have select eight hospitals across&#xD;
      four regions in Ghana to represent district or regional hospitals with more than adequate&#xD;
      flow of injured patients (â‰¥75 patients per month)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of the TIF will be assessed at the 8 study hospitals by measuring the use&#xD;
      of key performance indicators during initial care of the injured before vs. after&#xD;
      introduction of the TIF. Data on the key performance indicators will be obtained from&#xD;
      observations by research assistants (RAs) of care provided by Emergency Health Service&#xD;
      Providers (EHSPs) and by data from medical records. The investigators will obtain written&#xD;
      consent from the EHSPs whose actions will be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will then station RAs in the emergency units of recruited hospitals to&#xD;
      observe EHSP practices regarding initial care of the injured using an observation form&#xD;
      (derived from the TIF) as the investigators observe EHSPs assess and manage each participant&#xD;
      arriving during the 8-hour shift of the RAs. The RAs will fill the form without interaction&#xD;
      with EHSPs or the participant. For any components of the assessment and management that RAs&#xD;
      are unable to directly observe, RAs will obtain information from the participants records to&#xD;
      complete the observation form before the participant leaves the emergency unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After introduction of the TIF, RAs will complete the observation form for each participant as&#xD;
      before. Prior to the participant leaving the emergency unit, RAs will make a blinded copy of&#xD;
      the TIF completed by the EHSP in assessing and managing the participant. RAs will complete&#xD;
      the observation form with information from participants records and/or from the EHSP-filled&#xD;
      TIF. Both before and after introduction of the TIF, RAs will review the medical records of&#xD;
      all participants observed for additional safety-related data, including occurrence of&#xD;
      complications or death. These details will also be obtained from medical records at time of&#xD;
      discharge for all participants who are admitted to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will employ a stepped-wedge design in sequentially introducing the TIF to&#xD;
      the 8 selected hospitals considered as 4 groups of 2 hospitals each. First, following 14&#xD;
      weeks of initial observation of EHSP practices at all 8 selected hospitals, the investigators&#xD;
      will conduct a training workshop for EHSPs of the first randomly-selected group of hospitals&#xD;
      on use of the TIF. Following the workshop, the EHSPs will be encouraged to begin use of the&#xD;
      TIF at their hospitals. After another 14 weeks, the investigators will conduct the two-day&#xD;
      training workshop for the next group of randomly selected hospitals, after which use of the&#xD;
      TIF will begin at those hospitals. The investigators will continue this sequential conduct of&#xD;
      training workshops followed by use of TIF every 14 weeks until all 8 hospitals have been&#xD;
      exhausted. The RAs will continue to observe EHSP practices for a further 14 weeks during&#xD;
      which the TIF will be in use at all 8 hospitals. The total duration of observation of EHSP&#xD;
      practices will be 70 weeks. At the end of year one, the investigators will organize a one-day&#xD;
      workshop for leadership of participating hospitals to review study progress.&#xD;
