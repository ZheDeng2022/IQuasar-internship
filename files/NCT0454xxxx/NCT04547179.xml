      To understand the impacts of using a fixed orthotic facial exercise appliance (BLAfit®) for&#xD;
      migraine reduction, as compared to medication (fremanezumab-vfrm) and control.&#xD;

      The investigators will be studying the impacts of using an orthotic facial exercise device&#xD;
      (BLAfit®) in the prevention of migraines for those who suffer from roughly 10-15 migraines&#xD;
      per month. In order to test the efficacy of this device and its exercise routine,&#xD;
      investigators will have one arm of our study receive the BLAfit® device and perform the&#xD;
      exercises for one minute daily for three months. In Arm #2, there will be another treatment:&#xD;
      Ajovy® (fremanezumab-vfrm) injections- which is a known and commonly practiced clinical&#xD;
      prevention treatment for migraine patients. Patients in this arm will receive three&#xD;
      injections of Ajovy, which is will be meant to last 3 months. In addition, investigators will&#xD;
      have a placebo group that will receive three saline injections, which are meant to mimic the&#xD;
      three Ajovy® injections. Arms #2 and #3 of this study will be conducted in a double-blind&#xD;
      fashion, as both the clinician providing the injections and the patients receiving the&#xD;
      injections will not know if the injecting substance is Ajovy or saline, so as to minimize&#xD;
      bias. All patients in all three months will log their number and pain level of their&#xD;
      migraines each day for three months. Upon conclusion, they will meet with our in-house&#xD;
      neurologist (Principal Investigator &amp; Sponsor) for a final in-person evaluation and&#xD;
      questionnaire. Results from the three groups will then be analyzed.&#xD;
