  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare cost has increased drastically in the last decade, and over 50% of the cost can be&#xD;
      attributed to a small portion (5-10%) of the population. Certain clinical programs, such as&#xD;
      home-based care, aim to reduce this utilization but need methods to identify the most&#xD;
      appropriate patients to enroll. The Investigators believe that data-driven approaches can&#xD;
      optimize this new healthcare delivery system to target patients who may likely benefit from&#xD;
      the program. The primary aim of this project is to determine the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      Geisinger at Home ™ (GaH) program on survival, emergency department (ED) visits and&#xD;
      hospitalizations in multiple patient populations defined by clinical characteristics.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Geisinger at Home™ brings personalized healthcare to eligible Geisinger Gold Medicare&#xD;
      Advantage members where they live. Geisinger's at-home care program aims to keep patients&#xD;
      healthier, safer, and better connected to their healthcare team. Working closely with&#xD;
      patients' primary care physicians, Geisinger's team of doctors, registered nurses,&#xD;
      dietitians, case managers, pharmacists and other medical support staff can visit patients as&#xD;
      needed. The goal of the program is to meet the health needs of patients with chronic health&#xD;
      conditions through regular home visits, potentially reducing acute exacerbations of these&#xD;
      conditions requiring trips to the emergency room or hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Geisinger at Home's spectrum of care includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Checkups Routine testing Wound care Respiratory care Nutritional needs Urgent care Specialty&#xD;
      care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are about 7,000 Geisinger Gold members enrolled in the Geisinger at Home&#xD;
      program and over 11,000 are eligible based on current screening approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A fundamental operational challenge of this program is determining how to optimally&#xD;
      deploy/distribute its scarce resources-the members of the care team-among those 7,000&#xD;
      enrolled members to the optimize their impact. The current screening process uses limited&#xD;
      data (billing codes) and simple heuristics for assessing patient risk, and does not leverage&#xD;
      the rich, highly granular clinical data available, such as imaging, laboratory values, and&#xD;
      vital signs, which can greatly enhance the ability to accurately predict outcomes and&#xD;
      identify patients most appropriate for the program. The Investigators believe that using&#xD;
      these more granular data can optimize this new healthcare delivery system to target patients&#xD;
      who have the highest risk of future healthcare utilization or adverse events such as death.&#xD;
      As a proof-of-concept, the Investigators generated a machine learning model to predict risk&#xD;
      of future utilization in the next 12 months. This model utilized 191 input variables&#xD;
      including clinical data, imaging measures, comorbidities, medications, past utilization&#xD;
      metrics, as well as social metrics. The results showed that the machine learning model had&#xD;
      the ability to predict utilization endpoints compared to current screening approaches&#xD;
      utilizing billing code data. The Investigators now seek to prospectively evaluate the effect&#xD;
      that GaH interventions have on patient outcomes (e.g., hospitalizations and ED visits,&#xD;
      mortality), when informed by these accurate predictive modeling results and other&#xD;
      stratification approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design This is a prospective pragmatic randomized controlled study to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of GaH intervention on eligible patients as compared against current best practices&#xD;
      for care management. Patients will be identified and screened based on available data from&#xD;
      the EHR, randomly assigned GaH intervention or standard of care (SoC) and followed for 6&#xD;
      months. The primary endpoints of the study are number of hospitalizations and ED visits.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint will be 6-month survival after enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed Procedures: Once the cohorts are identified, cohort 2 (controls) will continue to&#xD;
      receive standard clinical care and management. There will be no intent for members of the&#xD;
      project team to intervene or interact with these individuals. Cohort 1 will be onboarded for&#xD;
      GaH intervention through the clinically directed process by the GaH team. Of note, the&#xD;
      purpose of this project is not to define, control, or evaluate the specific details of the&#xD;
      GaH process or procedure, but to evaluate its effectiveness as an alternative clinical care&#xD;
      path in this setting. As such, the specific details and actions of the GaH care team in each&#xD;
      patient interaction are left to their medical discretion.&#xD;
