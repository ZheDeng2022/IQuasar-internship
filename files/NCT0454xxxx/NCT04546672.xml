  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colon and rectal surgery is associated with high cost, long length of stay, high&#xD;
      postoperative surgical site infection rate, high incidence of postoperative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting, and a high rate of hospital readmission. Return of bowel function is of utmost&#xD;
      importance in avoiding patient discomfort, morbidity, and mortality after colorectal surgery.&#xD;
      All patient having colorectal surgery receive neuromuscular paralysis, which is reversed at&#xD;
      the end of surgery with either glycopyrrolate and neostigmine, or sugammadex. Glycopyrrolate&#xD;
      and neostigmine both affect bowel function. Sugammadex has no effect on bowel function. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine if a strategy of neuromuscular reversal with&#xD;
      sugammadex, instead of glycopyrrolate and neostigmine, may increase gastric emptying after&#xD;
      surgery and lead to less postoperative complications.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Colon and rectal surgery is associated with high cost, long length of stay, high&#xD;
      postoperative surgical site infection rate, high incidence of postoperative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting, and a high rate of hospital readmission. The 30-day mortality rate after open or&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer is high-between 3 and 8%. Return of bowel function&#xD;
      is of utmost importance in avoiding patient discomfort, morbidity, and mortality after&#xD;
      colorectal surgery. The incidence of postoperative ileus after colorectal surgery has been&#xD;
      reported to be 10-25%. Postoperative ileus is defined as intolerance of oral intake due to a&#xD;
      lack of coordinated bowel motility. Significant attention has been paid to the development of&#xD;
      guidelines and programs to reduce the incidence of postoperative ileus and accelerate return&#xD;
      of bowel function after colorectal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) and the Society of American&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) created an enhanced recovery after surgery&#xD;
      (ERAS) protocol to promote the following outcomes in patients undergoing colorectal surgery:&#xD;
      &quot;freedom from nausea, freedom from pain at rest, early return of bowel function, improved&#xD;
      wound healing, and early hospital discharge&quot;. An intervention that facilitates faster&#xD;
      postoperative gastric emptying may impact many of these outcomes; in particular, nausea may&#xD;
      be reduced, constipation-associated pain at rest may decline, return of bowel function would&#xD;
      be accelerated, and time to hospital discharge may be shortened. While administration of&#xD;
      medications such as Alvimopan and adjustments in anesthetic technique (providing epidural&#xD;
      analgesia, minimizing crystalloid administration, using multimodal analgesia) are&#xD;
      recommended, sugammadex is not currently considered in the ERAS protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuromuscular paralysis is required for the duration of open and laparoscopic colorectal&#xD;
      surgery to decrease patient movement, improve operating conditions, and at times facilitate&#xD;
      ventilation. Neostigmine and glycopyrrolate are commonly used to reverse rocuronium&#xD;
      neuromuscular blockade at the end of surgery. Both neostigmine and glycopyrrolate impact&#xD;
      bowel function. Neostigmine promotes and glycopyrrolate slows gastrointestinal motility.&#xD;
      Co-administration of neostigmine and glycopyrrolate can have variable effects on return of&#xD;
      bowel function after surgery. In general, administering a higher proportion of neostigmine&#xD;
      than glycopyrrolate is associated with faster return of bowel function. Unopposed cholinergic&#xD;
      activity from neostigmine administration can cause morbidity including bradycardia,&#xD;
      bronchoconstriction, hypotension, urinary incontinence, and increased salivary secretions.&#xD;
      Thus, the ratio of neostigmine to glycopyrrolate is relatively fixed and cannot be adjusted&#xD;
      to promote desired gastrointestinal outcomes. Sugammadex does not bind to acetylcholine&#xD;
      receptors on bowel and is presumed not to affect bowel function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some investigations into the contribution of sugammadex versus acetylcholinesterase&#xD;
      inhibitors to recovery of bowel function have been completed. In retrospective studies,&#xD;
      sugammadex administration has been associated with faster time to first bowel movement and&#xD;
      less ileus-related delays in hospital discharge. Conversely, two randomized, controlled&#xD;
      clinical trials found no difference in outcomes related to gastrointestinal motility&#xD;
      including time to first flatus, time to first bowel movement, and incidence of postoperative&#xD;
      ileus. One randomized, controlled trial found a shorter time to first flatus, but no&#xD;
      difference in time to first bowel movement. Lastly, one study found a trend towards faster&#xD;
      gastric emptying with sugammadex. A limitation of the aforementioned prospective studies is&#xD;
      they include patients having surgery on their thyroid gland, gallbladder, and other&#xD;
      intraabdominal organs. These surgeries lack bowel handling and anastomosis, which translates&#xD;
      to less effect on postoperative bowel function. It is hypothesized that a randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trial involving patients having colorectal surgery will find faster gastric&#xD;
      emptying, less nausea, and less gastrointestinal complications (including ileus) when&#xD;
      sugammadex is administered to reverse rocuronium neuromuscular blockade, compared to&#xD;
      neostigmine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if administering sugammadex for reversal of&#xD;
      neuromuscular blockade instead of neostigmine and glycopyrrolate, a strategy that avoids&#xD;
      cholinergic effects on the bowel, is associated with faster gastric emptying, faster time to&#xD;
      achieve a TOFr &gt; 0.9, less post-surgical gastrointestinal complications, shorter time to&#xD;
      first bowel movement, shorter PACU phase 1 recovery, and shorter hospital length of stay. If&#xD;
      sugammadex is shown to improve the aforementioned outcomes, an argument can be made that&#xD;
      sugammadex should be considered for inclusion in the ERAS protocol for Colorectal surgery.&#xD;
