  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The return of eyelid function and facial expression in Patients with facial nerve affection&#xD;
      is very important for quality of life. Eyelid dysfunction leads to drying and ulceration of&#xD;
      cornea which may lead to permanent vision loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facial paralysis is distinguished into two main groups according to the presence or absence&#xD;
      of facial fibrillations at needle Electromyography. Recent paralysis, mainly lasting less&#xD;
      than two years generally show these signs and are eligible for reactivation of facial nerve&#xD;
      by anastomosing it to a donor one (early facial reanimation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The masseteric nerve (motor branch of trigeminal nerve ) is a reliable donor nerve on early&#xD;
      facial reanimation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The deep temporal nerves are motor branches of trigeminal nerve which have some advantage&#xD;
      over masseteric nerve as they are longer and reach the zygomatic and frontal branch of facial&#xD;
      nerve and it can reach the eyelid and eyebrow to be used for direct neurotization and it&#xD;
      supplies temporalis muscle which is an expandable muscle with little effect on mastication&#xD;
      and it was reported that they can restore blinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So on this study we examine the advantages and disadvantages of both nerves to develop a&#xD;
      protocol for use of both especially on eyelid reanimation and restoration of blinking on&#xD;
      upper facial segment paresis&#xD;

      Type of the study: Prospective Interventional Study (clinical trial)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Model Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into two groups according to the surgical procedure performed as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: Deep temporal nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: Masseteric nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation and Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four patients will be randomly assigned to Group A or Group B (2 equal groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple randomization will be performed before surgery by a research nurse using the&#xD;
      closed-envelope technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four closed envelopes will be used, each 12 of them carries one of the 2 groups.&#xD;
      Closed envelope will be randomly withdrawn the night before surgery to assign the patient to&#xD;
      his specific group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting: Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Department, Assuit University Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Facial nerve paresis with upper eyelid affection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients are generally fit with no other disease interfere with microsurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Electromyography of eyelid showing fibrillations. b. Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Patient with other medical or mental disease causing generalized paralysis. 2. Syndromic&#xD;
      cases. 3. Patients are generally unfit or with any disease interfere with microsurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Electromyography of eyelid showing no fibrillations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation: 24 Sample size was calculated using G power program version 3.1.9.4&#xD;
      (6) in order to detect a significant difference in mean of palpebral fissure height (one of&#xD;
      main assessed outcomes in the study ) between two groups under the study , assumed effect&#xD;
      size 0.6 based on clinical assumption ( novel study ), Î± error 0.3 , power 0.80, and&#xD;
      allocation ratio 1: 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-two patient plus 10% for dropouts to make total twenty-four (12 patient for every&#xD;
      group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study tools&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in this study are subjected to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All patients will do preoperative clinical and neurophysiological assessments of mimetic&#xD;
           muscle function and donor nerve status (the ipsilateral deep temporal nerve. The&#xD;
           neurophysiological tests will include needle Electromyography (EMG) for recruitment of&#xD;
           residual motor unit action potential. If there are no fibrillations patients will have&#xD;
           another surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The trigeminal motor component will be tested by palpating the temporalis muscle during&#xD;
           chewing and via needle EMG of the temporalis muscle to verify availability as a donor&#xD;
           motor nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Photographic documentation preoperative using standardized frontal face view and adding&#xD;
           a scale to photo to measure the palpebral fissure size during three states normal eye&#xD;
           opening, resting eye closure and forced eye closure using ImageJ (image processing and&#xD;
           analysis in java) computer software (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Ophthalmological assessment of the affected eye for detection of redness, ulcer, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A We will avoid the use of muscle relaxants to induce anaesthesia and employ an&#xD;
      electro-stimulator to identify the deep temporal nerves and the facial nerve branches&#xD;
      supplying the eyelid on the affected side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploration on the affected side a facelift-type incision will be performed, and an anterior&#xD;
      subcutaneous flap is then will be lifted for several centimetres. In the inferior zygomatic&#xD;
      region, the plane of elevation is deepened into the sub-SMAS plane and a composite flap&#xD;
      elevated for several centimetres. Following elevation in this plane, the distal facial nerve&#xD;
      branches will be identified. The distal portion of the zygomatic nerve is usually located&#xD;
      midway between the oral commissure and the helical root. and was confirmed by nerve&#xD;
      stimulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The deep temporal fascia and temporalis muscle will be incised along the temporal fusion line&#xD;
      and will be reflected from the skull to expose the divisions of the deep temporal nerves and&#xD;
      the longest branch was traced and prepared for anastomosis end to end with the zygomatic&#xD;
      branch after confirming the eyelid supply(8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then suction drain will be put and will be removed after 24 hours. Group B The same procedure&#xD;
      except tracing the masseteric nerve related to masseter muscle and anastomosis will be the&#xD;
      same (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative All patient will receive physiotherapy and post-operative follow up to detect&#xD;
      any wound complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation (After 6 months from the operation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Photo documentation: measurement of the palpebral fissure size during three states&#xD;
           normal eye opening, resting eye closure , forced eye closure will be done adding eye&#xD;
           closure during mastication to compare with preoperative resting eye closure measure&#xD;
           using ImageJ (image processing and analysis in java) computer software(7).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Donor site morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow up Ophthalmological assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General surgical complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. General complication due to general anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Specific complication:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Delayed healing of nerve anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Affection of mastication.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. No postoperative improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Primary (main): Comparing the outcomes on palpebral fissure size between the deep temporal&#xD;
      group and the masseteric group after 6 months from the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Secondary (subsidiary):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Procedure-related morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Operative time and hospital stay.&#xD;
