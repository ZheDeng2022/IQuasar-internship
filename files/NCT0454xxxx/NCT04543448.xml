  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MS patients were randomly divided into traditional therapy and traditional therapy + cervical&#xD;
      mobilization groups. While muscle strengthening, stretching, balance and coordination&#xD;
      exercises were given to the traditional group, cervical mobilization was applied in addition&#xD;
      to these in cervical group. Patients received treatments twice a week for 4 weeks. The effect&#xD;
      of the applied treatment on the tonus and plantar pressure distribution was analyzed.&#xD;
      Treatments were interrupted for 4 weeks and the groups continued with the treatment they did&#xD;
      not receive (crossover design). The group that received traditional treatment in the first&#xD;
      period completed traditional + cervical mobilization, and the other group with traditional +&#xD;
      cervical mobilization traditionally completed the treatment.&#xD;

      Cervical region is rich in terms of muscle spindle and reseptors. When this region is touched&#xD;
      by physiotherapists, muscle spindles is activited. The cervical region is parasympathetic&#xD;
      area have common relaxed effect. Thus this part can be benefit to improvement of balance. As&#xD;
      improve balance, the plantar pressure distribution of patients may change.&#xD;

    <description>Pedobarography system was used for plantar pressure analyses. Pedobarography system contains screen, color printer, pressure sensor platform, remote control device, power unit, printer-to-platform and screen-to-platform connections. The maximum and mean pressure in the foot, the percentages of pressure values in the fore and rear of the foot, percentages of the total pressure falling to the foot were evaluated. As higher values mean higher load.</description>

    <measure>Change Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from plantar pressure distribution at one month</time_frame>
    <description>Romberg test (RT) was performed on the patients with eyes closed and feet together. When the participant held it in one place, the test was terminated, oscillations began, or was likely to fall. Romberg test's maximum duration was 120 sec. RT is clinically used for vestibular problems.&#xD;
Sharpened Romberg (SR) was performed on a straight line with one leg behind the other leg, eyes open, leaving the arms sagging and without impairing the balance. Duration stop criteria were defined as the time that took a participant to dislocate the foot, reach the maximal duration of 30 sec, and contact the observer to avoid falling.&#xD;
Individuals' dynamic balance was evaluated with the Functional Reach Test (FRT). Individuals had requested their hands at 90 degrees by keeping the dominant arms' elbow straight on the wall. The test was performed as reaching forward without taking a step and losing the balance on the wall. The metacarpal bone level was marked in the start position and final position</description>

    <description>Modified Ashworth Scale measures resistance during passive soft-tissue stretching and is used as a simple measure of spasticity. The minimum value is 1 and the maximum value is 4. Whether higher scores mean a worse outcome</description>

    <description>Traditional Rehabilitation program was included strengthening exercises for the muscles needed, balance and coordination exercises according to the individual's level, stretching for the lower limbs in all individuals. Indıvıduals participated in 2 training sessions per week for 4 weeks. Each training session consisted of a 5-minute non-balance coordination exercise, a 30-minute balance and coordination exercise, a 10-minute stretching and strengthing.</description>

Cervical mobilization includes suboccipital relaxing techniques, myofascial muscle relaxing techniques for Levator scapula, trapezius, scalenes muscles. These techniques were applied bilaterally.</description>
