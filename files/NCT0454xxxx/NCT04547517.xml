      This study aims to translate the original Counselor Competencies Scale-Revised (CCS-R,&#xD;
      English version) into traditional Chinese. It will then test the psychometric properties of&#xD;
      the newly translated CCS-R to examine its factorial structure using both exploratory factor&#xD;
      analysis (EFA) and CFA.&#xD;

      Clinical supervisors are charged with facilitating the development of their supervisees&#xD;
      toward becoming ethical and competent. In addition, clinical supervisors are expected to&#xD;
      serve as gatekeepers for the profession and deny entry to students who demonstrate a&#xD;
      deficiency of necessary competencies. Despite the developmental and remedial expectations for&#xD;
      clinical supervisors, specific guidelines to direct clinical supervisors' evaluation of their&#xD;
      supervisees' level of counseling competencies are limited. The lack of agreed-upon and&#xD;
      standardized evaluation criteria for supervisees' minimum level of counseling competencies&#xD;
      and the limited availability of tested assessments to measure supervisees' counseling&#xD;
      competencies fosters subjectivity in supervisory assessment and potential remediation.&#xD;
      Therefore, additional research is warranted relating to clinical supervisory evaluation&#xD;
      instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supervisory evaluation is &quot;the nucleus of clinical supervision&quot;. Specifically, &quot;supervisors&#xD;
      document and provide supervisees with ongoing feedback regarding their performance and&#xD;
      schedule periodic formal evaluative sessions throughout the supervisory relationship&quot;.&#xD;
      However, clinical supervisors are often uncomfortable in evaluating their supervisees.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, effective and ethical supervision supports supervisees' development of&#xD;
      counseling competencies in which supervisors provide their supervisees with both formative&#xD;
      and summative evaluative feedback within the context of a strong supervisory alliance.&#xD;
      Limited research was identified investigating supervisory evaluation processes with&#xD;
      standardized assessment tools such as the counselling competencies in Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial quantitative investigation of the 23-item counselling competencies scale-revised&#xD;
      (CCS-R) supported the construct validity (e.g., exploratory factor analysis identified a&#xD;
      ﬁve-factor model [professional behaviors, professional behaviors, counseling skills,&#xD;
      assessment and application, and professional dispositions], accounting for 72.61% of the&#xD;
      variance), internal consistency reliability, interrater reliability (r ¼.570), and&#xD;
      criterion-related validity (correlation between supervisees' practicum course grade and ﬁnal&#xD;
      CCS score, r ¼.407,) of the instrument. The researchers concluded that &quot;the CCS is a&#xD;
      promising instrument for assessment in counselor education and supervision&quot;. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      qualitative data are warranted to evaluate the CCS with a sample of clinical supervisors and&#xD;
      their supervisees around its (a) functionality in communication of supervisory feedback with&#xD;
      the CCS, (b) consistency in CCS evaluation, and (c) emotional reactions to supervisory&#xD;
      evaluation with the CCS. Therefore, this study aims to translate the original Counselor&#xD;
      Competencies Scale-Revised (CCS-R, English version) into traditional Chinese. It will then&#xD;
      test the psychometric properties of the newly translated CCS-R to examine its factorial&#xD;
      structure using both exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and CFA.&#xD;

    <description>The counselling competencies scale-revised is a 23-item scale measuring Counselor Competencies. It includes two factors, which are counselling skills &amp; therapeutic conditions with 12 items, and counselling dispositions &amp;behaviors with 11 items. Each of the items has a range of 1-5 points (0 indicates poor performance, while 5 indicates performance exceeding expectations). The 12 and 11 components scores are summed to yield two scores, with a range of 12-60 points and 11-55 points respectively.</description>
