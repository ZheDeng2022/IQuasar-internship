      The study is designed in 2 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle 1 will incorporate 20 participants and include a screening / enrollment visit and 1&#xD;
      study visit. The study visit will be 30 hours and involves SQ administration of placebo&#xD;
      (n=10) or MANP 2.5 ug/kg (n=10). Cycle 2 will incorporate 10 participants and include a&#xD;
      screening / enrollment visit and 1 study visit. The study visit will be 30 hours and involves&#xD;
      SQ administration of MANP 5 ug/kg (n=10). Studies will be performed at either the CRU of Mayo&#xD;
      Clinic's CCaTS in Rochester, Minnesota or the University of Mississippi CRU in Jackson,&#xD;
      Mississippi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have a screening / enrollment visit where a medical history will be&#xD;
      obtained and physical examination performed. At this visit informed consent will also be&#xD;
      obtained. Hypertension validation as described above will follow. Once hypertension is&#xD;
      validated, subjects will be scheduled for the study visit where either placebo or MANP will&#xD;
      be administered at Mayo Clinic's or the University of Mississippi's CRU. Three days prior to&#xD;
      the study visit, subjects will be initiated on a moderate sodium (3.0g/day) diet. Fluid&#xD;
      intake will be restricted to 2.5 liters per day for all subjects. A 24-hour urine sodium&#xD;
      collection will be obtained on the 24 hours prior to the study visit to establish adherence&#xD;
      to the low sodium diet. Subjects will be maintained on their standard anti-HTN treatment for&#xD;
      the entire duration of the study. At the study visit, subjects will be admitted at 07:00 to&#xD;
      the CRU fasting. For safety purposes, all subjects will remain in the CRU a total of 24 hours&#xD;
      following dosing. The study will be single blind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the study visit, either SQ placebo (n=10) or SQ MANP 2.5 ug/kg (n=10) will be&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will also be admitted at 07:00 to the CRU in the fasting state. Subjects will take&#xD;
      their usual antihypertensive medications in the CRU at time &quot;0 minutes&quot;. Over the next 60&#xD;
      minutes, blood pressure, heart rate, renal clearance, neurohumoral and cGMP assessment will&#xD;
      be performed as outlined in Table 2. Ninety minutes after administration of the participant's&#xD;
      usual antihypertensive medications, SQ placebo or SQ MANP will be administered if the&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure is ≥ 120 mm Hg. Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured before&#xD;
      and at several intervals after SQ placebo or SQ MANP administration. Four clearances of 6 hrs&#xD;
      for total of 24 hrs after the dosing will be performed. At the end of each clearance, the&#xD;
      patients will be asked to drink an amount of water equivalent to the sum of blood losses and&#xD;
      urinary volume. During each clearance, urinary, hormonal, and hemodynamic measurements will&#xD;
      be obtained and averaged for analysis. Subjects will be discharged from the CRU 24 hours&#xD;
      after SQ placebo or SQ MANP administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If ≤2 study participants who received SQ MANP 2.5 μg/kg experience any of the adverse events&#xD;
      listed below then cycle 2 will be initiated. If &gt;2 study participants who received SQ MANP&#xD;
      2.5 μg/kg MANP experience one of the above events then the study will be terminated and we&#xD;
      will not proceed to cycle 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinically significant hypotension, defined as a decrease from baseline in clinical SBP&#xD;
           ≥ 30 mmHg, or a decrease in sitting SBP to &lt; 90 mmHg, or lightheadedness or dizziness or&#xD;
           visual symptoms for 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any other safety results or adverse experiences that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
           investigator, raise concerns about the safety or tolerability of a higher dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle 2 will commence only if subjects in cycle 1 tolerated SQ MANP 2.5 μg/kg without&#xD;
      clinically significant hypotension or other adverse events (as defined above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cycle 2, SQ MANP 5 ug/kg (n=10) will be administered at the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will also be admitted at 07:00 to the CRU in the fasting state. Subjects will take&#xD;
      their usual antihypertensive medications in the CRU at time &quot;0 minutes&quot;. Over the next 60&#xD;
      minutes, blood pressure, heart rate, renal clearance, neurohumoral and cGMP assessment will&#xD;
      be performed as outlined in Table 2. Ninety minutes after administration of the participant's&#xD;
      usual antihypertensive medications, SQ MANP will be administered if the systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure is ≥ 120 mm Hg. Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured before and at several&#xD;
      intervals after SQ placebo or SQ MANP administration. Four clearances of 6 hrs for total of&#xD;
      24 hrs after the dosing will be performed. At the end of each clearance, the patients will be&#xD;
      asked to drink an amount of water equivalent to the sum of blood losses and urinary volume.&#xD;
      During each clearance, urinary, hormonal, and hemodynamic measurements will be obtained and&#xD;
      averaged for analysis. Subjects will be discharged from the CRU 24 hours after SQ placebo or&#xD;
      SQ MANP administration.&#xD;
