  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional study using interviews to explore head and neck cancer patients'&#xD;
      experience of preparing for and completing radiotherapy utilising an immobilisation mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 2 stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first stage is Item generation. Approximately 20 interviews will be conducted with head&#xD;
      and neck cancer patients who have completed or partially completed radiotherapy. The&#xD;
      interviews will capture their experiences and views pertaining to mould making, scans and&#xD;
      radiotherapy, reported associated fear of restriction, suffocation, loss of control and fear&#xD;
      of public embarrassment during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from the interviews will be used to develop potential items for a screening tool for&#xD;
      identification of those patients likely to experience anxiety and claustrophobia before they&#xD;
      start their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second stage is cognitive interviews. Approximately 5 patients included in Stage I will&#xD;
      be invited to take part in a further interview to review the themes and potential&#xD;
      questionnaire items identified from interviews.&#xD;
