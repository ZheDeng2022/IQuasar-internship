  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric emptying is a major risk factor for aspiration of gastric contents.Aspiration into&#xD;
      the lungs represents a fatal complication that can occur during anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not only gastric emptying importance to anesthetists is related to aspiration but also it is&#xD;
      important to determine the systemic availability of substances given through the mouth.&#xD;
      Delayed gastric emptying represents a major danger as it causes nausea and vomiting and&#xD;
      prevents a return to oral feeding. Lastly it may cause morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both humoral and neural influences have their impact on emptying. Volume and composition of&#xD;
      gastric food act as major determinants for the rate of gastric emptying. The effect of body&#xD;
      weight on gastric emptying are inconsistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASA fasting guidelines application represents the primary method to avoid aspiration as it&#xD;
      ensures that stomach is empty before induction of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These guidelines cannot be applied on all cases as in urgent or emergent situations or in&#xD;
      morbidities associated with delayed gastric emptying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound can be used perioperatively to asses gastric content and volume at bedside.&#xD;

      The objective of the current study is to evaluate gastric residual volume in obese patients&#xD;
      versus healthy controls scheduled for elective surgery, using gastric ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective observational study was performed on 100 patients undergoing elective&#xD;
      surgery from July 2019 to June 2020 at Fayoum University hospital after approval of the local&#xD;
      institutional ethical committee (M420). A detailed informed consent was signed by the&#xD;
      eligible participants before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study adheres to the CONSORT guidelines. The study was conducted on 100 Patients were&#xD;
      assigned to one of two groups of (50) patients in each group. Group obese ASA II from( 30-40)&#xD;
      BMI, ASA III above 40 BMI without other comorbidities and group non obese ASA I control.Obese&#xD;
      patients whose BMI &gt;30 and healthy patients whose BMI = 18-24.9 who was scheduled for an&#xD;
      elective surgery were included in this trial. All patients were enrolled in the study aged&#xD;
      above &gt;20 y. This study included patients scheduled for elective surgery after 8-hour&#xD;
      overnight fast after a light meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound scanning:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focused gastric ultrasound by was performed by a trained physician in semi-sitting position&#xD;
      then right lateral position using low frequency (2-5MHz) mindray curved transducer and&#xD;
      mindray DP-20 ultrasound system. The antrum of the stomach was located in the epigastrium&#xD;
      after a sweep of the probe from left to right subcostal margins. This could be done using&#xD;
      left lobe of liver as an anterior landmark and descending abdominal aorta as a posterior&#xD;
      landmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antrum was considered to be empty if flat with juxtaposed anterior and posterior walls,&#xD;
      fluid-containing if distended with thin walls and hypoechoic contents, solid -containing if&#xD;
      distended with a content with mixed echogenicity according to antral shape and contents .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antral cross sectional area (CSA) was measured using the two antral dimensions,&#xD;
      craniocaudal (D1) and anteroposterior (D2) dimensions, according to the following equation: π&#xD;
      [D1×D2]/4 provided that π = 22/7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gastric residual volume was calculated according to patient position as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bouvet and colleagues equation for semi-sitting position: gastric residual volume (ml) =215 +&#xD;
      57 log CSA (mm2) - 0.78 age (year) - 0.16 height (cm) - 0.25 weight (kg) - 0.80 ASA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perlas and colleagues equation for right lateral position: gastric residual volume (ml) =&#xD;
      27.0 + 14.6 × right-lateral CSA - 1.28 × age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the classification of Ven de Putte and perlas, the study could asses the risk of&#xD;
      aspiration as follows: (a) low risk of aspiration: patients with empty antrum and patients&#xD;
      with gastric residual volume less than 1.5 ml/kg.(b) high risk of aspiration: patients with&#xD;
      solid contents and patients with gastric residual volume more than 1.5 ml/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasogastric tube (18-french) was inserted after induction of anaesthesia and endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation. Aspiration of gastric contents was performed through gentle suction using 50 ml&#xD;
      syringe with synchronous epigastric massage and gentle movement of nasogastric tube in and&#xD;
      out for 10 minutes after confirmation of nasogastric tube position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The collected data were organized, tabulated and statistically analyzed&#xD;
      using SPSS software statistical computer package version 22 (SPSS Inc, USA). Numerical&#xD;
      variables were not normally distributed and were presented as median and interquartile range&#xD;
      (IQR); Mann-Whitney U test was used as a test of significant. Qualitative data were presented&#xD;
      as numbers and percentages, and the chi-squared test was used to determine significance. A&#xD;
      two-sided P-value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Sample size calculated using G-Power© software version 3.1.7 results with effect&#xD;
      size (0.57), two sided (two tails) type I error 0.05 and power of 80%, each group should&#xD;
      include at least (50) Subjects. the authors expected no dropout rates or missing data.&#xD;
