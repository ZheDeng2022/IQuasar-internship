  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients in Iceland with STEMI (2008-2018) and NSTEMI (2013-2018) that underwent coronary&#xD;
      angiography and had obstructive coronary artery disease were included. Information about&#xD;
      patients and angiography results and treatment were obtained from the Swedish Coronary&#xD;
      Angiography and Angioplasty Registry (SCAAR). Survival was estimated with Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
      method. Cox regression analysis were used to identify significant risk factors for long-term&#xD;
      mortality. Relative survival was defined as observed survival divided by expected survival of&#xD;
      the population of Iceland&#xD;

      Methods This is a retrospective observational nationwide study of all patients, aged 18 years&#xD;
      and older, who underwent coronary angiography for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during&#xD;
      the study period. All procedures were performed at Landspitali University Hospital, which is&#xD;
      a tertiary referral center and the only institution performing coronary angiographies in&#xD;
      Iceland. The study period was from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2018 for ST elevation&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (STEMI and from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2018 for non-ST&#xD;
      elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). For multiple admissions, the first was retained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about patient demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities,&#xD;
      angiography results and treatment were obtained from the Swedish Coronary Angiography and&#xD;
      Angioplasty Registry (SCAAR), a Swedish Web-based database also used in Iceland that&#xD;
      prospectively record both patient- and procedure-related factors. All data are registered by&#xD;
      the treating physician and nurses at the time of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical definitions Cases of acute myocardial were defined as STEMI and NSTEMI, according to&#xD;
      the current European Society of Cardiology guidelines, and determined by the attending&#xD;
      cardiologist [18]. The NSTEMI diagnosis was introduced into the database 2013 and there was&#xD;
      also a change in the Troponin analysis used at that time. This is the reason why we chose to&#xD;
      have a shorter study period for the NSTEMI patients. We excluded patients that had not&#xD;
      significant coronary artery stenoses. Cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension,&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, smoking status, statin use, body mass index (BMI) and renal function were&#xD;
      recorded. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was staged according to the Kidney Disease Outcome&#xD;
      Quality Initiative (KDOQI) classification. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was&#xD;
      calculated from serum creatinine measurements using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology&#xD;
      Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation, and CKD was defined as eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (stage&#xD;
      3-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior MI, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)&#xD;
      were recorded as defined in the database. Since these were AMI patients, they were all done&#xD;
      urgently but it was also recorded whether they were done acutely as primary PCIs. The results&#xD;
      of the coronary angiography were expressed as the number of vessels involved with significant&#xD;
      stenoses or left main stem disease based on angiographic results. If PCI was performed, it&#xD;
      was recorded whether patients received aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) or adenosine&#xD;
      diphosphate receptor (ADP) inhibitor before or during the procedure. The choice of treatment,&#xD;
      medical therapy alone, PCI or CABG, was at the discretion of the attending interventional&#xD;
      cardiologist and/or the heart team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observed and Expected Survival Data for all-cause mortality were extracted through linkage&#xD;
      with Statistics Iceland. Patients were followed up for their vital status after&#xD;
      hospitalization, with censoring at the end of follow-up on October 23, 2019. Expected&#xD;
      survival was derived from the general population of Iceland matched to observed survival for&#xD;
      the study population by sex, age and year of hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis All calculations were performed using R software version 3.3.3 (R&#xD;
      Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). All continuous variables were&#xD;
      normally distributed and were compared with Student´s t-test and presented as mean ± standard&#xD;
      deviation (SD). Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square test if the observed&#xD;
      data was over five, otherwise Fisher´s Exact test was performed. Statistical significance was&#xD;
      prespecified at 5% (P &lt; 0.05) Kaplan-Meier curve was plotted to assess the estimated&#xD;
      long-term survival and the two groups were compared using a log-rank test. To identify&#xD;
      independent prognostic factors for survival, a Cox multivariate analysis was used,&#xD;
      represented as hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relative survival was defined as the observed survival among patients with AMI divided by&#xD;
      expected survival in populace of Iceland matched by sex, age and year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As individual patients were not identified, obtaining individual consent for the study was&#xD;
      not obtained.&#xD;
