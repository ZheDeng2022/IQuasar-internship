    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to confirm the safety and efficacy of the RenzanTM&#xD;
      Peripheral Stent System when used for treatment of superficial femoral (SFA) and/or popliteal&#xD;
      (POP) artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial plans to include 135 patients in (up to) 10 locations around in Europe.&#xD;

      PRIZER Study is a prospective, multicenter, post-market, single arm study with plan to&#xD;
      include approximately 135 patients eligible to be treated with RenzanTM Peripheral Stent&#xD;
      System stratified in 2 groups: 90 FEM-POP patients (From superficial femoral Artery to the&#xD;
      Proximal edge of patella) and 45 Isolated POP patients (From Hunter's canal to the Origin of&#xD;
      anterior tibial artery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor will work in accordance with standard operating procedures (SOP) and the&#xD;
      Monitoring Plan in order to ensure adherence to the CIP and applicable regulations at the&#xD;
      investigational sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Monitoring Plan is built according to a risk-based monitoring approach and describes the&#xD;
      level of source data verification to be performed by the monitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk-based monitoring approach uses all available means to supervise the trial (central&#xD;
      monitoring, remote monitoring and on-site monitoring), focusing in critical data points and&#xD;
      issues ensuring that adequate monitoring (central, remote and on-site) at each site is&#xD;
      completed to ensure protection of the rights and safety of the subjects and the quality and&#xD;
      integrity of the data collected and submitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor shall provide training and the necessary guidelines to assist each&#xD;
      investigational site on the data collection in the eCRF. Each site is responsible to report&#xD;
      the available data requested by the CIP. In order to ensure data quality and avoid missing&#xD;
      information in the eCRF, edit checks are designed during database development. In addition,&#xD;
      Sponsor's CRA and Data Management team will be responsible to review the data and raise&#xD;
      queries accordingly into the eCRF. An audit trail logging all data entered and edited is&#xD;
      available within the EDC system. All source documents are maintained in the hospital files&#xD;
      ready for inspection by the Sponsor and regulatory authorities upon request. The Sponsor will&#xD;
      inform the investigator of the time period for retaining these records as per applicable&#xD;
      regulatory requirements.&#xD;

    <description>Procedure can be conducted via either contralateral or antegrade approach. After a successful target lesion crossing, predilate the lesion using either plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) or (if necessary) any available specialty balloon. The inflated diameter of the balloon should approximate the diameter of the vessel just distal to the lesion. Proper vessel preparation should achieve diameter of 1:1 to healthy vessel (with ≤20% residual stenosis, as per operator's assessment). Adjunctive debulking devices are prohibited.&#xD;
Final stent selection should be confirmed after a proper vessel preparation, considering the reference vessel diameter (RVD) for the optimal 1:1 stent-to-vessel sizing. The implanted dual layer length would encompass the entire lesion with the micromesh, covering it from healthy to healthy tissue. Post-dilatation of the stent for more optimal placement may be done at operator's discretion, using standard angioplasty with uncoated balloon.</description>

&#xD;
          5. A superficial femoral and/or popliteal artery lesion with &gt; 50% stenosis or total&#xD;
             occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Stenotic or occluded lesion(s) within the same vessel (one long or multiple serial&#xD;

             angiography (treatment of target lesion acceptable after successful treatment of&#xD;
             ipsilateral iliac lesions); Successful ipsilateral iliac artery treatment is defined&#xD;
             as attainment of residual diameter stenosis ≤30% without death or major vascular&#xD;
             complication, either with PTA or stenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The target lesion(s) can be successfully crossed with a guide wire and dilated up to&#xD;
             1:1 to healthy vessel (as per operator's assesment).&#xD;

             contralateral treatment is performed prior to treatment of the target lesion it should&#xD;
             be performed at least 1 day before the index procedure with uncoated devices only.&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Restenotic lesion that had previously been treated by atherectomy, laser or cryoplasty&#xD;
             within 3 months of the index procedure.&#xD;
