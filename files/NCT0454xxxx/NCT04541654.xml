  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn more about variants in the TP53 gene both&#xD;
      associated with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS), a hereditary cancer risk condition, and TP53&#xD;
      variants found in the blood for other reasons (e.g. ACE/CHIP and mosaicism).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study looks to enroll as many people with LFS or TP53 gene variants as possible&#xD;
      in order to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Better estimate cancer risks in individuals with TP53 variants or LFS, which is a rare&#xD;
           condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn the range of cancer risks linked to TP53 variants to help individuals and families&#xD;
           to improve our ability to counsel patients and families about cancer risks more&#xD;
           accurately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve opportunities for cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn more about the meaning of TP53 variants in the blood that are not inherited (e.g.&#xD;
           ACE/CHIP and mosaicism).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collecting information from the participant's medical record and short questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collecting blood, saliva, eyebrow hair and tumor tissue samples (optional).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sharing study information with family members (optional).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 1500 people will take part in this research study. Participants&#xD;
      will be in this study until it closes or the participant withdraws consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Cancer Institute is providing funding for part of this study and is considered a&#xD;
      study sponsor. They will require that some of the genetic information be made available to&#xD;
      the research community without personal identifying information.&#xD;

    <description>Examine accuracy of family history and the extent to which families meet various published Li-Fraumeni family criteria or assess for de-novo mutations using descriptive statistics. Exact binomial confidence limits for percents will be calculated at 95% coverage. Tests of difference between &gt;2 groups for binary variables will use the Fisher exact test.</description>

    <measure>Estimation of Cancer Risks in TP53 mutation carriers</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years or Study closure</time_frame>
    <description>Estimate the frequency in ExAc as a population rate and calculate a standardized risk ratio as the ratio of the prevalence of mutations in a given cancer type compared to that in ExAc. P-values and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated assuming the observed number of mutations follows a Poisson distribution with mean equal to the expected value calculated from the ExAC observed frequency.</description>

    <time_frame>5 years or Study closure</time_frame>
    <description>For each dataset, the following analyses will be performed using MENDEL: a) the relative risk (RR) across age groups is assumed to be constant; b) the RR is assumed to be a continuous, piece wise linear function of age which was constant before age 40 years and after age 60 years, and linear between ages 40 and 60 years</description>
