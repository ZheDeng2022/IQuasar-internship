  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ichthyoses are a group of lifelong genetic disorders that share characteristics of&#xD;
      generalized skin thickening, scaling and underlying cutaneous inflammation. The vast majority&#xD;
      are orphan disorders and are associated with extremely poor quality of life related to social&#xD;
      ostracism from altered appearance, associated itchiness and discomfort, and functional&#xD;
      limitations from the skin disease. Among the more common &quot;orphan&quot; forms of ichthyosis are&#xD;
      autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI; includes lamellar ichthyosis/LI and&#xD;
      congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma/CIE), Netherton syndrome (NS) and epidermolytic&#xD;
      ichthyosis (EI). However, there are dozens of other syndromic and non-syndromic ichthyotic&#xD;
      disorders as well. Therapy is time-consuming for patients or parents and is supportive,&#xD;
      focusing on clearance of the scaling. There are no therapies based on our growing&#xD;
      understanding of what causes the disease. We have recently found marked elevations in&#xD;
      Th17/IL-23 pathway cytokines and chemokines in the skin of individuals with ichthyosis, most&#xD;
      similar to the inflammatory pattern of psoriasis. While the significance of the high&#xD;
      expression of Th17/IL-23 pathway genes across all forms of ichthyosis studied to date is&#xD;
      unknown, the high expression of genes of the Th17/IL-23 pathway in psoriasis is thought to be&#xD;
      causative for the disease manifestations. We propose that IL-12/IL-23 -targeting therapeutics&#xD;
      will safely suppress the inflammation and possibly the other features of ichthyosis,&#xD;
      improving quality of life. As a proof-of-concept study, we propose to treat children (6 years&#xD;
      of age and higher) and adults with ichthyotic disorders with ustekinumab in an open-label&#xD;
      trial to serially assess clinical response to and safety of ustekinumab for this group of&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has provided informed consent; parental consent for patients under 18 years of&#xD;
             age (plus assent for subjects age ≥ 12 and &lt; 18).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects are at least 6 years of age or older at the time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Before screening visit, females must be:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Postmenopausal, defined as&#xD;

        otherwise be incapable of pregnancy), or&#xD;
&#xD;
        If heterosexually active, practicing a highly effective method of birth control, including&#xD;
        hormonal prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections, contraceptive patch,&#xD;
        intrauterine device, double-barrier method (e.g., condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap, with&#xD;
        spermicidal foam, cream, film, gel or suppository), or male partner sterilization,&#xD;
        consistent with local regulations regarding use of birth control methods for subjects&#xD;
