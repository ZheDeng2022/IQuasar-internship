  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Telerehabilitation is a form of tele-treatment in which rehabilitation services are dispensed&#xD;
      at patients' home utilizing video telecommunication services with real-time synchronous&#xD;
      exchange of information. The advantages of telerehabilitation include reducing unnecessary&#xD;
      travel to the hospital and person to person contact while maintaining social distancing.&#xD;
      While some of the patients are truly staying at remote areas, others are unable to manage&#xD;
      travel in the lockdown period. Telemedicine offers the opportunity to deliver rehabilitative&#xD;
      services in the patients' home, closing geographic, physical, and motivational gaps.&#xD;
      Punctuality on either side is also assured since the travel times are saved on both the ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate telerehabilitation vs. in-person&#xD;
      rehabilitation following ACL reconstruction. Objectives include assess return to sport and&#xD;
      patient reported functional outcomes.&#xD;

    <measure>ACL-RSI Questionnaire Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year post-op</time_frame>
    <description>ACL-RSI (anterior cruciate ligament - return to sport) consists of 12 questions. Each question is scored 0-100 with a total range of 0-1200. The higher the score, the more positive psychological outlook a participant has.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year post-op</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is a validated, subjective measure for acute and chronic pain. Scores are recorded by making a handwritten mark on a 10-cm line that represents a continuum between &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain.&quot; The total score ranges from 0-10. The higher the score, the worse the pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year post-op</time_frame>
    <description>KOOS is a knee-specific instrument, developed to assess the participants' opinion about their knee and associated problems. The KOOS evaluates both short-term and long-term consequences of knee injury. It holds 42 items in 5 separately scored subscales. Each subscale is calculated independently. The calculated mean score of the individual items of each subscale will be divided by 4. The total score range is 0-100. The lower the score, the more extreme the problems.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year post-op</time_frame>
    <description>The IKDC is a patient-completed tool, which contains sections on knee symptoms (7 items), function (2 items), and sports activities (2 items). Scores range from 0 points (lowest level of function or highest level of symptoms) to 100 points (highest level of function and lowest level of symptoms).</description>
