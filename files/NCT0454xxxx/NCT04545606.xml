  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and insomnia, and their parent(s) will undergo 4&#xD;
      sessions of behavioral therapy for sleep problems followed by 4 bimonthly booster sessions.&#xD;
      Children and their families will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy (in-person), cognitive behavioral therapy (remote), or behavioral therapy&#xD;
      (remote). Arousal will be measured through heart-rate variability. Sleep and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes (child daytime behavior, parent sleep) will be collected at baseline (weeks 1-2&#xD;
      before starting the treatment), post-treatment (weeks 6-8 from baseline), 6-month follow-up,&#xD;
      and 12-month follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with autism often have difficulties falling and staying asleep at night. Those sleep&#xD;
      difficulties can contribute to daytime problems with irritability, learning, and behavior.&#xD;
      Parents are often stressed about their child's sleep difficulties and as a result, their&#xD;
      sleep can suffer as well. Treatment that focuses on establishing behaviors and routines that&#xD;
      help reduce arousal and support good sleep are helpful for improving the sleep of children&#xD;
      without autism, but have not yet been tested in children with autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have indicated that distance can make it difficult for families to&#xD;
      participate in treatment. As such, we will conduct treatment remotely for two of treatment&#xD;
      arms. Having remote versions of the treatment can expand the number of children and families&#xD;
      that are able to receive these promising treatments. This may be particularly important for&#xD;
      children with ASD living in rural and underserved areas as well as those in military families&#xD;
      that may not have access to a healthcare provider with training in behavioral sleep&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
