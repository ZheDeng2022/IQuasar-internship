  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label study to evaluate different methods of initiating tenapanor&#xD;
      therapy in CKD patients on dialysis with hyperphosphatemia, when they are either phosphate&#xD;
      binder naïve or on phosphate binder therapy. The objective to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      tenapanor alone or in combination with phosphate binders to achieve target serum phosphorus&#xD;
      (s-P) levels of ≤5.5 mg/dL when tenapanor is administered as the core therapy (alone or in&#xD;
      combination with phosphate binders) for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Approximately 330 CKD patients on dialysis with hyperphosphatemia (&gt;4.5 mg/dL) will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, open-label study to evaluate different methods of initiating tenapanor&#xD;
      therapy in CKD patients on dialysis with hyperphosphatemia, when they are either phosphate&#xD;
      binder naïve or on phosphate binder therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a Screening visit and a 10-week open-label Treatment Period (TP), for&#xD;
      which&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with s-P &gt;5.5 and ≤10.0 mg/dL under stable phosphate binder treatment are&#xD;
           randomized in a 1:1 ratio to two different treatment cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cohort 1 (straight switch), which stops taking phosphate binders and is started on&#xD;
                tenapanor 30 mg twice daily (BID) at Visit 2 (Day 1);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cohort 2, which decreases phosphate binder dose by at least 50% (may be more than&#xD;
                50% if patient is taking an odd number of binder pills each day), with ability to&#xD;
                switch the binder regimen from thrice daily (TID) to BID or QD; and initiates&#xD;
                tenapanor 30 mg BID at Visit 2 (Day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phosphate binder naïve patients with s-P &gt;4.5 and ≤10.0 mg/dL are enrolled as Cohort 3&#xD;
           and receive tenapanor at Visit 2 (Day 1) with a starting dose of 30 mg BID.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients on phosphate binder therapy must receive phosphate binder(s) thrice daily, and&#xD;
           both the s-P level assessed at the most recent measurement prior to the Screening visit&#xD;
           (Visit 1) and the s-P level assessed at the Screening visit (Visit 1) must be &gt;5.5 and&#xD;
           ≤10.0 mg/dL to qualify for randomization into Cohort 1 or Cohort 2 at Visit 2 (Day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phosphate binder naïve patients must have the s-P level assessed at the Screening visit&#xD;
           (Visit 1) &gt;4.5 and ≤10.0 mg/dL to qualify for enrollment into Cohort 3 at Visit 2 (Day&#xD;
           1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who do not meet the randomization/enrollment criteria on s-P will be discontinued as&#xD;
      screen failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the TP, patients will receive tenapanor starting at a dose of 30 mg twice daily.&#xD;
      Tenapanor will be taken twice daily; just prior to breakfast and dinner. The Investigator may&#xD;
      titrate the dose of tenapanor in 10 mg increments down to a minimum of 10 mg QD or up to a&#xD;
      maximum of 30 mg BID at any time during the study based on s-P levels and/or gastrointestinal&#xD;
      (GI) tolerability.&#xD;
