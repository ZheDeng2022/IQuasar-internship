  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although success in lumbar spine surgeries depends on many factors, it has been reported that&#xD;
      one of the most important of these factors is patient expectations. In order for patients and&#xD;
      health professionals to have the same priorities and meet the same realistic goals, it is&#xD;
      necessary to understand what patients expect. Lumbar spine surgery expectations scale was&#xD;
      created by Mancuso et al. The aim of this study was to determine the Turkish validity and&#xD;
      reliability of Lumbar Spine Surgery Expectations Survey developed by Mancuso.&#xD;

    <measure>Lumbar Spine Surgery Expectation Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Survey has been described in detail previously with respect to validity, reliability, and factor analysis. The Survey addresses pain, function, work status, mental well-being, and anticipated future spine condition.It is prefaced by the question ''How much relief or improvement do you expect in the following areas as a result of the treatment for your spine?'' Response options are ''back to normal or complete improvement'' (4 points), ''not back to normal but a lot of improvement'' (3 points), ''a moderate amount of improvement'' (2 points), ''a little improvement'' (1 point), and ''I do not have this expectation or this expectation does not apply to me'' (0 points).</description>

    <measure>Quebeck Back Pain Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Quebeck Back Pain Disability Index is a condition-specific measure of disability that was described by Kopec et al. The scale contains 20 daily activities and asks the patient to rate his or her degree of difficulty in performing each activity from 0 (&quot;not difficult at all&quot;) to 5 (&quot;unable to do&quot;). The item scores were summed for a total score between 0 and 100, with higher numbers representing greater levels of disability.</description>
