    <textblock>
      Recently, in patients with a suboptimal ovarian response, a study of the role of adding a&#xD;
      single dose of GnRH agonist to a standard dose of hCG to initiate final oocyte maturation has&#xD;
      also been studied. Griffin et al. (2014) reported that in patients who had more than 25%&#xD;
      immature oocytes in their previous IVF cycle, the use of dual stimulation could increase the&#xD;
      number of mature oocytes. Since studies in this field are limited, the researchers decided to&#xD;
      design a clinical trial to investigate the effect of adding a GnRH agonist to a standard dose&#xD;
      of hCG to initiate final oocyte maturation in patients with a sub-optimal ovarian response.&#xD;

      Ovulation stimulation will be performed in all patients with the Standard GnRH antagonist&#xD;
      Protocol with E2 priming, with the antagonist protocol administered in all patients from the&#xD;
      20th cycle until the start of the next menstrual cycle with 4 mg of estradiol daily. Blood&#xD;
      sampling (FSH, LH, and estradiol levels) will be performed on the second day of the menstrual&#xD;
      cycle, just before gonadotropin stimulation. Ovarian stimulation will start from the second&#xD;
      or third day of menstruation with a maximum dose of 225 units of rFSH (Gonal -F: Serono&#xD;
      Laboratories Ltd, Geneva, Switzerland), and then if the follicle is observed, start with 13&#xD;
      injections of GnRH antagonist (Cetrotide®, 0.25 mg cetrorelix acetate, Serono, Inc)). From&#xD;
      the seventh day of the cycle, the dose of rFSH will be determined according to the rate of&#xD;
      ovarian response by vaginal ultrasonography two days in advance. If you see at least 2&#xD;
      follicles 18 mm in size or more, the antagonist will be injected. GnRH and gonadotropins&#xD;
      (Gonal-F) will stop and (oocyte triggering) will be the final stimulation of oocyte&#xD;
      maturation, at this time, the block randomization method will be designed to randomize&#xD;
      allocation of patients into groups with blocks of size 4. Recently, in patients with a&#xD;
      suboptimal ovarian response, a study of the role of adding a single dose of GnRH agonist to a&#xD;
      standard dose of hCG to initiate final oocyte maturation has also been studied. Griffin et&#xD;
      al. (2014) reported that in patients who had more than 25% immature oocytes in their previous&#xD;
      IVF cycle, the use of dual stimulation could increase the number of mature oocytes. Since&#xD;
      studies in this field are limited, the researchers decided to design a clinical trial to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of adding a GnRH agonist to a standard dose of hCG to initiate final&#xD;
      oocyte maturation in patients with a suboptimal ovarian response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controlled Ovulation stimulation (COS) will be performed in all patients with the Standard&#xD;
      GnRH antagonist Protocol with E2 priming, with the antagonist protocol administered in all&#xD;
      patients from the 20th cycle until the start of the next menstrual cycle with 4 mg of&#xD;
      estradiol daily. Blood sampling (FSH, LH, and estradiol levels) will be performed on the&#xD;
      second day of the menstrual cycle, just before gonadotropin stimulation. Ovarian stimulation&#xD;
      will start from the second or third day of menstruation with a maximum dose of 225 units of&#xD;
      rFSH (Gonal -F: Serono Laboratories Ltd, Geneva, Switzerland), and then if the follicle is&#xD;
      observed, start with 13 injections of GnRH antagonist (Cetrotide®, 0.25 mg cetrorelix&#xD;
      acetate, Serono, Inc)). From the seventh day of the cycle, the dose of rFSH will be&#xD;
      determined according to the rate of ovarian response by vaginal ultrasonography two days in&#xD;
      advance. If you see at least 2 follicles 18 mm in size or more, the antagonist will be&#xD;
      injected. GnRH and gonadotropins (Gonal-F) will stop and (oocyte triggering) will be the&#xD;
      final stimulation of oocyte maturation, at this time, the block randomization method will be&#xD;
      designed to randomize allocation of patients into groups with blocks of size 4. The required&#xD;
      number of blocks will be randomly selected according to sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final ovarian stimulation (oocyte triggering) will be performed in groups A and B as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A (Experimental): 0.2 mg Triptorelin (Decapeptyl; Ferring GmbH) associated with two&#xD;
      ampoules of Ovitrelle (Ovitrelle®, 250 μg/0.5 ml, Merck, Serono, Inc) will be administered&#xD;
      subcutaneously simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B (Control): Two ampoules of Ovitrelle® (Ovitrelle®, 250 μg/0.5 ml, Merck, Serono, Inc)&#xD;
      will be injected subcutaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COS cycles with less than two follicles will be cancelled s. Ovum pick up is performed&#xD;
      32-34 hours after oocyte triggering, and subsequently intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)&#xD;
      /in-vitro fertilization (IVF) will be done for all the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measures are the number of dominant follicles (≥13 mm) on the day of hCG&#xD;
      trigger and the number of mature (MII) oocytes collected after conventional versus&#xD;
      delayed-start ovarian stimulation protocol. Secondary outcome measures are including total&#xD;
      number of oocytes retrieved, oocyte maturity rate (number of MII oocytes/total number of&#xD;
      oocytes), oocyte yield (total number of oocytes retrieved/ antral follicle count [AFC]),&#xD;
      mature oocyte yield (number of mature oocytes retrieved/AFC), total dosage of gonadotropin&#xD;
      (recombinant FSH and/or highly purified hMG) needed, number of days needed for ovarian&#xD;
      stimulation, quality of obtained embryos, fertilization rate (the proportion of total number&#xD;
      of two-pronuclear [2PN] stage zygotes /per total injected MII oocytes), implantation rate&#xD;
      (total number of observed gestational sac/ number of transferred embryos) and clinical&#xD;
      pregnancy rate (presence of fetal heart beat by transvaginal ultrasound per embryo transfer).&#xD;
