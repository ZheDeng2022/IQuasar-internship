        A target sample of 75 patients with LCMN and/or NCM will be enrolled in this registry&#xD;
        study. The study is expected to accrue over â‰¥ 7 years. Currently, an estimated 50 LCMN&#xD;
        patients are followed at MSK and we anticipate 25 or more to be referred from outside&#xD;
        providers or from new patients seen at MSK. The patient population and the MSK referral&#xD;
        base is growing at this time, making this enrollment goal as feasible.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with LCMN, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Dark-colored patch of skin present at birth&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Can be located anywhere on the individual's skin&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  May include satellite lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  May be associated with hypertrichosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR, in absence of cutaneous involvement:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  histologically or radiographically confirmed CNS melanocytosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any age at diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Signed informed consent by a patient, or parent/legal guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Deceased patients can be included provided that parent/legal guardian is&#xD;
                  contacted at least 6 months after the death of the child and not on the child's&#xD;
                  birthday or anniversary of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pathology review at MSK is not mandatory to confirm the diagnosis of LCMN or NCM. We will&#xD;
        not require pathology analysis of leptomeningeal deposits in patients where characteristic&#xD;
        skin lesions are present and melanosis of the meninges is radiographically evident.&#xD;
        However, if pathology samples have already been obtained as part of a patient's evaluation&#xD;
        and treatment at another institution, tissue samples will be requested for review and&#xD;
        confirmation of the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent has not been provided.&#xD;
