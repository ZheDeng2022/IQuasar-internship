  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research study is to compare two different fluids (Human Albumin Solution&#xD;
      (HAS) and Balanced Crystalloid that are given via a drip to patients with severe infection&#xD;
      (sepsis). The investigators plan to see which fluid is better, and to see if they have a role&#xD;
      in improving a patient's recovery time, reducing complications and the length of time they&#xD;
      stay in hospital. This study plans to find out if there is evidence that one fluid is better&#xD;
      overall to determine the need for a subsequent definitive trial.&#xD;

      This trial will be an open label two-arm, multicentre, pragmatic, parallel group randomised&#xD;
      trial of adult patients with community acquired sepsis recruited from the Emergency&#xD;
      Department and Medical and Surgical Assessment Units across ~10 UK NHS Hospitals. The&#xD;
      treatment phase will be the first 6 hours following randomisation. 30-day and 90-day follow&#xD;
      up will be conducted using routine data only. The exception to this will be the first 50&#xD;
      patients enrolled in the study, Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) will be measured using&#xD;
      the EQ-5D-5L at baseline, 7 days and at 180 days. At baseline, the participant or their&#xD;
      relative will be asked to recall the quality of life 4 weeks prior to the index hospital&#xD;
      admission. Questionnaires will be administered by direct patient completion or, postal or&#xD;
      email survey with telephone follow up for non-responders after two mailings two weeks apart.&#xD;

    <description>Health Economic Outcomes are measured using the the 5-level EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L). The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate their health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>

    <description>Participants allocated to the treatment arm will receive intravenous 5% Human Albumin Solution (HAS) administered as the sole intravenous fluid during the initial 6-hour resuscitation period. The clinician can deliver up to 10ml/kg in the first 3 hours using 250ml boluses of HAS based on clinical judgement, using clinical assessment supplemented by technology if that is their usual practice. This will be followed by repeat clinical assessment after each bolus (including vital signs; lactate testing). After 3 hours further HAS boluses up to 6 hours post-randomisation will be at clinical discretion and will be documented in the CRF. Patients in the albumin arm should not receive balanced crystalloid as a resuscitation fluid in the first 6 hours.</description>
