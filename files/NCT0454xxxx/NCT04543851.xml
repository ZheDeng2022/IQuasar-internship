  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CARA is a novel Carbon-fibre Adjustable and Re-usable Accessory for supine breast positioning&#xD;
      during radiation therapy. CARA was developed at BC Cancer. In this study, twenty patients&#xD;
      will be planned and treated with CARA positioning to establish safety and workflow measures&#xD;
      of this novel device. The device is designed to remove the infra-mammary skin fold and&#xD;
      lateral breast droop which can lead to unwanted dose to normal tissue.&#xD;

      This pilot study will investigate the safety and potential benefits of CARA breast&#xD;
      positioning by treating 20 patients using the device. Patients will be planned with CARA&#xD;
      positioning and standard of care positioning. CARA plans will be evaluated to ensure all&#xD;
      treatment planning goals are met and patients will proceed to treatment with CARA&#xD;
      positioning. This pilot study will ensure that patients can be safely treated with the CARA&#xD;
      and provide us with valuable information from therapists, oncologists and patients about the&#xD;
      performance of the current design. This will also inform the direction of design improvements&#xD;
      and the production of educational materials for training practitioners in the use of the&#xD;
      device. Overall, this will prepare us for a randomized clinical trial of the CARA positioning&#xD;
      technique versus current standard of practice to assess whether reduced toxicity can be&#xD;
      achieved using the CARA technique.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of participants for whom dose volume treatment planning constraints are not met using CARA support for breast setup</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment planning dose constraints are:&#xD;
&gt;=95% of the prescribed dose covering &gt;=98% of the breast target tissue, including internal mammary chain when requested by the treating oncologist&#xD;
volume of ipsi-lateral lung receiving &gt;= 20Gy should be &lt;=35%&#xD;
volume of heart receiving &gt;=25Gy should be &lt;=5%&#xD;
maximum dose to any point in the body &lt;=110% of the prescribed dose&#xD;
volume of breast receiving &gt;=107% of prescribed dose should be &lt;=22 cm^3</description>

    <measure>Number of participants having measured breast skin dose =&gt; 110% of the prescribed dose to an area of skin =&gt; 1 cm^2</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Skin dose is measured on the breast surface under the carbon fibre device using radio-chromic film. The area of skin receiving 70% of the prescribed dose up to the maximum absorbed dose is measured in 5% dose increments to an accuracy of 0.5 cm^2.&#xD;
If any participant receives =&gt; 110% of the prescribed dose to &gt;=1 cm^2 area of skin, the study will be stopped.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants scoring =&gt;6 on the CTCAE Version 4.0 skin assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo a detailed breast skin assessment at baseline, one week prior to RT completion, last week of RT, and one and two weeks post RT using the CTCAE Version 4 skin assessment scoring system as well as examination of the infra-mammary fold for any moist desquamation. The dimensions and location of moist desquamation will be recorded. In the event that a skin reaction of ≥ 6 (indicating ulceration, hemorrhage or necrosis) on the CTCAE V 4.0 scale is reported, the trial will be stopped.</description>
