  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives of this study are to investigate the influence of the ketogenic diet&#xD;
      (KD), standard care for patients assisted in the UW Health Adult Epilepsy Dietary Therapy&#xD;
      Clinic, on changes in the frequency and severity of seizures, QoL, energy substrate&#xD;
      metabolism, body energy expenditure components, fat mass and fat-free mass in adults with&#xD;
      epilepsy. To achieve this objective, twenty-five male and female participants between the&#xD;
      ages of 18 and 45 years (or over 18 years for remote participation), who accepted to initiate&#xD;
      the KD as a standard of care prescribed by their physician, will be recruited according to&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. Participants will be on study for 6 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high fat, very low carbohydrate diet that promotes a variety of&#xD;
      changes in the chemical processes on the body associated with reduced frequency and severity&#xD;
      of seizures in patients with epilepsy. The reasons for this improvement are not yet fully&#xD;
      understood and the answers can be related to changes in the biochemical process and the use&#xD;
      of different substrates as the main source of energy for the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of life (QoL) of patients with epilepsy is highly affected by stigmatization,&#xD;
      difficulties with employment, and physical limitations. There is some evidence that the KD&#xD;
      may have beneficial effects on QoL in patients with epilepsy, which can be investigated by&#xD;
      changes in body energy expenditure (e.g. physical activity level). Studies that associate&#xD;
      changes in body energy requirements, body composition and biochemical measures with seizures&#xD;
      and QoL are currently limited in the scientific literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of this study are to investigate the influence of the KD on changes in&#xD;
      the frequency and severity of seizures, QoL, energy substrate metabolism, body energy&#xD;
      expenditure components, fat mass and fat-free mass in adults with epilepsy. To achieve this&#xD;
      objective, twenty-five male and female participants between the ages of 18 and 45 years (or&#xD;
      over 18 years old for remote participation, no metabolic analysis will be complete on remote&#xD;
      participants) will be recruited according to inclusion/exclusion criteria. Data will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline (time of enrollment), and again at 3 and 6 months following diet start.&#xD;
      Stable isotope compounds (doubly labeled water) will assess total daily energy expenditure&#xD;
      (TDEE) and body composition (fat mass; fat-free mass). Indirect calorimetry will assess the&#xD;
      resting energy expenditure (REE) and respiratory quotient for energy substrate oxidation.&#xD;
      Biochemical blood exams (fasting glucose and insulin, and ketone bodies) and anthropometric&#xD;
      data will provide data on the nutritional and metabolic status of the participant. Seizure&#xD;
      frequency, severity, and QoL will be evaluated using validated self-report questionnaires.&#xD;
      The physical activity level, obtained through the ratio between TDEE and REE and by wearing&#xD;
      of a physical activity monitor, will be used as a predictor of QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that KD therapy promotes differences in energy metabolism and energy&#xD;
      substrate oxidation, which will lead to better metabolic control of epilepsy, reduced&#xD;
      frequency and severity of seizures, and also an improved patient QoL. This study is expected&#xD;
      to help elucidate the metabolic changes associated with reduced seizure frequency and&#xD;
      severity, and improvement of QoL in patients with epilepsy.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Severity of Seizures Assessed by Seizure Severity Questionnaire (SSQ)</measure>

    <description>The SSQ scores range from 1-7 with lower scores indicating improved status. The hypothesize is that participants will have a significant reduction in seizures (&gt;50%) at 3 and 6 months following the start of KD therapy, which will also lead a significant reduction (p&lt;0.05) of SSQ overall score.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Quality of Life in Epilepsy (QOLIE-31-P) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The QOLIE-31-P instruments include seven multi-item scales that tap the following health concepts: emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, cognitive functioning, seizure worry, medication effects, and overall quality of life. The total range of possible scores is 0-100, higher scores indicate better well being. The hypothesis is that participants will have a significant reduction in seizures (&gt;50%) at 3 and 6 months following the start of KD therapy, which will also lead to significant improvement (p&lt;0.05) in the QoL overall score.</description>

    <measure>Enhanced Metabolic Control of Epilepsy Assessed by Indirect Calorimetry</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The hypothesis is that KD therapy will promote significant differences (compared to pre-diet baseline) in substrate oxidation (an increase in fat oxidation and a decrease in carbohydrate oxidation) which will correlate with seizure reduction.</description>
