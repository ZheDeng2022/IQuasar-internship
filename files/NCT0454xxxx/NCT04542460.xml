  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with a chronic total coronary occlusion (CTO ), clinically significant arrhythmia&#xD;
      seems to be an important and a poorly investigated problem. The arrhythmia prevalence in an&#xD;
      all-comer CTO-population is unknown, but in ICD-populations with ischemic heart disease, a&#xD;
      CTO may be found in half of patients with life-threatening arrhythmia.The purpose of the&#xD;
      CTO-ARRHYTHMIA study, is to investigate the incidence of clinically significant arrhythmias&#xD;
      in CTO patients using an implantable loop recorder. Further, the investigators intend to&#xD;
      identify predictors for arrhythmias as well as the impact on arrhythmia of optimized&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment and revascularization in CTO patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In angiographic materials, chronic total coronary occlusion (CTO) is present in approximately&#xD;
      15-25% of patients and in 25-50% of those with significant coronary disease. Until recently,&#xD;
      because of low procedural success and increased risk of complications, PCI was a problematic&#xD;
      treatment in these patients. The introduction of drug eluting stents and a variety of&#xD;
      dedicated CTO devices combined with the evolution of specific CTO techniques have made&#xD;
      revascularization by PCI a promising treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In CTO patients, clinically significant arrhythmia seems to be an important and a poorly&#xD;
      investigated problem. The arrhythmia prevalence in an all-comer CTO-population is unknown,&#xD;
      but in ICD-populations with ischemic heart disease, a CTO may be found in half of patients&#xD;
      with life-threatening arrhythmia. Further, in patients with ischemic heart disease receiving&#xD;
      ICDs as primary prevention, presence of a CTO was an independent predictor of occurrence of&#xD;
      ventricular arrhythmias, and in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, the risk of&#xD;
      ventricular arrhythmias was found to be increased in patients with a chronic total coronary&#xD;
      occlusion. Nevertheless, the genesis of arrhythmia in CTO-patients is likely to be&#xD;
      multifactorial. It has been documented, that ischemic heart disease patients who present with&#xD;
      a chronic occlusion of at least one coronary artery are older and have additional risk&#xD;
      factors such as hypertension, diabetes, lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and&#xD;
      more frequent myocardial infarction, i.e. a higher Chads2Vasc score (risk score for stroke in&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation patients). Although LVEF is lower in patients with a chronic coronary&#xD;
      occlusion, less than 1/3 are potential ICD candidates with an LVEF &lt;35%. However, a recent&#xD;
      study in consecutive post-AMI survivors documented the highest incidence of sudden cardiac&#xD;
      death in patients with a relatively preserved LVEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the CTO-ARRHYTHMIA study, is to investigate the incidence of clinically&#xD;
      significant arrhythmias in CTO patients using an implantable loop recorder. Further, the&#xD;
      investogators intend to identify predictors for arrhythmias as well as the impact on&#xD;
      arrhythmia of optimized pharmacological treatment and revascularization in CTO patients.&#xD;
      Here, CTO patients with failed PCI may be individuals with a particularly high risk of severe&#xD;
      arrhythmias.&#xD;
