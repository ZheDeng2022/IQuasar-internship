      The study team will be comparing two investigational Artificial Pancreas (AP) systems that&#xD;
      the UVA Center for Diabetes Technology has developed. An artificial pancreas system delivers&#xD;
      insulin automatically based on a blood glucose level that is provided from a continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitor (CGM).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Maintaining blood glucose (BG) control among adolescents with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is&#xD;
      arguably the greatest challenge in the entire field of T1D. One reason for this poor control&#xD;
      relates to missed meal boluses, which affects 65% of adolescents at least once weekly, with&#xD;
      38% missing at least 15% of their boluses. Adolescents who miss four boluses weekly&#xD;
      experience an increase of 1% in their HbA1c. While the advent of the artificial pancreas (AP)&#xD;
      offers promise of safe reductions in HbA1c, the study team previously found that the AP only&#xD;
      partly compensates for missed prandial insulin -demonstrating that some form of meal&#xD;
      announcement is necessary for good BG control, even with an AP. One way to automate this&#xD;
      process is by sharing the prandial dosing responsibilities between an automated insulin&#xD;
      priming (based on continuous glucose monitor condition predictive of a safe situation for&#xD;
      such insulin dosing) and a closed loop controller capable of reconstructing (estimating) the&#xD;
      prevailing glucose rate of appearance from an unannounced meal. The study team has developed&#xD;
      such an insulin priming schema and integrated it into a new version of the robust Model&#xD;
      Predictive Controller University of Virginia AP system (called the RocketAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, the investigators are testing this new AP system in two configurations:&#xD;
      hybrid and fully automated, among up to 20 adolescents. The primary outcome will be one of&#xD;
      efficacy in assessing how well the new system controls post-prandial BG in the absence of&#xD;
      carbohydrate (CHO) announcement as compared to the same situation but using the Control-IQ&#xD;
      closed loop algorithm, also designed at UVa and using the same modular architecture and&#xD;
      safety system, but without insulin priming and with a less advanced model-based controller.&#xD;
      Further comparisons will be made to BG control on RocketAP with CHO announcement and on&#xD;
      Control-IQ with CHO announcement. Adolescents will be started on the respective University of&#xD;
      Virginia AP systems (RocketAP and Control-IQ in random order, both implemented on the DiAs&#xD;
      platform, MAF 2109) and followed over the course of two dinners on each of the two platforms:&#xD;
      a dinner where CHO is announced as normal and the 2nd where no announcement is made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team hypothesize that performances of RocketAP in fully automated mode will lie in&#xD;
      between Hybrid and Fully Automated Control-IQ. In time, this may provide an opportunity to&#xD;
      improve BG control among adolescents who miss meal announcement.&#xD;
