  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite great advances in surgical therapy in the last decades, symptom relief for women with&#xD;
      vulvar neoplasia (vulvar cancer and pre-stage of vulvar cancer) is still not optimal.&#xD;
      Guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend using electronic&#xD;
      communication media, e.g. applications (&quot;apps&quot;) to relieve symptom distress and foster&#xD;
      self-management. However, little is known on how effective these communication technologies&#xD;
      are, especially in the field of a rare cancer disease like vulvar neoplasia. This mixed&#xD;
      methods project aims to examine the effectiveness of a multidimensional mobile app&#xD;
      intervention (&quot;WOMAN-PRO III&quot;) focusing on possible improvements due to the new mobile app&#xD;
      intervention, which consists of three counselling sessions with a gynaecologic-oncology nurse&#xD;
      and the use of the mobile app whenever women want for a period of six months, the online&#xD;
      version of the &quot;WOMAN-PRO&quot; diary for symptom assessment, the opportunity to send the data to&#xD;
      the gynaecology-oncology nurse, disease and treatment related information and evidence-based&#xD;
      recommendations, relevant contact data and a chat function for the anonymous exchange with&#xD;
      peers (intervention group) compared to three counselling sessions with a&#xD;
      gynaecologic-oncology nurse, where they receive written information (control group).&#xD;
      Effectiveness will be examined with respect to symptom induced distress, uncertainty and cost&#xD;
      effectiveness in women with vulvar neoplasia after surgical treatment across time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the qualitative study is to assess women's perceived uncertainty and the&#xD;
      acceptability, usability, strengths and weaknesses of the mobile app intervention (&quot;WOMAN-PRO&#xD;
      III&quot;) from patients' and gynaecology-oncology nurses' perspective.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Vulvar neoplasia - incidence, symptoms and disease's management Although being a rare cancer&#xD;
      disease, the incidence of vulvar neoplasia is increasing with a current incidence rate of 3.6&#xD;
      / 100.000 for women with vulvar cancer (Buttmann-Schweiger et al., 2015) and 7 / 100.000 for&#xD;
      women with VIN (Anders, Riethdorf, &amp; Löning, 2001). Due to the disease itself and treatment&#xD;
      side effects women suffer from a high number of postsurgical symptoms and related distress,&#xD;
      such as pain, swelling, or uncertainty (Jefferies &amp; Clifford, 2012; Philp, Mellon, Barnett,&#xD;
      D'Abrew, &amp; White, 2017; Senn et al., 2011). Results from literature suggest that women have&#xD;
      unmet support needs as talking to healthcare professionals is perceived as difficult and&#xD;
      information given by healthcare professionals is described as conflicting and inadequate&#xD;
      (Philp et al., 2017). The high symptom prevalence and related distress reported uncertainty&#xD;
      as well as the perceived lack of supportive care can lead to hospital readmissions and&#xD;
      consequently to the generation of high healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome this lack of supportive care, guidelines focusing on vulvar neoplasia recommend&#xD;
      an integrative approach including skilled nursing as a key factor for patient management&#xD;
      (Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, 2014). Specialist nurses, i.e. Advanced&#xD;
      Practice Nurses (APN) can, therefore, play an important role in caring for women with vulvar&#xD;
      neoplasia, as shown in the study of Raphaelis et al. (2018) where women received written&#xD;
      information and counselling sessions from APNs. However, gaps remain especially in women's&#xD;
      disease management beyond the walls of the clinic. Therefore, supportive care interventions&#xD;
      are requested to promote women's self-management, especially at home. One possibility might&#xD;
      be the use of e-health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E-health - the changing nature of self-help: E-health has come to be an important avenue for&#xD;
      supporting self-management. One integral part of the subject area of e-health is m-health.&#xD;
      Within the healthcare system the aim of m-health is to provide electronic solutions on mobile&#xD;
      devices, which is also described in the WHO definition of m-health: &quot;M-health covers medical&#xD;
      and public health practice supported by mobile devices, such as mobile phones, patient&#xD;
      monitoring devices, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and other wireless devices&quot; (World&#xD;
      Health Organization, 2011). It is expected to contribute to patients' empowerment as they&#xD;
      could take a more active role (European Commission, without date). Especially in chronic&#xD;
      disease management, m-health interventions could play an important role in providing&#xD;
      information and enabling communication without spatial and temporal restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: This research will contribute significantly to the knowledge about effects of&#xD;
      mobile app interventions in gynaecologic oncology, especially with regard to a reduction of&#xD;
      symptom induced distress and improvement of uncertainty in a stigmatized disease like vulvar&#xD;
      neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Primary Objective The study seeks primarily to examine the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      multidimensional mobile app intervention, which consists of the use of the mobile app&#xD;
      whenever women want for a period of six months and three counselling sessions with a&#xD;
      gynaecology-oncology nurse (&quot;WOMAN-PRO III&quot;) on symptom induced distress, uncertainty and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness in women with vulvar neoplasia after surgical treatment across time&#xD;
      compared to three counselling sessions with a gynaecology-oncology nurse and written&#xD;
      information. The secondary objective is to explore women's perceived uncertainty as well as&#xD;
      the mobile app's acceptability, usability, strengths and weaknesses by assessing&#xD;
      participants' and gynaecology-oncology nurses' experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We use an explanatory-sequential design (Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2017) to examine&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the mobile-app intervention (&quot;WOMAN-PRO III&quot;). Thus, quantitative&#xD;
      findings can be explained by means of qualitative results (Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2017).&#xD;
      Therefore, Phase 1 of this project will consist of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with&#xD;
      an intervention and control arm. Phase 2 is a subsequent qualitative study aiming to explore&#xD;
      (1) women's meaning of uncertainty and (2) the mobile app intervention's (&quot;WOMAN PRO III&quot;)&#xD;
      acceptability, usability, strengths and weaknesses from patients' and gynaecology-oncology&#xD;
      nurses' perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample and setting: 100 Patients, with an estimated rate of 20% loss to follow-up and&#xD;
      drop-out will be recruited continuously in four Swiss hospitals (Bern, Lucerne, Lugano,&#xD;
      St.Gallen) to have in the end a total sample of 80 patients for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: From May 1st, 2019 until January31st, 2021 patients will be consecutively&#xD;
      invited by a gynaecologist or a nurse to participate in the study after initial diagnosis at&#xD;
      the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Will be conducted in the control group via paper-based questionnaires and in&#xD;
      the intervention group via paper-based questionnaires and additionally via app. Patients will&#xD;
      be asked to complete questionnaires at three points in time:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis / before surgical intervention (t0),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  day seven after surgery (t1),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and month six after surgery (t2). Sample size: Statistical significance is defined as α&#xD;
           = 0.05, power is defined as 80%. Assuming a 20% rate of loss to follow-up and drop-out,&#xD;
           with a sampling ratio of 1 a total of 100 female patients with surgically treated VIN/VC&#xD;
           will be necessary to start the randomized control trial to gain a total sample of 80&#xD;
           patients for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned analyses: Patients will be analyzed within their assigned groups (intention to treat)&#xD;
      based on frequencies and descriptive statistics. Changes in symptom induced distress&#xD;
      (frequency of symptoms, items and subscores) will be analyzed using mixed linear regression&#xD;
      analysis, taking into account the longitudinal nature of the data (t0, t1, t2), and data&#xD;
      clustering within centers. Fixed variables will be study group, point of time, and their&#xD;
      interaction. The variables 'patient', nested under the respective 'center', will be entered&#xD;
      as a random effect. To find out time-specific differences between the patient groups post-hoc&#xD;
      tests will be performed. Uncertainty, our secondary outcome, will be analyzed similarly.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be provided by a professional statistician, using IBM SPSS Version&#xD;
      24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative study: After 6 months of collecting data for the RCT, a qualitative study will be&#xD;
      started aiming to explore (1) women's perceived meaning and interaction concerning&#xD;
      uncertainty and (2) the mobile app intervention's (&quot;WOMAN PRO III&quot;) acceptability, usability,&#xD;
      strengths and weaknesses from patients' and gynaecology-oncology nurses' perspective.&#xD;
      Therefore, interviews will be conducted with women participating in the RCT and women who&#xD;
      agreed to only participate in the qualitative study. Further, a focus group will be conducted&#xD;
      with gynaecology-oncology nurses involved in the intervention tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample and setting: Women who have participated in Phase one of the mixed methods study will&#xD;
      be considered as suitable to give insights about their meaning of uncertainty. As well, women&#xD;
      who were not interested in participating in the RCT, but declared interest in participating&#xD;
      in the qualitative study, are found to be eligible. Participants of the intervention and&#xD;
      gynaecology-oncology nurses involved in the mobile app intervention (6 - 8 nurses) are&#xD;
      considered eligible to deliver information about the mobile app intervention's (&quot;WOMAN PRO&#xD;
      III&quot;) acceptability, usability, strengths and weaknesses. It can be assumed, that with&#xD;
      interviewing about 15 patients and involving 6 - 8 gynaecology-oncology nurses a first data&#xD;
      saturation can be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Six months after surgery (t2) patients will be asked by a nurse not involved in&#xD;
      the patients' treatment to indicate their willingness to participate in an individual&#xD;
      interview. All gynaecology-oncology nurses involved in the mobile app intervention will be&#xD;
      asked to participate in the focus group interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: The patient interviews and the focus group with the gynaecology-oncology&#xD;
      nurses will be conducted by using interview guides consisting of open-ended questions. The&#xD;
      interviews and the focus group will last about an hour. Patients' interviews will take place&#xD;
      at the participant's home or in the clinical setting according to patient's preferences. The&#xD;
      focus group interview will be held at a research institute. ¨ Data analysis: Data of the&#xD;
      patient interviews and the focus group will be recorded, anonymized and transcribed verbatim&#xD;
      (Dresing &amp; Pehl, 2011) and analyzed using open, axial and selective coding as proposed by&#xD;
      Corbin &amp; Strauss (2015). The data analysis process will be conducted by researchers with&#xD;
      extended experience in qualitative research and assisted by MAXQDA 2018 (VERBI GmbH, Berlin).&#xD;
