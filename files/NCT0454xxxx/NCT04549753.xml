  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the characteristics of neural plasticity seen in&#xD;
      stroke patients by measuring the changes in brain activity during stimulation using&#xD;
      functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) when applying transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) for the purpose of enhancing finger function.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in cortical activity using fNIRS signals during brain stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and about 10 days (immediately after brain stimulation sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>Cortical activities before and after brain stimulation sessions are compared.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in motor evoked potential</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and about 10 days (immediately after brain stimulation sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>Resting motor threshold (rMT) and amplitude of motor evoked potential in first dorsal interosseous muscle are measured. These outcomes are measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motor hotspot. The rMT is defined as the minimum stimulus intensity that produced a minimal motor evoked response at rest. The amplitude means peak to peak of the muscle response.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>9-hole pegboard test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and about 10 days (immediately after brain stimulation sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>The test is a standardized, quantitative assessment used to measure finger dexterity of a patient.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Grip &amp; Tip pinch strength test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and about 10 days (immediately after brain stimulation sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>The test is to measure the maximum isometric strength of hand, forearm, and finger muscles.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Box &amp; Block test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and about 10 days (immediately after brain stimulation sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>The test is used to measure the gross manual dexterity of a patient, or of a person using an upper limb prosthetic device.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and about 10 days (immediately after brain stimulation sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>The score is a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index. The degree of impairment of upper and lower limbs is measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Finger tapping test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and about 10 days (immediately after brain stimulation sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>Response time is measured during finger tapping task.</description>
