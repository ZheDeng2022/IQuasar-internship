    <textblock>
      Sepsis is the most frequent risk factor for ALI/ARDS. Meanwhile, Pulmonary is the most&#xD;
      vulnerable organ to fail in response to sepsis, vascular endothelial dysfunction is a central&#xD;
      event in the pathophysiology of sepsis. An improved understanding of endothelial response and&#xD;
      associated biomarkers may lead to strategies to more accurately predict outcome and develop&#xD;
      novel endothelium-directed therapies in sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human and mouse R-spondins encode a family of proteins that includes four paralogs&#xD;
      (R-spo1-4). R-spondins are secreted proteins found primarily in the extracellular region and&#xD;
      are known to promote β-catenin signaling. Among them, the embryonic lethal vascular&#xD;
      remodeling phenotype of R-spondin3 (Rspo3) mutant mice suggests a role of EC derived Rspo3 in&#xD;
      angiogenesis. Rspo3 protects tissues against mesenteric I/R by tightening endothelial cell&#xD;
      junction and improving vascular intergrity. However, the role of Rspo3 in sepsis-induced&#xD;
      pulmonary endothelial dysfunction remains unclear. Thus, it is worthwhile to explore the&#xD;
      relationship between Rspo3 and sepsis-induced lung injury, which will be helpful for&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of sepsis-induced lung injury and endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is a clinical problem&#xD;
      induced by acute and excessive pulmonary inflammation. Sepsis is the most frequent risk&#xD;
      factor for ALI/ARDS. Meanwhile, Pulmonary is the most vulnerable organ to fail in response to&#xD;
      sepsis, and a major cause of death for sepsis patients is respiratory failure. Despite modern&#xD;
      clinical practices in critical care medicine, there still remains a mortality rate as high as&#xD;
      45%. In addition, Vascular endothelial dysfunction is a central event in the pathophysiology&#xD;
      of sepsis. Endothelial cell activation is associated with sepsis severity, organ dysfunction&#xD;
      and mortality. An improved understanding of endothelial response and associated biomarkers&#xD;
      may lead to strategies to more accurately predict outcome and develop novel&#xD;
      endothelium-directed therapies in sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human and mouse R-spondins encode a family of proteins that includes four paralogs&#xD;
      (R-spo1-4). R-spondins are secreted proteins found primarily in the extracellular region and&#xD;
      are known to promote β-catenin signaling. Among them, the embryonic lethal vascular&#xD;
      remodeling phenotype of R-spondin3 (Rspo3) mutant mice suggests a role of EC derived Rspo3 in&#xD;
      angiogenesis. Former studies demonstrated that endothelial Rspo3 enhances cell autonomous&#xD;
      non-canonical Wnt signaling, thereby preventing retinal and tumor blood vessel regression and&#xD;
      EC apoptosis. The mid-gestational lethality of Rspo3-ECKO mice indicated a role of EC-derived&#xD;
      RSPO3 in controlling blood vessel remodeling. Furthermore, Rspo3 protects tissues against&#xD;
      mesenteric I/R by tightening endothelial cell junction and improving vascular intergrity.&#xD;
      However, the role of Rspo3 in sepsis-induced pulmonary endothelial dysfunction remains&#xD;
      unclear. Thus, it is worthwhile to explore the relationship between Rspo3 and sepsis-induced&#xD;
      lung injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, the investigators will analyze the expression of Rspo3 in septic&#xD;
      patients and sepsis-induced lung injury models and explore whether Rspo3 could protect&#xD;
      sepsis-associated lung injury, which will be helpful for prevention and treatment of&#xD;
      sepsis-induced lung injury and endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;
