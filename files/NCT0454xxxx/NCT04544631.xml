  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated a smart phone virtual reality (VR) to manage pediatric burn dressing&#xD;
      pain. A randomized controlled trial was conducted among 90 patients (6-17 years). Active VR&#xD;
      participants played the game, passive VR group were immersed in the same VR without&#xD;
      interactions, and a standard care group served as the control. One researcher administered VR&#xD;
      and observed pain while another researcher administered post-trial survey that measured&#xD;
      child's perceived pain and VR experience. Nurses were asked to report the clinical utility.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Observed pain</measure>
    <time_frame>During outpatient burn dressing change, on average lasting about 15 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Researcher observed pain of patient based on the Face Legs Activity Cry and Consolability behavioral pain assessment tool (FLACC-r), using 0,1,2 numerical scale for category of face, legs, activity, cry, and consolability. Total scores range from 0-10 with higher scores indicating more pain.</description>

    <measure>Patient self-reported pain</measure>
    <time_frame>During outpatient burn dressing change, on average lasting about 15 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-perceived pain using 0-100 scale Visual Analog Scales (VAS), 0(min)-100(max), higher score for worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>VR experience self-reported by patient and parents</measure>
    <time_frame>During outpatient burn dressing change, on average lasting about 15 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported virtual reality experience using patient and parent survey questions (5-6 survey items) about their experience in using virtual reality during burn wound care. Questions are a mixture of yes/no and a 100 Visual Analog Scale (VAS) with 0 being &quot;Not at All&quot; and 100 being &quot;Very Much&quot;</description>

    <description>Simulator sickness symptoms using the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ), which has 15 survey items with possible choices of &quot;None&quot;, &quot;Slight&quot;, &quot;Moderate&quot;, and &quot;Severe&quot;.</description>

    <description>Attending nurse answered two questions using a survey questionnaire about clinical feasibility of VR using scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very easy&quot;.</description>

    <description>Participants in the active VR group played a virtual reality game entitled &quot;Virtual River Cruise&quot;. In this game, an otter floats down a river on a boat and players activate snow-blowing statues along the shore by focusing on them. The statues will emit snow if they are correctly aimed at by the child, and a thermometer placed in the front of the boat shows decreased temperatures as more snowflakes are blown. As feedback to reinforce continued engagement, a scoreboard placed beside the thermometer will show children the number of statues he/she has activated. Additionally, as the temperature drops, snow and ice will start piling up on the boat and its surroundings, providing an enhanced &quot;cooling&quot; experience for pediatric burn patients. Children interact with the immersive virtual reality environment by tilting their head, minimizing potential interference with the dressing change procedure.</description>
