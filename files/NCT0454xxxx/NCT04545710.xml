  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths. Advances in the systemic treatment of&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have increased survival in metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC.&#xD;
      However resistance to therapy can develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NSCLC tumors with EGFR-activating mutations are exquisitely sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors with overall response rates approximating 80%. The third generation EGFR compound&#xD;
      osimertinib is a standard first line option. Resistance to the third generation EGFR-TKI&#xD;
      osimertinib can develop with a median PFS of 18.9 months. Current research examining acquired&#xD;
      resistance to EGFR-TKIs has focused on overcoming these main mechanisms of EGFR-TKI&#xD;
      resistance and understanding the impact of co-occurring alterations. Frequently altered&#xD;
      pathways concomitantly affected with EGFR in lung cancer are cell cycle genes. This study&#xD;
      will explore a strategy to inhibit EGFR and CDK4/6 in resistant EGFR mutated lung cancer&#xD;
      patients post progression on osimertinib.&#xD;
