  <brief_summary>

      This phase I/II trial will investigate a new CD19 directed CAR-T therapy manufactured locally&#xD;
      with the goals to expedite infusion to wider patient inclusion that includes those who were&#xD;
      previously excluded, such as pediatric patients with B-cell NHL and patients in primary&#xD;
      relapse.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric patients with refractory or multiply relapsed leukemia and lymphoma do very poorly&#xD;
      with traditional chemotherapy and have overall survival rates of well under 20%. There has&#xD;
      been much excitement over the development of Car T cell therapy for these types of&#xD;
      leukemia/lymphoma, but many patients may not fit the standard criteria to receive them or&#xD;
      they cannot tolerate the extended wait and ongoing therapy that is needed for manufacture of&#xD;
      these cells at the commercial level. With this study, the investigators will investigate a&#xD;
      new CD19 directed CAR-T therapy that will be manufactured locally with a goal of wider&#xD;
      patient inclusion and less delay to CAR-T infusion. The investigators hypothesize that CD19&#xD;
      directed CAR-T cells manufactured using the Prodigy ClinicMACS system developed by Miltenyi&#xD;
      (UCD19 CAR-T) will be safe and tolerable and show preliminary efficacy in pediatric patients&#xD;
      with relapsed and/or refractory B-ALL or B- NHL.&#xD;

    <description>The CD19 CAR used in this study consists of three main components: the variable regions of the anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody FMC63 71, linked to the TNFRSF19-derived transmembrane domain, the 4-1BB costimulatory molecule, and the signaling domain of the CD3-zeta molecule. The DNA encoding this receptor was cloned into a lentiviral vector (LV) backbone.</description>
