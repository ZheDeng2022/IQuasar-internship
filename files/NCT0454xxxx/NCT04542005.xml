  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the most common chronic condition among children, and the third leading reason for&#xD;
      hospitalization of children in the United States. It exerts a large healthcare burden on the&#xD;
      US with estimated annual direct healthcare cost of approximately $50.1 billion with indirect&#xD;
      costs of $5.9 billion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma is characterized by airway inflammation and airway constriction. Albuterol and other&#xD;
      betaagonists are first line standard of care for acute exacerbations and provide short acting&#xD;
      smooth muscle relaxation and subsequent airway opening. The frequency of albuterol&#xD;
      administration is dependent on the severity of the exacerbation. For hospitalized patients&#xD;
      here at Children's Memorial Hermann (CMHH), patients may receive nebulized albuterol&#xD;
      continuously or if the exacerbation is not as severe, receive albuterol intermittently.&#xD;
      Intermittent albuterol frequency ranges from every two hour treatments, every three hour&#xD;
      (q3h) treatments, or every four hour (q4h) treatments. As patients recover from their acute&#xD;
      exacerbation, their frequency of albuterol administration is progressively titrated along&#xD;
      this continuum. Expert consensus uses q4h albuterol as discharge criteria from the hospital.&#xD;
      However, recent QI initiatives have studied the effect of q3h treatments as the discharge&#xD;
      cutoff with no reported changes in safety or harm. There are no randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      available. Furthermore, there are no economic evaluations available to see if costs saved by&#xD;
      decreasing the length of hospital care are merely being shifted to subsequent clinic or&#xD;
      emergency room care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to conduct a randomized control trial to compare q3h vs. q4h albuterol&#xD;
      as hospital discharge criteria for patients admitted for acute asthma exacerbations. The&#xD;
      investigators also propose to conduct a costeffectiveness analysis of the trial. If the&#xD;
      hypothesis that q3h albuterol is safe and as effective as q4h albuterol as discharge&#xD;
      criteria, the investigators would be able to argue for a new standard of care that is more&#xD;
      cost effective for this very costly and common disease of children in the United States&#xD;
