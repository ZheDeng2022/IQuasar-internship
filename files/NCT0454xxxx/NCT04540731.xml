  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent liver disease worldwide&#xD;
      affecting as much as 25% of the world's population. The spectrum of NAFLD ranges from&#xD;
      non-alcoholic fatty liver to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the latter being&#xD;
      associated with a progressive course towards fibrosis and a higher risk of developing&#xD;
      cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients with type 2 diabetes are particularly at&#xD;
      higher risk of developing fibrosis and advanced liver disease. Since NASH and its&#xD;
      consequences will only occur in a minority of patients, it is of paramount importance to&#xD;
      identify this population to offer them proper care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that there is a lack of awareness about the potential consequences of NAFLD,&#xD;
      not only in the general population but also in the medical community. Patients with NAFLD are&#xD;
      frequently lost during follow up and, additionally, approach to these patients is sub-optimal&#xD;
      and heterogeneous among physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An attractive approach to applying best medical practices to patients with NAFLD is to&#xD;
      generate a multicentre registry. Clinical registries comprise a set of systematic collected&#xD;
      and stored data focused on a specific condition. The information stored in a registry&#xD;
      provides relevant information about a disease and, through a process of error detection,&#xD;
      ensures data quality and reliability. A NAFLD registry is an essential tool for providing&#xD;
      relevant information such as epidemiological aspects of the disease, outcomes, and treatment&#xD;
      effectiveness. As far as we concern, this would be the first registry of NAFLD in our region,&#xD;
      a region where the disease behaves in a more aggressive way in comparison with other regions&#xD;
      and hemispheres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By generating this registry, we are confident that we will obtain objective information on&#xD;
      the characteristic of patients with NAFLD in our region, not only of the disease&#xD;
      characteristics but also of social determinants that might influence disease outcomes. By&#xD;
      being a prospective study, it allows an adequate patient follow up.&#xD;

&#xD;
      With this registry we primarily aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the characteristics of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the disease progression over time (in the sub-group of patients with type 2&#xD;
           diabetes or insulin resistance)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify barriers to achieve best medical practices in non-alcoholic fatty liver&#xD;
           disease, such as barriers to adhere to treatment recommendations ,and to access to&#xD;
           complementary studies such as elastography or liver biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate patient reported outcomes&#xD;
