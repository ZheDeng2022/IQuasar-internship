  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Topical steroid therapy is considered the first line of treatment for Oral Inflammatory&#xD;
      Ulcerative Diseases with current treatment regimens requiring multiple application or rinses&#xD;
      daily. Using Mucolox™ as a vehicle to deliver topical dexamethasone to the oral mucosa has&#xD;
      the potential to effectively prolong contact time between the medication. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to determine the clinical efficacy and tolerability of compound&#xD;
      dexamethasone at 0.5 mg/5 mL in Mucolox™ for the treatment of Oral Inflammatory Ulcerative&#xD;
      Diseases as measured by a reduction in oral symptoms between patients treated with compounded&#xD;
      dexamethasone 0.5mg/5ml solution in Mucolox™ (group A) and patients treated with topical&#xD;
      commercial dexamethasone 0.5mg/5ml solution only (group B). and mucosa, leading to improved&#xD;
      clinical outcomes due to the need for less frequent application.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean Change from Baseline in Oral Pain Scores on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at 4 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Oral Pain Scores will be measured on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the score ranges from 0-10, zero indicating no pain and 10 indicating the worst pain. The pain score measured on a VAS scale will be compared between group A and group B to detect any significant differences pre and post treatment at 4 weeks.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change from Baseline in Reticulation/keratosis, erythema, and ulceration (REU) scores at 4 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Oral lesions will be scored using the REU system. Reticular/hyperkeratotic changes will be scored from 0 to 1 (0 = no white striations, 1 = presence of white striations or keratotic papules); erosive/erythematous lesions will be scored from 0 to 3 by area of involvement (0 = no lesion, 1 = lesions less than 1 cm2, 2 = lesions from 1 to 3 cm2, 3 = lesions greater than 3 cm2); ulcers will be scored from 0 to 3 by area of involvement. In order to evaluate the clinical improvement in clinician-reported outcome measures for oral lesions, REU scores within the compound dexamethasone solution in Mucolox™ group (Arm A) will be compared to that in the dexamethasone solution only group (Arm B). The REU scores will be summarized descriptively for each arm at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and pre-to-post treatment change. The pre-to-post treatment change will be compared between the arms using either student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test, depending on the distribution of the data.</description>
