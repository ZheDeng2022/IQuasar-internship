      The aim of this study is elucidate genetic susceptibility of patients with traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury (TBI) and symptoms of Brain Injury Associated Fatigue and Altered Cognition (BIAFAC)&#xD;
      using genome-wide association study (GWAS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Annually 1.5 million children and adults experience trauma to the head and brain that results&#xD;
      in a TBI. Our research suggests that in a subset of patients, TBI induces pituitary&#xD;
      dysfunction and abnormal growth hormone (GH) secretion. The clinical syndrome associated with&#xD;
      abnormal GH secretion is characterized by profound fatigue and cognitive dysfunction related&#xD;
      to executive function, short-term memory, and processing speed index. Fatigue in these&#xD;
      patients is profound and debilitating leaving them unable to maintain their usual activity&#xD;
      levels. We have termed this syndrome Brain Injury Associated Fatigue and Altered Cognition&#xD;
      (BIAFAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our recent work has shown that cognitive and physical dysfunction are significantly improved&#xD;
      with recombinant human growth hormone replacement in patients with BIAFAC. Improvements in&#xD;
      fatigue often precede (~3 months) improvements in cognition (~4-5 months) following rhGH&#xD;
      treatment. Although rhGH replacement relieves BIAFAC symptoms, it does not cure the&#xD;
      underlying cause, as symptoms reoccur with rhGH withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the mechanisms causing BIAFAC have not been determined, our previous research&#xD;
      demonstrated that a year of GH treatment resulted in symptom relief which was associated with&#xD;
      changes in brain morphometry and connectivity. These associated brain changes include&#xD;
      increased frontal cortical thickness and gray matter volume as well as resting state&#xD;
      connectivity changes in regions associated with somatosensory networks&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next step to understanding BIAFAC is to develop a biomarker that identifies individuals&#xD;
      that are susceptible to developing this syndrome. The University of Michigan maintains a&#xD;
      searchable DataDirect database of over 4 million individual patient medical records linked&#xD;
      via the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI) to genomic data collected from over 70,000&#xD;
      patients. By collaborating with the University of Michigan, we have a unique opportunity to&#xD;
      combine their extensive genomic database with the more than 100 UTMB patients we are&#xD;
      currently treating for BIAFAC to search for common genetic markers associated with BIAFAC. In&#xD;
      order to identify patients in the UM genomic database with BIAFAC, we will develop a risk&#xD;
      stratified machine-learning algorithm based on BIAFAC symptoms. Initial use of the algorithm&#xD;
      will begin with approximately 9,000 patients in the UM database that have already been&#xD;
      identified with a diagnosis code of fatigue and malaise. Once these patients are identified,&#xD;
      a select cohort will be contacted to confirm the accuracy of the algorithm in identifying&#xD;
      BIAFAC patients. Once we complete the genotyping of UTMB patients with BIAFAC and have&#xD;
      identified the patients with BIAFAC in the UM genomic database, a genome-wide association&#xD;
      study (GWAS) will be executed to look for common genetic markers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Identify patients in the UM MGI cohort who show positive traits associated&#xD;
      with BIAFAC. Patients in the UM Michigan Genomic Initiative (MGI) cohort will be filtered&#xD;
      through ICD-9, ICD-10, and CPT codes associated with fatigue, malaise, and other related&#xD;
      diagnoses. Natural language processing (NLP) approaches will be developed to parse clinical&#xD;
      notes from candidate patients, recognize relevant medical concepts, and combine features to&#xD;
      identify candidates. These will be evaluated for algorithmic accuracy using manual review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Develop medical concept mapping of EHR systems across UTMB and UM. Semantic&#xD;
      representations of medical concepts in UTMB and UM will be generated based on co-occurrence&#xD;
      patterns of these concepts summarized from each site. Statistical methods will be developed&#xD;
      to generate a mapping of the medical concepts between UTMB and UM and harmonize the data&#xD;
      across institutions leveraging the trained representations. The learned mapping can&#xD;
      facilitate the transfer of trained algorithms from one system to another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 3: Develop a computable phenotype to identify TBI patients with BIAFAC,&#xD;
      combining the concept mapping identified in Aim 2 with clinical note-based features&#xD;
      identified in Aim 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4: Conduct genetic analysis of the UTMB cohort. The MGI cohort individuals are&#xD;
      genotyped on an Infinium Global Screening Array and imputed to contain &gt;10M genetic markers.&#xD;
      We will use this data to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the phenotypes&#xD;
      identified in Aim 3 by testing each variant for association while accounting for confounders&#xD;
      such as population stratification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will study subjects (aged 18-70 years) with a history of mild TBI (n=100).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients presenting with TBI and BIAFAC symptoms will be invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TBI subjects will have saliva and possibly blood taken for DNA extraction and genotyping,&#xD;
      which will be used for the GWAS.&#xD;
