  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known fact, that prediabetes is a predictor of high cardiovascular mortality,&#xD;
      increasing the risk of developing such adverse cardiovascular events as myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, stroke and sudden cardiac death. The key pathogenetic link in development of&#xD;
      carbohydrates metabolism disorders (CMD) is insulin resistance (IR), which is one of the&#xD;
      crucial mechanisms for the development and progression of chronic heart failure (CHF). IR&#xD;
      disrupts the functioning of the myocardium due to endothelial dysfunction, inflammation,&#xD;
      oxidative stress, remodeling and impaired myocardial metabolism. In condition of a&#xD;
      combination of CMD and CHF the reverse development of hyperglycemia is also difficult due to&#xD;
      hyperactivation of neurohormonal systems - renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, in&#xD;
      particular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, drug therapy should neutralize the undesirable metabolic effects of hyperglycemia on the&#xD;
      course of CHF, as well as prevent the development of micro- and macrovascular complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will investigate the ability of metformin to impact on clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      (neurohormonal, lipid profiles, renal function) parameters of ischemic etiology heart failure&#xD;
      patients with prediabetes, as well as their quality of life and prognosis (incidence of&#xD;
      adverse cardiovascular events). These tests will be assessed at the beginning and repeated&#xD;
      after one year. At the end of the study we will investigate the difference between lifestyle&#xD;
      modification effect and metformin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is funded by Ministry of Education and Science of Kyrgyz Republic.&#xD;

      This is a single centre trial designed to investigate the benefit, if any, of 12-month&#xD;
      metformin 2000 mg/day treatment on clinical course of chronic heart failure in 78 patients&#xD;
      with coronary artery disease and impaired glucose tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be seen in three occasions: screening, baseline randomization, 6 month,&#xD;
      final 12 month, during which clinical and laboratory indicators will be assessed. There will&#xD;
      also be three telephone visits at: month 1, month 3, month 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a screening visit an initial history will be performed during following informed consent.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a laboratory, clinical and instrumental screening in Chronic Heart&#xD;
      Failure department of National Centre of cardiology and Internal Medicine named after&#xD;
      academician M.Mirrakhimov. Among with anthropologic and clinical data, prior to metformin&#xD;
      administration, blood samples were evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet all inclusion criteria will return for the randomization during&#xD;
      hospitalization to either Metformin or Lifestyle modification alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6 months of observation safety indicators will be evaluated, as well as fasting and&#xD;
      postprandial glucose, creatinine, ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the active arm, therapy will be metformin in an initial dose of 1000 mg/day (metformin 500&#xD;
      mg х2/day). Participants will continue on Metformin 500 mg x2/day for 2 weeks, following&#xD;
      safety blood checks this dose will be increased to 2000 mg/day. If the higher dose cannot be&#xD;
      tolerated it will be reduced to 1000 mg/day (or stopped if not tolerated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target dose of Metformin at 2000 mg/day was chosen based on previous study of metformin&#xD;
      in nondiabetic heart failure patients with IR&#xD;
