    <textblock>
      Empathy imbalance hypothesis suggests that individuals with autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)&#xD;
      should have a deficit of cognitive empathy and a surfeit of emotional empathy. Considering&#xD;
      that inconsistent amygdala reactivity to emotional faces might be ascribed to aberrant&#xD;
      attention in ASD, the investigators hypothesized to investigate if there would be an&#xD;
      imbalance between conscious and nonconscious emotional processing. This fMRI study recruited&#xD;
      26 youths and young adults with autism spectrum disorder and 25 matched controls, and&#xD;
      measured their amygdala reactivity and functional connectivity in response to conscious and&#xD;
      nonconscious (backward masked) perception of threatening faces.&#xD;

    <description>Immediately after fMRI scanning, participants underwent the detection task, during which they were shown all of the stimuli again and alerted of the presence of fearful faces. The subjects were administered a forced-choice test under the same presentation conditions as those during scanning and asked to indicate whether they observed a fearful face or not.</description>

    <description>There is no intervention to be administered in this study. Here, this fMRI study used the backwardly masked paradigm to elucidate how perceiving emotional expressions affects amygdala engagement and its related functional connectivity across two participant groups: ASD with and controls. All ASD participants were diagnosed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition's (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria (APA, 2013) and conÔ¨Årmed by clinical consensus. ASD individuals were recruited from a community autism program and referred to children's health doctors and child psychiatrists. Exclusion criteria for all participants were neurological abnormalities, a history of epilepsy or seizures, head trauma and IQ &lt;75. The subjects did not participate in any intervention or drug programs during the experimental period.</description>

Here, this fMRI study used the backwardly masked paradigm to elucidate how perceiving emotional expressions affects amygdala engagement and its related functional connectivity across two participant groups: ASD with and controls. The participants in the age- and sex-matched control group were recruited from the local community, and screened for major psychiatric illnesses by conducting structured interviews.</description>
