  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burkina Faso will be deploying next-generation ITNs through mass campaigns in pre-determined&#xD;
      provinces. As part of New Nets Project's initiative to catalyze the market introduction of&#xD;
      next-generation ITNs, enhanced surveillance activities will be conducted to support&#xD;
      observational impact analyses. As part of this enhanced surveillance, malaria infection&#xD;
      prevalence is being measured through annual cross-sectional surveys during peak transmission&#xD;
      periods using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) in children aged 6 to 59 months (under 5 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will also include strengthened routine data collection at all health facilities in the&#xD;
      districts. The present study aims to leverage the planned cross-sectional surveys and&#xD;
      strengthened routine data conducted by the New Nets Project in three of the study districts&#xD;
      (Banfora, Gaoua, and Orodara) to assess (1) whether the malaria infection prevalence data&#xD;
      collected during antenatal care (ANC) surveillance correlates with these estimates of&#xD;
      community infection prevalence in children 6 to 59 months and (2) if intervention coverage&#xD;
      data (particularly ITN ownership and use) collected from ANC surveillance are valid and&#xD;
      representative of the population as a whole. These additional data could catalyze a new model&#xD;
      of surveillance for malaria, and greatly simplify evaluation of the impact of new&#xD;
      interventions, as ANC surveillance could potentially replace or supplement cross-sectional&#xD;
      household surveys and provide more granular and timely data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All pregnant women attending first ANC visit at seven health facilities in each study&#xD;
      district and who are 20 years old or older or in a union will be eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
      Potential participants will be approached during their visit by a health facility worker.&#xD;
      During group counselling sessions at initial intake, women will be informed of this pilot&#xD;
      surveillance activity, and written informed consent will be obtained from each woman&#xD;
      individually prior to routine ANC testing. All consenting women attending ANC first visit at&#xD;
      a participating health facilities will be tested for malaria using an RDT and asked to&#xD;
      complete a study questionnaire which will include questions about the participant's net use,&#xD;
      and care seeking behavior. It is expected to take 15 minutes to complete. Women who test&#xD;
      positive for malaria will be given treatment according to national guidelines. There is no&#xD;
      additional benefit to individual participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives of this ANC surveillance pilot are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the prevalence of malaria infection and coverage of malaria control&#xD;
           interventions among pregnant women attending their first ANC visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the correlation between ANC surveillance parasite prevalence from this study,&#xD;
           malaria incidence measured from health facilities, and parasite prevalence collected by&#xD;
           the New Nets Project during cross-sectional household surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analyze the correlation between health seeking and net use/access in the ANC&#xD;
           surveillance and health seeking behavior compared to the cross-sectional survey&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data from public health surveillance systems are used for multiple purposes, including&#xD;
      measuring the burden and monitoring the trends of a disease; guiding the planning,&#xD;
      implementation, and evaluation of prevention and control programs; and prioritizing the&#xD;
      allocation of health resources. In addition to routine health surveillance activities, public&#xD;
      health programs often collect additional data on health indicators , as well as intervention&#xD;
      coverage and program utilization, via nationally representative household surveys, such as&#xD;
      the Demographic and Health Survey and the Malaria Indicator Survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These household surveys provide data to help measure the burden of and monitor trends in&#xD;
      malaria, including data on the prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in the&#xD;
      population. Additionally, because the surveys provide data on monitoring and coverage impact&#xD;
      indicators, they help guide the planning, implementation, and evaluation of prevention and&#xD;
      control programs, and prioritization of the allocation of national malaria control program&#xD;
      (NMCP) resources. Indeed, these representative surveys have become key tools for benchmarking&#xD;
      progress towards malaria control and elimination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the surveys are expensive to conduct and are limited by long periodic intervals&#xD;
      (e.g., every two to five years) and broad sampling strategies (i.e. generating national or&#xD;
      regional estimates of disease burden and intervention coverage) that fail to capture seasonal&#xD;
      trends or sub-regional heterogeneity, limiting their use for real-time or locally targeted&#xD;
      planning and response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine health information systems, on the other hand, may provide a continuous, granular&#xD;
      data source representative of all age groups, primarily to help measure the burden and&#xD;
      monitor the trends of symptomatic malaria and other diseases. Many countries have implemented&#xD;
      standardized, electronic-based health management information system (HMIS), on platforms such&#xD;
      as District Health Information System 2, which provide monthly health facility data in real&#xD;
      time. Despite being a potential source of valuable public health information, several factors&#xD;
      limit the utility of HMIS data and should be considered carefully. One key limitation is the&#xD;
      quality and representativity of the data being reported into HMIS, which is affected not only&#xD;
      by general data issues, but also by factors such as case management practices and stockouts.&#xD;
      These limitations require monitoring and health systems strengthening to overcome. HMIS data&#xD;
      on case numbers may also be biased because some symptomatic patients may not present to a&#xD;
      facility for care or may not seek care at all, and it can be difficult to interpret the&#xD;
      incidence because of uncertainties surrounding regional and local population estimates.&#xD;
      Further, not all health facilities report into HMIS; in many countries, the data derive&#xD;
      predominantly from public health facilities. If the population using alternative sources of&#xD;
      care for diagnosis and treatment of malaria (e.g., private facilities or traditional healers)&#xD;
      varies over time, or differs from those using public facilities, the data trends observed in&#xD;
      the HMIS may not be representative. Finally, as HMIS data are limited to patients presenting&#xD;
      with symptomatic illness, it is not possible to assess the burden and epidemiology of&#xD;
      asymptomatic infections, which are believed to represent the majority of malaria infections&#xD;
      in many populations. Representativeness and validity of routine data may also be affected by&#xD;
      diagnostic testing practices, which in turn may vary by health care provider performance,&#xD;
      seasonality, and availability of diagnostic commodities. Finally, data on monitoring and&#xD;
      coverage of malaria control interventions, such as insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs), are&#xD;
      not typically collected during routine health visits or reported in HMIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To build on the strengths and address the limitations of these two complementary surveillance&#xD;
      approaches, collecting data on parasite prevalence and coverage of malaria control&#xD;
      interventions during antenatal care (ANC) clinic visits may provide an easily accessible,&#xD;
      reliable, and representative source for monitoring population trends in malaria control with&#xD;
      a higher degree of granularity than is possible in nationally representative household&#xD;
      surveys. ANC coverage is high across sub-Saharan Africa; about 90% of women make at least one&#xD;
      ANC visit in each pregnancy. Only six countries reported that fewer than 80% of women&#xD;
      attended ANC at least once during their most recent pregnancy. Thus, pregnant women attending&#xD;
      their first ANC visit are likely to be representative of the overall population of pregnant&#xD;
      women. Pregnant women attending their first ANC visit are an ideal population for monitoring&#xD;
      trends in malaria prevalence over time, as monthly ANC attendance remains relatively constant&#xD;
      over time (minimal effects of seasonality) and is independent of malaria symptoms, thus&#xD;
      giving an general infection prevalence estimate similar to that of a community survey. It has&#xD;
      been demonstrated that malaria parasite prevalence among pregnant women correlates with the&#xD;
      prevalence among children under five years of age. This highlights the possibility that&#xD;
      pregnant women could be a good sentinel population for representative measures of trends in&#xD;
      malaria prevalence, and raises the question of whether pregnant women would be a good source&#xD;
      of data on coverage of malaria control interventions that could be readily tracked over time.&#xD;
      Once scaled up, these systems may also provide these data more frequently, at a finer spatial&#xD;
      scale, and at a lower cost than household surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Burkina Faso, the NMCP is distributing new ITNs in mass campaigns in nine provinces. The&#xD;
      New Nets Project is funding community surveys in three of these provinces, including rapid&#xD;
      diagnostic test (RDT) testing in these provinces, to look at the impact of ITNs. This&#xD;
      presents an important opportunity to validate whether the coverage of malaria control&#xD;
      interventions and measures of parasite prevalence among pregnant women at first ANC visits is&#xD;
      representative of the population at large in Burkina Faso. In three districts, pregnant women&#xD;
      presenting for their first ANC visit will be consented and tested for malaria using an RDT&#xD;
      and asked to complete a study questionnaire. A comparison of results obtained at first ANC&#xD;
      visits will be made to results from concurrent household surveys conducted by the New Nets&#xD;
      Project. If validated and found to be a sustainable change to ANC visit procedures, data from&#xD;
      the ANC sentinel population could be used to augment or even replace much of the data&#xD;
      collected through the use of Malaria Indicator Surveys, which are expensive and infrequently&#xD;
      conducted and generally only powered to the regional level. This data could then be&#xD;
      triangulated with malaria burden data from the outpatient department to understand variation&#xD;
      in community prevalence (as measured through ANC) and malaria clinical incidence, thereby&#xD;
      guiding programmatic decision-making and response.&#xD;

        Cohorts will be selected from three districts in Burkina Faso: Banfora, Gaoua, Orodara.&#xD;
        Malaria is endemic in Burkina Faso, with heightened transmission June and October. The&#xD;
        overall malaria incidence per 1,000 people is 722 in Gaoua, 729 in Banfora, and 631 in&#xD;
        Orodara. The 2017 Malaria Indicator Survey found that malaria prevalence was 16.9% in&#xD;
        children under five, a significant decrease from the 45.7% found during the 2014 survey,&#xD;
        though the survey took place after the peak transmission season and could be much higher.&#xD;
        Insecticide treated nets are the primary vector control method to prevent malaria and are&#xD;
        distributed during mass campaigns, antenatal care and Expanded Programme on Immunizations&#xD;
        visits, and in the private sector. Four rounds of seasonal malaria chemoprevention is given&#xD;
        to children 3 to 59 months of age between July and October throughout much of the country.&#xD;
        An indoor residual spray program was recently restarted 2012 and now covers three&#xD;
        high-burden districts.&#xD;
