    <textblock>
      This is an open-labelled single arm trial of pembrolizumab and imatinib mesylate in subjects&#xD;
      with unresectable or metastatic KIT-mutant melanoma that are refractory to standard therapy.&#xD;
      The phase Ib and II study will be conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability and response&#xD;
      rate data of this combination therapy. KIT-mutant tumors will be confirmed in previously&#xD;
      biopsied tumors. This analysis will be done by next-generation sequencing.&#xD;

      This trial is conducted as &quot;Advanced medicine&quot; authorized by the Ministry of Health, Labor,&#xD;
      and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan, and in in conformance with Clinical Trial Act.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PIb study is a dose-escalation study comprising two dose levels of imatinib mesylate with&#xD;
      fixed dose of pembrolizumab to evaluate safety and tolerability and identify maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose/administered, and determine recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In PII study, a Simon's minimax two-stage design is employed.The treatment period with the&#xD;
      combination therapy of both studies will continue every 21 days for up to 33 cycles&#xD;
      (approximately 2 years) as long as subjects are receiving benefit from treatment and have not&#xD;
      had disease progression or met any criteria for study withdrawal.&#xD;

&#xD;
             2. Have histologically confirmed melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Have unresectable or metastatic melanoma with KIT mutations detected by&#xD;
             next-generation sequencing which was performed at clinical laboratories accredited by&#xD;
             international standards such as CLIA and CAP certification.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Have progressed on treatment with an anti-PD-1/L1 mAb administered either as&#xD;
             monotherapy, or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors or other therapies.&#xD;
             PD-1 treatment progression is defined by meeting all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Received at least 2 doses of an approved anti-PD-1/L1 mAb.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Has demonstrated disease progression after PD-1/L1 as defined by RECIST 1.1. The&#xD;
                  initial evidence of disease progression is to be confirmed by second assessment&#xD;
                  no less than 4 weeks from the date of the first documented progressive disease,&#xD;
                  in the absence of rapid clinical progression. This determination is made by the&#xD;
                  investigator. Once progressive disease is confirmed, the initial date of&#xD;
                  progressive disease documentation will be considered the date of disease&#xD;
                  progression.&#xD;

                  anti-PD-1/L1 mAb or during the treatment. In adjuvant therapy, progressive&#xD;
                  disease has been documented within 6 months from the last dose of anti-PD-1/L1&#xD;
                  mAb or during the treatment.&#xD;

                  within 14-days prior to enrollment on study.&#xD;
