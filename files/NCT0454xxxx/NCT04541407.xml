  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is testing two novel combinations (temozolomide plus osimertinib OR temozolomide&#xD;
      plus lorlatinib) which have not been evaluated in clinical trials. Thus, the exact benefits&#xD;
      of these novel combinations are unclear. However, based on the mechanism of action of&#xD;
      temozolomide and CNS(Central Nervous System) penetration/activity in other tumor types, it is&#xD;
      hypothesized that adding temozolomide to osimertinib or temozolomide to lorlatinib may&#xD;
      provide improvement in CNS disease control in patients with CNS progression on either of&#xD;
      these latter two TKIs (Tyrosine kinase inhibitors).&#xD;

    <description>Temozolomide is an oral alkylating chemotherapy which has good CNS penetration and has demonstrated CNS responses in both primary brain tumors (e.g., glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma) and in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) brain metastases. Preclinical data from glioblastoma suggests potential synergy of concurrent ALK or EGFR inhibition with temozolomide and early phase trials in glioblastoma are ongoing investigating such combinations. It is felt that combining temozolomide with osimertinib or lorlatinib may be beneficial for patients with progressive CNS disease on either of these TKIs because of the high CNS penetration of temozolomide, good CNS activity of temozolomide in other tumor types and preclinical data from glioblastoma suggesting a potential enhanced effect of concurrent EGFR and ALK/ROS1 inhibition with temozolomide.</description>

             malabsorption disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;

             LP with cytology is required to have demonstrated progressive leptomeningeal disease&#xD;
             on osimertinib or lorlatinib within 21 days of starting study drugs. CT of brain with&#xD;
             contrast can be used to demonstrate progressive disease if patients have a documented&#xD;
             anaphylaxis to gadolinium contrast and/or other contraindication to MRI (e.g., severe&#xD;
             claustrophobia that cannot be managed with anxiolytics).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients must not be pregnant. Women/men of reproductive potential must have agreed to&#xD;
             use an effective contraceptive method (see section 6.6 for list of effective methods).&#xD;
             Women must use an effective contraceptive method during the study and for 6 months&#xD;
             following the last dose. Men having sex with women of reproductive potential are&#xD;
             required to use effective contraception during the study and for 6 months following&#xD;
             the last dose. A woman is considered to be of &quot;reproductive potential&quot; if she has had&#xD;
             menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months. In addition to routine&#xD;
             contraceptive methods, &quot;effective contraception&quot; (see section 6.6 for list of&#xD;
             effective contraceptive methods) also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery&#xD;
             intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a sideeffect of pregnancy prevention) defined&#xD;
             as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation. However, if at&#xD;
             any point a previously celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during&#xD;
             the time period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he/she is&#xD;
             responsible for beginning contraceptive measures. Women of reproductive potential are&#xD;
             not to be nursing during the study and for six months following the last dose of all&#xD;
             study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Women on the lorlatinib arm who are of reproductive potential agree to use a&#xD;
             non-hormonal method of contraception during the study and for the time periods&#xD;
             outlined above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             mutations are defined as 2 or more mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain with&#xD;
             the following exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. C797S and EGFR exon 19 deletion or EGFR exon 21 point mutation and&#xD;

             stopped greater than 3 half-lives prior to starting study drugs for patients receiving&#xD;
             lorlatinib plus temozolomide. Strong CYP3A inhibitors should be stopped greater than 3&#xD;
