  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is an important public health problem worldwide. There are large regional differences&#xD;
      in the prevalence of overweight and obesity. Obesity is a growing problem in both developed&#xD;
      and low-income countries. Obesity is a common condition characterized by excessive fat&#xD;
      accumulation in adipose tissue. It is associated with metabolic, hematological and&#xD;
      musculoskeletal complications, increased risk of dyslipidemia, heart disease, diabetes and&#xD;
      some malignancies, leading to a shortened life span. Inflammation from adipose tissue has&#xD;
      been identified as the main source of systemic inflammation and may also be associated with&#xD;
      insulin resistance. Adipocytes and adipose tissue-related macrophages from obese individuals&#xD;
      are an important source of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1 and MCP-1. It has&#xD;
      also been shown that decreased levels of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, are associated&#xD;
      with obesity and metabolic syndrome.We aimed to evaluate changes in 13 different&#xD;
      proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy&#xD;
      or gastric bypass.&#xD;

      Obesity is an important public health problem worldwide. There are large regional differences&#xD;

      are an important source of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1 and MCP-1. It has&#xD;
      also been shown that decreased levels of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, are associated&#xD;
      with obesity and metabolic syndrome.There are many studies examining the changes in the&#xD;
      weight and blood values of patients after bariatric surgery. Among these blood values,&#xD;
      cytokines, which are inflammation mediators, were evaluated. However, in these studies,&#xD;
      either sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass was evaluated separately and generally focused on&#xD;
      TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1, IL10, and MCP-1 cytokines. There are conflicting results regarding the&#xD;
      parameters examined in these studies. In some studies, no difference was found in the&#xD;
      cytokines examined, while some regression was observed in proinflammatory cytokines. The&#xD;
      situation is similar for IL10, which is one of the anti-inflammatory cytokines. An increase&#xD;
      in IL10 values was observed in a study evaluating patients who underwent gastritic bypass,&#xD;
      whereas no difference was found in a study evaluating sleeve gastrectomy patients.We aimed to&#xD;
      evaluate changes in 13 different proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines before and 6&#xD;
      month after the surgery in patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass&#xD;
