  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the active development of surgical methods of treatment (endovascular embolization&#xD;
      and microsurgical clipping) of cerebral aneurysms, determining the indications and method of&#xD;
      surgical treatment of cerebral aneurysms still causes debate in many cases. To a greater&#xD;
      extent, this concerns the treatment of unruptured aneurysms. While there are a number of&#xD;
      randomized trials of surgical treatment of ruptured cerebral aneurysms, there is currently no&#xD;
      published randomized trial comparing surgical clipping and endovascular embolization of&#xD;
      unruptured aneurysms. The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      microsurgical clipping and endovascular embolization of cerebral aneurysms (both ruptured and&#xD;
      unruptured) in a prospective, randomized fashion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is planned to include 200 patients. Before randomization, patients will be&#xD;
      stratified according to the presence or absence of aneurysm rupture in the acute period. The&#xD;
      stratified patients will be randomized into two groups (100 to the microsurgical clipping&#xD;
      group and 100 to the endovascular embolization group). Each group will be divided into 2&#xD;
      subgroups of 50 people each: the first subgroup includes patients in the acute period of&#xD;
      aneurysm rupture, the second subgroup includes patients with unruptured aneurysms. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed postoperatively, outcome endpoints will be assessed at discharge, 6 and 12&#xD;
      months. At discharge and after 6 and 12 months, patients will be assessed clinically using a&#xD;
      modified Rankin scale (mRS). Cerebral angiography will be performed intraoperatively&#xD;
      (endovascular group), after surgery (microsurgical group) and 12 months after discharge (both&#xD;
      groups). Thus, the outcome of surgical treatment, including periprocedural complications and&#xD;
      mortality, will be assessed both clinically and angiographically.&#xD;

    <description>Assessment of the clinical condition of patients will be carried out according to the modified Rankin scale (mRS). Primary Outcome Measure is modified Rankin Scale &lt; or = to 2. mRS will be studied before surgery, after surgery, 6 and 12 months after discharge. Also the dynamics of changes in mRS compared with the baseline values will be analyzed. The null hypothesis is that no difference in outcome will be detected between the endovascular and surgical treatment arms. A statistically significant difference will then be considered evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis, that one treatment is superior to the other.</description>
