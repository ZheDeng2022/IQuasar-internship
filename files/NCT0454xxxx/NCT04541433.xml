  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity of AZD9833 in Japanese women with&#xD;
      endocrineresistant ER+ HER2- breast cancer that is not amenable to treatment with curative&#xD;
      intent. This study consists of 2 cohorts, Cohort1 and Cohort2. In cohort 1 (for tolerability&#xD;
      evaluation), a minimum of 3, or up to 6, evaluable Japanese patients with ER+ HER2- breast&#xD;
      cancer will be enrolled. In cohort 2 (for exploratory research), at least 6 to maximum 12&#xD;
      evaluable Japanese patients with ER+ HER2- breast cancer will be enrolled.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD9833 in Japanese women with ER+ HER2-&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the anti-tumor activity and efficacy of AZD9833&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate AZD9833 activity in tumor cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 1, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity of AZD9833 in Japanese women with&#xD;
      endocrineresistant ER+ HER2- breast cancer that is not amenable to treatment with curative&#xD;
      intent. Eligible patients will receive AZD9833. In cohort 1 (for tolerability evaluation), a&#xD;
      minimum of 3 to maximum 6 evaluable patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cohort 2, if paired biopsy after administration of the study drug becomes inoperable&#xD;
      during administration of the study drug, additional subjects can be added to obtain an&#xD;
      evaluable biopsy sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cohort 2 (for exploratory research), eligible patients will receive AZD9833 once daily and&#xD;
      at least 6 to maximum 12 patients will be enrolled. In cohort 2, paired biopsy sample will be&#xD;
      collected from at least 6 and maximum 12 patients. If paired biopsy after administration of&#xD;
      the study drug becomes inoperable during administration of the study drug, additional&#xD;
      subjects can be added to obtain an evaluable biopsy sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum 18 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
