      This is a phase II, prospective, longitudinal, multi-center trial of poly-ICLC (Hiltonol ®)&#xD;
      treatment for progressive low-grade gliomas in pediatric patients with NF1. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate the efficacy of poly-ICLC in pediatric NF1 patients with progressive&#xD;
      low-grade glioma (LGG) as measured by objective tumor response rate (CR+PR) within the first&#xD;
      48 weeks (12 cycles) of therapy. There will also be secondary and exploratory objectives&#xD;
      listed in the detailed description below.&#xD;

      This is a phase II, prospective, longitudinal, multi-center trial of poly-ICLC (Hiltonol ®)&#xD;
      treatment for progressive low-grade gliomas in pediatric patients with NF1. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate the efficacy of poly-ICLC in pediatric NF1 patients with progressive&#xD;
      low-grade glioma (LGG) as measured by objective tumor response rate (CR+PR) within the first&#xD;
      48 weeks (12 cycles) of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine 12, 24 and 60 month progression free survival (PFS) in pediatric NF1 patients&#xD;
           with progressive LGG treated with poly-ICLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the efficacy of poly-ICLC in pediatric NF1 patients with progressive LGG as&#xD;
           measured by best objective tumor response rate (CR+PR) within 24 cycles of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the efficacy of poly-ICLC in pediatric NF1 patients with progressive LGG as&#xD;
           measured by clinical benefit response rate (CR+PR+MR+SD) after 12 and 24 cycles of&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess the toxicity associated with poly-ICLC treatment in pediatric NF1 patients with&#xD;
           LGG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the visual outcome measures in children with progressive optic pathway gliomas&#xD;
           treated with poly-ICLC. Visual response is defined as 0.2 logMAR or greater in acuity&#xD;
           improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate patient reported outcomes and quality of life measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate biological correlates.&#xD;
