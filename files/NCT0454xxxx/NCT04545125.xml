  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The UK population is ageing. Whilst many people remain active and in good health as they get&#xD;
      older, getting older is associated with the onset of many common medical conditions, as well&#xD;
      as memory and mobility problems. There is a natural decline in heart and lung fitness with&#xD;
      age, although this may be slowed by regular exercise and physical activity. The majority of&#xD;
      digestive system problems that require operations (such as bowel cancer) are more common in&#xD;
      older people. These operations can reduce an older person's ability to look after themselves&#xD;
      and their quality of life. In some cases there is a trade-off between major surgery and a&#xD;
      smaller operation or procedure with a lower chance of cure, but a faster rate of recovery and&#xD;
      fewer problems immediately after the procedure. (Examples of smaller operations include&#xD;
      bringing the bowel out onto the abdominal wall; creating a 'stoma'. Examples of procedures&#xD;
      include inserting a tube inside the bowel or oesophagus to open up a blockage; insertion of a&#xD;
      'stent'). Some patients may be advised or may choose not to undergo any form of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deciding whether a person is fit enough to undergo a major operation is difficult and depends&#xD;
      on patient factors (e.g. heart and lung fitness, other medical conditions, patient choice)&#xD;
      and technical factors (location and spread of disease, availability of other options for&#xD;
      treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the outpatient setting there are a number of tests that can be used to try to work out&#xD;
      what the risks of a major operation will be for a particular person. These can then guide&#xD;
      different approaches to try to lessen these risks. Examples include exercise programmes,&#xD;
      dietary supplements and anxiety management programmes in the period before the operation. In&#xD;
      the emergency setting there is often not sufficient time before their operation but there are&#xD;
      still a number of ways of improving the chances of a good recovery, such as meeting with a&#xD;
      physiotherapist and early planning for discharge needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to explore:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Whether patients who have poor outcomes after surgery can be identified at the start of&#xD;
           their surgical journey&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Whether there are specific patient characteristics that are associated with whether&#xD;
           individual patients undergo major surgery or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What patients feel about different support measures that may be put in place to try to&#xD;
           improve outcomes&#xD;

      The UK population is aging. Under-investigation and under-treatment of older people is&#xD;
      common, with rates of surgery declining with age, despite the incidence of surgically treated&#xD;
      gastrointestinal pathology increasing with age. There are large variations in outcomes in&#xD;
      older people, between different surgical units in the UK, which suggests that not all&#xD;
      patients are receiving the same level of care or access to resources. In GI surgery, the&#xD;
      concern is that patients in centres with low elective surgery rates will be inappropriately&#xD;
      denied the benefits of operative intervention (disease control, symptom improvement), with&#xD;
      consequently higher rates of emergency admission and intervention. Conversely, in centres&#xD;
      with high rates of elective surgery, patients may be inappropriately subjected to the&#xD;
      morbidity or even mortality of surgery with limited or no benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major surgery remains one of the most debilitating events that an older person may experience&#xD;
      and may profoundly influence functional decline and disability. Optimisation of outcomes in&#xD;
      older patients with comorbidities and frailty requires multi-professional input which is&#xD;
      often lacking. Adverse factors associated with ageing include co-morbidity, polypharmacy,&#xD;
      cognitive impairment, dependency and frailty, all of which are associated with increased all&#xD;
      cause mortality in the general population. There is also a natural decline in&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness with age, however this may be modifiable with physical activity or&#xD;
      exercise. Malnutrition and psychological problems are also very common in patients requiring&#xD;
      gastrointestinal surgery. When these at-risk individuals are exposed to the stress of major&#xD;
      abdominal surgery, post-operative mortality and morbidity also increase. Common lifestyle&#xD;
      choices, including smoking, excess alcohol consumption and sedentary behaviours, add to this&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
