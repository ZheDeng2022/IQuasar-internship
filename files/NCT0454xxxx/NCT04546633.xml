    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the investigational&#xD;
      drug KAF156 in combination with a solid dispersion formulation of lumefantrine (LUM-SDF) in&#xD;
      pediatric patients (6 months to &lt; 18 years of age) with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.&#xD;
      There is an unmet medical need for anti-malarial treatment with a new mechanism of action to&#xD;
      reduce the probability of developing resistance, and for a duration shorter than 3 days of&#xD;
      treatment and/or reduced pill burden.&#xD;

      This Phase 2 study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      investigational drug KAF156 and a Solid Dispersion Formulation of lumefantrine (LUM-SDF) when&#xD;
      administered in combination once daily for two days in pediatric patients 6 months to &lt; 18&#xD;
      years of age with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In addition, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK) of the drug combination will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be three age-descending cohorts: Run-in Cohort, Cohort 1 and Cohort 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to understand the impact of food on exposure. In adult healthy volunteers,&#xD;
      LUM-SDF alone has shown a food effect whereas KAF156 does not have a food effect. This new&#xD;
      study will first explore the effect of food on lumefantrine and KAF156 PK in malaria patients&#xD;
      12 to &lt; 18 years old with malaria caused by P. falciparum before younger patients are&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, efficacy, safety and tolerability of the combination of KAF156 and LUM-SDF will be&#xD;
      evaluated in younger patients with and without food, first in Cohort 1 of patients 2 to &lt; 12&#xD;
      years old and then in Cohort 2 of patients 6 months to &lt; 2 years old.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized study in adolescents and children with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.&#xD;
This study will first explore the effect of food on lumefantrine and KAF156 PK in a Run-in Cohort of patients 12 to &lt; 18 years old with malaria caused by P. falciparum, before younger patients are assessed. Then, efficacy, safety and tolerability of the combination of KAF156 and LUM-SDF will be evaluated in younger patients with and without food, first in Cohort 1 of patients 2 to &lt; 12 years old and then in Cohort 2 of patients 6 months to &lt; 2 years old.&#xD;
Randomization is stratified by country for the first 24 patients in the Run-in cohort, by body weight for the first 24 patients in Cohort 1 (aged 6 to &lt; 12 years) and by age group (6 to &lt; 12 years and 2 to &lt; 6 years) and country in the remaining patients in Cohort 1, and by country in Cohort 2 to achieve the equal treatment allocation within weight band/age group/country.</intervention_model_description>
