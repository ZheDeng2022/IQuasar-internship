  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to compare the clinical and radiographic success of triple&#xD;
      antibiotic paste (TAP) which includes (metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and minocycline) and&#xD;
      Vitapex (calcium hydroxide/iodoform paste) for root canal treatment of pulpally involved&#xD;
      teeth.&#xD;

      This study evaluated and compared the clinical and radiographic efficacy of&#xD;
      non-instrumentation triple antibiotic paste pulp therapy (TAP) versus Vitapex pulpectomy in&#xD;
      non-vital primary molars. Healthy 5 to 9 years old children with at least one non-vital&#xD;
      primary molar were included in the study. molars were divided based on the subject's&#xD;
      cooperation level and parental preference into two groups. In the first group, molars&#xD;
      received TAP and in the second group, they received Vitapex pulpectomy followed by a&#xD;
      stainless-steel crown. The TAP was freshly prepared and proportioned in equal parts by volume&#xD;
      (metronidazole, minocycline, and ciprofloxacin=1:1:1) before the scheduled treatment&#xD;
      appointment. The clinical and radiographic examination was performed by two calibrated and&#xD;
      trained pediatric dentists at the pre-operative baseline and at the six- and 12-months&#xD;
      follow-up visits.&#xD;
