  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following a surgical procedure, patients may experience complications, such as a surgical&#xD;
      site infection (SSI). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) define a SSI as an&#xD;
      incisional or organ space infection which occurs following a surgical procedure. The severity&#xD;
      is then classified as a superficial, deep or organ space infection, occurring within 30 days&#xD;
      of surgery. Despite improvements in patient care and a variety of available preoperative,&#xD;
      intraoperative and postoperative infection prevention strategies, SSIs still occur very&#xD;
      frequently. They account for 20% of hospital infections and are associated with important&#xD;
      economic and patient outcomes such as morbidity, mortality and length of stay. It is&#xD;
      estimated that over half (55%) of SSIs could be prevented. One proposed intervention to&#xD;
      reduce SSIs is the intraoperative irrigation of incisional wounds. By washing a solution over&#xD;
      an open wound, debris, bacteria and bodily fluids may be removed prior to wound closure at&#xD;
      the end of a procedure. Although many studies have been conducted, uncertainty remains with&#xD;
      respect to the following: 1) the need for irrigation; 2) the solution used to irrigate; 3)&#xD;
      the method of irrigation (i.e. pour, syringe, pressure and/or pulsed delivery); and 4) the&#xD;
      volume of irrigation, leading to conflicting guidelines and practice heterogeneity. In this&#xD;
      trial, adult patients scheduled to undergo an elective abdominal open or laparoscopic&#xD;
      procedure will be randomly assigned to incisional wound irrigation with povidone-iodine&#xD;
      solution; or incisional wound irrigation with saline; or no irrigation. This trial will be&#xD;
      conducted under the IMPACTS (Innovative, Multicentre, Patient-centred Approach to Clinical&#xD;
      Trials in Surgery) program umbrella and will follow IMPACTS methodology. For the Vanguard&#xD;
      trial, the aim is to determine the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial. Future&#xD;
      outcomes of interest include surgical site infection and quality of life, among others.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background/Rationale: Recent international Guidelines and reviews have highlighted that&#xD;
      studies of intraoperative irrigation are small, outdated (i.e., no longer reflect current&#xD;
      standards of care), and judged to be of very low to moderate quality, and have called for&#xD;
      additional RCTs. For example, as per the WHO Guidelines, RCTs are needed to assess frequently&#xD;
      utilized irrigation solutions and their effect on SSI and state that a suitable alternative&#xD;
      to povidone-iodine is currently unknown. Furthermore, determining whether irrigation with&#xD;
      antiseptics and antibiotics can reduce SSIs was listed as a key research recommendation by&#xD;
      NICE, in addition to determining cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Further evidence is&#xD;
      required to support or refute the effectiveness of intraoperative irrigation in reducing SSIs&#xD;
      and to address practice heterogeneity, with a focus on establishing whether irrigation is&#xD;
      needed, and if so, which solution is optimal for this practice. We aim to address this&#xD;
      knowledge gap by assessing the benefit of intraoperative wound irrigation with&#xD;
      povidone-iodine solution as compared to with saline, or no irrigation in adults aged 18 years&#xD;
      or older who are scheduled to undergo an elective abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Before embarking on a definitive RCT, this pilot trial has five specific&#xD;
      feasibility objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess our ability to accrue patients using the IMPACTS Program design platform at&#xD;
           multiple institutions, over the course of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess our ability to adaptively randomize patients and deliver the randomized&#xD;
           assignment using the IMPACTS Program design platform, over the course of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess our ability to collect complete data directly from participants (patients and&#xD;
           clinicians) on: surgical site infection and quality of life over the course of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To examine our ability to carry out data linkages using the IMPACTS Program design&#xD;
           platform over the course of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To estimate the rate of surgical site infections to inform the sample size calculation&#xD;
           for the definitive trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a multicenter, pragmatic, open-label, 3-arm Vanguard RCT. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized using an adaptive design to incisional wound irrigation with&#xD;
      povidone-iodine versus incisional wound irrigation with saline versus no irrigation.&#xD;
      Participants will be followed until 30 days after surgery to assess the incidence of SSIs,&#xD;
      with additional outcomes collected until 90 days after surgery. If feasibility is&#xD;
      demonstrated during the pilot trial, we will plan to conduct a definitive trial. If there are&#xD;
      only minimal changes to the protocol, we will include data from the pilot phase into the&#xD;
      definitive trial analysis (i.e. a Vanguard design).&#xD;
