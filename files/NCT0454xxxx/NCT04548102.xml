  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up till now, there is insufficient evidence that daily fetal movement counting for pregnant&#xD;
      women who are already have a history of high risk pregnancy is beneficial or not in term of&#xD;
      early detection and preventing adverse pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The aim of the current study is to evaluate the effect of fetal movement counting on&#xD;
      maternal and fetal outcome&#xD;

      The researchers met the pregnant women in antenatal clinics during their routine follow up.&#xD;
      Woman who was eligible to be recruited in the study signed the consent after description of&#xD;
      the study's purpose. Pregnant women in the study group received verbal information regarding&#xD;
      normal fetal movements (i.e. description of the changing pattern of movement as the fetus&#xD;
      develops, normal sleep/wake cycles, and factors which may modify the mother's perception of&#xD;
      movements such as maternal weight and placental position), and its importance to be followed&#xD;
      during the third trimester. Further, each pregnant woman in the study group was trained how&#xD;
      to count the fetal movement (i.e.lying down on her left side after taking her meal, and&#xD;
      concentrating on fetal movements, calculate it three times per day, half an hour/ one time&#xD;
      and record it in the chart). As a rule, if there are less than 10 movements felt in 2 hours,&#xD;
      women should contact her health care provider immediately (Royal college of obstetrician &amp;&#xD;
      gynecologists, 2011). Fetal movements counting chart was provided and women telephoned once a&#xD;
      week in order to ensure proper recording. They also asked to present the fetal movements'&#xD;
      chart to the researcher and thier health care providers in each antenatal follow up visit.&#xD;
      Pregnant women in both groups; the study and the control groups followed according to thier&#xD;
      antenatal visits schedule till delivery. Women in the control group received the antenatal&#xD;
      hospital standard care. The maternal and neonatal outcomes had been assessed at delivery&#xD;
      unit.&#xD;
