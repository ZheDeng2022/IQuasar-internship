  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two different formulations of mirikizumab in healthy&#xD;
      participants. This study will compare how much of each formulation gets into the blood stream&#xD;
      and how long it takes the body to remove it. Information about any side effects that may&#xD;
      occur will also be collected. Participants will remain in the study for about 12 weeks, after&#xD;
      receiving study drug.&#xD;
