  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate whether treatment with alpelisib in combination with&#xD;
      fulvestrant prolongs Progression Free Survival (PFS) compared to treatment with placebo in&#xD;
      combination with fulvestrant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary scientific question of interest is: what is the treatment effect based on PFS for&#xD;
      alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant versus placebo in combination with fulvestrant in&#xD;
      Chinese men and postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer&#xD;
      with a PIK3CA mutation, who received prior treatment with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) either&#xD;
      as (neo) adjuvant treatment or as treatment for advanced disease, regardless of study&#xD;
      treatment discontinuation or start of new anti-neoplastic therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study&#xD;
      conducted in Chinese men and postmenopausal women with HR- positive, HER2-negative, PIK3CA&#xD;
      mutant advanced breast cancer which progressed on or after AI treatment. The study also&#xD;
      includes a single arm, open-label cohort (the PK cohort) to conduct pharmacokinetic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the randomized cohort, in the randomized treatment phase, subjects will be randomized 1:1&#xD;
      to receive alpelisib or matching placebo plus fulvestrant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of approximately 120 subjects will be enrolled; randomization will be stratified by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Lung and/or liver metastases (yes versus no)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Previous treatment with any CDK4/6 inhibitor (yes versus no) The total number of&#xD;
           subjects pre-treated with any CDK4/6 inhibitor will be limited to 30% of the total&#xD;
           number of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 15 subjects meeting the same inclusion/exclusion criteria as the randomized&#xD;
      cohort will be enrolled into the PK cohort. Subjects in the PK cohort will receive alpelisib&#xD;
      plus fulvestrant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will continue to receive study treatment until disease progression as determined by&#xD;
      investigator, unacceptable toxicity, or until discontinuation of study treatment due to any&#xD;
      other reason.&#xD;
