  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is naturally aversive and often distressing. Pain coping and self-regulatory skills have&#xD;
      been shown to effectively reduce pain-related distress and other symptoms. The purpose of the&#xD;
      study is to pilot a single-session videoconference-delivered pain education class (Empowered&#xD;
      Relief) for bolstering pain and symptom management in people with chronic pain. Class&#xD;
      participants learn skills and develop a personalized plan to use the skills every day. The&#xD;
      study will follow participants 3 months by administering 5 follow-up surveys at 1 &amp; 2 weeks&#xD;
      and 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months post-treatment to determine whether the class confers&#xD;
      long-term benefits across various aspects of health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inadequate treatment of chronic pain is an interrelated public health crisis. An Institute of&#xD;
      Medicine Pain Report noted that chronic pain affects ~100 million American adults and costs&#xD;
      $635 billion annually. There is a critical need to better integrate behavioral medicine and&#xD;
      self-management strategies to treat pain comprehensively and apply a 'whole person' approach&#xD;
      to pain care. To date, the U.S. lacks scalable behavioral medicine for pain thereby&#xD;
      underscoring the need for solutions that are accessible, low-cost, and low-burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poor access to behavioral pain care contributes substantially to chronic pain burden because&#xD;
      patient-level factors-such as pain catastrophizing-remain untreated and the multidimensional&#xD;
      nature of pain ignored. Pain catastrophizing - a pattern of negative cognitive and emotional&#xD;
      responses to actual or anticipated pain is a potent prognostic for pain and disability&#xD;
      trajectories. Pain catastrophizing is effectively treated with 8-week skills-based group&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pain (pain-CBT), yet pain-CBT is inaccessible to&#xD;
      most Americans due to few trained therapists and the burdens of treatment time and costs.&#xD;
      Efficient, effective solutions are urgently needed to provide access to skills-based&#xD;
      behavioral medicine that equips patients to reduce pain catastrophizing and better&#xD;
      self-manage chronic pain. To address this unmet need, the investigators developed and tested&#xD;
      a single-session, 2-hour, pain-CBT skills-based behavioral medicine class (&quot;Empowered&#xD;
      Relief&quot;) to reduce pain catastrophizing and pain correlates. In a 3-arm randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial involving in-person delivery of treatments, results suggest that Empowered Relief was&#xD;
      non-inferior to 8-week cognitive behavioral therapy and superior to a health education class&#xD;
      for reducing pain catastrophizing and improving multiple secondary outcomes at 3 months&#xD;
      post-treatment in individuals with chronic low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, Empowered Relief is being translated from class delivery to an online&#xD;
      format. Implementing a 2-arm randomized controlled trial of a single-session, video&#xD;
      conference-based, group-intervention version of &quot;Empowered Relief&quot; and comparing it to Usual&#xD;
      Care in mixed etiology chronic pain. Outcome 1, Empowered Relief will be superior to the&#xD;
      Usual Care for reducing pain catastrophizing at the 1-month follow-up. Outcome 2, Empowered&#xD;
      Relief will be superior to Usual Care for reducing pain bothersomeness and sleep disturbance&#xD;
      at the 1-month follow-up. Outcome 3, Empowered Relief will be superior to Usual Care for&#xD;
      reducing pain intensity, anxiety, depression, physical function at the 1-month follow-up.&#xD;
      Patient outcomes will be longitudinally tracked at weeks 1 &amp; 2 and months 1, 2, &amp; 3 after the&#xD;
      intervention session.&#xD;
