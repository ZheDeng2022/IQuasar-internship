  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disease associated with inflammatory response&#xD;
      harmful for the Central Nervous System. Immunological imbalance is involved with Th1 and Th17&#xD;
      cells in correlation with a disturbance of regulators mechanisms as Treg cells. Despite years&#xD;
      of research, the mechanisms involved remain unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serotonin (5-HT) seems to be a therapeutic target to treat multiple sclerosis. Indeed,&#xD;
      several studies have shown the anti-inflammatory potential of this neurotransmitter and also&#xD;
      its vulnerability in inflammatory context. Moreover, a recent study has shown that 5-HT can&#xD;
      reduced CD4 T cells proliferation and pro-inflammatory cytokines released in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5-HT protector effects have also demonstrated in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis&#xD;
      mouse model (EAE) with an inflammatory response reduction and also a decreased of spinal cord&#xD;
      lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The latest receptor discovered, the 5-HT7 receptor, has been identify as a promise target to&#xD;
      treat neurological disorders associated with inflammatory context. Present in humans and&#xD;
      mice, this receptor spreads on the surface of a large number of cells, such as T-lymphocytes,&#xD;
      macrophages, dendritic cells and also neurons, astrocytes and microglia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the importance of the positive cells for 5-HT7 receptor, in the inflammatory context&#xD;
      observed in multiple sclerosis, The investigator propose to study the receptor expression in&#xD;
      blood samples from multiple sclerosis patient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The expression modulation of 5-HT7 receptor will be investigate in correlation with the&#xD;
      immunological context, in different group of MS patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: MS patients with an acute relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: MS stable patients treated with Natalizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3: Healthy people (from Etablissement Français du Sang)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 5-HT7 receptor expression evaluation on circulating leukocyte cells Each group&#xD;
                presents a different inflammatory context. The investigator wish to determine the&#xD;
                immunological context influence on the 5-HT7 receptor expression and which cells&#xD;
                express it. To analyze the 5-HT7 expression on circulating leukocyte cells, The&#xD;
                investigator will perform flow cytometry studies from the whole blood of the three&#xD;
                groups mentioned above. In a first step, the investigator will analyze the overall&#xD;
                rate of 5-HT7 circulating positive cells by the use of an antibody against 5-HT7&#xD;
                receptor whose specificity was validated in our research team. In a second step,&#xD;
                the investigator will precise which cell type, among the lymphocytes implicated in&#xD;
                the MS pathology, express the 5-HT7 receptor. The investigator will use antibodies&#xD;
                against each population t helper cell: Th1 , Th2, Th17 and Treg. The investigator&#xD;
                will also perform immunostaining on Cytospin (thin layer of blood cells on&#xD;
                coverslips) to visualize co-labeling and confirm the results of flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Correlation between 5-HT7 receptor expression and mRNA quantity In addition, a&#xD;
                correlation has been shown between an increase of 5-HT7 positive cells and an mRNA&#xD;
                quantity up regulated. For the three groups, the investigator will determine the&#xD;
                5-HT7 mRNA quantity on circulating leukocyte cells. In a first step, the&#xD;
                investigator will check correlation between the 5-HT7 receptor expression rate and&#xD;
                the mRNA quantity on circulating leukocyte cells, using quantitative Polymerase&#xD;
                Chain Reaction (qPCR). In a second step, the investigator will perform cell sorting&#xD;
                to isolate Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg cells and specifically extract 5-HT7 mRNA. In&#xD;
                this way, the investigator can address the 5-HT7 receptor role on one or more&#xD;
                specific cell types on the MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. 5-HT7 receptor modulation according to the immunological context In order to&#xD;
                understand the 5-HT7 receptor potential role on immune response moderation, the&#xD;
                investigator will identify the immune context by ELISA dosage from serum samples.&#xD;
                The investigator will investigate on pro-inflammatory markers like IL1b, IFNg, IL17&#xD;
                and anti-inflammatory markers like IL10 and IL4. These results will be correlated&#xD;
                with the previous results concerning the 5-HT7 receptor expression/quantity for&#xD;
                each patient groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. 5-HT7 receptor role on lymphocyte functions in vitro From blood samples of the&#xD;
                three groups mentioned above, the investigator will isolate peripheral blood&#xD;
                mononuclear cells (PBMC) in vitro, to evaluate the 5-HT7 receptor role on their&#xD;
                function to produce and release cytokines. The investigator will stimulate PBMC&#xD;
                with one or more 5-HT7 ligands, and will perform ELISA dosage from supernatant with&#xD;
                pro-inflammatory markers like IL1b, IFNg, IL17 and anti-inflammatory markers like&#xD;
                IL10 and IL4. The cell immunolabelling will be perform to visualize 5-HT7 receptor&#xD;
                on the cell surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Identification of 5-HT7 receptor isoforms There are three forms of 5-HT7 receptor&#xD;
                (5-HT7a, 5-HT7b, 5-HT7d). However, no difference has yet been described for their&#xD;
                pharmacological function. The investigator propose to identify these different&#xD;
                isoforms by qPCR. As previously described, in a first step, on circulating&#xD;
                leukocyte cells and in a second step, after cell sorting to isolate Th1, Th2, Th17&#xD;
                and Treg cells.&#xD;
