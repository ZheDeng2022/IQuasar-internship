  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inadequate dietary protein intake is well-known cause of hypoalbuminemia in dialysis&#xD;
      population. Protein loss into dialysate and increased catabolic state due to uremic milieu or&#xD;
      inflammation worsened hypoalbuminemia, hence high protein diet is recommended in patients on&#xD;
      peritoneal dialysis (PD). The recommendations from K/DOQI clinical practice guidelines for&#xD;
      the amount of daily protein intake is based on expert opinion and the optimal daily protein&#xD;
      intake in PD patients is not known. The investigators hypothesize that higher dietary protein&#xD;
      intake has a greater beneficial effect on nutritional status in hypoalbuminemic PD patients.&#xD;
      In particular, 1.5 g/kg protein intake provides a better beneficial effect than 1.2 g/kg&#xD;
      protein intake.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoalbuminemia is common and is strongly associated with an increased risk for mortality in&#xD;
      patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Inadequate dietary protein intake is&#xD;
      well-known cause of hypoalbuminemia in dialysis population. Protein loss into dialysate and&#xD;
      increased catabolic state due to uremic milieu or inflammation worsened hypoalbuminemia,&#xD;
      hence high protein diet is recommended in PD patients. Although there is an increased daily&#xD;
      calorie intake from absorption of dialysate glucose concentration, hypoalbuminemia ensues in&#xD;
      a substantial number of PD patients. There is concern that a disproportionately increasing&#xD;
      calorie intake from dialysate glucose with no change in dietary protein intake causes weight&#xD;
      gain which in turn worsens sarcopenic obesity in PD patients. Achieving adequate dietary&#xD;
      protein intake should be the priority in the management of hypoalbuminemia. It is feasible&#xD;
      for PD patients to increase dietary protein intake through protein supplements. Among&#xD;
      nutritional supplements, whey protein has several positive effects on carbohydrate&#xD;
      metabolism, muscle building, immune function, and human health in various areas of disease,&#xD;
      supported by well-performed studies. There are limited data available regarding the effects&#xD;
      of nutritional counseling and whey protein supplements on the nutritional, body compositional&#xD;
      status and immune function of PD patients with hypoalbuminemia. The recommendations from&#xD;
      K/DOQI clinical practice guidelines for the amount of daily protein intake is based on expert&#xD;
      opinion and the optimal daily protein intake in PD patients is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are to investigate the optimal dietary protein intake and to examine&#xD;
      the effects of whey protein supplement on the change of nutritional, body composition and&#xD;
      immune function in PD patients with hypoalbuminemia. Specifically, the investigators will&#xD;
      compare the effect of nutritional counseling (1.2 g/kg protein intake) with that of&#xD;
      nutritional counseling and whey protein supplement (1.5 g/kg protein intake) regarding the&#xD;
      changes of nutritional, body composition parameters and immune function in PD patients. This&#xD;
      is a quality improvement program to cope with the fact that the proportion of hypoalbuminemic&#xD;
      PD patients sometimes does not meet the requirements set by Joint Commission of Taiwan, and&#xD;
      to improve the nutritional status of PD patients in a feasible way of daily clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are going to conduct a randomized, controlled trial with cross-over design.&#xD;
      Subjects with ESKD undergoing maintenance PD for more than three months, adequate dialysis,&#xD;
      and hypoalbuminemia will be recruited. Those with non-dietary cause of hypoalbuminemia&#xD;
      including untreated fluid overload, uncorrected metabolic acidosis, having active infection&#xD;
      or inflammation, hospitalization within the past 4 weeks, having gastrointestinal bleeding,&#xD;
      those who cannot cooperate with the dietary record, those who have poor adherence to whey&#xD;
      protein consumption, history of psychiatric disorders and having mental retardation will be&#xD;
      excluded. Participants will receive nutritional counseling with whey protein supplement or&#xD;
      nutritional counseling alone for 3-month period, separated by 3-month washout period. The&#xD;
      study outcome measures are difference in change-from-baseline nutritional, body composition&#xD;
      parameters and immune function between the two study periods.&#xD;
