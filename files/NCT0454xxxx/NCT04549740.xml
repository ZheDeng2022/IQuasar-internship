      Critical illness may be induced by different underlying life-threatening diseases, such as&#xD;
      infection, sepsis, trauma, respiratory insufficiency or hypoxia and severe neurological&#xD;
      status. The associated endocrine, nervous, metabolic and immunological changes are defined as&#xD;
      acute stress syndrome. Salivary alpha-amylase is secreted from the salivary glands mainly in&#xD;
      response to beta-adrenergic stimuli. Salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) has gained rapid popularity&#xD;
      as a non-invasive marker of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity.&#xD;

      Critical illness may be induced by different underlying life-threatening diseases, such as&#xD;
      infection, sepsis, trauma, respiratory insufficiency or hypoxia and severe neurological&#xD;
      status. The associated endocrine, nervous, metabolic and immunological changes are defined as&#xD;
      acute stress syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although sepsis is one of the oldest syndromes in medicine, it is a challenging healthcare&#xD;
      problem even nowadays. In spite of the era of modern an¬tibiotics and intensive therapy&#xD;
      sepsis is still one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the novel results and advances of pathobiology, management and epidemiology of&#xD;
      sepsis, the definitions of the syndrome have been changed recently. Sepsis-3 consensus&#xD;
      de¬fines sepsis as a life-threatening organ dysfunc¬tion caused by a dysregulated host&#xD;
      response to infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of sepsis is most often not easy especially in newborns or in patients whose&#xD;
      im¬mune response is not adequate. Therefore, it is of most importance to introduce diagnostic&#xD;
      biomarkers which can predict or verify systemic inflammation as early as possible. These&#xD;
      tests should also be applicable for monitoring of the disease progression and efficacy of&#xD;
      therapy as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Salivary alpha-amylase is secreted from the salivary glands mainly in response to&#xD;
      beta-adrenergic stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) has gained rapid popularity as a non-invasive marker of&#xD;
      sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. sAA is a digestive enzyme that breaks down starch&#xD;
      into glucose and maltose, and enzymatic activity (in Units/ml) is used as a proxy for sAA&#xD;
      concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of salivary alpha amylase as a marker of sympathetic activity seems justified.&#xD;
      Salivary alpha amylase release from the salivary glands is under strong control of local&#xD;
      sympathetic nerves. Its salivary concentration rapidly increases during acute stress, and its&#xD;
      use as a marker of sympathetic activation is also validated by pharmacological studies.&#xD;
