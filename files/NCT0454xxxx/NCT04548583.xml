  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease has several phenotypes (inflammatory, stricturing, fistulizing) and location&#xD;
      (small bowel, ileocecal, colon, and perianal). Approximately one third of patients have&#xD;
      inflammation limited to the colon. Up to two thirds will become medically refractory and&#xD;
      require a total abdominal colectomy for symptom control. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the safety and efficacy of using allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem&#xD;
      cells (MSCs) delivered by targeted endoscopic delivery to treat people for medically&#xD;
      refractory Crohn's colitis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with medically refractory Crohn's colitis will be treated by targeted endoscopic&#xD;
      delivery of remestemcel-L, an ex vivo culture expanded allogeneic bone marrow derived&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cell product at a dose of 150 or 300 million. This will be injected into the&#xD;
      submucosal layer of the colon and rectal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a second dose of remestemcel-L at a dose of 150 or 300 million MSCs&#xD;
      (same dose as initial). If at 3 months post injection of remestemcel-L there is clinical&#xD;
      remission, escalation of medical management and/or surgery will be delayed and patients&#xD;
      observed. If there is worsening or no improvement in treated patients, then patients will&#xD;
      proceed with escalation of medical management or colectomy as per standard of care. Control&#xD;
      patients without improvement will cross over to receive remestemcel-L at 3 months and may be&#xD;
      retreated at 6 months. All patients will be followed for two years post initial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a total of 4 cohorts of 3 patients (2 treatment:1 control) receiving the 150&#xD;
      million MSC dose of study drug and a total of 4 cohorts of 3 patients (2 treatment:1 control)&#xD;
      receiving 300 million MSCs dose of study drug. This study plans to enroll a total of 24&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of endoscopic&#xD;
      injection of remestemcel-L, an ex vivo culture expanded allogeneic bone marrow derived&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cell product for treatment of medically refractory Crohn's colitis.&#xD;
