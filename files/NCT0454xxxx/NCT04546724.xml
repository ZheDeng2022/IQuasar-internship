    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, multicenter, pivotal clinical study&#xD;
      evaluating the final dose of VLA1553 (1 x10E4 TCID50 per dose) in comparison to a placebo&#xD;
      control. The final dose of VLA1553 or control will be administered as single immunization on&#xD;
      Day 1. Overall, approximately 4,060 male and female subjects aged 18 years and above will be&#xD;
      enrolled into the study.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, double-blinded, multicenter, randomized, pivotal Phase 3 study&#xD;
      comprising approximately 4,060 subjects aged 18 years or above randomized in a 3:1 ratio to&#xD;
      the live-attenuated CHIKV vaccine candidate (VLA1553) or placebo. The final dose of&#xD;
      lyophilized VLA1553 or placebo will be administered as a single intramuscular immunization.&#xD;
      Subjects in this study will be stratified into two age strata of 18 to 64 years and 65 years&#xD;
      of age or above. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and&#xD;
      safety of the final dose of VLA1553 28 days following the single immunization. Immunogenicity&#xD;
      evaluations in the immunogenicity subset will include the proportion of subjects with&#xD;
      seroprotective neutralizing CHIKV antibody titers above a surrogate threshold indicative of&#xD;
      protection. The surrogate of protection reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit has&#xD;
      been established in non-human primate passive transfer studies using human sera from the&#xD;
      Phase 1 study. Safety data collection and immunogenicity will continue to be assessed until&#xD;
      Month 6&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first enrolled and randomized approximately 500 subjects will comprise the immunogenicity&#xD;
      subset.&#xD;
