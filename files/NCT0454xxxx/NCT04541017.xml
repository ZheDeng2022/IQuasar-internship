      This phase Ib/II trial identifies the best dose and possible benefits and/or side effects of&#xD;
      magrolimab when given in combination with mogamulizumab in treating patients with stage IB-IV&#xD;
      mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome types of T-cell lymphoma that has come back (relapsed)&#xD;
      or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Magrolimab and mogamulizumab are monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Treatment&#xD;
      with magrolimab in combination with mogamulizumab may stabilize cancer for longer period than&#xD;
      the usual treatment in patients with relapsed/refractory T-cell lymphoma who have been&#xD;
      previously treated.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the safety and toxicity profile and to determine a safe recommended phase&#xD;
      2 dose (RP2D) of Hu5F9-G4 (magrolimab) when given in combination with mogamulizumab. (Phase&#xD;
      I) II. To compare the proportion of patients who achieve a partial or complete response&#xD;
      lasting at least 6 months (ORR6) of the combination of Hu5F9-G4 (magrolimab) and&#xD;
      mogamulizumab versus mogamulizumab alone. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the efficacy of the combination of Hu5F9-G4 (magrolimab) and mogamulizumab&#xD;
      versus mogamulizumab alone with respect to the following endpoints (Phase II):&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIa. Overall response rate (ORR); overall response rate lasting at least 4 months (ORR4);&#xD;
      overall response rate lasting at least 12 months (ORR12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIb. Duration of response (DOR). IIc. Progression-free survival (PFS). IId. Time to next&#xD;
      treatment (TTNT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify potential biomarkers that correlate with response to mogamulizumab and&#xD;
      Hu5F9-G4 (magrolimab) including (Phase I and II):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. Expression of CCR4. Ib. Somatic mutations and germline polymorphisms. Ic. Phenotyping of&#xD;
      lymphoma and immune microenvironment. Id. Functional assay of phagocytosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose de-escalation study of magrolimab followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study. Patients in the phase Ib study receive treatment as in Arm I. Patients in the phase II&#xD;
      study are randomized to Arm I or Arm II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive magrolimab intravenously (IV) over 2-3 hours weekly during cycles&#xD;
      1-2, then every 2 weeks (Q2W) during cycles 3-12. Patients also receive mogamulizumab IV over&#xD;
      at least 60 minutes weekly during cycle 1, then Q2W during cycles 2-12. Cycles repeat every&#xD;
      28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive mogamulizumab IV over at least 60 minutes weekly during cycle 1,&#xD;
      then Q2W during cycles 2-12. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who have received at least 2 full&#xD;
      treatment cycles and have progressive disease (PD) or have received at least 6 full treatment&#xD;
      cycles and have stable disease (SD) may crossover to Arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of Hu5F9-G4 (magrolimab) on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason and because monoclonal antibody agents as well as other therapeutic agents&#xD;
             used in this trial (mogamulizumab) are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method&#xD;
             of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study&#xD;

             (magrolimab) and mogamulizumab. Effective contraception is defined as oral&#xD;
             contraceptives, double barrier method (condom plus spermicide or diaphragm plus&#xD;

             childbearing potential includes any female who has experienced menarche and has not&#xD;
             undergone successful surgical sterilization or is not postmenopausal (defined as&#xD;
             amenorrhea &gt;= 12 consecutive months). Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol who are&#xD;
             sexually active with women of childbearing potential and who have not had vasectomies&#xD;
             must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of&#xD;
             study participation, and 4 months after completion of Hu5F9-G4 (magrolimab)&#xD;
             administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must not be nursing or planning to be&#xD;
             pregnant and must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 30 days before&#xD;
             randomization and within 72 hours before the first administration of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female patients of childbearing potential must be willing to use one highly&#xD;
                  effective method of contraception during the study and continue for 4 months&#xD;
                  after the last dose of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male patients who are sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential&#xD;
                  (WOCBP) and who have not had vasectomies must be willing to use a barrier method&#xD;
                  of contraception (condom plus spermicidal gel) and refrain from sperm donation&#xD;
                  during the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study treatment. If the&#xD;
                  partner is pregnant, male patients must use barrier method contraception (condom)&#xD;
                  during the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study treatment to&#xD;
                  prevent fetal exposure to study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;

             active signs of active infection, and whose last active infection was more than 6&#xD;
             months ago, may enter the study, and should continue to take the prescribed medication&#xD;

             limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Hu5F9-G4 (magrolimab) is&#xD;
             monoclonal antibody agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with Hu5F9-G4 (magrolimab), breastfeeding should&#xD;
             be discontinued if the mother is treated with Hu5F9-G4 (magrolimab). These potential&#xD;
             risks may also apply to other agents used in this study (mogamulizumab)&#xD;
