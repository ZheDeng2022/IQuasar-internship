&#xD;
          2. Subject is implanted with Percept PC (Model B35200) and Medtronic DBS leads (Model&#xD;
             3387, 3389, B33005 or B33015) and extensions (Model 37085, 37086, or B34000)&#xD;
             bilaterally in the same target (physician confirmed), STN or GPi&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. In the opinion of the investigator, the subject responds to DBS Therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Based on the opinion of the investigator, the subject's cDBS parameters and PD&#xD;
             medications are stable and expected to remain stable from enrollment through the end&#xD;
             of the aDBS Evaluation phase&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject is configured to monopolar or dual monopolar stimulation using contacts 1&#xD;
             and/or 2 (9 and/or 10) on at least one side.&#xD;
&#xD;
             For subjects with the SenSight system, all segments activated per electrode level&#xD;
             (ring mode) (Primary Cohort) OR with one or two segments active per level (directional&#xD;
             stimulation) on at least one side (Directional Stimulation Cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject is willing and able to attend all study-required visits and complete the study&#xD;
             procedures (e.g. 1-month recall questionnaires, MDS-UPDRS III)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has the ability to understand and provide written informed consent for&#xD;
             participation in the study prior to the study-related procedures being conducted&#xD;

             birth control as confirmed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. For subjects with the SenSight system: Subject is configured to the following&#xD;
             stimulation rates: 55, 85, 110, 125, 145, 164 or 180 Hz (as required for sensing/aDBS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        LFP Screening Inclusion Criteria&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Subject has more than one INS&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. At enrollment, the subject's INS has a predicted battery life of &lt;1 year&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Subject requires diathermy, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), or&#xD;
             electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject has a metallic implant in the head, (eg, aneurysm clip, cochlear implant)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject has, or plans to obtain, an implanted electrical stimulation medical device&#xD;
             anywhere in the body (eg, cardiac pacemaker, defibrillator, spinal cord stimulator)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject has, or plans to obtain, an implanted medication pump for the treatment of&#xD;
             Parkinson's disease (eg, DUOPATM infusion pump) and/or portable infusion pump&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Based on the opinion of the investigator, the subject has an abnormal neurological&#xD;
             examination that would preclude them from study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject is breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subject is under the age of 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subject is currently enrolled in or plans to enroll in any concurrent drug and/or&#xD;
             device study that may confound the results of this study as determined by the&#xD;
             Medtronic study team&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subject is unable to use or tolerate wearable&#xD;
