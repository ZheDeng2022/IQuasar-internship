      The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of the intervention measures of the&#xD;
      &quot;Maternal-Infant Exercise Program&quot; to improve the postpartum women's body composition,&#xD;
      stress, fatigue and parent-child attachment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Taiwan, more than 50% of maternal women will encounter obesity problems, because they have&#xD;
      to take care of newborns, lack of proper exercise, and the traditional concept of confinement&#xD;
      leads to excessive dietary supplementation, basal metabolic rate decline, and insufficient&#xD;
      exercise. In addition to the physical changes after birth, women also face the change of the&#xD;
      role of mothers. Caring for newborns is almost 24 hours on standby, gradually forming stress&#xD;
      and fatigue. Stress may make postpartum women unable to perform the tasks of mothers. Makes&#xD;
      postpartum women feel physiologically and psychologically uncomfortable. Both stress and&#xD;
      fatigue have an adverse effect on their health, and are not conducive to parent-child&#xD;
      attachment. However, early postpartum mothers and infants are almost inseparable. This period&#xD;
      of attachment often affects infants' interpersonal relationships and emotions, if the&#xD;
      relationship is not harmonious, may cause deviations in the baby's future behavior. Many&#xD;
      studies have pointed out that moderate exercise can not only reduce the fatigue of postpartum&#xD;
      women but also help to restore physical strength, help the recovery of organs and body,&#xD;
      maintain physical health and weight management. However, busy with baby care and lack of&#xD;
      continuous exercise often lead to postpartum women unable to reduce body weight. Therefore,&#xD;
      this study hopes to develop a &quot;Maternal-Infant Exercise Program&quot; to improve the postpartum&#xD;
      women's body composition, stress and fatigue, and to improve the attachment relationship&#xD;
      between parents and their infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explore the effectiveness of the intervention measures of the &quot;Maternal-Infant Exercise&#xD;
      Program&quot; to improve the postpartum women's body composition, stress, fatigue and parent-child&#xD;
      attachment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, a longitudinal and long-term follow-up randomized controlled trial study was&#xD;
      adopted. The case was collected in a postpartum ward and an obstetrics and gynecology clinic&#xD;
      of a medical center in the north Taiwan. The mothers who met the conditions for sample&#xD;
      selection were selected as the research object. There are two different intervention modes&#xD;
      (intervention group and control group), the intervention group is a Maternal-Infant Exercise&#xD;
      Program, and the control group receives routine postpartum exercise nursing guidance. There&#xD;
      are 50 people in each group. It is estimated that 100 healthy women with vagina postpartum&#xD;
      will be collected. The questionnaires and physiological measurements are used to collect and&#xD;
      aggregate the data. The main research variables are the Maternal-Infant Exercise Program, and&#xD;
      the dependent variables are the postpartum women's body composition, stress, fatigue and&#xD;
      parent-child attachment. The body composition of postpartum women is measured using a body&#xD;
      fat meter, postpartum stress is measured using a Perceived Stress Scale(PSS), postpartum&#xD;
      fatigue is measured using a Modified Fatigue Symptoms Checklist(MFSC), and the parent-child&#xD;
      attachment relationship is measured using the Maternal Attachment Inventory(MAI). The two&#xD;
      groups will collect data at one month, two months and three months after delivery, including&#xD;
      body composition measurement and filling in each scale. The analysis method of the research&#xD;
      data will use SPSS version 22.0 software, using chi-square test, independent sample t test ,&#xD;
      Pearson correlation, generalized estimation equations for discussion of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Result:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study expects to understand the current status of postpartum women's body composition,&#xD;
      stress, fatigue, and parent-child attachment. It is expected that parent-child exercise&#xD;
      programs will improve postpartum women's body composition, as well as improve stress,&#xD;
      fatigue, and enhance parent-child attachment.&#xD;
