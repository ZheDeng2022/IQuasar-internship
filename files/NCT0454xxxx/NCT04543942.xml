  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol abuse inflicts enormous physical, emotional, and financial burdens on the individual&#xD;
      and society at large. Knowing who is at risk for alcohol abuse, and why, is crucial for the&#xD;
      development of effective prevention and treatment strategies. Alcohol abuse has been&#xD;
      traditionally considered a male-oriented problem and as a consequence research on risk&#xD;
      factors specific to women has been minimal. However, the sex gap in substance abuse is&#xD;
      closing rapidly, and findings from both animal and human studies suggest that females are&#xD;
      actually more vulnerable to drug use than males. As such, there is an urgent need to identify&#xD;
      sex differences in risk factors for alcohol abuse in order to develop sex-specific prevention&#xD;
      and treatment efforts. One clear candidate risk factor is poor inhibitory control, both in&#xD;
      terms of baseline levels of inhibition and sensitivity to the disinhibiting effects of&#xD;
      alcohol. Recent studies suggest that sex hormones affect inhibitory control in drug-free&#xD;
      individuals, potentially contributing to sex differences in baseline levels of inhibition.&#xD;
      However, the degree to which fluctuations in sex hormones influence sex differences in&#xD;
      inhibition-related brain function in sober and intoxicated individuals is not known. The&#xD;
      proposed project will determine the neural and hormonal mechanisms underlying sex differences&#xD;
      in sensitivity to the disinhibiting effects of alcohol in heavy drinkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of the research is to identify hormonal determinants of alcohol effects&#xD;
      on brain activation during response inhibition (BARI) in young adult female and male&#xD;
      drinkers. BARI will be assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during&#xD;
      performance of the stop signal task. This task reliably activates right-lateralized&#xD;
      prefrontal regions implicated in inhibitory control. This study will assess BARI during IV&#xD;
      alcohol (60mg%) and saline infusion in women during the early follicular and mid-luteal&#xD;
      phases and in men at matched intervals.&#xD;

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale (BAES) is a 14-point self-reporting, unipolar adjective rating scale designed to measure both stimulant and sedative effects of alcohol. Scores range from 0-10 for each of the 14 questions. Higher scores indicate increased stimulation or sedation. Scores will be reported with alcohol comparted to placebo.</description>

    <measure>Change in Drug Effects Questionnaire Score</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Drug Effects Questionnaire (DEQ) consists of simple, face-valid, visual analog scale (VAS) questions on which people report their subjective states after ingesting a substance. The analog scale of responses ranges from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely.&quot; Scores are measured in millimeters from the scale origin. Higher scores (longer lengths) indicate greater drug effects. Scores will be reported with alcohol comparted to placebo.</description>
