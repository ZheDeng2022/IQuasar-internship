  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This longitudinal study deals with the characterization of the electrophysiological and&#xD;
      behavioral effects of alpha-based neurofeedback training on the brain networks involved in&#xD;
      the relaxation process of healthy people.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite a growing number of studies dedicated to neurofeedback, the underlying cerebral&#xD;
      mechanisms (plasticity phenomena underlying neurofeedback training or learning) are very&#xD;
      poorly known. In most of the work on stress and anxiety reduction, the neural parameters on&#xD;
      which neurofeedback is performed are low frequency waves like alpha waves. But the effects&#xD;
      that an alpha-based neurofeedback has on these waves and more generally on the oscillatory&#xD;
      behaviour of the networks involved after the neurofeedback sessions, are very little studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the NEURORELAX study aims to clarify the effects on neurofeedback training at the&#xD;
      (electro)physiological level (changes in brain responses in terms of frequency of&#xD;
      oscillations, power and location of the cerebral sources of these activities) and/or&#xD;
      behavioural level (relaxation and reduced susceptibility to anxiety). It will use the&#xD;
      Melomind neurofeedback device as built by myBrain Technologies company, which will make it&#xD;
      additionally possible to assess feasibility of neurofeedback training with this reduced&#xD;
      mobile device comprising of 2 dry electrodes. For these purposes, the investigators will&#xD;
      propose a series of auditory neurofeedback training sessions to the participants, accompanied&#xD;
      by electrophysiological (EEG) and clinical measures. The level of relaxation of the subjects&#xD;
      will be characterized by self-reported questionnaires and by electrophysiological signal&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;
