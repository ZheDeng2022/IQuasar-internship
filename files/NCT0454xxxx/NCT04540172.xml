      will be firstly applied to clinical practice. The students were randomly assigned to music&#xD;
      (n=30), exercise (n=28), and control (n=28) groups. The data of the study were collected with&#xD;
      Student Information Form and State-Trait Anxiety Scale. The music therapy intervention was&#xD;
      applied to the experimental groups three times a week for the first 2 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>The level of Anxiety was evaluated with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). STAI consists of 20 items for assessing trait anxiety and 20 for state anxiety. All items are rated on a 4-point scale (None&quot; (1), &quot;A little&quot; (2), &quot;Very&quot; (3), and &quot;Completely&quot; (4). Higher scores indicate greater anxiety.</description>

    <description>music therapy was applied in the practice room. Environmental noise was reduced as much as possible; the room was dimly lit. The students were asked to close their eyes after sitting comfortably in a chair and focus on the music by asking them to imagine a different memory and place that would relax them instead of the thoughts that occupied their minds. The music was played through a portable computer for 15 minutes under the supervision of the researchers using an mp3 player program on the computer.</description>

    <description>In this study, the steps of applying progressive muscle relaxation exercises were created with the guidance of the &quot;Relaxation Exercises &quot; materials of the Turkish Psychological Association. Warning messages were hung on the door of the room, environmental noise was reduced as much as possible, and the room was provided with dim lighting. The students were asked to close their eyes and breathe deeply after sitting comfortably in a chair. After taking two deep breaths, they were told to dangle their arms and relax as much as possible. The hands, shoulders, neck, chest, abdomen, hips, legs, feet, toes, and facial muscles were made to relax while they breathed and relaxed while exhaling. They were asked to store the experience into their memories thoroughly so that they could recall this feeling for comfort during the day.</description>
