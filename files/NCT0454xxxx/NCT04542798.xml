  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will select two study groups from a population of patients with severe&#xD;
      chronic low back pain (CLBP) of facet joint (FJ) origin already treated with conventional&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation (CRFA) of the medial branch of the dorsal ramus (MBDR) and that&#xD;
      failed to obtain a 50% pain reduction measured through the numerical rate scale (NRS) for at&#xD;
      least 3 months. Severe CLBP is considered a value of at least 7 by NRS pain assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group will be characterized by a nociceptive/mechanic type of back pain. The second&#xD;
      group of study will be characterized by a neuropathic type of back pain. This difference will&#xD;
      be established by a DN4 score of at least 4 points (Doleur Neurophatique 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in the group with nociceptive/mechanic back pain will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      conventional radiofrequency ablation or to water cooled radiofrequency (WCRF) of the MBDR.&#xD;
      The patients in the group with neuropathic back pain will be randomly assigned CRFA of MBDR&#xD;
      or to pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried on for an estimated time of 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at least 50% back pain reduction for at least 3 months evaluated through NRS, with a&#xD;
           subcategorization of results that will consider a mean difference in effect (respect to&#xD;
           the initial evaluation, with an initial NRS score of at least 7) of 1 point on NRS pain&#xD;
           scale as small/modest, 2 points as moderate, more than 2 as large/substantial between&#xD;
           the case/control study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improvement of low back pain disability: 10 points increase on the Oswestry Low Back&#xD;
           Pain Disability Questionnaire (ODI) have been proposed as minimal clinically important&#xD;
           differences, between 10 and 20 as moderate, more than 20 as large/substantial clinical&#xD;
           improvement at month 3 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome will be evaluated by the 12-item short form survey SF12, accordingly with&#xD;
      the clinical pre-interventional findings, analgesic intake at month 1-3-6 (if increased,&#xD;
      unchanged, decreased, in dosages or number of pain killers' assumption). Groups sizes: will&#xD;
      be calculated based on the disease's incidence and the outcome targets.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The efficacy of radiofrequency to treat LBP of FJ origin decreases with time, and the&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms behind this failure is a matter of debate; the phenomenon of&#xD;
      central sensitization and ectopic nerve regeneration could be possible explanations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central sensitization represents an enhancement in the function of neurons and circuits in&#xD;
      nociceptive pathways caused by increases in membrane excitability and synaptic efficacy as&#xD;
      well as to reduced inhibition and is a manifestation of the remarkable plasticity of the&#xD;
      somatosensory nervous system in response to activity, inflammation, and neural injury. The&#xD;
      net effect of central sensitization is to recruit previously subthreshold synaptic inputs to&#xD;
      nociceptive neurons, generating an increased or augmented action potential output: a state of&#xD;
      facilitation, potentiation, augmentation, or amplification. Central sensitization is&#xD;
      responsible for many of the temporal, spatial, and threshold changes in pain sensibility in&#xD;
      acute and chronic clinical pain settings and exemplifies the fundamental contribution of the&#xD;
      central nervous system to the generation of pain hypersensitivity. Because central&#xD;
      sensitization results from changes in the properties of neurons in the central nervous&#xD;
      system, the pain is no longer coupled, as acute nociceptive pain is, to the presence,&#xD;
      intensity, or duration of noxious peripheral stimuli. Instead, central sensitization produces&#xD;
      pain hypersensitivity by changing the sensory response elicited by normal inputs, including&#xD;
      those that usually evoke innocuous sensations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous studies using animal models of low back pain, mechanical allodynia has been&#xD;
      correlated with and is hypothesized to be due to a host of physiologic changes in the central&#xD;
      nervous system. Among these nociceptive responses are neuronal plasticity, glial cell&#xD;
      activation and cytokine upregulation. In addition, animal models specifically investigating&#xD;
      changes in neural electrical activity following lumbar facet capsule stretching have&#xD;
      demonstrated alterations in neurophysiology for applied loading. Together, these molecular&#xD;
      and cellular changes contribute to central sensitization and persistent pain. Indeed, in&#xD;
      clinical research, central sensitization has been hypothesized as a mechanism of chronic pain&#xD;
      after whiplash injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injury to the cervical facet joint and its capsule is primarily a ligamentous injury but&#xD;
      because the facet capsule is innervated there may also be neuropathic injury. In fact,&#xD;
      capsule stretch in several animal models induces both transient increases in firing of&#xD;
      joint-innervating afferents similar to the injury discharge that accompanies nerve injury and&#xD;
      also the later development of ectopic firing and hyperexcitability in dorsal horn neurons.&#xD;
      The onset of spontaneous firing likely represents a temporal threshold after which&#xD;
      sensitization persists despite blockade of joint afferent activity with nerve blocks or&#xD;
      neurotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic pain exhibit primary mechanical hyperalgesia over the back of the&#xD;
      cervical spine, in a &quot;coat hanger&quot; distribution indicative of peripheral nociceptor&#xD;
      sensitization. These patients are also hypersensitive to pressure, heat, and cold stimuli at&#xD;
      sites distant from the cervical spine, including over the median, radial, and ulnar nerve&#xD;
      trunks in the arm and over the tibialis anterior muscle. Together, these studies demonstrate&#xD;
      that generalized and widespread secondary hypersensitivity is robust in individuals who&#xD;
      sustain a whiplash-like exposure and indicative of central sensitization. Patient-reported&#xD;
      sensory disturbances include spontaneous pain that is disproportionate to and/or occurs in&#xD;
      the absence of any inciting event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are more than two dozen reported cases of lumbar facet dislocation after rapid&#xD;
      deceleration injuries (e.g., traffic accidents), most involving L5-S1. The mechanism of&#xD;
      injury in these cases is purported to be a combination of hyperflexion, distraction, and&#xD;
      rotation. In a posthumous study conducted in 31 lumbar spines of subjects who died of&#xD;
      traumatic injuries (mostly motor vehicle accidents), Twomey et al. found occult bony&#xD;
      fractures in the superior articular process or subchondral bone plate in 35% of victims, and&#xD;
      z-joint capsular and/or articular cartilage damage in 77% of cases. In this study the authors&#xD;
      concluded that occult bony and soft tissue injuries to the l-z joints may be a common cause&#xD;
      of LBP after trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to immediate neuronal responses, facet capsular loading that induces behavioural&#xD;
      hypersensitivity in the rat is also associated with many sustained modifications in the&#xD;
      nociceptive signalling from the primary afferents that are evident in the DRG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protein expression of the nociceptive neurotransmitter, substance P, is increased in the DRG&#xD;
      after painful facet joint stretch by day 7, and that change is absent in non-painful stretch.&#xD;
      Capsular stretch-induced increases in DRG expression of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5&#xD;
      (mGluR5) and its second messenger, protein kinase C-epsilon (PKCÎµ), are strain dependent and&#xD;
      are not evident until 7 days after the initial injury. The late upregulation of these&#xD;
      molecules suggests that they may play a role in the later nociceptive pathways involved in&#xD;
      injury-induced pain. Because these neuromodulators are involved in neuroplasticity and pain,&#xD;
      their delayed elevation implies that the afferents undergo persistent activation and/or&#xD;
      dysfunction after painful loading has occurred. Because axonal degeneration is known to take&#xD;
      7 days to develop, it may contribute to the late onset of modified nociceptive signalling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to increases in expression of glutamate receptors, expression of glutamate&#xD;
      transporters on astrocytes and neurons, which regulate the clearance of glutamate away from&#xD;
      synapses, like glutamate aspartate transporter, glutamate transporter 1, and excitatory&#xD;
      amino-acid carrier 1, is also altered in the spinal cord 1 week after painful facet stretch.&#xD;
      While the astrocyte glutamate transporter (glutamate aspartate transporter) is upregulated 1&#xD;
      week after painful injury, both glutamate transporter 1 and excitatory amino-acid carrier 1,&#xD;
      which are expressed on other cells, are downregulated, pointing to the widespread and&#xD;
      complicated dysregulation of glutamate in pain from facet joint injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Like other chronic pain conditions, spinal astrocytes are activated for at least 14 days&#xD;
      after painful facet stretch. Mechanical injury to the facet capsule also regulates the&#xD;
      production of inflammatory mediators, including proinflammatory cytokines and neurotrophins,&#xD;
      in the facet joint itself, as well as in the DRG. Because peripheral inflammation increases&#xD;
      hyperexcitability and substance P in DRG neurons, along with pain production, recent studies&#xD;
      have begun to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which peripheral inflammation contributes&#xD;
      to central sensitization in the context of facet-mediated pain. Recently, neurotrophins have&#xD;
      been implicated both locally in the facet and to be more widespread in the CNS. Nerve growth&#xD;
      factor (NGF) increases in the facet joint tissues as early as 1 day after a facet joint&#xD;
      distraction that produces pain at that same time. Further, inhibiting NGF signalling also&#xD;
      prevents the onset of pain and associated spinal neuron hyperexcitability when anti-NGF is&#xD;
      given intra-articularly immediately after capsule stretch and before pain develops,&#xD;
      suggesting a critical role of local NGF in initiating pain. Unlike NGF, expression of the&#xD;
      neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) increases in both the DRG and spinal&#xD;
      cord at a later time (day 7), with intrathecal administration of the BDNF-sequestering&#xD;
      molecule trkB-Fc after facet injury partially reducing pain. Collectively, these NGF and BDNF&#xD;
      studies not only reveal important novel pathways emerging as having critical roles in pain&#xD;
      from whiplash injury, but also provide potential therapeutic targets for treating joint pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologic studies have demonstrated that the lumbar facet joints are richly innervated with&#xD;
      encapsulated (Ruffini-type endings, Pacinian corpuscles), un-encapsulated, and free nerve&#xD;
      endings. The presence of low-threshold, rapidly adapting mechanosensitive neurons suggests&#xD;
      that in addition to transmitting nociceptive information, the l-z facet capsule also serves a&#xD;
      proprioceptive function. Besides substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide, a&#xD;
      substantial percentage of nerve endings in facet capsules have also been found containing&#xD;
      neuropeptide Y, indicating the presence of sympathetic efferent fibers. Nerve fibers have&#xD;
      also been found in subchondral bone and intra-articular inclusions of l-z joints, signifying&#xD;
      that facet-mediated pain may originate in structures besides the joint capsule. In&#xD;
      degenerative lumbar spinal disorders, inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and the&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha have&#xD;
      been found in facet joint cartilage and synovial tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wide dynamic range neurons in the dorsal horn may be capable of modulating central&#xD;
      sensitization in many chronic pain states. In their study K.P.Quinn et al. comparing painful&#xD;
      to non-painful and sham C6/C7 cervical facet joint capsule stretch stimuli in a rat model&#xD;
      find out that the proportion of cells in the deep laminae that responded as wide dynamic&#xD;
      range neurons was increased in the painful group relative to non-painful or sham groups&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.0348).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The significant increase in the number of wide dynamic range neurons classified in the&#xD;
      painful group (69% of neurons; p&gt;0.0348) in this study suggests that a phenotypic shift in&#xD;
      the response of the neuronal population in the deep laminae of the dorsal horn may play a key&#xD;
      role in modulating chronic pain after facet joint injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings suggest that excessive facet capsule stretch, while not producing visible&#xD;
      tearing, can produce functional plasticity of dorsal horn neuronal activity. The increase in&#xD;
      neuronal firing across a range of stimulus magnitudes observed at day 7 post-injury that&#xD;
      facet-mediated chronic pain following whiplash injury is driven, at least in part, by central&#xD;
      sensitization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the fact that most of the neurophysiological and molecular central and peripheral&#xD;
      changes in the low back pain syndrome are related to rat experimental whiplash-like exposure,&#xD;
      the investigators consider that the mechanisms of central sensitization related to chronic&#xD;
      low back pain of FJ origin can be hypothesised to be the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other side, the mechanism of aberrant nerve sprouting after previous RFA could explain&#xD;
      the necessity to increase the size of the lesion, especially in patients that underwent to&#xD;
      multiple treatment with such technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain recurrence after denervation in medical practice, and nerve regeneration from a third&#xD;
      degree nerve injury from different ablation techniques, have a common pathway. This pathway&#xD;
      includes macrophage migration, Schwann cell proliferation, CAMs for preparing the basement&#xD;
      membrane, NGF on the Schwann cell for axonal sprouting, and increased trophic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injured axons regenerate at a rate of 1-2 mm/day, although the rate depends on many factors&#xD;
      and can vary significantly from individual to individual. Since the length of nerve from the&#xD;
      axonal lesion to the lumbar facet joint is approximately 30-40 mm, reinnervation could occur&#xD;
      within 3-6 weeks. Regeneration is the primary form of nerve repair when &gt;90% of the axons are&#xD;
      injured. In partial nerve injuries when only 20%-30% of the axons are affected, collateral&#xD;
      sprouting from preserved axons can contribute to reinnervation. Okuyama et al. showed that&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation in cardiac tissue results in aberrant nerve sprouting within 2 hours&#xD;
      after ablation. Therefore, ablation of nerves within the back could have a high likelihood&#xD;
      for a similar development, which could cause faster failure rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion this study will select two groups of patients from a population with severe&#xD;
      chronic low back pain (CLBP) of facet joint (FJ) origin already treated with conventional&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation (CRFA) of the medial branch of the dorsal rama (MBDR) and that failed&#xD;
      to obtain at least a 50% pain reduction measured through the numerical rate scale (NRS).&#xD;
      Severe CLBP is considered a patient subjective pain judgement superior to 7 by NRS&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group will be characterized by a nociceptive/mechanic type of back pain. The second&#xD;
      group of study will be characterized by a neuropathic type of back pain. This difference will&#xD;
      be established by a DN4 score superior to 4 points (Doleur Neurophatique 4) and a negative&#xD;
      pre-interventional eco-guided medial branch block (MBB). A negative MBB will be characterized&#xD;
      by a reduction of NRS inferior to 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to try to clarify if a larger lesion created by the water cooled&#xD;
      radiofrequency (WCRF) in the nociceptive/mecchanic pain groups (NMPG) and the pulsed&#xD;
      radiofrequency (PRF) of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in the neuropatic pain groups (NPPG) could&#xD;
      improve patients' functional status and reduce the burden of their low back pain compared to&#xD;
      conventional radiofrequency (CRF) of the medial brach of the dorsal rama (MBDR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the hypothesis in study are confirmed there is to be expected a statistically significant&#xD;
      reduction in the NRS and an improvement in the ODI score in the DRG-PRF and WCRF groups,&#xD;
      compared to the patients in the CRF groups. The aim is to allow the patients to start a&#xD;
      program of rehabilitation/physiotherapy, that is by far the standard of clinical care for LBP&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this case the results could support our hypothesis in both group of investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Like already underlined in the physiopathological explanation representing the base of this&#xD;
      study, increasing the area of lesion with the WCRF technique should increase the chances to&#xD;
      target the arborized neural regenerate terminals to the zygapophyseal joint, leading to a&#xD;
      better result and possibly longer efficacy of the procedure in the NMPG respect to the group&#xD;
      treated with CRF. Today, different doctors use both techniques based on their personal&#xD;
      preference and logistic possibility as there are no conclusive data about superiority; even&#xD;
      the last consensus practice guidelines for lumbar facet joint pain proposed by the American&#xD;
      Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine 2020 (CPG-ASRAPM) assess that &quot;there is&#xD;
      indirect evidence, and limited direct evidence, that techniques that result in larger lesions&#xD;
      (eg, larger electrodes, higher temperatures, longer heating times, proper electrode&#xD;
      orientation, fluid modulation) improve outcomes&quot; (Grade C, low level of certainty that larger&#xD;
      lesions increase the chance of capturing nerves. Grade I, low level of certainty that larger&#xD;
      lesions increase duration of pain relief).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, in the NPPG the treatment of the DRG with PRF should interrupts and&#xD;
      possibly treat the intercellular and molecular circuits at the base of the central pain&#xD;
      sensitization, improving the outcomes considered in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biggest effort of this study will be the standardization of all the procedures, to allow&#xD;
      the maximal reproducibility, in line with the latest recommendation in diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of low back pain of facet joint origin stated by the CPG-ASRAPM and current best&#xD;
      practice in radiofrequency denervation of the lumbar facet joints published by the British&#xD;
      Pain Society (CBP-BPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The theory that chronic LBP of FJ origin can be related to a central sensitization mechanism&#xD;
      is a new investigation field, with no other studies yet exploring our treatment hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is important to carry out research projects that clarify which technical&#xD;
      variables are those that provide an improvement in pain control and, above all, an&#xD;
      improvement in the quality of life in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the conclusions of this project could be possible applied by professionals of the&#xD;
      Pain Units worldwide in their daily activity, in order to provide our patients with the best&#xD;
      care and the best possible results. It is a clinical study and therefore its translation to&#xD;
      the clinical practice can be direct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENTS The application of radiofrequency (RF) signals to neural tissue is well&#xD;
      established in the treatment of movement, mood, and chronic pain disorders. Undesired neural&#xD;
      signals, such as those transmitting nociceptive pain, are interrupted when high-frequency&#xD;
      current (100-1,000 kHz) flowing through an RF probe's active tip raises the temperature at a&#xD;
      soma/ganglion or axon/nerve to destructive levels (45-50Â°C) by means of frictional heating.&#xD;
      The process is known as RF heat lesioning, RF thermocoagulation, RF ablation, or thermal RF.&#xD;
      The volume of tissue damaged by RF heating is called a heat lesion. Monopolar RF (the&#xD;
      technique used in this hospital) refers to current flow between a probe electrode and a large&#xD;
      area ground pad placed on the skin's surface. Bipolar RF refers to current flow between two&#xD;
      probe electrodes without a ground pad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RF heat lesioning includes cooled RF, wherein the electrode is internally cooled by&#xD;
      circulating fluid but surrounding tissue is exposed to destructive temperatures. Water-cooled&#xD;
      radiofrequency (WCRF) ablation is a minimally invasive neuroablative technique used in the&#xD;
      treatment of various pain syndromes. The mechanism of pain relief from WC-RF application is&#xD;
      analogous to CRF application: a thermal lesion is created, by applying radiofrequency (RF)&#xD;
      energy through an electrode placed in the vicinity of the target neural structure, with the&#xD;
      aims of interrupting the afferent nociceptive pathways. The difference already mentioned is&#xD;
      that the 'cooled' radiofrequency probes have water running through the probe tip, which keeps&#xD;
      the tip cooled and allows a larger lesion to be made. Since the physician can't actually see&#xD;
      the nerve he is trying to target, larger lesions should theoretically improve his chances of&#xD;
      hitting it. The 'cooling' of the water also allows the temperatures to be lower than what is&#xD;
      needed for standard RF (approximately 60Â°C).It is widely accepted that the PRF action&#xD;
      mechanism (involving lower temperatures, below 42-44 Â°C) is most likely related to the&#xD;
      induced electric field, rather than to thermal effects. Different effects of exposure to PRF&#xD;
      electrical fields have already been reported. Some studies have revealed evidence of&#xD;
      morphological changes in the neuronal cells after PRF treatment that affect the inner&#xD;
      structures of axons. These structural changes consist of mitochondria swelling and disruption&#xD;
      of the normal organisation of the microtubules and microfilaments that preferentially affect&#xD;
      C-fibres and to a lesser extent AÎ´ fibres. In addition, transient ultrastructural changes&#xD;
      such as endoneural oedema and collagen deposition have also been found. Besides structural&#xD;
      changes, the effects on cellular activity and gene expression have also been observed as well&#xD;
      as an increase in the expression of inflammatory proteins. All these effects could&#xD;
      potentially inhibit the transmission of nerve signals through C-fibres, which would lead to&#xD;
      pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number and laterality of medial branches to be lesioned is to be decided after a clinical&#xD;
      examination by the pain physician. When selecting targets for blocks, levels should be&#xD;
      determined based on clinical presentation, radiological findings when available, tenderness&#xD;
      on palpation performed under fluoroscopy. A maximum of eight medial branches at a maximum of&#xD;
      four vertebral levels may be lesioned in a single sitting, subjects with unilateral pain to&#xD;
      receive unilateral treatment. A maximum of three DRG for each side will be treated in a&#xD;
      single sitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For various reasons, medial branch blocks are the only acceptable and validated diagnostic&#xD;
      test as an indication for medial branch neurotomy. The paradigm of lumbar medial branch&#xD;
      neurotomy is that patient's pain can be relieved by coagulating the nerves that mediate&#xD;
      (transmit) their pain. An essential prerequisite, therefore, is that it must be shown that&#xD;
      the target nerves are responsible for the patient's pain. This is achieved by controlled&#xD;
      diagnostic blocks of the medial branches of the cervical and lumbar dorsal rami that mediate&#xD;
      the pain. In order to reduce the likelihood of responses being false positive, controlled&#xD;
      blocks are mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An issue in this sense is represented by the relatively high percentage of false positive MBB&#xD;
      for placebo effect (up to 30%) described in the literature (patients that responds positively&#xD;
      to the MMB, but that fail or will possibly again fail a sustained benefit after the&#xD;
      conventional procedure - control group). On the other side some patients may respond&#xD;
      positively to the MBB but presents with a neuropathic back pain, possibly leading to a bias&#xD;
      in selection, because in this case the mechanisms involved in the origin of back pain could&#xD;
      be both neuropathic and nociceptive/mechanic in nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the high percentage of placebo related effect in the false positive group, the&#xD;
      only way to exclude this kind of false positive is to perform a placebo-controlled&#xD;
      pre-procedural MBB, where the placebo procedures will be difficult to be approved by any&#xD;
      ethical committee, due to the relatively safety of this procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reasons this investigators decided to exclude patients positive to the MBB but with&#xD;
      neuropathic pain and the patients with negative MBB and negative DN4 score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients recruited in this study have been previously treated in our pain service by&#xD;
      experienced interventionists anesthesiologists (this will suppose that the percentage of&#xD;
      patients actually positive to the MBB because of previous inefficacy technique should be&#xD;
      really low).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, this study group decided to perform a single MBB with 0.5 mL of levo-bupivacaine 5&#xD;
      mg/mL, that is the consensus preferred solution, under ultrasonographic guidance, in our&#xD;
      technical operative room, with needle tip to be positioned on the curvature between the&#xD;
      articular process and transverse process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three radiofrequency techniques have been in use over the past three decades. The scientific&#xD;
      community refers to them by name of continents where each was originally described: European,&#xD;
      North American, and Australian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique described by Nath and all. and mentioned like standard of treatment in the last&#xD;
      consensus on best practice in RFA of the lumbar facet join by the British Pain Society,&#xD;
      similar to the Australian technique, is described as follows: the lumbar spine is visualized&#xD;
      and the radiograph beam is adjusted to come from a posterior-lateral aspect to get the best&#xD;
      possible view of the curvature of the medial part of the upper border of the transverse&#xD;
      process where it ascends to become the ventral-lateral border of the superior articular&#xD;
      process. In patients with a hypertrophic superior articular process due to arthritic changes&#xD;
      greater lateral rotation can be required. The C-arm is then inclined caudal so that the&#xD;
      direction of the radiograph beam is from upwards looking below and somewhat medially along&#xD;
      the groove in which the medial branch lies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 22 SWG SMK C15 cannula with a 5 mm active tip is introduced along the direction of the&#xD;
      radiograph beam, in the so-called &quot;tunnel technique&quot; until bone contact is made with the&#xD;
      lower part of the transverse process (L5 and higher). The cannula is then rotated so that the&#xD;
      bevel was against the bone allowing the needle to slide up in the groove maintaining contact&#xD;
      with the bone surface till the tip was at the upper border and in the centre of the curvature&#xD;
      formed by the upper border of the transverse process ascending to form the lateral border of&#xD;
      the articular process. The position is then checked in the tunnel view, the postero-lateral&#xD;
      view as well as a cephalad view. The lateral view confirms that the cannula is not too far&#xD;
      in, encroaching on the foramen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the S1 level (L5 dorsal ramus) a similar view is maintained to lay the cannula in the&#xD;
      groove between the lower part of the lateral aspect of the superior articular process of S1&#xD;
      and the upper surface of the ala of the sacrum. The tunnel view confirms the position in the&#xD;
      groove. The forward advance is checked rotating the C-arm to look from a more lateral aspect&#xD;
      to visualize the anterior border of the superior articular process of S1, and then from a&#xD;
      more cephalad aspect to visualize the point of the needle in relation to the anterior border&#xD;
      of the ala of the sacrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About the DRG, the radiological location can be divided into 3 types-the intraspinal,&#xD;
      foraminal, and extraforaminal regions; most DRG neurons are of the foraminal type. This&#xD;
      position corresponds to the dorsal-cranial quadrant of the intervertebral foramen on the&#xD;
      lateral view in fluoroscopy, and the middle of the pedicle column on the anteroposterior (AP)&#xD;
      view. However, if the arthritic degenerative changes and foraminal stenosis are severe,&#xD;
      positioning the needle to target the DRG on fluoroscopy may be difficult. Accordingly, needle&#xD;
      tips can be placed laterally on the side of the corresponding pedicle in the AP view. When&#xD;
      the RF needle is close to the target position, the stylet of the RF needle is removed, and&#xD;
      the RF probe is inserted. Similar to the Australian technique, the C-arm is placed with a&#xD;
      20-30Â° lateral tilt on the side to treat, with a slightly caudocephalad tilt, to better&#xD;
      visualize the foramen, just under the inferior border of the transvers process, with&#xD;
      placement of the needle in tunnel vision. The final position of the RF probe is determined&#xD;
      with sensory stimulation (50 Hz), at a voltage below 0.5 V. Proximity of the needle to the&#xD;
      DRG is determined by appropriate sensory stimulation with 50 Hz (0.4-0.6 V), when the patient&#xD;
      feels a tingling sensation. If the threshold value exceeded 0.5V, the needle is carefully&#xD;
      advanced until the patient feels sensory stimulation. Motor stimulation at 2 Hz is used to&#xD;
      determine a threshold 1.5-2.0 times greater than the sensory threshold to avoid placement&#xD;
      near the anterior nerve root and perform the procedure safely. Contrast injection at the end&#xD;
      of the needle tip positioning could represent a further confirmation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the fact that a curved cannula could increase the size of the lesion, a straight&#xD;
      22-gauge cannula with a 5-mm active tip remains the tool most commonly used for&#xD;
      radiofrequency denervation of the facet nerves, and it will be the used cannula in the CRF&#xD;
      group and in the DRG-PRF group. A 4-mm active tip 10 cm long 17G cannula will be placed for&#xD;
      WCRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This group of investigation will adopt a modified Nath technique (using a 5 to 15 degree&#xD;
      cephalo-caudal inclination and a needle view similar to that obtained with the advanced&#xD;
      Australian technique), for CRF and WCRF ablation of MBDR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Position of the radiofrequency cannula will be confirmed by fluoroscopy with AP, oblique, and&#xD;
      lateral view. Once the cannula(e) position is confirmed, routine motor testing will be&#xD;
      carried out with a threshold for lower limb muscle contraction of 2V. Lower limb muscle&#xD;
      contractions occurring below the threshold will prompt a repositioning of the RF cannula.&#xD;
      Sensory stimulation will be applied when single lesions are anticipated (CRF groups); sensory&#xD;
      stimulation of 0,6V mean that the needle is placed at less than 3 mm from the MBDR, that is&#xD;
      the ideal distance to realize an adequate lesion. When multiple or large lesions are planned,&#xD;
      the evidence for sensory stimulation is inconclusive; despite this fact, it was decided to&#xD;
      check for sensory stimulation for all patients involved in this study, knowing that in the&#xD;
      WCRF and CRF groups such stimulation could be inconclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the larger expected lesion size in the WCRF, like suggested by the work of Malik et&#xD;
      all. the investigators will ensure a &quot;safe distance&quot; from the segmental spinal nerve by&#xD;
      adopting the following safety measures: (a) the electrode tip will be placed on the&#xD;
      transverse process, about 4 mm lateral to its junction with the superior articular process;&#xD;
      (b) the parameters used for sensory testing will be modified and paresthesia will be sought&#xD;
      at &gt; 0.6 V, between 0.8 V to 1.0 V.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of CRF and WCRF before starting the treatment, 1 ml of lidocaine 1% will be&#xD;
      injected through the cannula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each lesion will be carried out at 80Â° C for 90 seconds in the CRF group. One lesions will be&#xD;
      applied for each treated level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each lesion in the WCRF group will be carried out at 60Â° C for 150 seconds. One lesion will&#xD;
      be applied for each treated level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the procedure 1 to 1.5 ml of a mixture of ropivacaine 0,2% 8ml + betamethasone&#xD;
      11.8 mg 2ml will be injected before the extraction of the needle, in both this groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of DRG-PRF, a pulsed current (20ms, 2 Hz) is applied (1 time for 120 seconds),&#xD;
      with a 45V output, 20ms lasting impulse (480ms pause). During this procedure, the temperature&#xD;
      at the tip of the electrode is not supposed to exceed 42â.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the procedure, 0,5 to 1 ml of a mixture of ropivacaine 0,1% 8ml and&#xD;
      dexamethasone 8mg will be injected before needle extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CRF treatment and the DRG-PRF will be realized with the Cosman G4 Radiofrequency&#xD;
      Generator. For the WCRF a COOLED RF Generator of Halyard will be used. All the procedures can&#xD;
      be performed in day hospital, with no need for hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ones the needle is positioned, the wire is retired and the probe is inserted; the measured&#xD;
      impedance has to be between 200 and 700â¦ to confirm the proximity to the target structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be in a prone position.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with chronic lumbar back pain supposed to be of facet joint origin (low back&#xD;
             pain irradiated to buttocks, legs, eventually feet in absence of exclusion criteria);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  positivity to FJ provocative clinical tests, possible muscle spasm over the affected&#xD;
             joints;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  positivity to DN4 assessment in the NPPG + negative MBB and negative DN4 assessment +&#xD;
             positive MMB in the NMPG;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  efficacy of MBDR-RF treatment for at least one time reported in the personal clinical&#xD;
             history, unresponsive to the last CRF or WCRF (only for the NPPG);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  an MRI no more than 2 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  basal NRS â¥ 7;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients between 18y and 85y;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ASA (American Society of Anaesthesiologists scale) I-III;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  absence of severe chronic disease associated, full mental capacity to sign the&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        This group is well aware that nowadays literature lack of confirmed clinical diagnostic&#xD;
        criteria, like underlined in the last CPG-ASRAPM. Despite this issue, we decided to select&#xD;
        our clinical criteria to better identify LBP of FJ origin following some of the indications&#xD;
        mentioned in the Delphi survey of an expert panel (Wilde et al., 2007):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  reproduction of similar or even worsening of basal pain during paravertebral finger&#xD;
             pressure applied no more than 2-3 cm laterally to the midline (89% expert acceptance);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  improvement of patient's pain during the flexion of the trunk while sitting (78%&#xD;
             expert acceptance);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  reduced range of motion or increased stiffness during local lateral passive movements&#xD;
             (61% expert acceptance);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  positive balance test with increased pain during extension - stress movements (after&#xD;
             the flexion manoeuvre), or during lateral flexion (starting from 20 degree) and&#xD;
             rotational axial movements (56% expert acceptance).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Another manoeuvre, taking into consideration the spinal columns' biomechanics, is&#xD;
             realized asking the patients while standing with joined feet, to flex completely the&#xD;
             trunk trying to touch with hands the top of his feet; this movement should not provoke&#xD;
             patients' usual pain or worsen it; after that is invited to slowly return to a neutral&#xD;
             position, stopping for 5 seconds in a 90-degree position between the trunk and the&#xD;
             feet; during the extension movement to recover the initial position, the pain could&#xD;
             worsen, or mimic the patients' usual pain, but it can't improve.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We decided to include also patient that present with bilateral low back pain, despite this&#xD;
        survey describe localized unilateral low back pain like one of possible clinical indicator&#xD;
        of lumbar facet joint pain (80% expert agreement); this decision is based on our clinical&#xD;
        experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  positive MBB with positive DN4;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  negative MMB with negative DN4;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  positive EMG for neuropathic pain of radicular origin (89% expert acceptance),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  diagnostic imaging of significant radicular compression (based on the radiologist&#xD;
             judgement);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  late diagnosis of other causes of LBP, cancer related pain, neoplastic patients,&#xD;
             patients with life expectation inferior to 1 year;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI &gt; 35;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients insurance or work absence related interests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patient refusal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Back's depression inventory II (BDI-II) &gt; 20,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  previous lumbar spinal, pelvic and knee surgery, or significant stenosis of the spinal&#xD;
             canal that can interfere with diagnosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patient with systemic infection, pregnant or breastfeeding woman, untreatable&#xD;
             coagulative problems;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  clinical doubt by the enrolling physician that can interfere with the evaluation's&#xD;
             efficacy of the procedures under investigation (like hip pain, cluneal nerve's&#xD;
             entrapment pain, trochanteritis, myofascial pain, etc.);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  any contraindication to neuraxial injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Social risk factors that could influence the adherence to the study protocol will be&#xD;
             taken into consideration and valuated accordingly.&#xD;
