    <textblock>
      The current study builds on the empirical foundation of Mindful-Compassion Art Therapy (MCAT)&#xD;
      to test its efficacy as a multicomponent, holistic, psycho-socio-spiritual intervention for&#xD;
      supporting dementia family caregivers. MCAT is a group-based intervention that integrates&#xD;
      mindfulness meditation and art therapy, with reflective awareness complementing emotional&#xD;
      expression, to foster self-compassion and inner-resilience among professional caregivers. A&#xD;
      wait-list RCT design is adopted to refine and extend the application of MCAT to empower&#xD;
      self-care and resilience among 102 dementia family caregivers recruited via community-based&#xD;
      dementia-care organizations in Singapore. The expected outcomes will advance theory and&#xD;
      practice for sustainable dementia family caregiving in Singapore and around the globe.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Dementia is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to irreversible decline in&#xD;
      one's cognitive and functional capacity, identity, and personhood. In Singapore, the number&#xD;
      of persons with dementia is expected to soar to 187,000 by 2050. Hence, it is imperative to&#xD;
      render comprehensive support to dementia sufferers, and especially their family caregivers.&#xD;
      While local initiatives have raised public awareness and developed services for dementia&#xD;
      care, they do not adequately address the psycho-socio-spiritual needs of family caregivers,&#xD;
      as caregiving stress can greatly impede one's mental and emotional health. International&#xD;
      research for dementia family caregivers has thus focused on developing multicomponent&#xD;
      interventions that accentuate holistic support to promote healthy and sustainable caregiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective and Methods: Building on the established MCAT protocol (Ho et al., 2019), this&#xD;
      study will adopt a wait-list randomized controlled trial design to test the efficacy of the&#xD;
      refined version of Mindful-Compassion Art Therapy for Dementia Care (MCAT-DC) among 102&#xD;
      dementia family caregivers in Singapore. This study aims to: 1) develop a disease-specific&#xD;
      version of MCAT for Dementia Care (MCAT-DC); 2) assess MCAT-DC's effectiveness in reducing&#xD;
      caregiver stress and burden; 3) assess MCAT-DC's effectiveness for reducing caregivers'&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and psychophysiological distress, while enhancing resilience, hope,&#xD;
      spirituality, meaning and quality-of-life; and 4) assess the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      a standardized MCAT-DC protocol for large-scale implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: MCAT is an effective psycho-social-spiritual intervention for reducing stress&#xD;
      and promoting holistic wellbeing among professional caregivers. It has received wide&#xD;
      recognition and distinction among palliative care and research communities for its clinical&#xD;
      innovation and effectiveness. Given the robust evidence on MCAT's positive impact on&#xD;
      professional caregivers, it is anticipated that a refined version of MCAT will have similar,&#xD;
      if not greater, benefits for family caregivers. The study findings will form new knowledge to&#xD;
      advance both theory and practice for sustainable dementia family caregiving in Singapore and&#xD;
      around the globe.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Upon referrals made by the collaborating institutions and other community dementia-care organizations, consenting caregivers will be allocated to either the immediate treatment group or wait-list control group. Baseline assessment [T1] is conducted through face-to-face interviews, or self-administered questionnaires, facilitated by the research team.&#xD;
Participants assigned to the treatment group will then attend a 4-week MCAT-DC programme conducted jointly by an experienced mindfulness practitioner and a credentialed art therapist or artist. Thereafter, immediate post intervention assessment [T2] will be carried out, with follow-up assessments at 4 weeks [T3], 3-months [T4] and 6-month [T5]. Participants assigned to the wait-list control group will be assessed at second baseline [T2], thereafter, attend a 4-week MCAT-DC programme, followed by an immediate post intervention assessment [T3], as well as follow-up assessments at 3-months [T4] and 6-months [T5].</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Heart Rate Variability (HRV), a reliable biomarker that reflects an individual's cardiovascular stress regulation, is used to assess participants' psychophysiological well-being (Wheat &amp; Larkin, 2010).

Concisely, an Infrared Pulse Plethysmography finger sensor is attached to participants' index finger while following a series of brief breathing instruction on the screen of the smart tablet, and during this 1-2 minute exercises, data of their psychophysiological performance are collected.</description>

    <description>Each Mindful-Compassion Art Therapy for Dementia Care (MCAT-DC) will focus on 3 major areas that cultivate self-care, resilience and communal support. The specific intervention structure include: Week 1 - Empowering Self-Care: Introduction to the science of stress, self-care, burnout, as well as the arts and mindfulness to cultivate resilience; Week 2 - Reflective Caregiving: Reflection of caregiving experiences that demonstrates strengths and challenges; Week 3 - Understanding Loss: Introduction to the science of loss, how grief can impair hope and wellbeing, and how self-compassion can help transform suffering into blessings.; Week 4 - Meaning Reconstruction: Reflection on caregiver identities, to elicit the lessons and wisdoms learnt, and to create renewed meaning to sustain their caregiving journeys. Guided mindfulness mediation will also be professionally recorded to form a daily take-home mindfulness mediation exercise for participants, each exercise will last 10-20 minutes.</description>
