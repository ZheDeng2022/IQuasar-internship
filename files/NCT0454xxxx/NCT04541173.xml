  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, randomized phase II study comparing the Y90 TARE&#xD;
      followed by bevacizumab and atezolizumab treatment to the Y90 TARE treatment alone in&#xD;
      unresectable intermediate stage HCC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized to Y-90 TARE alone (Arm A) or Y-90 TARE followed by the&#xD;
      combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab (Arm B). The first 10 subjects randomized to Arm&#xD;
      B (Y-90 TARE + bevacizumab + atezolizumab) will be assessed for safety after two cycles. If&#xD;
      there are no Grade ≥ 3 unexpected toxicities; possibly, probably or definitely related to&#xD;
      TARE in combination with bevacizumab and atezolizumab the combination will be deemed safe and&#xD;
      accrual will continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to receive bevacizumab and atezolizumab (Arm B) will start the&#xD;
      combination of bevacizumab and atezolizumab 4 weeks (± 1 week) after TARE treatment. Full&#xD;
      recovery from the procedure is required prior to systemic treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AST and ALT ≤ 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin ≤ 3 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Manifestations of post-embolization syndrome (e.g., fever, nausea, vomiting, and&#xD;
           abdominal pain) have resolved to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria&#xD;
           for Adverse Events, Version 5.0 Grade 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No significant medical events (e.g., gastrointestinal [GI] bleeding, cardiac events,&#xD;
           hepatorenal syndrome) during or after the TARE procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These subjects will continue the study drugs for a total of 24 months from the TARE&#xD;
      treatment, until intolerable toxicity or disease progression occur.&#xD;

    <description>This plan will involve treating the predominant liver lesions with segment Y-90 TARE using predetermined dosimetry, while keeping FLR equal or greater than 40% (FLR is estimated by excluding the liver volume of Y-90 infused distribution).&#xD;
The maximal amount of Y-90 TARE treatment will be limited to only one lobe of the liver if segmental Y-90 TARE is not possible to treat the predominant lesion. Since segmental Y-90 TARE may result in less long term liver damage compared to lobal Y-90 TARE, segmental Y-90 TARE treatment is preferred to lobar Y-90 TARE if segmental Y-90 TARE treatment is able to treat all blood supply to the predominant lesion or lesion with vascular invasion to preserve liver function. For segmental treatment, a minimum tumor dose of 190 Gy should be used for glass microspheres and 120 Gy for resin microspheres. For lobar treatment, a minimum dose of 100 Gy should be used for resin microspheres.</description>
