    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of Acalabrutinib to current standard therapy of Rituximab,&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine and Prednisolone (R-CHOP) for patients with&#xD;
      previously untreated CD20 positive Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) requiring full&#xD;
      course chemoimmunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive one cycle of R-CHOP. Two thirds of patients (Arm B) will go on to&#xD;
      receive a further 5 cycles (every 21 days) of R-CHOP with Acalabrutinib. Acalabrutinib will&#xD;
      be taken orally twice daily continuously in 21 day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One third of patients (Arm A) will continue with 5 cycles of R-CHOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up initially for 24 months and then for disease status and survival&#xD;
      until 114 progression events have been observed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common of the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.&#xD;
      Whilst the majority of patients will respond well to conventional treatment (R-CHOP -&#xD;
      rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone), a significant number&#xD;
      of patients lymphoma will not respond to initial therapy or their disease will return after&#xD;
      completion of therapy. In a number of B-cell diseases an enzyme called, Bruton tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase (BTK) prevents death of tumour cells, including in DLBCL. Acalabrutinib is an orally&#xD;
      active BTK-inhibitor and it is thought that stopping BTK being activated may help in treating&#xD;
      B-cell diseases. It is hypothesised that the addition of Acalabrutinib to standard R-CHOP&#xD;
      immunochemotherapy may improve outcomes of patients with DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REMoDL-A is a randomised, phase II, open label, multicentre study that will be open in up to&#xD;
      50 centres. Up to 553 patients (453 randomised) will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent all patients will receive 1 cycle of conventional R-CHOP&#xD;
      chemotherapy. At the same time the diagnostic pathology block will be sent for molecular&#xD;
      profiling by the Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service (HMDS). The delivery of the&#xD;
      first cycle of R-CHOP will allow a sufficient interval for real time determination of&#xD;
      molecular phenotype. Patients whose biopsies yield sufficient tumour material for profiling&#xD;
      will be randomised 2:1 in favour of the experimental arm (R-CHOP + acalabrutinib).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective will be to establish if combining acalabrutinib with R-CHOP improves&#xD;
      efficacy, compared to R-CHOP alone, for the treatment of previously untreated patients with&#xD;
      DLBCL to a degree that justifies further development of this approach.&#xD;
