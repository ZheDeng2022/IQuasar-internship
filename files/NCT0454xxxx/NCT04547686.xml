      The purpose of this study is to test whether the integration of a smoke-free homes&#xD;
      intervention into the clinical guidelines for tobacco cessation can encourage sustained&#xD;
      smoking cessation in low-income primary care patients. The intervention consists of five&#xD;
      components, three interactive mailings and two coaching calls, focused on creating home and&#xD;
      vehicle(s) smoking bans among smokers.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Smoke-Free Homes intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>The adapted smoke-free homes intervention consists of five components, three interactive mailings and two coaching calls, focused on creating home and vehicle(s) smoking bans among smokers. The intervention is based on principles of Social Cognitive Theory and the Transtheoretical Model's stages of change. The rationale underlying the intervention is that creation of additional smoke-free environments will reduce situational and environmental cues to smoke, reduce opportunities and places to smoke, increase self-efficacy for quitting and increase motivation to quit. The intervention uses persuasion, role modeling, behavioral contracting and goal setting to move smokers through behavioral capability, outcome expectations and self-efficacy for strict smoke-free rules, creation of and compliance/enforcement with smoke-free rules, reduced cigarettes smoked per day, increased motivation to quit, increased quit attempts, and successful cessation.</description>
