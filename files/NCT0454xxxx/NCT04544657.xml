  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a common clinical disease with high disability and mortality, which seriously&#xD;
      threatens human life and health.Carotid atherosclerotic plaque rupture is an important&#xD;
      pathogenic basis of ischemic stroke, so judging the stability of plaque has important&#xD;
      clinical significance in preventing ischemic stroke.Ultrasound, as a convenient, rapid,&#xD;
      noninvasive, radiation-free auxiliary examination technology, is widely used in carotid&#xD;
      plaque stability examination.At present, there are many methods to judge the stability of&#xD;
      carotid plaque based on ultrasound, including two-dimensional ultrasound, contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      ultrasound, ultrasound elastography and so on. However, the results of plaque stability&#xD;
      judgment by various technologies deviate greatly, which is not conducive to the development&#xD;
      of standardized diagnosis and treatment strategies by clinicians.Studies have shown that&#xD;
      because the neovascular epidermal cells in atherosclerotic plaques are imperfect, they are&#xD;
      easy to rupture after stress, and the ruptured neovasculature will lead to intraplaque&#xD;
      hemorrhage, thus causing plaque shedding, and eventually obstructing the cerebrovascular&#xD;
      cause stroke.Contrast-enhanced ultrasound can sensitively detect the distribution and course&#xD;
      of blood vessels.The plaque's softness and hardness determine its stability, while the&#xD;
      difference of lipids, fibers and calcium in the plaque determines its softness and&#xD;
      hardness.Real-time ultrasound elastography can provide tissue mechanical parameters, express&#xD;
      the soft and hard of tissue with strain value, and provide important reference information&#xD;
      for judging plaque stability.At present, elastography technology is used to reflect the&#xD;
      hardness of plaque, so as to further judge its stability.However, the elastography parameters&#xD;
      are prone to deviations due to the influence of the selected section and the selected region&#xD;
      of interest.Deep learning is the hottest research method in AI at present. [Deep learning is&#xD;
      essentially to construct machine learning models with multiple hidden layers, and use&#xD;
      large-scale data to train to obtain a large number of more representative feature&#xD;
      information, so as to use these features to classify and predict samples. At present, it is&#xD;
      widely used in the field of image analysis and plays an important role in medicine.Such as&#xD;
      pathological image detection, regulatory genomics research, diagnosis of retinopathy and&#xD;
      quantitative analysis of liver fibrosis, etc.Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a new&#xD;
      discipline developed by the combination of numerical calculation and classical fluid&#xD;
      mechanics theory. It can make it convenient for researchers to build a geometric model of&#xD;
      cardiovascular system, simulate the real structure of vascular wall and blood, and display&#xD;
      the results of &quot;numerical experiments&quot; using visualization technology.More intuitive&#xD;
      Comprehensive response to changes in hemodynamic parameters In recent years, its application&#xD;
      in cardiovascular hemodynamic research has become increasingly widespread, with a large&#xD;
      number of relevant literature reports However, no report has been reported on the study of&#xD;
      carotid plaque stability and fluid dynamics using this technology Based on the above&#xD;
      reasons,This study attempts to use AI technology to automatically identify and quantitatively&#xD;
      evaluate the gray scale differences of plaques, elastic image characteristics of plaques,&#xD;
      microvessel density division of plaque contrast-enhanced ultrasound, and velocity vector&#xD;
      imaging (VVI) to determine plaque surface stress.To study the effect of hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters on carotid plaque using CFD technology, and to establish a systematic&#xD;
      comprehensive evaluation system for carotid plaque stability, which integrates&#xD;
      two-dimensional plaque information, texture information, microcirculation perfusion&#xD;
      information, biomechanical information and blood flow field information, and combines the&#xD;
      results of clinical follow-up and collagen fiber content of surgical specimens, MMP9/CD34 and&#xD;
      other examinations.&#xD;
