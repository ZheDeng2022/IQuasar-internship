  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop and test an intervention combining physical therapy&#xD;
      (PT) and coping skills training to improve women's sexual function after pelvic radiation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic radiation, which is a critical component in the treatment of many gynecologic,&#xD;
      bladder, rectal and anal cancers, often results in devastating and long-lasting sexual side&#xD;
      effects. Vaginal changes following pelvic radiation include adhesions, agglutination,&#xD;
      fibrosis, dryness, atrophy, and stenosis. Pelvic radiation-related sexual problems are often&#xD;
      undertreated, resulting in poor symptom management and reduced quality of life.&#xD;
      Rehabilitation programs including pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) and vaginal dilator&#xD;
      exercises may help minimize post-radiation vaginal changes and related sexual problems, but&#xD;
      use of these rehabilitation strategies is inconsistent and infrequent in routine clinical&#xD;
      practice. For many women, engaging in these rehabilitation strategies can be difficult and&#xD;
      adherence is low (e.g.,1% to 35% for dilator use). Barriers to engaging in PFMT and dilator&#xD;
      exercises include lack of information, pain, embarrassment, fear, and reliving invasive&#xD;
      treatments. There is a critical need for interventions to help women access and engage in&#xD;
      rehabilitation following pelvic radiation treatment. We propose to develop and pilot test a&#xD;
      novel physical therapist delivered intervention to improve women's sexual function after&#xD;
      pelvic radiation that integrates pelvic health physical therapy interventions (i.e., vaginal&#xD;
      dilators, PFMT) and cognitive-behavioral based coping skills training for managing symptoms&#xD;
      and improving treatment adherence. Pelvic health physical therapy interventions have&#xD;
      demonstrated effectiveness for treating pelvic pain and sexual pain disorders. Coping skills&#xD;
      training interventions have demonstrated benefits for reducing symptoms and improving&#xD;
      treatment engagement.This study includes two phases: intervention development and pilot&#xD;
      testing. For intervention development (months 1-6), qualitative data obtained from patient&#xD;
      and healthcare provider interviews will be used to develop and refine the integrated PT and&#xD;
      coping skills training intervention. Using information obtained in qualitative interviews, we&#xD;
      will develop the intervention. In pilot testing (months 7-12), we will pilot the developed&#xD;
      intervention with women who were treated with pelvic radiation. : The specific aims of this&#xD;
      study are to: 1) develop and refine an integrated PT and coping skills training intervention&#xD;
      based on qualitative data from interviews with cancer survivors, oncology providers, and&#xD;
      pelvic health physical therapists; 2) pilot the developed intervention to examine its&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability; and 3) examine the patterns of change and relationships among&#xD;
      outcome variables including vaginal changes, pelvic floor function, sexual function and&#xD;
      satisfaction, and use of rehabilitation exercises.&#xD;

    <description>The proposed intervention will provide pelvic health physical therapy interventions including: education about vaginal moisturizers and lubricants, low back and hip assessment and instruction in accommodations (e.g., strategies for accommodating sexual position of choice), instruction in vulvar massage, instruction and facilitation of vaginal dilator use, and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) and exercises. Women will be given a set of vaginal dilators. Cognitive behavioral techniques that have been successfully used by physical therapists in prior intervention studies will be integrated into the PT intervention including breathing and relaxation techniques, guided imagery, systematic desensitization, cognitive restructuring techniques and coping thoughts, and problem solving</description>
