      This pilot project will randomize a small sample of patients about to undergo surgery for&#xD;
      their autoimmune, inflammatory thyroid disease, and determine if a short course of prednisone&#xD;
      alters the inflammation of the gland and makes surgery less difficult. It will enroll 30&#xD;
      participants who will each be on study for up to 7 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis are autoimmune conditions affecting the thyroid&#xD;
      gland. Surgery to remove the thyroid gland in these patients may be complicated by the&#xD;
      inflammatory nature of these diseases. Prednisone is a steroid medication used to decrease&#xD;
      inflammation of the thyroid gland in other disease states such as sub-acute thyroiditis, but&#xD;
      has not been used systematically to reduce inflammation in patients about to undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot project that proposes to randomize a small sample of patients about to&#xD;
      undergo surgery for their autoimmune, inflammatory thyroid disease, and determine if a short&#xD;
      course of prednisone alters the inflammation of the gland and makes surgery less difficult.&#xD;
      This could potentially lead to better outcomes for these patients, as well as increased time&#xD;
      to recovery and improved quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project proposes to administer short quality of life surveys at three time points, as&#xD;
      well as draw additional labs to measure inflammation and antibody levels at times when&#xD;
      patients will already be getting labs drawn for clinical purposes. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to generate preliminary data from which a larger, blinded, placebo-controlled trial could&#xD;
      be designed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the benefits and safety of preoperatively administered prednisone for patients&#xD;
           with autoimmune thyroid disease undergoing thyroidectomy on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Difficulty of surgery and rates of surgical complications&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum autoantibody levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Longitudinally assess the impact of surgical treatment on QoL in patients with&#xD;
           autoimmune thyroid disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Update: Protocol amendment approved on 10-22-2020: Study team decided to omit the aim&#xD;
      'antibody-mediated cytokine levels' from the protocol and consent process as it became&#xD;
      cost-prohibitive for processing and storage fees. Cytokine levels are not something typically&#xD;
      collected or tracked in the course of clinical care, and may not be relevant. Study can&#xD;
      proceed without this aim and will not alter the main outcome measures of antibody levels and&#xD;
      difficulty of the operation.&#xD;

    <description>The surgeon will fill out the &quot;Thyroid Difficulty Scale&quot; at the conclusion of the operation. This is a 4-item survey to rate the vascularity, friability, mobility, and glandular size of the thyroid. The total possible range of scores from 4-20, higher scores indicate increased difficulty in thyroid surgery</description>

    <description>Autoantibodies that may be positive include: Thyroglobulin Antibody [TgAb], Thyroid peroxidase antibody [TPO], Thyroid Stimulating Ig antibody [TSI], and/or Thyrotropin Receptor antibody [TRAb]. Any that were positive pre-op will be measured at each time point.</description>

    <description>Antibody-mediated cytokine levels will be measured using a 10 cytokine panel from Luminex. Cytokines that have been implicated in other autoimmune disease include: IFN-gamma (BR29), IL-6 (BR13), IL-10 (BR22), IL-13 (BR47), IL-15 (BR63), IL-17A (BR42), and VEGF-C (BR38).</description>

    <description>The SF-12 is a 12-item quality of life survey to understand how the participant feels and how well they are able to do their normal activities. It is scored on a scale of 0-100, with higher numbers indicating higher quality of life.</description>

             proceed with thyroidectomy as the clinical treatment of their autoimmune thyroid&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pediatric patients &lt; 18&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with radioactive iodine (RAI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known diagnosis of thyroid cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on any immunosuppressive regiment (such as organ transplant patients or&#xD;
