  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators has developed a blood pressure telemonitoring system. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that, when optimal control of BP is confirmed on the telemonitoring system, the index&#xD;
      physician's consultation can be safely deferred, and medications can still be prescribed&#xD;
      without such face-to-face consultation. Despite potentially resource-saving for doctors and&#xD;
      time-saving for patients, the feasibility and patients' acceptability of the use of the&#xD;
      telemonitoring system to replace face-to-face physician consultation remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For primary outcome, the investigators hypothesize that this telemonitoring system will be&#xD;
      feasible and acceptable to patients and can replace physicians' face-to-face consultations.&#xD;
      For secondary outcomes, the investigators hypothesize that patients receiving care through&#xD;
      telemonitoring have non-inferior BP control when compared with patients receiving usual care.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the patients receiving telemonitoring may also have enhanced self-efficacy and&#xD;
      compliance to drugs and lifestyle interventions&#xD;

    <description>The HT app (HealthCap) allows patients to record their home BP measurements (HBPM) and can automatically provide mean BP values from the previous 7 or 30 days. 1-2 week prior to a scheduled physician, HealthCap and a research assistant will remind patients to take dual BP readings both in the morning and evening for 1 week for doctors' management. The mean values of the 7-day home BP will be checked before the index consultation. If the home BP control was optimal (i.e. ≤135/85 mmHg), other important parameters will be checked automatically by a questionnaire in the app: (i) if they have good drug compliance and if they experienced any side effects,(ii) if they have symptoms suggestive of target organ damages such as chest pain or hemiplegia, and (iii) if they have any problem(s) that need to consult a physician. If no complaints are identified, the patient can collect medications directly from the clinic and the physician appointment will be deferred for 3 months</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have a diagnosis of essential hypertension (HT) and are currently taking&#xD;
             antihypertensive agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have good control of clinic BP as confirmed on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring&#xD;
             (ABPM) (daytime BP ≤135/85mmHg)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  can read basic Chinese (as the content of the app in Chinese)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have a home BP monitor (HBPM)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  used any mobile app (not HT-related) in the previous 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  an inability to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  unwillingness to conduct HBPM or repeated ABPM&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  current use of any other HT app for BP monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  relative contraindications to ABPM (diagnosed atrial fibrillation, occupational&#xD;
             drivers or patients with bleeding tendencies)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  severe mental illness, including those diagnosed with schizophrenia, dementia or as&#xD;
             being actively suicidal, because these patients may have diminished ability to use the&#xD;
             HT app;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a diagnosis of other chronic disease(s) that need regular physical assessments and&#xD;
             doctors' consultations (e.g. diabetes and asthma that are being treated, but patients&#xD;
             with hypertension and hyperlipidaemia will remain eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  diagnosed active cancer,&#xD;
