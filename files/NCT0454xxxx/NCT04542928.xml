    <textblock>
      Many studies have shown that patients with schizophrenia have poor cleanliness and negligible&#xD;
      appearance, which leads to negative body image and low self-esteem. However, there are few&#xD;
      researches in Taiwan that nurse facilitated face care group in patients with schizophrenia to&#xD;
      improve their body image and self-esteem.This study was to explore the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      nurse facilitated face care group in patients with schizophrenia in improving their body&#xD;
      image and self-esteem.A total of 96 patients with schizophrenia in a mental hospital in&#xD;
      southern Taiwan were recruited in this study. The participants were divided into experimental&#xD;
      and control groups through block randomization. In addition to participating in routine&#xD;
      functional treatment activities, the experimental group is required to receive an additional&#xD;
      50 minutes of face care grou every two weeks led by the nurse. The patients in control group&#xD;
      received routine functional treatment activities, a facial cleansing instruction and five&#xD;
      facial cleansing videos. The research tools include demographic data, the subscale in MBSRQ -&#xD;
      Appearance evaluation and Appearance orientation, FACE-Q - Appearance-related psychosocial&#xD;
      distress. FACE-Q - Satisfaction with outcome. FACE-Q - Psychological function. FACE-Q -&#xD;
      Satisfaction with skin. FACE-Q - Social function. Rosenberg self-Esteem scale (RSES). A&#xD;
      questionnaire survey of body image and self-esteem was conducted before the intervention, 12&#xD;
      weeks after the intervention and one month after the end of the intervention.The collected&#xD;
      data were analyzed by IBM SPSS 24.0 statistical software. The descriptive statistics include&#xD;
      mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, frequency distribution, and percentages; the&#xD;
      Generalized estimating equation (GEE) were employed to explore the effectiveness of a nurse&#xD;
      facilitated face care group in patients with schizophrenia after controlling demographic&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
