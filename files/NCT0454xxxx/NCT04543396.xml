      All accrued subjects will be assigned study ID numbers to de-identify subject data and keep&#xD;
      research team members blinded to group assignments. The CRC will maintain a master keyfile of&#xD;
      subject Group randomization that will be revealed to the research team after between-group&#xD;
      statistical analyses have been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all subjects: The active study period for this investigation will be 8 weeks in duration.&#xD;
      Passive monitoring will then continue for 12 months after the initial 8 week period. All&#xD;
      subjects will continue to receive standard of care treatments from their preferred clinical&#xD;
      practitioner (physical therapist, chiropractor, none). All subjects will complete three&#xD;
      progress assessments over the duration of the 8-week intervention period. These progress&#xD;
      assessments will occur at baseline, week 4, and week 8 and will include the following&#xD;
      elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical Questionnaires - Clinical questionnaires will be digitally completed by each&#xD;
           participant. There will be four (4) clinical questionnaires (Visual Analog Pain Scale,&#xD;
           Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, PROMIS Physical Function, and PROMIS Pain Interference).&#xD;
&#xD;
           PROMIS Physical Function Questionnaire: Developed by the NIH, this question bank is used&#xD;
           to assess patient function. Patients rate each question on a nominal scale from 1-5&#xD;
           related to their ability to complete activities of daily living and exercise. We will&#xD;
           use the version 2.0 question bank.&#xD;
&#xD;
           PROMIS Pain Interference: Developed by the NIH, this question band is used to assess the&#xD;
           degree to which pain interferes with quality of life and how much pain restricts the&#xD;
           patient from activities of daily living and exercise. We will use the version 1.1&#xD;
           question bank.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia: Developed in 1990, this is a clinical questionnaire used&#xD;
           to evaluate fear of movement relative to lower back pain. This is a 17 item form with&#xD;
           each item being subjectively indicated by the subject on a 4 point scale. The overall&#xD;
           form is then evaluated by a standardized scoring format.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visual Analog Scale: A one question clinical questionnaire that asks subjects to&#xD;
           subjectively rate their pain on a scale from 1-10. A green-to-red color gradient may&#xD;
           also be used and converted to a 10 point scale as this has shown to produce greater&#xD;
           reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient Satisfaction: Subjects will be asked 2 questions related to satisfaction with&#xD;
           their outcomes. Both questions will be scored on 5 point scales. Question 1 will be in&#xD;
           reference to overall satisfaction &quot;How would you rate your current satisfaction as&#xD;
           related to your lower back pain?&quot; Answer options will include 1) &quot;very satisfied&quot;, 2)&#xD;
           &quot;somewhat satisfied&quot;, 3) &quot;satisfied&quot;, 4) &quot;somewhat dissatisfied&quot;, 5) &quot;very&#xD;
           dissatisfied&quot;. Question 2 comes from the North American Spine Society lumbar spine&#xD;
           outcome assessment and will read &quot;Rate your satisfaction of the treatment received for&#xD;
           your lower back pain.&quot; Answer selections will include: 1) &quot;The treatment met my&#xD;
           expectations&quot;, 2) &quot;I did not improve as much as I had hoped, but I would undergo the&#xD;
           same treatment for the same outcome&quot;, 3) &quot;I did not improve as much as I had hoped, and&#xD;
           I would not undergo the same treatment for the same outcome&quot;, and 4) &quot;I am the same or&#xD;
           worse than before treatment&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tonal Subject Satisfaction - Subjective questions pertaining to progress perceived by&#xD;
           the subject will be integrated into the Tonal software platform and answers will be&#xD;
           recorded digitally. The Tonal satisfaction question will be presented in the following&#xD;
           format:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Question for trial participants: &quot;How was your workout?&quot; Responses: 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5&#xD;
           stars&#xD;
&#xD;
           If 1 star, the secondary question is: &quot;Let's fix it. What can we improve?&quot; If 2 - 4&#xD;
           stars, the secondary question is: &quot;Thanks for your feedback. What can we improve?&quot; If 5&#xD;
           stars, the secondary question is: &quot;Thanks for your feedback. What did you love?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
           Selections:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ease of use&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Movements&#xD;

&#xD;
        3. Core Training Program - for intervention groups, a training program designed to enhance&#xD;
           core strength, stability, and function will be performed on the Tonal device.&#xD;
           Performance of this program will be supervised by a designated and clinically trained&#xD;
           research team member who will not conduct the statistical analysis and subsequently not&#xD;
           be blinded to Group assignment. Group 5 will also complete the prescribed training&#xD;
           program in the comfort of their own home/Tonal gym. The program will last approximately&#xD;
           20 minutes in length and incorporate progressive exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each training session will be preceded by a dynamic warm-up and finished with a dynamic&#xD;
           cooldown to fit within the approximate time frame of 30 minutes. If at any point a&#xD;
           prescribed exercise appears to cause difficulty or discomfort to a subject, the&#xD;
           supervising trainer will have authority to use his/her discretion to modify the exercise&#xD;
           to make it easier for the subject, or skip the exercise altogether. Throughout the&#xD;
           training program, the Tonal device will record continuous data on range of motion, power&#xD;
           generated, weight resistance, total weight displacement, time under tension, and&#xD;
           strength score. This data is automatically saved on the Tonal servers and will be&#xD;
           transferred to the research team on a weekly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At each evaluation session, subjects will perform the artificial intelligence learning&#xD;
           program used by the Tonal to establish baseline resistance levels for new users.&#xD;
           Subjects will be asked to perform five separate activities (neutral grip deadlift, bench&#xD;
           press, overhead press, and lateral pull down), each for multiple repetitions. During the&#xD;
           each repetition, the artificial intelligence program on the Tonal will adjust user&#xD;
           resistance based on performance of the previous repetition until an optimal resistance&#xD;
           weight is identified for the subject. Once the Tonal has established resistance levels,&#xD;
           the subject will repeat each activity for 10 repetitions with weight activated. A&#xD;
           weight-activated bicep curl will also be performed for 10 repetitions. The standard&#xD;
           tonal data sheet will be collected. This sheet includes the following variables:&#xD;
           activity, time, repetitions, range of motion, power, duration, target repetitions,&#xD;
           target time, target duration, base weight, suggested weight, additional&#xD;
           eccentric/concentric weight, assisted weight, total duration, total activities, total&#xD;
           sets, total volume, and percent completion. Identifiable information, which is typically&#xD;
           included in Tonal reports will be replaced with assigned Subject IDs prior to any data&#xD;
           transfer so that all data remains de-identified. In addition to this standard Tonal&#xD;
           report, continuous data will be collected for range of motion (calculated from cable&#xD;
           distance traveled) and speed of motion relative to time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For each training session subjects will follow the specified exercise protocol, which&#xD;
           will be supervised by the athletic trainer. The standard Tonal report will be generated&#xD;
           as indicated for the evaluation sessions. This report will again be de-identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sorenson's Back Endurance Test - a research team member will perform a Sorenson's Back&#xD;
           Endurance Test on each subject. To perform this test, subject will lie prone on a&#xD;
           clinical exam table with the superior edge of the iliac crest at the edge of the table&#xD;
           and arms crossed over the chest. The lower limbs will be stabilized to the table with&#xD;
           straps. The subject will be asked to maintain their upper body in a horizontal position&#xD;
           for as long as possible while a research team member times them. If the subject&#xD;
           maintains this posture for 240 seconds, the test will end. The total time for which a&#xD;
           horizontal upper body posture is maintained will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Shearwave Elastography (SWE) - SWE ultrasound images will be captured on the erector&#xD;
           spinae muscles with a Aixplorer MACH 30 (Hologic Supersonic Imagine, France). This&#xD;
           non-invasive, non-radiation imagery allows for assessment of stiffness properties in&#xD;
           muscle tissue. A research team member will take SWE images with the subject laying prone&#xD;
           on a horizontal surface in a relaxed position and with the ultrasound transducer aligned&#xD;
           with the muscle fibers. A minimum of 3 images will be captured and averaged to determine&#xD;
           the mean resting tissue stiffness. These ultrasound images are research procedures that&#xD;
           will be completed by research staff using research equipment. The research team members&#xD;
           have been trained in the collection of shearwave images directly by the ultrasound&#xD;
           vendor company. The indicated activities will be completed supplemental to your standard&#xD;
           clinical care as part of this study and will not be considered part of your medical&#xD;
           treatment nor will they be included as part of your medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Isokinetic Lumbar Strength - a research team member will assess flexion/extension torque&#xD;
           of the lumbar spine will be assessed via a Humac Norm Dynamometer (CSMI Solutions,&#xD;
           Stoughton, MA, USA). Isokinetic torque will be recorded across a subject-specified range&#xD;
           of motion at a rotation speed of 60°/sec. A subject will be permitted four (4) warm-up&#xD;
           trials to familiarize themselves with the isokinetic device and lumbar exercise. The&#xD;
           subject will then be asked to perform five (5) recorded trials at their maximal effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Isometric Proprioceptive Measurement - a research team member will assess the ability of&#xD;
           each subject to use their proprioception to match a target strength magnitude for&#xD;
           isometric back flexion/extension contractions. This test will be performed using the&#xD;
           lumbar accessory for the Humac Norm Dynamometer. A target force of will be selected.&#xD;
           This test will be performed after the Isokinetic Lumbar Strength test and subjects will&#xD;
           only qualify if their maximal isokinetic strength exceeds the specified target force.&#xD;
           Subjects will be secured at a predetermined flexion angle within each subject's range of&#xD;
           motion for lumbar flexion. Subjects will be asked to increase the strength of their back&#xD;
           contraction in a trapezoidal form (3 seconds ramp-up, 10 seconds hold steady, 3 seconds&#xD;
           ramp-down). The first trial will be performed with visual stimulus to define the target&#xD;
           force. The second trial will be performed without visual stimulus and will rely on the&#xD;
           subject's proprioception to identify the target force and maintain steadiness. These&#xD;
           tests will be repeated three times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Standard of Care Subjects: Subjects will continue their preferred clinical care, but&#xD;
      complete no additional Tonal training outside of the three progress evaluation sessions&#xD;
      specified above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Intervention Subjects: Subjects will continue their preferred clinical care and&#xD;
      additionally be asked to perform the above specified Core Training Program two (2) times per&#xD;
      week for a period of eight (8) weeks. This program will be performed on a Tonal device&#xD;
      installed at Mayo Clinic. For every training session, the Tonal Subject Satisfaction and&#xD;
      Visual Analog Scale questions indicated above will be answered relative to the workout.&#xD;
      Intervention subjects will complete a total of 16 training sessions on the Tonal device, with&#xD;
      full progress evaluations occurring on sessions 1, 8, and 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal Tracking: After the completion of the 8 week intervention period, all subjects&#xD;
      from all Groups will be tracked by the CRC or research team members for up to one (1) year.&#xD;
      The CRC or research team members will follow-up once per quarter with all subjects from all&#xD;
      Groups. These follow-ups will be completed remotely via phone and/or email and will consist&#xD;
      of quarterly interactions during which subjects will be asked to complete the same Clinical&#xD;
      Questionnaires described above in the progress evaluations. Subjects will also indicate&#xD;
      whether they have sought additional treatment for LBP. For Groups 1-4, those subjects that&#xD;
      have had positive LBP recurrence will have their medical records evaluated for severity and&#xD;
      outcome of LBP.&#xD;

        Subjects seeking treatment for nonspecific LBP will be recruited by their treating&#xD;
        therapist, physiatrist, athletic trainer, or chiropractor then enrolled by a clinical&#xD;
        research coordinator (CRC). The CRC will assign study IDs and randomize clinical patients&#xD;
        into groups based on the each subject's selected treatment of choice. Care will be taken to&#xD;
        match subject distribution between groups based on demographics (sex and age), activity&#xD;
        level, and subjective pain scores. Lead investigators will remain blinded to group&#xD;
        assignments. Subjects will have to complete 2 screening evaluations prior to participation&#xD;
        in this study. The first screen will be that the treating physical therapist, physiatrist,&#xD;
        athletic trainer, or chiropractor will approve the patient for participation. The second&#xD;
        screen will consist of completing two basic activities on the Tonal at minimal weight&#xD;
        without being restricted by pain. The two activities will be 10 repetitions on each arm of&#xD;
        standing unilateral bicep curl and seated unilateral lateral pulldown. For both activities&#xD;
        Tonal resistance will be set at 5 pounds, which is the minimum resistance for the device.&#xD;
        This screen will affirm that the subject is capable of completing at least the minimum&#xD;
        level of workout provided by the Tonal.&#xD;
