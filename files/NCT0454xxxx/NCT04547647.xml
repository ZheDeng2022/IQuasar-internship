      1. Determine the prevalence of scoliosis and kyphosis among male adolescents in preparatory&#xD;
           and secondary governmental schools in El Kharga city.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify factors affecting aetiology and morphology of scoliosis and kyphosis among&#xD;
           male adolescents in governmental preparatory and secondary schools in El Kharga city.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the effect of scoliosis and kyphosis among male adolescents in governmental&#xD;
           preparatory and secondary schools in El Kharga city on related life style aspects.&#xD;

      The anterior and posterior curves of concavity are part of the physiological position of the&#xD;
      spinal column, and are represented by cervical lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis,&#xD;
      and new sacral and coccygeal kyphosis. Despite all these curves, the spinal column should&#xD;
      work mechanically as a straight and rigid axis to withstand stress, and should be&#xD;
      functionally flexible in order to allow movement. This mix of opposite behaviors (rigidness&#xD;
      and flexibility) is the result of a complex stabilization system formed by muscles that&#xD;
      contract and relax harmonically and absorb any impact exerted on the spinal column structure.&#xD;
      Biomechanically speaking, the spinal column influences and is influenced by positioning and&#xD;
      stress of the pelvic and scapular belts, and upper and lower limbs, respectively. Postural&#xD;
      deformities and alterations should not be evaluated only in terms of bone structure, but also&#xD;
      in terms of the functional assembly represented by the spinal column [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescence is a stage of fast physical development in which the nervous system and&#xD;
      musculoskeletal system have yet to fully develop. Changes in the physical morphology of the&#xD;
      spine are known to cause musculoskeletal system conditions, such as non-specific back pain.&#xD;
      Moreover, the spinal morphology as scoliosis and kyphosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With early identification and intervention, scoliosis may be prevented from progressing, so&#xD;
      that it does not interfere with mobility, activity or comfort. Scoliosis has a large&#xD;
      percentage that remains asymptomatic,[4] Therefore the feasibility of screening is worthwhile&#xD;
