  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is a rather common event during general surgery, with&#xD;
      variable incidence that ranges between 5 and 99% based on the definition used. It is&#xD;
      associated to significant complications including acute renal failure, myocardial damage,&#xD;
      stroke and overall increased mortality, reason why the prevention and the reduction of&#xD;
      hypotensive events through an appropriate proactive approach can potentially improve the&#xD;
      patient's outcome. The Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) is an algorithm derived from the&#xD;
      analysis of the arterial waveform and it is expressed as an absolute value from 0 to 100. It&#xD;
      has been demonstrated that the HPI is able to predict the occurrence of hypotensive events of&#xD;
      patients undergoing major surgery under general anesthesia, providing also a guide for the&#xD;
      appropriate treatment based on further calculated secondary hemodynamic variables that&#xD;
      estimate patient's preload, cardiac contractility and afterload. Aim of this prospective&#xD;
      randomized study is to compare the incidence of IOH during major gynecologic oncologic&#xD;
      surgery among two groups of patients receiving standard hemodynamic monitoring versus HPI&#xD;
      monitoring. The primary hypothesis is that hemodynamic management HPI-guided reduces the&#xD;
      incidence, entity and duration of intraoperative hypotensive events, defined as mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure (MAP) lower than 65 mmHg lasting more than one minute.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) represents a common event during general anesthesia (GA),&#xD;
      with an estimated incidence between 5% and 99%, according to definition adopted [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actually, a mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 65 mmHg is considered an appropriate&#xD;
      definition of IOH [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotension mainly occurs during anaesthesia due to three pathophysiological dysregulations:&#xD;
      hypovolemia and consecutively decreased cardiac output, myocardial depression and low&#xD;
      systemic vascular resistance [3]. IOH has been associated with postoperative acute acute&#xD;
      kidney injury and myocardial injury; it seems that the cumulative time spent in hypotension&#xD;
      increases the risk, and this has implications as even relatively short episodes of&#xD;
      hypotension that are treated promptly can over time reach accumulated hypotension time&#xD;
      associated with increased injury rates [4-7]. Therefore, anaesthetic management that aims to&#xD;
      prevent IOH using a &quot;pro-active&quot; treatment protocol might potentially reduce the amount and&#xD;
      severity of IOH, perioperative complications and mortality. In order to detect and treat&#xD;
      these haemodynamic alterations, advanced haemodynamic monitoring combined with a treatment&#xD;
      algorithm can be used [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) algorithm was recently established by Edwards&#xD;
      Lifesciences (Irvine, USA). Based on the Edward´s monitoring platform (HemoSphere), HPI is a&#xD;
      monitoring tool which aims to predict IOH up to 15 min before its onset [9, 10]. HPI is a&#xD;
      unitless number that ranges from 1 to 100, and as the number increases, the risk of an event&#xD;
      occurring in the future increases. The HPI was developed using machine learning methods and&#xD;
      is a data-driven model developed from over 200,000 hypotensive patient events and it predicts&#xD;
      upcoming hypotensive events based on features of the arterial pressure waveform [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      When HPI rises over 85, the monitor Hemosphere provides a secondary screen showing the&#xD;
      following hemodynamic parameters: stroke volume variation (SVV) as indicator of fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness - preload, radial dP/dtmax as indicator of cardiac contractility, and dynamic&#xD;
      elastance (Eadyn) as dynamic indicator of resistance - afterload. Hemodynamic variables,&#xD;
      hemodynamic diagnostic guidance and the definition of a treatment protocol, should allow for&#xD;
      determination and treatment of the underlying cause of the impending hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using an early warning system to predict hypotension does not necessarily lead to reduce&#xD;
      hypotension. There are few randomized clinical trials to investigate the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      use of HPI in reducing the amount of hypotension as measured by time-weighted average [11]&#xD;
      during major noncardiac surgery [3, 12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be allocated in one of the two groups of the study according to a&#xD;
      computerized randomization form (ww.randomization.com). Once the patient arrives in the&#xD;
      premedication hall of the operating room, a peripheral intravenous access will be placed.&#xD;
      Based on the patient's allocation group, the following hemodynamic monitoring will be&#xD;
      started:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C - Control: through the EV1000 monitor (with Flotrac sensor)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group HPI - Proactive: through the HemoSphere platform (with Acumen Flotrac sensor)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following timepoints will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T0: Machine calibration on the bed in neutral position, recordings of the parameters with&#xD;
      annotation of the baseline MAP; T1: Infusion of RLS at 3ml/kg/h as in standard clinical&#xD;
      practice; T2: cannulation of the radial artery under local anesthesia before induction of&#xD;
      general anesthesia, as in normal standard clinical practice; T3: performance of neuraxial&#xD;
      anesthesia if needed; T4: standard induction of general anesthesia GA) with propofol,&#xD;
      sufentanil and rocuronium bromide; maintenance of GA with sevoflurane and sufentanil; T5:&#xD;
      differentiated hemodynamic management based on the patient's allocation group; T6: surgery&#xD;
      under continuous monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C: Standard Protocol In group C the hemodynamic management will be performed based on&#xD;
      cardiac optimization. Fluid boluses will be given with the use of an individualized&#xD;
      goal-directed therapy (GDT) protocol aiming to optimize stroke volume index (SVI) [13].&#xD;
      Patients will receive 250 ml fluid challenges, within duration of 5 minutes, with a RL&#xD;
      solution. Fluid responsiveness will be defined as a SVI increase ≥10%. Maximal stroke volume&#xD;
      will be defined as the absence of a sustained rise in SVI of at least 10% sustained for 20&#xD;
      minutes or more in response to a fluid challenge. No more than 500 ml of fluid will be&#xD;
      administered for initial determination of the maximal value of SVI before start of the&#xD;
      surgical procedure. Once the maximal value of SVI will be determined after induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia, SVI must be maintained throughout the intervention period with subsequent boluses&#xD;
      of fluids as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the treatment of eventual hypotensive episodes, etilephrine or efedrine will be used,&#xD;
      depending on the clinical situation. If needed, continuous infusion of noradrenaline and/or&#xD;
      other vasopressors or inotropes will be started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the hemodynamic parameters detected with the EV1000 monitor and the measures adopted&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group HPI: Proactive Protocol In case of HPI&gt;85, hypotension will be prevented according to&#xD;
      the following modalities. The first step will be the optimization of SVV (in case of SVV&gt;13%)&#xD;
      with bolus of 250 ml RLS. In case of dP/dtmax &lt; 400 (or in decreasing trend) dobutamine&#xD;
      infusion 2.5 - 5 mcg/Kg/min will be started. In case of Eadyn &lt; 0,9 norepinephrine infusion&#xD;
      0,1 mcg/kg/min will be started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the data relative to the hemodynamic monitoring and the measures adopted will be&#xD;
      recorded and subsequently analyzed to compare the incidence and duration of the hypotensive&#xD;
      events in the 2 groups. To calculate the entity of the intraoperative hypotension the&#xD;
      following technique will be used: after removal of artifacts, the TWA MAP (time weighted&#xD;
      average mean arterial pressure) &lt;65mmHg will be represented by the area between the threshold&#xD;
      of 65 mmHg and the curve of the measured MAP, divided by the total recorded time in minutes&#xD;
      [12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical plan The data will be described in their demographic and clinical characteristics&#xD;
      through the application of descriptive statistics. The qualitative variables will be&#xD;
      described using tables of absolute frequencies and percentages; the continuous quantitative&#xD;
      variables will be presented as a median and interquartile range or as a mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation when normally distributed; while the non-normal variables will be presented as&#xD;
      minimum, maximum and median values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the two groups of patients, the hypertensive events, defined as a MAP lower than 65mmHg&#xD;
      for &gt; 1 minute (and the severe hypotensive events as having a MAP lower than 60 and 55 mmHg),&#xD;
      will be analyzed in terms of frequency and absolute duration and, to estimate their severity,&#xD;
      as the ratio between the area under the 65 mmHg threshold and the total length, expressed in&#xD;
      minutes, of intraoperative monitoring using the TWA-MAP method. The Chi-squared test will be&#xD;
      used to compare the two incidences. The t-student test for independent samples will be used&#xD;
      to evaluate statistically significant differences among the patients' demographic and&#xD;
      anthropometric characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Shapiro-Wilk test will be used to assess the normality of data distribution, while the sd&#xD;
      test will be used to verify the equality of the variance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mann-Whitney test will be used for independent samples to compare the data that are not&#xD;
      normally distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the assessment of the secondary outcomes, the investigators will report the&#xD;
      relative risks with 95% confidence intervals and p-values based on either the chi square or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test, as more appropriate according to the frequencies expected and detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A p-value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All of the analysis will be&#xD;
      performed through the STATA IC 15.1 (Stata Corp) for Windows, Microsoft Excel, Matlab (The&#xD;
      MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) and the Acumen Analytics software (Edwards Lifesciences,&#xD;
      Irvine, CA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size International literature agrees to consider clinically significant a reduction of&#xD;
      75% of the hypotensive events in terms of entity and duration. According to one of our&#xD;
      internal databases (data not yet published), the mean TWA-MAP during gynecological oncology&#xD;
      surgery is 0,5 mmHg. Thus, the estimated mean difference between the two groups according to&#xD;
      the sample size calculations results to be 0.38 mmHg. Based on the previous clinical trials&#xD;
      11,12 the TWA-MAP standard deviation is estimated to be 0.51 mmHg. Dividing the mean&#xD;
      difference by the standard deviation, the resulting dimension has a size effect of 0.74. The&#xD;
      investigators calculated that a sample of 60 patients, 30 for each group, has 80% ability of&#xD;
      discriminating such effect (t-test with α of 0.05).&#xD;
