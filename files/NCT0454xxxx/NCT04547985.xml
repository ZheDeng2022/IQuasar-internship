      This is a study to see how effective oral naltrexone is as treatment for prolonged grief&#xD;
      disorder (PGD). Participants will take their assigned medication for 8 weeks, with monthly&#xD;
      visits to assess symptom severity, social connectedness, and adverse reactions.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Prolonged Grief Disorder symptom severity as assessed by Prolonged Grief-13 (PG-13)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly for 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in PGD symptom severity will be measured by using Prolonged Grief-13 (PG-13), a self-rated scale consisting of 11 items. For this study, we have added an additional item inquiring about loneliness to be congruent with DSM criteria and SCIP. This 5-point Likert-type of measurement tool evaluates the intensity and severity of the PGD. The validity and reliability of the PG-13 was tested and validated in previous studies.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Prolonged Grief Disorder severity as assessed by Structured Clinical Interview for PGD (SCIP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 4 weeks for 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Eligibility for the study and change in symptom severity will be measured by SCIP. This structured clinical interview is adapted to the DSM-5-TR criteria for PGD. Interviewers will be trained to standard which will be a κ &gt; 0.8 agreement between trainee and trainer.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in strength of subjectively perceived closeness of a social relationship as measured by the Inclusion of the other in the Self (IOS) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 4 weeks for 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The IOS is a self-reported pictorial tool use to measure the subjectively perceived closeness of a relationship. The tool asks respondents to select one of seven pairs of increasingly overlapping circles that best represents their relationship with another, with more overlap signifying a closer relationship. This scale possesses good reliability, with (α = .93) for the entire sample, (α = .87) for family, (α = .92) for friendship, and (α = .95) for romantic relationships. Test-retest reliability shows similar findings, with (α = .83) for the entire sample, (α = .85) for family, (α = .86) for friendship, and (α = .85) for romantic relationships.</description>
