  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare two manual therapy techniques. By testing if the Pressure&#xD;
      Release of Myofascial Trigger Points technique (PRM) is more effective in treating Myofascial&#xD;
      Trigger Points present in the upper trapezius muscle of patients with mechanical cervical&#xD;
      pain. This will be compared mainly with another manual therapy technique that presents&#xD;
      evidences such as Ischemic Pressure technique (IP), and a control group, through the&#xD;
      evaluation of the Visual Analogical Scale (VAS), the Threshold of Pain at Pressure (TPP) and&#xD;
      the Northwick Park Questionnaire (NPC) of neck disability, spanish version.&#xD;

      The present pilot study is proposed as a crossover, controlled and randomized clinical trial,&#xD;
      with blinded evaluation of response variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to test whether the Pressure Release of Myofascial Trigger Points&#xD;
      technique(PRM) is effective in treating Myofascial Trigger Points present in the upper&#xD;
      trapezius muscle of patients with mechanical cervical pain. This will be compared mainly with&#xD;
      another manual technique that presents more evidence such as Ischemic Pressure (IP), through&#xD;
      the evaluation of the Visual Analogical Scale (VAS), the Threshold of Pain at Pressure (TPP)&#xD;
      and the Northwick Park Questionnaire (NPC) of neck disability, Spanish version.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients, with a minimum sample for the pilot study of 30 subjects, of working age (18-50&#xD;
      years) with mechanical neck pain for at least the last month, will be recruited from the&#xD;
      clinic &quot;Fisioterapia Los Molinos&quot; in the town of Getafe, the same place where the treatment&#xD;
      will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be randomly divided into three groups: one will be given Pressure Release of&#xD;
      Myofascial Trigger Points technique (PRM), another Ischemic Pressure technique (IP), and a&#xD;
      last one will be assigned as a control group. In compliance with the corresponding ethical&#xD;
      criteria, the three groups will be subjected to random crossover so that no patient is left&#xD;
      untreated. Visual Analogical Scale (VAS), Threshold of Pain at Pressure (TPP) and Northwick&#xD;
      Park Questionnaire (NPC) of neck disability (spanish version), will be evaluated before and&#xD;
      immediately after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed by IBM SPSS v22.0 program or a later version,&#xD;
      verifying that the sample meets the criteria of normality and homogeneity and comparing the&#xD;
      results of the variables through an ANOVA Analysis of variance.&#xD;

    <description>Evaluated with a pressure algometer. It will be assessed with the subject in a comfortable position, back supported by the backrest, feet on the floor and arms relaxed. The algometer will be placed perpendicular to the previously marked Miofascial Trigger Point. Once it is in place, the pressure should be increased one kilogram by second until the patient begins to feel discomfort.&#xD;
At this point the application will be stopped. Three measurements were made and the average will be calculated. Measured by Kilograms per square centimeter</description>
