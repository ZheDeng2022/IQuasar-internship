  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use polysomnography, alongside other methodologies such as questionnaires,&#xD;
      actigraphic measurements and salivary melatonin samples used in previous studies to&#xD;
      investigate sleep quality in patients with localized, locally advanced or metastatic hormone&#xD;
      sensitive prostate cancer. The measurements will be taken before treatment is initiated, at&#xD;
      six months and some measures again at twelve months.The groups, defined by prostate cancer&#xD;
      type and whether or not treatment includes ADT, will be compared to see if there are&#xD;
      differences in the prevalence of the lowered sleep quality in the groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main outcomes of this pilot study can be summarised as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using a previously unused methodology to assess whether ADT may negatively affect&#xD;
           patterns of sleep quality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identifying sleep micro/macrostructure changes in prostate cancer patients receiving ADT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparing the novel methodology with results obtained previously through standard&#xD;
           methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Providing statistical underpinnings, such as sample size calculations, for a full&#xD;
           interventional trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Highlighting the most appropriate non-pharmaceutical interventions to be tested in the&#xD;
           full interventional trial&#xD;

    <description>The two groups considered will be group A1, and group A2. This will demonstrate whether there is a difference in sleep quality between these two groups of patients. The difference between time points will establish correlation between treatment initiation and symptom onset, the between group analysis will test whether the link seems to be radiotherapy alone or whether ADT further decreases sleep quality</description>
