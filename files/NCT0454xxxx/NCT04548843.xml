  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objectives are to evaluate the safety of a single intravenous (IV) infusion of&#xD;
      autologous CD34+ cells enriched with placenta-derived allogeneic mitochondria in participant&#xD;
      with primary mitochondrial disease associated with mitochondrial DNA mutations or deletions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 participants aged from 4 to 18 years old on the day of screening visit with primary&#xD;
      mitochondrial disease associated with mitochondrial DNA mutations or deletions will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MNV-BM-PLC is a personalized cell therapy based on autologous patient-derived Hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) enriched with mitochondria isolated from healthy placenta&#xD;
      obtained from donors during C-section. Healthy mitochondria are employed, ex-vivo, to enrich&#xD;
      the patient's CD34+ peripheral blood cells, followed by infusion of the mitochondrial&#xD;
      enriched cells back to the patient. This therapeutic process of mitochondrial augmentation&#xD;
      provides the patient with healthy mitochondria carrying non-mutated/deleted mtDNA that can&#xD;
      supplement mitochondrial functionality in the patient's cells.&#xD;

Cohort 1: 3 patients will be administrated with Dose 1 The dosing interval between patients will be at minimum 2 weeks. Two (2) weeks after the 3rd patient has received MNV-BM-PLC, the Data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will convene to review accumulated safety data. The DSMB will make a recommendation whether to proceed with the 4th patient administration.&#xD;
Cohort 2: 3 patients will be administrated with Dose 2 The dosing interval between patients will be at minimum 2 weeks.</intervention_model_description>
