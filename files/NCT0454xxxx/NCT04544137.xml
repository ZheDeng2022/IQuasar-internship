  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot trial is designed to test the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of offering&#xD;
      the BOKS program, an evidence-based physical activity curriculum that engages school-age&#xD;
      children in moderate to vigorous physical activity for one hour daily, alongside the USDA's&#xD;
      Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) during the summer. Eighty children, ages 6-12 years and&#xD;
      from low-income households, will be randomized to participate in the BOKS + SFSP program or&#xD;
      to the SFSP alone. We anticipate that the BOKS program will not only provide increased&#xD;
      physical activity for the participants, but that it will help to promote participation in the&#xD;
      SFSP given that it will be offered in the same location directly before the SFSP lunches are&#xD;
      served.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Youth from low-resource communities are disproportionately affected by childhood obesity,&#xD;
      independent of race and ethnicity. A time of particular vulnerability for excess weight gain&#xD;
      in low-income youth is the summer. Findings from three separate low-income populations show&#xD;
      that BMI z-scores (BMIz) decrease during the school year and increase during the summer in&#xD;
      this population. To address this and aid in national obesity prevention efforts, the&#xD;
      Institute of Medicine and the White House Task Force on Childhood Obesity recommend increased&#xD;
      access to the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), a federally-funded program that provides a&#xD;
      free, healthy lunch meal to youth during the summer. However, participation in the SFSP is&#xD;
      low. Based on qualitative work with families from low-income communities, this pilot trial is&#xD;
      designed to test the acceptability and and preliminary efficacy of the BOKS program, an&#xD;
      evidence-based physical activity curriculum that engages school-age children in moderate to&#xD;
      vigorous physical activity for one hour daily, when offered alongside the USDA's Summer Food&#xD;
      Service Program during the summer. Specifically, 80 children, ages 6-12 years and from&#xD;
      low-income households, will be randomized to participate in the BOKS + SFSP program or to the&#xD;
      SFSP alone. To test acceptability of the combined program versus the SFSP alone, we will&#xD;
      compare SFSP participation (attendance) across groups. Additionally, we will examine physical&#xD;
      fitness levels in both groups to determine if participation in the BOKS program prevents the&#xD;
      loss of fitness gains achieved during the school year.&#xD;

    <description>BOKS is an evidence-based physical activity program developed by Reebok to get kids active and establish a lifelong commitment to health and fitness. It was originally developed and tested as a 12-week program offered before or after school. In the present study, BOKS will be offered four days per week for eight weeks over the summer at a public park in one low-income community. The program will run one-hour prior to lunch service by the USDA's Summer Food Service Program. The BOKS curriculum includes lesson plans for 40-45 minute classes that follow the same daily format and focus on a functional fitness skill of the week (squat, plank, push up, etc) and engage participants in team-oriented games.</description>
