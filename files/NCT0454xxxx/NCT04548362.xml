      This cross-over meal study is a four-way intervention with 12 volunteers randomized at the&#xD;
      same time to four meals with fried meats (beef, pork, chicken and amino-acid matched non-meat&#xD;
      control) and to four meals with potato products (boiled, chips, fries, and a control with&#xD;
      boiled white rice) to search for biomarkers of intake.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a two-dimensional, cross-over meal study, 12 healthy volunteers consumed in a randomized&#xD;
      sequence four test meals: chicken, pork, beef, and a control made of egg white and pea. At&#xD;
      the same time they were independently randomized to four starchy foods to be consumed&#xD;
      together with the meats: boiled potatoes, fried potatoes, potato crisps or boiled white rice.&#xD;
      Fasting and postprandial urine samples were collected to cover 48 h after each meal and&#xD;
      samples were profiled by untargeted LC-ESI-qTOF-MS metabolomics. The profiles following the&#xD;
      meal challenges were explored by univariate and multivariate analyses and single and combined&#xD;
      markers of intake identified chemically by MS/MS fragmentation experiments and statistically&#xD;
      by ROC curves and error rates as well as FDR statistics.&#xD;
