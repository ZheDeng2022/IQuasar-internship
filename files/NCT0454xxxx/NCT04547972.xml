  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When you perform weightlifting, your body makes new proteins within your muscle. These new&#xD;
      proteins can increase the size of the fibers within your muscle to make your muscle larger, a&#xD;
      process called hypertrophy. The common convention surrounding gains in muscle mass and&#xD;
      strength are that higher-loads (i.e. heavier weights) used for fewer repetitions are better&#xD;
      for increasing strength and lower-loads (i.e. lighter weights) used for higher repetitions&#xD;
      are better for increasing muscle mass. However, recent research has found that when higher-&#xD;
      and lower-loads are used when participants exercise until volitional fatigue (i.e. cannot&#xD;
      perform another repetition), muscle mass and strength increases are similar regardless of&#xD;
      using a higher- or lower-load. Many of these studies have examined this effect in males with&#xD;
      fewer studies examining the effects of higher- and lower-load training in females when&#xD;
      assessing changes in muscle mass, strength, and muscle endurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, it has been shown that there is substantial individual variation in response to&#xD;
      resistance exercise training where individuals can be broadly categorized as higher- or&#xD;
      lower-responders to resistance exercise training. This study aims to explore how the muscle&#xD;
      mass, strength, and muscle endurance of females are impacted by both higher- and lower-loads&#xD;
      while also exploring how individuals may respond to the training interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a total of 12 weeks in total duration. Weeks 1 and 12 will include testing&#xD;
      assessments of skeletal muscle mass, muscle strength, and muscle endurance. Weeks 2-11 will&#xD;
      be comprised of the resistance training intervention wherein participants will train thrice&#xD;
      weekly at the Chan Gunn Pavilion research laboratory at the University of British Columbia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance training sessions will include unilateral knee extensions and unilateral dumbbell&#xD;
      bicep preacher curls with each being performed for three sets. Limbs assigned to train with&#xD;
      higher-loads will perform between 8-12 repetitions per set and limbs assigned to train with&#xD;
      lower-loads will perform between 20-25 repetitions per set. Participants will rest 90 seconds&#xD;
      between sets and 120 seconds between exercises. Each exercise will be performed in its&#xD;
      entirety before moving on to the next.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also be supplemented with whey protein which will be ingested twice daily&#xD;
      during the resistance training phase.&#xD;
