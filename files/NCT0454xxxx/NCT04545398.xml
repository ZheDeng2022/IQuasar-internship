      Introduction: Protein rich foods that are alternatives to farm-grown meat have received&#xD;
      considerable consumer attention. Whilst meat alternatives were once niche food products aimed&#xD;
      at vegetarians, they are increasingly marketed to omnivores and &quot;flexitarians&quot;, thus&#xD;
      contributing to a trend for reductions in red meat intakes [1]. Studies to date have&#xD;
      addressed the environmental benefit, plus consumer perceptions and acceptability of meat&#xD;
      alternatives [2, 3, 4], yet there is surprisingly a paucity of data compared the nutritional&#xD;
      and digestive differences to meat. The aim of this trial is to compare the digestive&#xD;
      consequences of pasture-fed and grain-finished, beef versus a plant-based meat analogue&#xD;
      blinded meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analyses: Healthy, young (20-34 y) participants will be asked to consume three&#xD;
      separate meals in a crossover, blinded investigation followed by five hours of blood testing&#xD;
      and questionnaires to assess the digestive consequences of meat and a plant-based meat&#xD;
      analogue. The three meals will include either pasture-fed, or grain-finished, or laboratory&#xD;
      based protein alternative as a mixed meal, in random order, separated by one week minimum.&#xD;
      Plasma samples will be assessed amino acid content, neurotransmitter proteins, chylomicron&#xD;
      fatty acid distribution and general health indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and dissemination: The trial has been granted ethical approval by the Ministry of&#xD;
      Health, Health and Disability Ethics Committee (Ref: 19/STH/226). All results originating&#xD;
      from this study will be submitted for publication in scientific journals and presented at&#xD;
      meetings.&#xD;

      Introduction: Red meat consumption contributes important nutrients to the diet, including&#xD;
      essential amino acids, long chain and complex lipids, vitamins (including B12) and minerals&#xD;
      (including iron and zinc) [5]. While supplying these important nutrients, red meat may&#xD;
      contain components which may negate optimal health such as the saturated fat content and&#xD;
      nitrates, that are added during processing [5]. The degree to which red meat affects health&#xD;
      is likely related to its inherent nutritional profile, the quantity consumed and any&#xD;
      processing (e.g. nitrates or cooking techniques). Regardless, the simple notion of a complex&#xD;
      whole-food containing single nutrients which are 'good' or 'bad' for health is now considered&#xD;
      overly simplistic [6]. For example, to reduce heart disease, nutritional guidelines now&#xD;
      suggest an increase in polyunsaturated fats at the expense of saturated fat, rather than a&#xD;
      complete reduction of all fats [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alongside the controversy over the health consequences of red meat, recent attention has&#xD;
      focused on the possibility of using &quot;plant-based&quot; proteins as an alternative to red meat&#xD;
      consumption. The search for meat alternatives has resulted in a sharp increase in the&#xD;
      production of novel &quot;plant-based&quot; meat analogues that have been designed to replicate the&#xD;
      taste and eating experience of red-meat. To date there are very few studies addressing the&#xD;
      nutritional differences between traditional red meat and plant-based meat analogues, and the&#xD;
      nutritional differences that arise due to different production systems. Given the nutritional&#xD;
      composition of red meat is likely to be influenced by the farming and feeding practices of&#xD;
      the animals, production procedures and end-user cooking techniques [7], these differences&#xD;
      need to be accounted for in the research design and application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To investigate the digestive responses to an acute intake of pasture-fed beef,&#xD;
      grain-finished beef, lamb and a plant based meat-analogue consumed as a component of a mixed&#xD;
      meal. This study is part of a larger programme to understand the nutritional implications of&#xD;
      consuming New Zealand, pasture-fed red meat as part of a balanced diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Setting: The study is designed as randomised cross-over trial to capture&#xD;
      biological difference in postprandial nutrient dynamics. Research subjects will act as their&#xD;
      own controls and will consume each meal (pasture raised, grain-fed beef, lamb and a meat&#xD;
      alternative meal) on a separate occasion in random order. The study compares exemplars of&#xD;
      pasture-fed New Zealand beef, grain-finished New Zealand beef, lamb and a meat analogue. The&#xD;
      plant-based meat analogue has been selected on the basis of its macronutrient profile&#xD;
      (protein and fat) and appearance in order to that best matches that of meat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The digestion and metabolism of key nutrients in beef will be measured immediately after the&#xD;
      ingestion of a single meal. This experimental setting will also be used to examine some&#xD;
      subjective qualities of the meal experience, such as satisfaction score (i.e., liking,&#xD;
      satisfaction, enjoyment, satiety, appetite) and gastrointestinal score (i.e., comfort,&#xD;
      fullness, bloating, rumbling, flatulence, faecal urgency, diarrhoea).&#xD;
