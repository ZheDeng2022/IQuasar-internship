  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to determine if the transfusion of one unit of red blood cells to&#xD;
      anemic oncology patients results in comparable numbers of transfusion episodes when compared&#xD;
      to transfusion of two units of red blood cells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The aim of this trial is to determine if administration of one unit of red blood cells to&#xD;
      anemic oncology patients is non-inferior to the administration of two units of red blood&#xD;
      cells in terms of the number of annual transfusion episodes. If demonstrated, our findings&#xD;
      will cut the total transfusion episode time in half and avoid exposure to an additional unit&#xD;
      of red blood cells while freeing up scarce hospital resources.&#xD;
