      This is a prospective data recording study, all patients will receive standard medical care&#xD;
      and no experimental interventions will be performed. All patients scheduled to undergo&#xD;
      esophageal ESD from December 2018 to December 2021 as medically indicated will be considered&#xD;
      for the study, Patients in whom esophageal ESD is considered as part of their standard&#xD;
      medical care will be offered to participate in this study. The principle investigator who&#xD;
      performing the procedure will also discuss the study with the subjects and ask them to sign a&#xD;
      consent. If the patient agrees to participate, he/she will be given the informed consent form&#xD;
      and allowed enough time to read it. Then if the patient agrees, he/she will sign the consent&#xD;
      form. Data will be prospectively recorded according to the data collection form.&#xD;

      Early precancerous esophageal lesions and esophageal cancer, are a threatening illnesses with&#xD;
      high mortality rate, so the early intervention is critical during the course of treatment,&#xD;
      statistically, every year an estimated 17,290 adults in the United States will be diagnosed&#xD;
      with esophageal cancer. Esophageal cancer is the seventh most common cause of cancer death&#xD;
      among men (1, 2). Giving the aggressive nature and fatality of esophageal cancer, the early&#xD;
      management using the Endoscopic submucosal dissection is very essential (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal ESD is a technique that grants the en-block resection of lesions, with less&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality when compared to surgery, and more efficient than other endoscopic&#xD;
      techniques like endoscopic mucosal resection as ESD associated with higher curative resection&#xD;
      rates and lower recurrence rates (4). ESD require experience and excellent training due to&#xD;
      technique difficulties, longer procedure times and possible serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The esophageal Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is gaining momentum in United States.&#xD;
      Although a great deal of training is focused on teaching how to utilize the equipment for&#xD;
      performing the procedure, the strategy of where to start the incision and how to proceed with&#xD;
      dissection is not yet standardized. The investigators standardized a technique for performing&#xD;
      esophageal ESD utilizing gravity as traction to expedite the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the investigators are performing this technique for esophageal ESD at Baylor St.&#xD;
      Luke's Medical center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the mean time needed to perform esophageal ESD using this&#xD;
      technique. Our quality metrics are a dissection rate of 9cm2 per hour as suggested by&#xD;
      Japanese experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose and objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Assessing the mean time needed to perform esophageal ESD using this technique. Our&#xD;
           quality metrics are a dissection rate of 9cm2 per hour as suggested by Japanese experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Assessment of the safety of gravity assisted esophageal ESD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining the informed consent, the following information will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - All the incisional times and the submucosal dissection time (details listed below)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Demographic information related to the study participants (age, sex, race, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - BMI&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - Family History&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. - The pathology reports for ESD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. - Social habits such as smoking and drinking alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will collect the time that will be spent during this technique as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Lower incision time (anal side): this is the initial incision and will start at the&#xD;
           anal side of the lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Right and left incisional time, these incisions will be on the each side of the lesion&#xD;
           and they will meet the initial incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - The proximal incision time (oral side): is performed at the oral side of the lesion&#xD;
           communicating the right and left side incisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - Total incision time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. - Total submucosal dissection time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. - Total procedure time&#xD;
