  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mitochondrial diseases (MDs) are the commonest group of inborn errors resulting from primary&#xD;
      dysfunction of mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC). High phenolics-containing extra-virgin&#xD;
      olive oil (EVOO) can be one of the potential dietary supplements for the treatment of MD.&#xD;
      Previous reports demonstrated that phenolics including oleuropein, oleocanthal,&#xD;
      hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol found in EVOO have strong antioxidant properties against the&#xD;
      oxidative stress in brain tissue and showed a protective effect on mitochondria by restoring&#xD;
      mitochondrial enzymatic activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed study is an open-label pilot/ feasibility clinical trial using extra-virgin&#xD;
      olive oil (EVOO) as dietary supplements in a cohort of 12 MD patients recruited from the Hong&#xD;
      Kong Children's Hospital (HKCH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to explore the longitudinal effect of receiving EVOO as dietary supplements&#xD;
      over a 12-month period and the change on a 6-month period after withdrawal. The applicability&#xD;
      of the outcome measures will be evaluated in the current trial for future clinical studies&#xD;
      and obtain relevant data for the next phase of the clinical trial on EVOO efficacy. Besides,&#xD;
      the tolerability of EVOO in MD patients will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the functional assessment of the patient's clinical outcomes&#xD;
      by International Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Score (IPMDS). Secondary outcome measures&#xD;
      included the measurement of biochemical and radiological parameters. Besides, tolerability&#xD;
      and quality of life of the subjects will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant data including the feasibility of subject recruitment, withdrawal rate, feasibility&#xD;
      of data collection of outcome measures, longitudinal effect of EVOO on the outcome measures&#xD;
      in the trial can be collected and analysed in this pilot study providing important&#xD;
      information for the future clinical trials. The ultimate goal is to develop effective&#xD;
      therapies to lower mortality, improve the clinical outcomes and quality of life in MD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High phenolics-containing extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) can be one of the potential dietary&#xD;
      supplements for the treatment of MD. There is growing evidence to suggest that daily&#xD;
      consumption of EVOO in Mediterranean diets have beneficial effects on preventing&#xD;
      neurodegeneration. Previous reports demonstrated that phenolics including oleuropein,&#xD;
      oleocanthal, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol found in EVOO have strong antioxidant properties&#xD;
      against the oxidative stress in brain tissue and protective effect on both acute and chronic&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases by in vitro study and animal models. In addition to improvement of&#xD;
      arsenic-induced oxidative stress by oleuropein or hydroxytyrosol treatment, hydroxytyrosol&#xD;
      also showed a protective effect on mitochondria by restoring mitochondrial enzymatic&#xD;
      activities in rat brain. In vitro study also demonstrated the stimulatory effect of&#xD;
      hydroxytyrosol on mitochondrial function including in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes and human&#xD;
      endothelial cells. A recent reported clinical study showed that consumption of olive oil&#xD;
      could increase mitochondrial membrane fluidity and ATPase activity in patients with&#xD;
      relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, a neurodegenerative disease associated with&#xD;
      mitochondrial dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitochondrial diseases (MDs) are the commonest group of inborn errors with a minimal&#xD;
      prevalence of 12.5 per 100,000 and 4.7 per 100,000 adults and children respectively. These&#xD;
      diseases are resulted from primary dysfunction of mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) which&#xD;
      is mostly caused by both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA defects. They are progressive,&#xD;
      multisystem disorders that can affect many parts of the body including brain, nerve, muscle,&#xD;
      kidney, heart, liver, eyes, ears or pancreas and some are devastating or even life&#xD;
      threatening. Development of effective treatments for the patients is an unmet need until now.&#xD;
      Effective treatment strategies and clinical trials are limited, and therapies are mostly&#xD;
      palliative. Drug developments and clinical trials for these diseases are scarce in Hong Kong&#xD;
      when compared with other countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MDs are extremely heterogeneous phenotypically and genetically with the biochemical&#xD;
      dysfunction and pathogenic mechanisms being unique in each individual molecular defect. With&#xD;
      the advance in next generation sequencing, over 300 mitochondrial genes are implicated to&#xD;
      cause human diseases. This wide heterogeneity has been hindering the development of new&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies such as gene therapy which requires long term evaluation and&#xD;
      substantial manipulation to improve efficacy and reduce toxicity risk. It is therefore not&#xD;
      efficient nor realistic to develop unique therapy targeting at a specific molecular defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The future pharmaceutical development for treating mitochondrial dysfunctions will focus on&#xD;
      boosting the residual mitochondrial function by non-specific bypassing the defective&#xD;
      components of MRC or improving the aberrant cellular consequences. Dietary supplements were&#xD;
      demonstrated to treat MD owing to their roles as metabolic cofactors to ameliorate&#xD;
      mitochondrial ATP production, bypass mitochondrial complex defects and remove toxic&#xD;
      metabolites. However, there are few randomized controlled trials to assess the cause-effect&#xD;
      relationship of these dietary supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a feasibility clinical trial to explore the longitudinal effect of&#xD;
      receiving EVOO as dietary supplements on primary and secondary outcomes (clinical,&#xD;
      biochemical and radiological parameters and quality of life) and tolerability in MD patients&#xD;
      in Hong Kong. The investigators aim to obtain relevant data to determine the sample size and&#xD;
      treatment duration for the next phase of the clinical trial on EVOO efficacy. Another aim of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the applicability of the outcome measures in the current study for&#xD;
      future clinical trials on different treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will be a longitudinal, open label study. Twelve subjects will be recruited,&#xD;
      including MD patients with confirmed MD-associated nuclear DNA or mtDNA mutations, from the&#xD;
      Hong Kong Children's Hospital (HKCH). Subjects will receive EVOO daily as dietary supplements&#xD;
      for 12 months. After that, patients will be randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio to either continue&#xD;
      on or withdraw from receiving EVOO as their dietary supplements for another 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EVOO will be given according to the total energy requirement of the subjects. The target&#xD;
      energy uptake for MD patients from fat will be higher than healthy individuals and the&#xD;
      percentage of energy uptake from fat for all the subjects in this trial will be fixed to 55%.&#xD;
      Among the 55% energy from fat, 30% will be from natural food, ~31% from cooking and 39% from&#xD;
      EVOO as supplements in our trial. The amount of EVOO consumed daily by all the subjects will&#xD;
      be calculated according to the energy requirement of their ages. The willingness of the&#xD;
      participants to stay in the trial in terms of the percentage of participants completing the&#xD;
      whole trial on EVOO dietary supplement will be assessed. The withdrawal rate in different&#xD;
      study periods and the reasons of withdrawal will be further studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will visit the trial site at different time points after the start of dietary&#xD;
      supplements for clinical follow up, functional assessment including questionnaire, blood and&#xD;
      urine sampling and neuroimaging as primary and secondary outcome measures. There will be more&#xD;
      frequent follow-up and monitoring after initiation and withdrawal of supplements. Data of&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcome measures (except radiological evaluation) will be collected&#xD;
      before the trial as baseline, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3, 6, 9, 12 months after the commencement of&#xD;
      the trial and 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months after randomization. The investigators will&#xD;
      examine the feasibility of collecting data on the primary and secondary outcome measures in a&#xD;
      clinical trial condition. The amount of missing data, the reason for the missing and&#xD;
      difficulties on those data collection will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An open label trial is used for this proposed study because a matching placebo with the same&#xD;
      properties, such as taste, smell, colour, etc, as EVOO to keep blindness is not yet developed&#xD;
      at this moment. Therefore, a withdrawal design will be used even though this can be a&#xD;
      limitation of this study because of the easy accessibility of EVOO by the patients who can&#xD;
      continue to use EVOO on their own after being assigned for withdrawal, which may potentially&#xD;
      affect the outcome. Information on any deviation from the study protocol on this issue can be&#xD;
      collected from the patients by questionnaires at the end of the study to guide the data&#xD;
      analysis and interpretation.&#xD;

    <description>International Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Score was previously established by Radboud Centre for Mitochondrial Medicine to monitor symptoms and signs of disease progression in MD patients aged from 1-18 years old. This scale was suggested to be a robust tool for the follow-up of children with MD and aimed for the purpose in clinical trials. International Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Score consists of 61 items in 3 domains (Domain 1, 2 and 3). Domain 1 has 23 items providing the detailed insights into subjective complaints and symptoms which should be assessed by interviewing parents or caregivers. Domain 2 consists of 25 items assessed by physical examination. Domain 3 has 13 items of functional assessment obtained by physical/motor function evaluation. Minimum value of raw score is 0 and maximum value is 243. Lower score means better clinical status.</description>

    <description>The measurement model the investigators will use will be the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory version 4.0 generic core scale for the measurement of health-related quality of life in children and adolescents who are healthy or with acute and chronic health condition. Paediatric Quality Of Life assessment consists of 5 versions of the same questionnaire for various age ranges: a) toddler version for 2-4 year old; b) young child version for 5-7 years old; c) child version for 8-12 years old; d) adolescent version for 13-18 years old; e) young adult version for 18-23 years old. Each of the versions has a parent version for proxy report and child version for self-report (except for the toddler version). Each version is composed of 23 items with 4 scales (physical, emotional, social and school functioning) and 3 summary scores (total, physical health summary, psychosocial health summary score). The scale scores ranged from 0-100 and higher score indicates better quality of life.</description>
