  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this voluntary research study is to evaluate the extent to which infants with&#xD;
      Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER) exhibit oxygen desaturation (low oxygen levels in their blood)&#xD;
      and bradycardia (slow heart rate) in supine (lying flat on back) and inclined positions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mothers will bring their infants to the Clinical Research Center where they will be escorted&#xD;
      to a private room. Participants will proceed to feed their infant a typical liquid meal (i.e.&#xD;
      breastmilk or formula). Within 15 minutes of completion of the feed, infants will be placed&#xD;
      in the prototype infant reclining device at either 0, 10, 18, or 28 degrees of incline.&#xD;
      Infants will spend 15 minutes at each level of incline in a randomly assigned order. During&#xD;
      this time period that each infant is under observation the infant may be&#xD;
      entertained/distracted/comforted with white noise, music or other forms of distraction as&#xD;
      determined by the mother or study team. Mothers may touch/caress their infant or use a&#xD;
      pacifier to soothe infant as needed so long as each 15 minute segment is completed. Following&#xD;
      each 15 minute segment, a &quot;washout&quot; period will be used such that the next 15 minute segment&#xD;
      will not begin for a minimum of 1 minute to a maximum of 5 minutes in duration before the&#xD;
      next incline position is begun. This allows for a clean start and stop period for each 15&#xD;
      minute segment that is not impacted by either the prior position or the change to the new&#xD;
      position. This also allows mothers or study staff to pick up and comfort the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each of the four 15 minute segments, infants will be monitored using the Masimo RAD-97&#xD;
      pulse oximeter with data continuously collected regarding oxygen saturation and heart rate in&#xD;
      2-second intervals. The oxygen saturation probe will preferably be attached to a big toe, but&#xD;
      can be placed in alternative spots consistent with usual clinical care such that a consistent&#xD;
      reading of heart rate and oxygen saturation are recorded. A study coordinator will complete a&#xD;
      data collection form for each segment characterizing whether GER occurred (spit-up into mouth&#xD;
      or outside of mouth), the number of GER episodes as well as a subjective assessment of degree&#xD;
      crying/fussing, hiccups, back arching, and breathing difficulty. The coordinator will also&#xD;
      have a timer to measure the duration of crying in each position. Infants will be video&#xD;
      recorded as a backup method for symptom assessment and for qualitative assessments by the&#xD;
      study sponsor.&#xD;
