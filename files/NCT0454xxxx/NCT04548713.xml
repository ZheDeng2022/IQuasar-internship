  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insertion of a central venous catheter (CVC) allows clinicians to easily access the&#xD;
      circulation of a patient to administer life-saving interventions. Due to their invasive&#xD;
      nature, CVC's are prone to complications such as infection, bacterial biofilm production, and&#xD;
      catheter occlusion due to a thrombus. A CVC is placed in up to 97% of patients in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit, exposing this vulnerable population to risk of nosocomial infection and&#xD;
      occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current standard of care involves use of normal saline as a catheter locking solution.&#xD;
      Although efficacious in maintaining line patency, saline offers little prophylactic measures&#xD;
      against catheter complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4% tetrasodium Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) fluid (KiteLock Sterile Locking&#xD;
      Solution) possesses antimicrobial, anti-biofilm, and anti-thrombotic properties and is&#xD;
      approved by Health Canada as a catheter locking solution. As such, it may be superior CVC&#xD;
      locking solution than the present normal saline lock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, the efficacy of an EDTA catheter locking solution has not yet been&#xD;
      investigated in the intensive care patient population. Our team proposes to fill this&#xD;
      knowledge gap by performing a multi-centre, cluster-randomized, crossover study evaluating&#xD;
      the impact of KiteLock Sterile Locking Solution on a primary composite outcome of&#xD;
      intraluminal occlusion rates and alteplase use in the ICU of four Canadian hospitals compared&#xD;
      to the standard of care saline lock.&#xD;
