  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most premature babies require oxygen therapy. There is uncertainty about what oxygen levels&#xD;
      are the best. The oxygen levels in the blood are measured using a monitor called a saturation&#xD;
      monitor and the oxygen the baby breathes is adjusted to keep the level in a target range.&#xD;
      Although there is evidence that lower oxygen levels maybe harmful, it is not known how high&#xD;
      they need to be for maximum benefit. Very high levels are also harmful. Saturation monitors&#xD;
      are not very good for checking for high oxygen levels. For this a different kind of monitor,&#xD;
      called a transcutaneous monitor, is better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keeping oxygen levels stable is usually done by nurses adjusting the oxygen levels by hand&#xD;
      (manual control). There is also equipment available that can do this automatically (servo&#xD;
      control). It is not known which is best.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies of automated control have shown that infants spend more time within their intended&#xD;
      target oxygen saturation range. These have not included measurements of transcutaneous&#xD;
      oxygen. There are no previous studies directly comparing automated respiratory devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to show the transcutaneous oxygen levels as well as the oxygen&#xD;
      saturation levels when babies have their oxygen adjusted using two automated (servo) control&#xD;
      devices delivering nasal high flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a period of 12 hours each baby will have their oxygen adjusted automatically using each&#xD;
      devices for 6 hours respectively. The investigators will compare the range of oxygen levels&#xD;
      that are seen between the two respiratory devices.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Presently oxygen is titrated against saturation (SpO2) by manual adjustment. Automated or&#xD;
      servo-control systems have been developed that result in tighter control of SpO2 and more&#xD;
      time spent in the intended target range. These systems are already in clinical use. Automated&#xD;
      systems produce quite large fluctuations in fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) in order to&#xD;
      keep SpO2 in range. It is possible that this could result in short periods of high or low&#xD;
      oxygen tension (PO2) that are undetectable using saturation monitoring. Studies to date have&#xD;
      examined the effects of manual and automated (servo) oxygen targeting on SpO2 but not on&#xD;
      transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2). There are no studies directly comparing two automated&#xD;
      systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need to determine the achieved SpO2 and TcPO2 distributions associated with the&#xD;
      use of different automated control systems as a first step in planning future trials. When&#xD;
      this is measured over a small number of hours it is not anticipated that this would have an&#xD;
      influence on clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, single centre, randomised crossover trial of two automated&#xD;
      (servo) control devices - IntellO2 (Vapotherm, USA) versus Leoni plus CLAC (Löwenstein&#xD;
      Medical, Germany) - delivering nasal high flow employing automated oxygen titration. Each&#xD;
      infant will act as their own control. Infants born at less than 30 weeks gestation, greater&#xD;
      than 48 hour of age and receiving supplementary oxygen will be eligible for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be undertaken in the Neonatal Unit at the Simpson Centre for Reproductive&#xD;
      Health at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total study time is 12 hours for each infant. Infants will be randomised to commence on&#xD;
      either automated (servo) control using either Leoni plus CLAC or IntellO2, Vapotherm. SpO2&#xD;
      (range 90-95%) will be continuously monitored as per normal standard of care. A second pulse&#xD;
      oximetry probe will be place for servo control input.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional monitoring will be carried out as shown below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. TcPO2 monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. FiO2 monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Heart rate monitoring (used to validate SpO2 readings)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Arterial gas sampling (only if conducted by the direct care team as part of the routine&#xD;
           care of the infant; no extra blood samples will be taken as part of the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
      FiO2 will be adjusted by the respiratory support devices which have integrated automated&#xD;
      oxygen control, set to maintain a SpO2 target range of 90-95%. The IntellO2 device uses&#xD;
      Precision Flow technology (IntellO2, Vapotherm, USA). By means of a modified closed-loop&#xD;
      algorithm, the devise uses Masimo pulse oximetry to target a user-set SpO2 value. The Leoni&#xD;
      plus CLAC (Closed-Loop Automated oxygen Control) ventilator (Leoni plus, Löwenstein Medical,&#xD;
      Germany) similarly uses MasimoSET (Signal Extraction Technology) to target SpO2 and automate&#xD;
      oxygen control. Both devices have a signal averaging time of 8 seconds (Masimo, Irvine, USA).&#xD;
      The Leoni plus CLAC algorithm is set to a 30 seconds wait time between adjustments, allowing&#xD;
      up to 120 automated adjustments/hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SpO2 readings will be downloaded directly from the multiparameter patient monitor. SpO2 will&#xD;
      be measured using a Phillips MX500 multiparameter monitor (Phillips, Germany, CE 0366). TcPO2&#xD;
      will be measured using a SenTec Digital Monitoring System with OxiVent sensor (SenTec AG,&#xD;
      Switzerland, European patent No. 1535055, CE 0120). Both monitors are routinely used in&#xD;
      clinical practice. Transcutaneous data will be recorded contemporaneously and the site of the&#xD;
      transcutaneous probe will be rotated on each infant every 2 hours. Control of sensor&#xD;
      temperature and application duration are designed to meet all applicable standards and this&#xD;
      monitoring device is use routinely in many neonatal units.&#xD;
