  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cricothyroid membrane acts as a route through which the upper airway can be accessed to&#xD;
      provide oxygen and ventilation to patients. Anesthesiologists need to deliver oxygen and&#xD;
      ventilation to patients under general anesthesia, where patients may lose the ability to&#xD;
      breath for themselves. Access through this membrane to provide oxygen and ventilation is&#xD;
      critical in emergency situations where other traditional means to access the airway (e.g.&#xD;
      through endotracheal ventilation, supraglottic airway devices or face mask ventilation) have&#xD;
      failed. It is known, from previous studies, that due to the physiological changes that occur&#xD;
      in labour, the upper airway of the body undergoes changes that can make accessing the airway&#xD;
      through traditional means more difficult, specifically during the period of labor, delivery,&#xD;
      and just after delivery. Ultrasound is becoming increasingly popular due to its ability both&#xD;
      to identify the cricothyroid membrane and to improve success in accessing the airway through&#xD;
      the cricothyroid membrane. What is not known, and has not been studied to date, is&#xD;
      specifically how the anatomy (i.e. its height and its depth) specifically changes during the&#xD;
      period of labour, delivery and just after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study would be to scan (using ultrasound) pregnant women's necks once at the&#xD;
      very start of their labour, and once within 4 hours of delivery of their baby, to identify&#xD;
      how the size and depth of the cricothyroid membrane changes. This information would improve&#xD;
      the understanding of how to best approach accessing this membrane in laboring pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that in labouring third trimester patient, that the depth to&#xD;
      the cricothyroid membrane will increase, and there will be no change in the cricothyroid&#xD;
      membrane height.&#xD;
