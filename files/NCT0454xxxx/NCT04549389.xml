  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will include 50 chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) patients who will be randomised&#xD;
      in 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A (25 patients )will receive 6 LiST sessions with a frequency 1 session / week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B (25 patients) will receive 6 LiST sessions with a frequency 2 sessions / week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index(NHI-CPSI), International&#xD;
      Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-ED)&#xD;
      questionnaires will be answered before and at 1 and 3 month follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be reported during the treatment and follow up period.&#xD;

    <description>CP/CPPS-related complaints will be assessed by the the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI). The questionnaire designed to provide symptom scores for patients with chronic prostatitis. The index provides scores on pain (items 1-4), urinary symptoms (items 5-6), and quality of life (items 7-9).Total score ranges from 0 to 35 (higher values represent worse outcome).The index provides a special pain domain (items 1-4) and the score for this domain ranges from 0 to 21.</description>

    <description>It will be assessed by International Index of Erectile Function -Erectile Domain (IEF-ED) score. A questionnaire designed to evaluate erectile capabilities. The questionnaire provides a score between 5 and 30.The severity categories are: 1-10 severe ED, 10-16 moderate ED, 17-21 moderate to mild ED, 22-25 mild ED, 26-30 no ED</description>

    <description>They will be assessed by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). A questionnaire designed to provide information on lower urinary tract symptoms and their impact on quality of life. Scores range from 0 to 35. The severity categories are: 1-7 mild, 8-19 moderate, 20-35 severe</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The difference between groups in the the Pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at week 3, 4, 5,</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed by the pain VAS, right after each LIST session. Pain VAS is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity . It is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal (HVAS) or vertical (VVAS) line, usually 10 centimeters (100 mm) in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme. For pain intensity, the scale is most commonly anchored by &quot;no pain&quot; (score of 0) and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; or &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (score of 100 [100-mm scale]. To avoid clustering of scores around a preferred numeric value, numbers or verbal descriptors at intermediate points are not recommended. The following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain (5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75- 100 mm)</description>
