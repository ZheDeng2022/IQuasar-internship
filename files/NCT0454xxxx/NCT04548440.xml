    <textblock>
      An open-label, non-randomized, phase II study to assess the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      Preoperative Sintilimab Plus Nab-paclitaxel and Cisplatin in Borderline Resectable Esophageal&#xD;
      Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients&#xD;
    </textblock>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the R0 resection rate of Borderline Resectable Esophageal Squamous Cell&#xD;
      Carcinoma patients who used preoperative Sintilimab Plus Nab-paclitaxel and Cisplatin&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the Pathological Complete Response (pCR) rate, Progression Free Survival (PFS),&#xD;
      Relapse Rate, Tumor Regression Grading (TRG) post preoperative chemotherapy, Overall Survival&#xD;
      (OS), safety and toxicity of chemotherapy regimen and surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploring the benefits of this treatment strategy in Borderline Resectable Esophageal&#xD;
      Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients at a molecular level&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients receive Sintilimab and cisplatin intravenously on day 1 and albumin-bound&#xD;
      paclitaxel intravenously on days 1 and 8. This cycle is repeated every 3 weeks in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Radiological and multidisciplinary&#xD;
      assessment is performed after every 2-4 cycles.&#xD;

    <description>Patients receive the following regimen every 3 weeks:&#xD;
Sintilimab 200mg IV on Day 1; Albumin-bound paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 and Day 8; Cisplatin 75mg/m2 IV on Day 1; Standard hydration regimen on Day 0-3&#xD;
After 2-4 cycles, radiological evaluation and multidisciplinary assessment will be performed. If radical resection is possible, surgery is to be performed 3-6 weeks after the last chemotherapy session. In the case of a R0 resection, the investigator will decide whether to perform adjuvant therapy depending on the patient's condition; in the case of R1 or R2 resection, concurrent chemoradiotherapy is recommended. If the multidisciplinary assessment considers that radical resection is not possible, radical concurrent chemoradiotherapy is performed.</description>
