  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Training prescription is planned considering recovery periods to enhance performance. To&#xD;
      assess recovery, a complexity model can be used, in which the main variable would correspond&#xD;
      to a fractal of performance. To assess the effectiveness of post-exercise massage and&#xD;
      cold-water immersion under a new prism of recovery by means of muscle stiffness and movement&#xD;
      variability analysis regarding the sport-specific gesture and an experimental task of&#xD;
      shoulder elevation in swimmers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty swimmers from São Paulo state swimming teams will be initially assessed to investigate&#xD;
      movement patterns at rest and after a fatigue protocol by means of inertial sensors. The&#xD;
      participants will be assessed regarding their perceptions by the Swimmer's Perception of&#xD;
      Effort Questionnaire (SPEQ), muscle stiffness by a myotonometer, skin temperature by a&#xD;
      thermographic infrared camera and coordination by the Coordination Index and Continuous&#xD;
      Relative Phase (CRP). Then, the athletes will perform the fatigue protocol again followed by&#xD;
      five interventions in a crossover design separated by 24hr: i) superficial massage, ii) deep&#xD;
      massage iii) cold-water immersion iv) immersion in thermoneutral water and v) control (no&#xD;
      intervention). All procedures will be performed for an experimental task of shoulder&#xD;
      elevation and the sport-specific gesture (front crawl simulation in swim bench). The&#xD;
      statistical analysis will be conducted in SPSS software. To analyze fractal properties of&#xD;
      time series the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) will be used where (α) varies from 0,5&#xD;
      to 1,5, interpreted as random series and Brownian noise, respectively. To compared pre and&#xD;
      post assessments from initial testing the paired t test will be used. To compare perceptions,&#xD;
      muscle stiffness and temperature between groups after fatigue protocol and intervention a&#xD;
      Mixed ANOVA will be used with Greenhouse-Geisser corrections and Bonferroni post-hoc if&#xD;
      necessary. Descriptive data will be presented as mean and standard deviations. All analysis&#xD;
      will assume level of significance of P&lt; 0,05.&#xD;
