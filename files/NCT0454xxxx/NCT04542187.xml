      Backround:The incidence of difficulty in laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation is more&#xD;
      common in obese patients. There are conflicting data on factors predicting difficult&#xD;
      intubation. Also, these predictors are uncertain when video laryngoscopy (VL) is used. In&#xD;
      this study we aim to investigate the correlation between airway assessment tests,&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements and Modified Cormack-Lehane Classification (MCLC), assessed by&#xD;
      C-MAC-D-blade VL and predictive values for intubation difficulty in class-III patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This prospective observational study was performed in 121 obese patients (Body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI)≥45kg/m2) undergoing bariatric surgery. BMI, modified mallampati scores (MMS),&#xD;
      thyromental distance (TMD), sternomental distance (SMD), interincisor distance (IID), and&#xD;
      neck, waist, and chest circumference were all recorded preoperatively. Endotracheal&#xD;
      intubations were performed with a C-MAC D-blade VL. The glottic view and intubation&#xD;
      difficulty were determined according to the MCLC. MCLC I-IIa was recorded as the group with&#xD;
      no risk of a difficult intubation, the MCLC IIb-III was recorded as the group with risk of a&#xD;
      difficult intubation and the MCLC-IV was recorded as the group with a difficult intubation.&#xD;
      The correlation between the airway tests, anthropometric parameters and the MCLC, as well as&#xD;
      their sensitivity and specificity in predicting the intubation difficulty based on the MCLC,&#xD;
      were analyzed. The duration of intubation, number of attempts, external laryngeal maneuver,&#xD;
      the equipment requirements (style, guide), and complications during intubation were recorded.&#xD;

      Study Design This prospective observational clinical study was conducted in patients with a&#xD;
      BMI ≥ 45 kg/m2 undergoing elective bariatric surgery between January 2018 and January 2019,&#xD;
      in the Anesthesiology and Reanimation Clinic of the Health Sciences University, Bagcilar&#xD;
      Training and Research Center, after obtaining approval from the Ethics Board of Health&#xD;
      Sciences University Istanbul Bagcilar Training and Research Hospital (17.08.2017-2017/599).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population The number of participants in this study was calculated based upon a&#xD;
      previous study. A sample size calculator showed that 116 participants would be required to&#xD;
      predict difficult intubation in obese patients (with 80% power, α=0,05 and, β=0,2). After&#xD;
      obtaining the patients written informed consent, as a result of the power analysis, one&#xD;
      hundred and twenty-one patients, aged 16-68 years, with a BMI ≥ 45 kg/m2, who were undergoing&#xD;
      elective bariatric surgery were included in this study. Patients with a history of difficult&#xD;
      airway, limited neck movements, oral-pharyngeal cancer or reconstructive surgery, cervical&#xD;
      spinal injury and facial anomaly or scar, patients who required quick and awake endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation, and patients who were not oriented-cooperative, were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol Age, sex, height, body weight, BMI, airway assessments and anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements, including the MMS, thyromental distance TMD), sternomental distance (SMD),&#xD;
      interincisor distance (IID), and neck, waist and chest circumference measurements of all&#xD;
      patients were evaluated and recorded preoperatively. The MMS was assessed by Samsoon and&#xD;
      Young Modifications and scores were assessed 1 to 4. The TMD and SMD were measured with the&#xD;
      neck fully extended. The TMD was measured between the upper border of the thyroid cartilage&#xD;
      and the bony point of the mentum, and the SMD was measured between the upper border of the&#xD;
      manubrium sterni and the bony point of the mentum. The IID was measured when the patient&#xD;
      opened their mouth, and the distance between upper and lower incisors was obtained. Neck&#xD;
      circumference was measured at the level of the thyroid cartilage when the head was in a&#xD;
      neutral position. The chest and waist circumference was measured around the widest&#xD;
      circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After patients were admitted to the operating room, all patients were positioned with the gel&#xD;
      placed under their head. The intravenous route was inserted in the dorsum of the hand using a&#xD;
      20 G (Gauge) venous cannula, and a 2-4 mL/kg balanced crystalloid was infused. All patients&#xD;
      were premedicated with 1-2mg midazolam (Zolamid 15mg/3ml, Defarma, Turkey). Each patient was&#xD;
      routinely monitored with the standard monitorization, including three-lead&#xD;
      electrocardiography (ECG), non-invasive arterial pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation&#xD;
      (SpO2), and neuromuscular monitorization with the TOF-Watch SX (Organon, Ireland) device. All&#xD;
      patients were pre-oxygenated using a face mask, with 100% oxygen for 3 to 5 minutes prior to&#xD;
      induction of the anesthesia. Induction is made with 2 mg/kg propofol (Propofol 1%, Fresenius&#xD;
      kabi, Germany) and 1 µgr/kg fentanyl (Talinat, VEM, Turkey) based on a lean body weight, and&#xD;
      0.6 mg /kg rocuronium bromide (Esmeron Organon, Holland) based on an ideal body weight.&#xD;
      Following the adequate paralysis (loss of responsiveness to train of four stimulations with&#xD;
      TOF), all patients were routinely intubated using C-MAC D-blade VL (Storz 8402 ZX C- MAC Karl&#xD;
      Storz, Germany). Anesthesia was maintained with inhalation of 50% oxygen-medical air mixture&#xD;
      and 2% minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane (Sevoflurane, Abbott, England).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time of the tracheal intubation was defined from insertion of the VL in the mouth until&#xD;
      the endotracheal tube was placed through the vocal cords and expired carbon dioxide at&#xD;
      capnography was observed. In the case of a peripheral oxygen saturation decrease (&lt; 90%),&#xD;
      performing of intubation was interrupted, and mask ventilation was resumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there is no validated classification for the glottic view with VL intubation, it was&#xD;
      evaluated and recorded according to the MCLC modified by Yentis and Lee, without any&#xD;
      laryngeal pressure as shown below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MCLC I: A full view of the glottis MCLC IIa: Partial view of the glottis is visible MCLC IIb:&#xD;
      Arytenoids or posterior part of the vocal cords are only just visible MCLC III: Only the&#xD;
      epiglottis is visible MCLC IV: Neither epiglottis nor the glottis are visible MCLC I-IIa was&#xD;
      recorded as the group with no risk of a difficult intubation, MCLC IIb-III was recorded as&#xD;
      the group with a risk of a difficult intubation, the grade MCLC IIb was associated with a&#xD;
      greater difficulty for intubation with a grade III, and MCLC-IV was recorded as the group&#xD;
      with difficult intubation. The time of intubation, number of attempts, external laryngeal&#xD;
      maneuver, stylet or both the usage requirements and complications (airway trauma, soft tissue&#xD;
      hemorrhage, tooth damage, etc.) were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All airway assessment tests, and anthropometric parameters were performed by the same&#xD;
      anesthesiologist. All the endotracheal intubations and assessment of MCLC were routinely&#xD;
      performed with a C-MAC D-blade VL by another anesthesiologist who was blinded to the datas of&#xD;
      the preoperatively assessed tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and Secondary Outcomes The primary outcomes were the correlation between the&#xD;
      preoperative airway assessment tests (MMS, TMD, SMD, IID), anthropometric measurements (BMI,&#xD;
      neck, waist, chest circumference), and MCLC assessed by VL as well as their predictive values&#xD;
      for the intubation difficulty according to the MCLC. Secondary outcomes were the time for&#xD;
      intubation, number of attempts, equipment (stylet) and external laryngeal maneuver (ELM)&#xD;
      requirements, as well as the complications during intubation (lip trauma, soft tissue&#xD;
      hemorrhage, tooth damage, supraglottic trauma, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 21 Statistical&#xD;
      Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous variables are&#xD;
      expressed as means and standard deviation. The Kolmogrov-Smirnov test was used to investigate&#xD;
      the normal distribution of continuous data. The Student's test was used for normally&#xD;
      distributed continuous variables. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for variables that were&#xD;
      not normally distributed. The Chi-Square and Fisher's Exact tests were used for&#xD;
      non-continuous variables. To evaluate the change of continuous variables both Pearson&#xD;
      correlation analysis was used for parametric data and Spearman Correlation analysis was used&#xD;
      for nonparametric data. The evaluation of correlation coefficient; r=0.00-0.24, r=0.25-0.49,&#xD;
      r=0.50-0.74, r=0.75-1.00 were considered as weak, moderate, strong and very strong&#xD;
      respectively. The cut-off points for statistically significant parameters were determined by&#xD;
      using the receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis which resulted in the best combination for&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative&#xD;
      predictive values were calculated in the presence of significant limit values. All variables&#xD;
      at p &lt; 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.&#xD;
