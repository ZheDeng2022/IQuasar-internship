  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maintaining the population's fitness for work is a priority for the UK Government. People&#xD;
      with poor health often struggle at work and take sick leave. Work brings financial, social&#xD;
      and health benefits. Few employees receive support to manage their health at work, known as&#xD;
      vocational advice, so when their health affects work they visit their general practitioner&#xD;
      (GP). The investigators have recently shown the benefits of providing vocational advice for&#xD;
      adults consulting in primary care with musculoskeletal pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WAVE study research question is: in patients consulting in general practice who receive a&#xD;
      fit note for time off work, does a brief vocational advice intervention lead to fewer days&#xD;
      lost from work than usual primary care, and is it cost-effective?&#xD;
&#xD;
      WAVE includes a feasibility phase to adapt a vocational advice intervention for a broader&#xD;
      group of patients and test it in a small sample of patients; followed by a pragmatic,&#xD;
      multi-centre, two-arm, parallel-group randomised (1:1) trial with internal pilot phase, mixed&#xD;
      methods process evaluation and health economic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to either (i) vocational advice intervention plus usual care, or&#xD;
      (ii) usual care alone. The vocational advice intervention is designed as a stepped care model&#xD;
      based on the principles of case management and delivered by trained Vocational Support&#xD;
      Workers (VSWs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also interview patients, General Practitioners (GPs), VSWs and&#xD;
      employers to understand their views about the intervention and return to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the trial will be followed-up over 6 months with fortnightly text messages&#xD;
      and postal questionnaires at 6 weeks and 6 months.&#xD;

    <description>Work Productivity Activity Impairment (WPAI) Questionnaire to measure impairments to work and activities in the past seven days. The WPAI provides four sets of scores; absenteeism, presenteeism, work productivity loss and activity impairment. Scores are multiplied by 100 to express percentages with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity i.e. worse outcomes.</description>

Step 1, contact by phone to undertake an assessment with a trained Vocational Support Worker (VSW) to identify obstacles to Return to Work (RTW) and support RTW planning.&#xD;
Step 2, face-to-face (in person or by videoconference) in-depth discussion of obstacles to RTW and further support for RTW planning.&#xD;
Step 3, contact by the VSW (with participant consent) with the participants' workplace.&#xD;
The frequency of contact will be individualised to the needs of participants and the offer of support continued until sustained RTW (defined as return to any work for at least 4 weeks) or until 6 months of absence, after which participants will be signposted to other services.</description>
