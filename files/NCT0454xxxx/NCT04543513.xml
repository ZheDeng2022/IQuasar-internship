  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deficits in emotional cognitive control are present in a number of clinical psychiatric&#xD;
      populations including depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Deficits in this domain of function&#xD;
      limit one's ability to focus attention on goal-directed activities while inhibiting reactions&#xD;
      to irrelevant emotional stimuli, and this contributes to the symptoms of these disorders and&#xD;
      makes individuals less likely to be successful in existing treatments. The left dorsolateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex (LDLPFC) and its connectivity with other regions (i.e., dorsal anterior&#xD;
      cingulate cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, insula, amygdala) is thought to play a&#xD;
      central role in facilitating emotional cognitive control. However, past research has&#xD;
      primarily utilized correlational approaches that limit conclusions about the directionality&#xD;
      of these relationships. Enhancing our understanding of the neural underpinnings of emotional&#xD;
      cognitive control could be valuable for informing treatment for populations with deficits in&#xD;
      these processes, such as adults with PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study utilizes a neuromodulatory approach called real-time functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) whereby participants observe their own neural&#xD;
      activity in the moment and are taught to self-regulate this activity. Adult volunteers, who&#xD;
      have been diagnosed with PTSD, will be trained to increase neural activity in LDLPFC while&#xD;
      involved in mental tasks involving emotional cognitive control processes. The mental tasks&#xD;
      will include counting, remembering words, or planning events while viewing&#xD;
      negatively-valenced emotional words (e.g., kill, death, threat). Participants in this study&#xD;
      will complete a non-randomized LDLPFC rtfMRI-nf protocol to assess tolerability and&#xD;
      feasibility of the protocol in a clinical population of interest. Resting-state fMRI scans&#xD;
      and behavioral testing sessions will take place before and after rtfMRI-nf.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are to examine the impact of LDLPFC rtfMRI-nf on: (1) LDLPFC activity&#xD;
      during emotional cognitive control, (2) LDLPFC functional connectivity with other brain&#xD;
      regions during rest, and (3) cognitive control task performance. As this study is meant to be&#xD;
      preliminary, the target sample size is not powered to detect statistical significance for&#xD;
      these measures. However, effect size estimates will be calculated to provide potential&#xD;
      justification for future work with this protocol in this clinical population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To these ends, this study will use rtfMRI-nf to examine preliminary evidence of a novel&#xD;
      protocol to regulate LDLPFC activity in adults diagnosed with PTSD. This research will&#xD;
      improve our understanding of emotional cognitive control and demonstrate whether this is a&#xD;
      modifiable target for intervention in this clinical population of interest.&#xD;
