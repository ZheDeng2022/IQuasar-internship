      Musculoskeletal pain (MSP) reflects of musculoskeletal conditions related to tissues such as&#xD;
      tendons, muscles, ligaments, nerves, and other joint structures. Coping strategies with pain&#xD;
      are used to manage the pain and its impacts. The present study aimed to compare active and&#xD;
      passive coping strategies used and pain severity in postmenopausal women according to their&#xD;
      demographic characteristics. Also, the relationship between pain and coping strategies in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with cMSP will be examined.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal pain (MSP) reflects of musculoskeletal conditions related to tissues such as&#xD;
      tendons, muscles, ligaments, nerves, and other joint structures. If MSP lasts for longer than&#xD;
      three months, it becomes chronic. The prevalence of chronic MSP (cMSP) increases with aging&#xD;
      and its ratio changes between 35,7% and 49,8%. The previous studies demonstrated the&#xD;
      differences in the prevalence of cMSP between men and women. According to most of the&#xD;
      studies, older women adults are more vulnerable to experience than men due to some&#xD;
      differences in perception of pain such as biological characteristics, their roles in daily&#xD;
      life, beliefs or coping strategies with pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oestrogen has a prominent role in the physiology of muscles, tendons, ligaments, and bones.&#xD;
      The decline of this sex hormone during menopause transition could lead to MSP, particularly&#xD;
      in the postmenopausal period. Indeed, an increasing rate of cMSP in postmenopausal women has&#xD;
      been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coping strategies with pain are used to manage the pain and its impacts. Coping with pain&#xD;
      requires the self-regulation of individuals using cognitive and behavioral reactions. Dealing&#xD;
      with cMSP is a process that can need the making of changes in daily life and activities This&#xD;
      study aimed to compare active and passive coping strategies being used and pain severity in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women according to their age, marital status, educational status, and exercise&#xD;
      habits. Also, subdomains of strategies and subdomains of pain and the relationship between&#xD;
      pain and coping strategies in postmenopausal women with cMSP will be examined.&#xD;
