  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a master protocol for a prospective Phase I-II study evaluating feasibility and&#xD;
      efficacy of incorporating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) simulation into the planning of&#xD;
      radiation treatments.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. A Phase I clinical trial tests the feasibility and&#xD;
      safety of an investigational intervention. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the process targeting&#xD;
      high doses of radiation to the tumor based on MRI is still being studied. This research study&#xD;
      is a Feasibility Study, which means it is the first-time investigators at this institution&#xD;
      are examining this type of MR-guided dose planning. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) has cleared MRI planning for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Phase I of this study, will prospectively determine the feasibility of using an MRI&#xD;
           simulator to plan radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Phase II, the efficacy of adjusting RT based on MRI simulation will be explored,&#xD;
           either by utilizing an MRI-simulation and synthetic CT to plan treatment or by&#xD;
           dose-painting based on functional MRI data&#xD;
