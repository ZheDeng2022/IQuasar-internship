  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized double-blind study is to compare the analgesic efficacy of the&#xD;
      bilateral Erector Spinae Plane (ESP) block versus the bilateral Thoracic Paravertebral block&#xD;
      (TPVB), by ultrasound-guided single injection in patients who underwent sternotomy for&#xD;
      cardiac surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery causes moderate to severe postoperative pain during the first 24 - 48&#xD;
      post-operative hours. This pain is greatly increased by mobilization (respiratory&#xD;
      physiotherapy) and leads to the consumption of morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate analgesia, along with a reduction in morphine consumption are important factors&#xD;
      in reducing morbidity after cardiac surgery and allow better postoperative rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the concept of multimodal analgesia has become established, which corresponds to&#xD;
      ensuring optimal analgesia through the use of non-morphine drugs associated with locoregional&#xD;
      analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During cardiac surgery, Paravertebral block (TPVB) technique is the first line of reference&#xD;
      in our establishment. Lately, a new approach of blocking the intercostal nerves called&#xD;
      Erector Spinae Plane block (ESP) has been discovered. It is a technique that seems simpler&#xD;
      and safer than TPVB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, the analgesic efficacy of the ESP block compared to TPVB after cardiac surgery by&#xD;
      sternotomy has never been studied.&#xD;

We will look at these as a combined number known as the FEV1/FVC ratio.The higher the percentage derived from your FEV1/FVC ratio, in the absence of restrictive lung disease that causes a normal or elevated FEV1/FVC ratio, the healthier your lungs are. A low ratio suggests that something is blocking your airways</description>

    <description>If the patient is randomized to group &quot;Erector Spinae Plane Block&quot;, the anesthesiologist performs the ESPb block before induction of general anesthesia. The patient is positioned in a right lateral decubitus position. The anesthesiologist performs the erector block of the spine ESP with ultrasound identification at the T4-T5 level (identify the 1st rib on ultrasound then the space T4 to T5). Slow injection of 20 ml of ropivacaine on each side (diluted to 3.75 mg / ml = dilution in a 20 ml syringe with 10 ml of ropivacaine 7.5 mg / ml and 10 ml of 0.9% NaCl) after aspiration test.&#xD;
The patient is then turned in left lateral decubitus position and the contralateral block is performed according to the same procedure.</description>
