      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes, and especially diabetic kidney disease is associated with the development of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease such as calcification in the coronary arteries and heart failure.&#xD;
      Sleep apnea is frequent among patients with diabetes and diabetic kidney disease and sleep&#xD;
      apnea itself is a solitary risk factor in the development of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Nonetheless, sleep apnea is underdiagnosed in diabetes patients because of a discrepancy&#xD;
      between sleep apnea severity and actual oxygen deficiency symptoms which makes the diagnosis&#xD;
      difficult. For that reason, many diabetics have undiagnosed sleep apnea together with&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Early discovery of sleep apnea among high risk diabetic patients may&#xD;
      therefore be considered crucial before cardiovascular complications develop. For this reason,&#xD;
      sleep apnea screening of high-risk diabetics can possibly improve early diagnostics of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will seek to establish the association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and&#xD;
      coronary calcification and heart failure in patients with diabetic kidney disease. The basic&#xD;
      hypothesis of the study is that patients with diabetic kidney disease and concurrent OSA have&#xD;
      a higher prevalence and severity of coronary calcification and heart failure compared to&#xD;
      patients without OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic adult patients with scheduled check-ups at Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, or&#xD;
      Department of Renal Medicine on Aarhus University Hospital will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, all included patients are screened for sleep apnea with the devices SomnoTouch® and&#xD;
      ApneaLink®. Based on the sleep apnea determination; 40 patients with moderate-severe sleep&#xD;
      apnea are compared with 40 patients without sleep apnea. In both groups, the patients are&#xD;
      examined for calcification in the coronary vessels using a CT-scan while the function of the&#xD;
      heart is examined by ultrasound (echocardiography). The stiffness of aorta is measured and&#xD;
      performed using radial artery tonometry (SphygmoCor®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, range of blood- and urine samples will be performed&#xD;
&#xD;
      The perspectives are that patients with diabetes should be regularly evaluated for sleep&#xD;
      apnea and that patients with moderate/severe sleep apnea should undergo further examination&#xD;
      for cardiovascular disease even though the patients don't display any symptoms of either&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease or sleep apnea.&#xD;
