      Double-Blind, Randomised, Placebo-Controlled Exploratory Study to Estimate the Prophylactic&#xD;
      Efficacy of Palivizumab in Healthy Adult Participants Inoculated with Respiratory Syncytial&#xD;
      Virus (RSV).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As no data exists for Palivizumab in the RSV human challenge model, this exploratory study is&#xD;
      therefore planned to establish the margins of effect and variance of prophylactically&#xD;
      administered Palivizumab within the RSV-A Memphis 37b challenge model in healthy adult&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in adults aged 18-55 years, in two parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Part 1: All participants will be administered Palivizumab (8mg/Kg, intravenously).&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic (PK), safety will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there are no safety concerns in Part 1, and PK analysis of Palivizumab treated&#xD;
      participants confirm the modelling of 8mg/Kg to be appropriate, Part 2 will commence with the&#xD;
      planned 8mg/Kg treatment dose. However, if PK analysis of Part 1 suggests that 8mg/kg may be&#xD;
      insufficient dose to provide suitable efficacious coverage in Part 2, then Part 2 will&#xD;
      proceed with a dose of 15mg/Kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Part 2: Participants will be either administered Palivizumab (8mg/Kg or 15mg/Kg, as&#xD;
      determined in Part ) or a placebo and they will subsequently be challenged with an RSV-A&#xD;
      strain (Memphis 37b). The margin of effect and variance between groups will be measured, as&#xD;
      well as safety and reactogenicity.&#xD;

    <description>The PK assessment up to and including Day 12 exposure was used as a decision information for the dose to be given to participants in Part 2. Pharmacokinetic exposure data from at least 5 out of 6 participants were required for dose decision making with a projected exposure of ≥40 μg/mL on Day 12 according to the protocol.&#xD;
This was achieved after administration of a single IV dose of Palivizumab at 8 mg/kg. Therefore, a dose of 8 mg/kg was chosen for Part 2.</description>

    <description>Mean TSS values (collected daily in the symptom diary card) over time. Symptoms were collected using the hVIVO (services provider) symptom diary card. Several symptoms (such as runny nose, sore throat, earache, etc) in the 13-item questionnaire were graded on a scale of 0-3 (grade 0: No symptoms; grade 1: just noticeable; grade 2: clearly bothersome from time to time but does not interfere with me doing my normal daily activities; grade 3: Quite bothersome most or all of the time, and it stops me participating in activities). Shortness of breath and wheeze have an additional grade 4: Symptoms at rest. The total symptom score (TSS) was determined as the sum of the symptom scores ranging from 0.0 (min) to 41(max) [or a maximum of 41x11.33=464.67 depending on what the reviewer is asking] using a 13-items self-reported diary card. 11.33 is the number of days symptom diary cards were included (Day +1 morning dairy card to Day 12 morning diary card). Higher scores mean worse outcome.</description>

             conditions, and no clinically significant test abnormalities that will interfere with&#xD;
             participant safety, as defined by medical history, physical examination, (including&#xD;
             vital signs), Electrocardiogram (ECG), and routine laboratory tests as determined by&#xD;
             the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A documented medical history prior to enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The following criteria are applicable to female participants participating in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to&#xD;
                  enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Females of non-childbearing potential:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Post- menopausal females; defined as having a history of amenorrhea for &gt;12&#xD;
                  months with no alternative medical cause, and /or by Follicle stimulating hormone&#xD;
                  (FSH) level &gt;40mIU/mL, confirmed by laboratory&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Documented status as being surgically sterile (e.g. tubal ligation, hysterectomy,&#xD;
                  bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The following criteria apply to female and male participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Female participants of childbearing potential must use one form of highly&#xD;
                  effective contraception. Hormonal methods must be in place from at least 2 weeks&#xD;
                  prior to the first study visit. The contraception use must continue until 30 days&#xD;
                  after the date of viral challenge/last dosing with IMP (whichever occurs last).&#xD;
                  Highly effective contraception is as described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Established use of hormonal methods of contraception described below (for a&#xD;
                  minimum of 2 weeks prior to the first study visit). When hormonal methods of&#xD;
                  contraception are used, male partners are required to use a condom with a&#xD;
                  spermicide:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Oral 2. Intravaginal 3. Transdermal b. Intrauterine device (IUD) c. Intrauterine&#xD;
        hormone-releasing system (IUS) d. Bilateral tubal ligation e. Male sterilisation (with the&#xD;
        appropriate post vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate) where&#xD;
        the vasectomised male is the sole partner for that woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
        f. True abstinence - sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if&#xD;
        defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk&#xD;
        associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be&#xD;
        evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual&#xD;
        lifestyle of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        b) Male participants must agree to the contraceptive requirements below at entry to&#xD;
        quarantine and continuing until 90 days after the date of Viral challenge / last dosing&#xD;
        with the investigational medicinal product (IMP) (whichever occurs last):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Use a condom with a spermicide to prevent pregnancy in a female partner or to prevent&#xD;
             exposure of any partner (male and female) to the IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male sterilisation with the appropriate post vasectomy documentation of the absence of&#xD;
             sperm in the ejaculate (please note that the use of condom with spermicide will still&#xD;
             be required to prevent partner exposure). This applies only to males participating in&#xD;
             the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. In addition, for female partners of childbearing potential, that partner must use&#xD;
             another form of contraception such as one of the highly effective methods mentioned&#xD;
             above for female participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. True abstinence - sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if&#xD;
             defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk&#xD;
             associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be&#xD;
             evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and&#xD;
             usual lifestyle of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        c) In addition to the contraceptive requirements above, male participants must agree not to&#xD;
        donate sperm following discharge from quarantine until 90 days after the date of Viral&#xD;
        Challenge/last dosing with IMP (whichever occurs last).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. For Part 2 of the study: Sero-suitable to the challenge virus, as defined in the study&#xD;
        Analytical Plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medical History&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of, or currently active, symptoms or signs suggestive of upper or lower&#xD;
             respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks prior to the first study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. a) Any history or evidence of any other clinically significant or currently active&#xD;
             systemic comorbidities including psychiatric disorders (includes participants with a&#xD;
             history of depression and/or anxiety).&#xD;
&#xD;
             b) And/or other major disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may put the&#xD;
             participant at undue risk, or interfere with a participant completing the study and&#xD;
             necessary investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The following conditions apply:&#xD;
&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study was conducted in 2 parts: Part 1 (PK sentinel part) and Part 2 (viral challenge part).&#xD;
Part 1: Open-label. This part of the study was used to determine the dose of Palivizumab IV for Part 2 (8 or 15 mg/kg).&#xD;
Part 2: Double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled. Participants received a single IV dose of either Palivizumab (8 mg/kg, as finally determined in Part 1) or a placebo and were subsequently challenged with an RSV-A strain.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The PK assessment up to and including Day 12 exposure was used as a decision information for the dose to be given to participants in Part 2. Pharmacokinetic exposure data from at least 5 out of 6 participants were required for dose decision making with a projected exposure of ≥40 μg/mL on Day 12 according to the protocol.&#xD;
This was achieved after administration of a single IV dose of Palivizumab at 8 mg/kg. Therefore, a dose of 8 mg/kg was chosen for Part 2.</description>
        <time_frame>In Part 1: before the start of infusion; at end of infusion,15 minutes and 0.5, 1, 4, 8, and 12 hours after infusion; and at 1, 2, 3, 7, and 12 days after infusion.</time_frame>
        <population>All participants treated had at least 1 post-dose PK result; therefore, all participants were included in the PK analysis population. One participant had an interrupted IV infusion of Palivizumab but received the complete dose of 8 mg/kg.</population>

        <title>Total Symptom Score (TSS)-Time Curve (AUC) Collected Daily in the Participant Symptom Diary Card</title>
        <description>Mean TSS values (collected daily in the symptom diary card) over time. Symptoms were collected using the hVIVO (services provider) symptom diary card. Several symptoms (such as runny nose, sore throat, earache, etc) in the 13-item questionnaire were graded on a scale of 0-3 (grade 0: No symptoms; grade 1: just noticeable; grade 2: clearly bothersome from time to time but does not interfere with me doing my normal daily activities; grade 3: Quite bothersome most or all of the time, and it stops me participating in activities). Shortness of breath and wheeze have an additional grade 4: Symptoms at rest. The total symptom score (TSS) was determined as the sum of the symptom scores ranging from 0.0 (min) to 41(max) [or a maximum of 41x11.33=464.67 depending on what the reviewer is asking] using a 13-items self-reported diary card. 11.33 is the number of days symptom diary cards were included (Day +1 morning dairy card to Day 12 morning diary card). Higher scores mean worse outcome.</description>
