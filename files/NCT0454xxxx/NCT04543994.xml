      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of using remestemcel-L, an&#xD;
      ex vivo culture-expanded adult allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell product&#xD;
      (MSCs) delivered by targeted endoscopic delivery to treat people for medically refractory&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll adult patients with medically refractory ulcerative colitis who are&#xD;
      planning to switch biologic therapy or undergo colectomy as the next stage in their treatment&#xD;
      plan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory disease of the colon and&#xD;
      rectum, which continues to increase in incidence for unknown reasons, resulting in a&#xD;
      significant burden to the healthcare system. UC is characterized by persistent mucosal&#xD;
      inflammation of the colon and rectum with a chronic remitting and relapsing behavior which&#xD;
      leaves patients on chronic immunosuppression and hospitalizations to treat the disease&#xD;
      symptoms, but unable to cure the disease. Despite the ever-growing armamentarium of&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medication, up to 30% of patients still require a colectomy for medically&#xD;
      refractory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with medically refractory ulcerative colitis will be treated by targeted&#xD;
      endoscopic delivery of remestemcel-L, an ex vivo culture expanded allogeneic bone marrow&#xD;
      derived mesenchymal stem cell product at a dose of 150 or 300 million. This will be injected&#xD;
      into the submucosal layer of the colon and rectal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a second dose of remestemcel-L at a dose of 150 or 300 million MSCs&#xD;
      (same dose as initial). If at 3 months post injection of remestemcel-L there is clinical&#xD;
      remission, escalation of medical management and/or surgery will be delayed and patients&#xD;
      observed. If there is worsening or no improvement in treated patients, then patients will&#xD;
      proceed with escalation of medical management or colectomy as per standard of care. Control&#xD;
      patients without improvement will cross over to receive remestemcel-L at 3 months and may be&#xD;
      retreated at 6 months. All patients will be followed for two years post initial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a total of 4 cohorts of 3 patients (2 treatment:1 control) receiving the 150&#xD;
      million MSC dose of study drug and a total of 4 cohorts of 3 patients (2 treatment:1 control)&#xD;
      receiving 300 million MSCs dose of study drug. This study plans to enroll a total of 24&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of endoscopic&#xD;
      injection of remestemcel-L, an ex vivo culture expanded allogeneic bone marrow derived&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cell product for treatment of medically refractory ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
