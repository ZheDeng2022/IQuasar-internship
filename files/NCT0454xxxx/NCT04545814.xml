  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, single-center pilot study in which 10 patients with one to four brain&#xD;
      metastases diagnosed on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within the past 30 days will&#xD;
      be evaluated for study eligibility and enrolled as appropriate.&#xD;

      INTERVENTION: Enrolled patients will receive stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to all&#xD;
      metastases followed by surgical resection of resectable metastases within one to 10 days&#xD;
      following SRS. Pathologic specimens will be analyzed, and the patient will enter a standard&#xD;
      pattern of surveillance (brain MRI every three months for two years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY RATIONALE: Given the increased risk of leptomeningeal failure with surgery followed by&#xD;
      SRS as well as the risk of radiation necrosis, new paradigms in therapy delivery and&#xD;
      sequencing are being explored. Areas of investigation include optimization of target volume,&#xD;
      marginal expansion, multi-fractionation, timeliness of SRS after surgery, and delivery of SRS&#xD;
      prior to surgical resection. In theory, advantages of preoperative SRS include better target&#xD;
      delineation, sterilization of tumor cells prior to surgical disruption of the tumor, vascular&#xD;
      supply, and CSF spaces, and resection of tissue that would otherwise be at risk of radiation&#xD;
      necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2014, Asher, et al. (Asher AL, Burri SH, Wiggins WF, et al. A new treatment paradigm:&#xD;
      neoadjuvant radiosurgery before surgical resection of brain metastases with analysis of local&#xD;
      tumor recurrence. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 2014;88:899-906.) reported that the use of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant SRS prior to surgery was both safe and effective (even for metastases &gt;3 cm) with&#xD;
      no reported leptomeningeal recurrences or radiation necrosis. More recently, Patel et al.&#xD;
      (Patel KR, Burri SH, Asher AL, et al. Comparing Preoperative With Postoperative Stereotactic&#xD;
      Radiosurgery for Resectable Brain Metastases: A Multi-institutional Analysis. Neurosurgery&#xD;
      2016;79:279-85.) performed a retrospective comparison of preoperative versus postoperative&#xD;
      SRS and reported no difference in local control, distant brain failure, or overall survival.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the authors reported significantly lower rates of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis&#xD;
      and radiation necrosis with preoperative SRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Huff, et al. (Huff WX, Agrawal N, Shapiro S, et al. Efficacy of pre-operative stereotactic&#xD;
      radiosurgery followed by surgical resection and correlative radiobiological analysis for&#xD;
      patients with 1-4 brain metastases: study protocol for a phase II trial. Radiat Oncol&#xD;
      2018;13:252.) recently published a protocol for a phase II prospective trial designed to&#xD;
      compare outcomes using preoperative SRS versus historically cited outcomes for postoperative&#xD;
      SRS. This pilot study mirrors this design and aims to confirm study feasibility and to assess&#xD;
      local control, central nervous system (CNS) progression-free survival, overall survival,&#xD;
      rates of leptomeningeal spread, rates of radiation necrosis, and quality of life measures&#xD;
      with the use of preoperative SRS.&#xD;
