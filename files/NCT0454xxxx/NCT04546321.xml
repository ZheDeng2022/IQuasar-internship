  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a comparative prospective and observational study conducted at Neonatal Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit (NICU) in Assiut University Children Hospital. All cases of perinatal asphyxia and TTN&#xD;
      admitted to the NICU during the period 12-2016 to 6-2018 were included. All the included&#xD;
      newborns were examined and the serum level of total L carnitine was measured. Then we&#xD;
      compared the demographic data and investigation of cases with HIE with the outcome of those&#xD;
      cases. Results: It was found that serum level of total L carnitine decreased in both HIE and&#xD;
      TTN cases but without significant difference with mean 5.51 ± 1.30 umol/l in group I vs 6.22&#xD;
      ± 2.56 umol/l in group II. The male factor with changes in the serum sodium (132.63 ± 9.30)&#xD;
      and abnormal serum creatinine level [1.4 (0.7-15.0)] were significantly related to the&#xD;
      outcome of cases with HIE&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective comparative and observational study included all the full-term HIE and&#xD;
      TTN cases admitted to NICU of the University Children Hospital during the period of December&#xD;
      2016 to June 2018. The newborns with perinatal asphyxia who died before admission,&#xD;
      gestational age&lt;37wks and those with congenital anomalies were excluded. The study included&#xD;
      35 HIE Patients and 12 TTN patients. All cases were subjected to full perinatal history and&#xD;
      clinical examination. HIE cases were classified clinically by Sarnat staging (Sarnat and&#xD;
      Sarnat, 1976) [10]. HIE cases were subjected to investigations as capillary blood gases,&#xD;
      complete blood count (CBC), and electrolytes, renal function. The demographic data and the&#xD;
      results of HIE investigations will be correlated to the outcome. The serum level of total L&#xD;
      carnitine was measured for both HIE and TTN cases by sending 1 ml of newborn serum frozen to&#xD;
      be analyzed by human ELIZA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay) kit (SinoGeneClon Biotech&#xD;
      Co.,Ltd) within the 1st week of life and compared with each other. Normal range in males and&#xD;
      females 17.4-58.7umol/l. the&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data entry and data analysis were done using SPSS version 22 (Statistical Package for Social&#xD;
      Science). Data were presented as number, percentage, mean, standard deviation and median.&#xD;
      Chi-square and Fisher Exact tests were used to compare between qualitative variables.&#xD;
      Independent samples t-test was used to compare quantitative variables between two groups and&#xD;
      ANOVA test for more than two groups in case of parametric data. Mann-Whitney test was used to&#xD;
      compare quantitative variables between groups in case of non-parametric data. P-value&#xD;
      considered statistically significant when P &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included 35 cases of HIE (group I) and 12 cases of TTN (group II) all cases were&#xD;
      full-term babies there was no significance between the two groups in the demographic data&#xD;
      (sex, weight and maternal age) . There were (19) 54.3% females and (16) 47.7% males in the&#xD;
      first group versus 33.3% females and 66.7% males in the 2nd group.The mean birth weight for&#xD;
      the first group was 2.78 ± 0.50 kg versus 2.86 ± 0.28 kg in the second group. There were 22&#xD;
      cases and 11 cases delivered by cesarean section in the 1st group and the 2nd group&#xD;
      respectively. There were 13 cases and 1 case delivered by normal vaginal delivery in group I&#xD;
      and group II respectively. On comparison between the two groups in measuring the serum level&#xD;
      of total L carnitine. The serum level of total L carnitine had decreased in both groups with&#xD;
      a mean of 5.51 ± 1.30 umol/l in group I versus 6.22 ± 2.56 umol/l in group II. Then after&#xD;
      correlation between the demographic data and investigations of cases of HIE with the outcome&#xD;
      there was a significant correlation between male factor and death by deaths of 66% of males&#xD;
      with HIE and also there was a significant correlation between the outcome and grade III of&#xD;
      HIE ( 86.7% of grade III died) .There were a significant correlation between hyponatremia&#xD;
      (132.63 ± 9.30) with death of HIE cases and abnormal serum creatinine [1.4 (0.7-15.0)] with&#xD;
      death of HIE cases.&#xD;
