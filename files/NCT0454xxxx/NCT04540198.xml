  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the population of older adults grows, almost doubling in size from 2012 to 2040, so too&#xD;
      will the need for family caregiving. Caregiving can lead to negative psychosocial outcomes&#xD;
      such as depression, anxiety, and burden; social isolation and family conflict: financial&#xD;
      strain due to costs of care; and some caregivers also experience negative health&#xD;
      consequences. This project will test the value of GamePlan4Care (GP4C) an evidence-based,&#xD;
      internet-enabled system capable of providing immediate, tailored education and skills&#xD;
      training to caregivers who can access live support from a DCS via phone or web-based video.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Daily care and supervision of a person living with dementia (PWD) has been defined as&#xD;
      &quot;intense caregiving&quot; and is associated with significant daily burdens and an overall threat&#xD;
      to the caregiver's quality of life. Despite evidence suggesting that negative consequence can&#xD;
      be remediated with community-based supports, those services remain allusive to caregivers due&#xD;
      to the systemic challenges of turning interventions into services. This study is based on a&#xD;
      practical approach of applying technology to an existing evidence-based intervention,&#xD;
      Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health II (REACH II), refined with real-world&#xD;
      user feedback and rigorously tested with the goal of creating an online family caregiver&#xD;
      support system that has the potential of both scalability and sustainability. This two-group&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial will compare the relative impact of GP4C to an education-based&#xD;
      online site called Resources4Care (R4C) on a wide range of family caregiver outcomes. Family&#xD;
      caregivers will be randomized to one of the two conditions and will complete an assessment&#xD;
      battery at baseline and at the 6-month follow-up.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline Caregiving Burden at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and six months</time_frame>
    <description>A 12-item version of the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview. The Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview (ZBI) is an assessment tool for evaluating caregiver burden. The ZBI consists of 12 items representing a statement related to some aspect of perceived burden. Respondents (i.e., caregivers) rate each item ranging 0 (=never) to 4 (=nearly always). Total ZBI score is the summation of 12 items ranging from 0 to 48. Higher scores indicate greater burden.</description>

    <description>Levels of depressed symptoms:&#xD;
A 10-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CESD) Scale is an assessment tool for evaluating depression. Each item represents a statement for which respondents indicate how often in the past week they have felt that way from 0 (= rarely or none of the time) to 3 (= most or almost all of the time). Total score is the summation of 10 items ranging from 0 to 30. Higher scores indicate higher levels of depressed symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Self-rated health at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and six months</time_frame>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Social Support at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and six months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of availability of support and satisfaction with support from others:&#xD;
Two constructs from Social Provision Scale (reliable alliance and guidance) are used to evaluate social support. Two constructs assess availability of support and satisfaction with support from others. Four items for each construct (total of 8 items) describe a statement for which respondents agree to what extent their relationships are with other people from 1 (= strongly disagree) to 4 (=strongly agree). A total score is the summation of 8 items ranging from 8 to 32. Higher scores indicate higher levels of social support.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Interaction with Health Care Providers at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and six months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of the frequency and experiences of medical care management and coordination for care-recipients:&#xD;
9 items from the National Study of Caregiving (NSOC) ask about experiences and frequency of caregiver's interactions with care-recipients' health care providers. Each item represents a statement for which respondents indicate how often in the last 6 months they interact with health care providers/workers.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Caregiver stress at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and six months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of levels of stress:&#xD;
The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is an assessment tool for evaluating stress level. The PSS consists of 10 stress items. Each item represents how often in the last month respondents felt that way from 0 (=never) to 4 (=very often). A total score is the summation of 10 items ranging from 0 to 40. Higher scores indicate higher levels of stress.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline reported positive aspects of caregiving at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and six months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of favorable aspects of caregiving experiences:&#xD;
An 11-item of Positive Aspect of caregiving (PAC) is an assessment tool for evaluating favorable aspects of caregiving experiences. Each item represents a statement of mental or affective state related to caregiving experiences. Respondents rate to what extent the each statement corresponds to their mental or affective state ranging from 0 (=disagree a lot) to 4 (=agree a lot). A total score is the summation of 11 items ranging from 0 to 44. Higher scores indicate higher levels of positive experiences of caregiving.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline neuropsychiatric symptoms in Care-recipient/corresponding caregiver distress at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Presence and severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms and levels of relevant caregiving distress :&#xD;
Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire-Q (NPI-Q), a 12-item self-administered questionnaire (NPI-Q), completed by the caregivers about care-recipients for whom they care, is a tool to assess the presence and severity of 12 Neuropsychiatric Symptoms (NPS) in patients with dementia, as well as the caregiver's corresponding distress. Each item asks the presence (1=yes, 0=no), severity (1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe), and caregiving distress (0=not at all; 5=extreme or very severe).</description>

    <time_frame>At six months only</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of Attitude toward GP4C/R4C system:&#xD;
A 30-items of USE questionnaire will evaluate participant's attitude toward GP4C system. The USE questionnaire includes four areas: assess usefulness (8 items), ease of use (11 items), ease of learning (4 items), and satisfaction (7 items). Respondents rate agreement with the statements, ranging from strongly disagree (=1) to strongly agree (=7). Total scores are the summation of items on each area. Higher scores in each are indicate more useful, easier to use, easier to learn, and more satisfied on their experience.</description>

    <description>Participants in this arm will receive access to Resources4Care (R4C), a feature-limited version GamePlan4Care system. R4C will serve as an online hub for articles and videos about Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Educational topics will included information on: 1) Alzheimer's Disease &amp; Dementia, 2) Caregiving, 3) Caregiver Stress and 4) Home Safety. R4C will present a page on each topic with active links to two additional online sources on the same topic. Study participants assigned to R4C will receive two emails from their DCS encouraging the caregiver to review specific education materials. Each email will be followed by brief &quot;check-in&quot; calls (15-min each) at three months and five months after randomization.</description>
