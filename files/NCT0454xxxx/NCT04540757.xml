  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to explore how lung cancer patients and their family carers are&#xD;
      affected by different types of cancer treatment. The investigators are focusing on a&#xD;
      particular type of lung cancer called Stage III N2. N2 means the cancer has spread just&#xD;
      outside the lung to the lymph nodes. There are two main treatments available in the UK for&#xD;
      this type of lung cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. surgery PLUS chemo radiotherapy or chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. radiotherapy PLUS chemotherapy Patients live for a similar length of time with either&#xD;
           treatment option so it is difficult for patients and health professionals to know which&#xD;
           treatment to choose. It is important to understand the impact of the treatment on&#xD;
           patients in their daily lives. Patients will be allocated at random to receive one of&#xD;
           the two treatments options. Patients and carers will complete questionnaires and take&#xD;
           part in interviews. The results of this study will help the investigators decide if a&#xD;
           larger study should be conducted in the future.&#xD;

      The investigators aim to explore how lung cancer patients and their family carers are&#xD;
      affected by different types of cancer treatment.The information collected will help patients&#xD;
      and their carers in the future to make decisions about the best treatment option for them.&#xD;
      The investigators are focusing on a particular type of lung cancer called Stage III N2. N2&#xD;
      means the cancer has spread just outside the lung to the lymph nodes. Around 2500 patients a&#xD;
      year in the UK are diagnosed with this type of lung cancer. There are two main treatments&#xD;
      available in the UK:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. surgery PLUS chemo radiotherapy or chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. radiotherapy PLUS chemotherapy Patients live for a similar length of time with either&#xD;
           treatment option so it is difficult for patients and health professionals to know which&#xD;
           treatment to choose. Research has not explored how the two different treatments offered&#xD;
           affect individual patients and their carer. It is important to understand the impact of&#xD;
           the treatment on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Emotional well-being&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Day to day activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other research studies including N2 lung cancer patients have struggled with patient&#xD;
      recruitment. This study design will show us if it is possible to run this type of research&#xD;
      with this group of patients. Patients will be allocated at random to receive one of the two&#xD;
      treatments options: 1) surgery PLUS chemo radiotherapy or chemotherapy 2) radiotherapy PLUS&#xD;
      chemotherapy Patients and carers will complete questionnaires and take part in interviews.&#xD;
      Health professionals will also be asked to take part in interviews. These interviews will&#xD;
      help the investigators to understand their experience of recruiting patients to this study.&#xD;
      The results of this study will help the investigators decide if a larger study should be&#xD;
      conducted in the future.&#xD;
