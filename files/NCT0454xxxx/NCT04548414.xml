  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the one-carbon metabolism of macrophages was&#xD;
      significantly up-regulated, the expression of key enzyme 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate&#xD;
      reductase increased. In vitro experiments we found that LPS stimulation can increase the&#xD;
      expression of MTHFR mRNA and protein in macrophages, suggesting that aerobic glycolysis may&#xD;
      trigger cytokine storm through one-carbon metabolism. Homocysteine (homocysteine, Hcy) is an&#xD;
      important intermediate product of one-carbon metabolism. A number of studies have shown that&#xD;
      Hcy is positively correlated with the level of pro-inflammatory factors, significantly&#xD;
      enhancing cytokine storm. However, the relationship between Hcy and serum pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      factors in patients with sepsis and the effect of Hcy on the prognosis of patients with&#xD;
      sepsis are still unclear. Based on the previous work, our research group intends to carry out&#xD;
      single-center, prospective, observational clinical research to observe the relationship&#xD;
      between homocysteine and the mortality of patients with sepsis, and to provide new indicators&#xD;
      for accurately judging the prognosis of sepsis , To provide new targets for clinical&#xD;
      development of drugs for the treatment of sepsis.&#xD;
