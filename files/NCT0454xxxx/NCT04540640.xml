    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation remains the best treatment option for patients with end-stage kidney&#xD;
      failure, however, the need for transplantable organs far exceeds the number of acceptable&#xD;
      grafts available from deceased donors. In an effort to increase access to transplantation,&#xD;
      organs from higher risk donors are being used more frequently. Patients who receive these&#xD;
      high risk kidneys are more likely to experience poor outcomes post-transplantation, such as&#xD;
      delayed graft function and shorter graft survival than those who receive standard criteria&#xD;
      donor kidneys. One way to improve outcomes in these high risk kidneys is to limit the amount&#xD;
      of damage donor organs sustain during the transplant process. The current standard of care is&#xD;
      storage of the donor organ on ice until the time of transplant, during which the kidney&#xD;
      incurs injury from cold and lack of oxygen. Recent research suggests that oxygenated machine&#xD;
      perfusion of the organ at room temperature as a storage method can help protect kidneys and&#xD;
      improve post-transplant outcomes. This study aims to assess the feasibility and safety of&#xD;
      room temperature oxygenated machine perfusion of donor kidneys prior to transplantation.&#xD;
      Kidney function will be evaluated with standard clinical parameters and participants will be&#xD;
      followed for one-year post-transplantation for their outcomes. Feasibility will be evaluated&#xD;
      in terms of trial process such as recruitment rate and ease of implementation of the study&#xD;
      intervention. Preliminary safety will be assessed by incidence of graft discard and technical&#xD;
      limitations.&#xD;

      Kidney transplantation remains the treatment of choice for patients suffering from end-stage&#xD;
      renal disease. To combat the ever-increasing waiting list, higher risk organs, including&#xD;
      those from donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors, and older donors are being&#xD;
      transplanted more frequently. However, organs from these donors are more susceptible to&#xD;
      damage during the transplant procedure known as ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and show&#xD;
      worse outcomes post-transplant such as increased rates of primary non-function, delayed graft&#xD;
      function and early graft loss. Therefore, strategies to mitigate IRI are of great interest to&#xD;
      improve transplant outcomes. One method of interest is modification of organ storage&#xD;
      techniques during the transplant process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard of care for organ preservation is static cold storage or hypoxic&#xD;
      hypothermic pulsatile perfusion of the donor organ. Our pre-clinical studies in a porcine DCD&#xD;
      transplant model indicate that perfusion at room temperature is capable of significantly&#xD;
      reducing kidney inflammation and damage during the transplant process compared to cold&#xD;
      storage and normothermic perfusion. While other trials have looked at hypothermic and&#xD;
      normothermic perfusion, to the best of our knowledge there has not been a trial to evaluate&#xD;
      subnormothermic perfusion of kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study intervention will consist of ex vivo perfusion of donor kidneys using a clinical&#xD;
      pulsatile pump modified with an oxygen delivery unit developed by our laboratory. Once organs&#xD;
      arrive at the transplant centre they will be attached to the pump by the transplant surgery&#xD;
      team and/or perfusionist. Prior to placement on pump, a baseline tissue sample of the kidney&#xD;
      will be taken via needle core biopsy. Kidneys will be perfused with a preservation solution&#xD;
      composed of a bloodless oxygen carrier. Organs will be perfused for 1-10 hours depending on&#xD;
      the clinical timeline of the transplant. The kidney will be transplanted into the recipient&#xD;
      as per clinical standard. After reperfusion of the kidney in the recipient, another study&#xD;
      tissue sample will be collected via needle core biopsy. Pre-implantation and post-perfusion&#xD;
      baseline biopsies are performed as clinical standards, but a small sample of the biopsy&#xD;
      specimen will be stored for analysis in our laboratory. Study participants (n=15) will be&#xD;
      followed for 1 year post-transplant and their graft function will be assessed using standard&#xD;
      clinical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to determine the feasibility and preliminary safety of&#xD;
      subnormothermic perfusion. Feasibility will be assessed by ease of implementation of study&#xD;
      procedures and recruitment rate. Safety will be determined from rate of graft discard&#xD;
      attributed to study intervention, graft function and technical limitations of the study&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
