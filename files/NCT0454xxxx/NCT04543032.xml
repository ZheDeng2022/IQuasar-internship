  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a common chronic complication of diabetes mellitus which&#xD;
      results in high public health costs and has a huge impact on patients' quality of life. It&#xD;
      leads to sensory and motor deficits, which often result in mobility-related dysfunction, and&#xD;
      alterations in gait characteristics. These alternations in gait performance cause increase in&#xD;
      the risk of fall, which has the strongest association with symptoms of depression in patients&#xD;
      with diabetes. However, little is known about possible treatment strategies for improving&#xD;
      gait ability and reduce risk of fall in patients with diabetic neuropathy. So, the purpose of&#xD;
      this study will be to investigate the effect of sensorimotor training on ankle muscle&#xD;
      strength, gait and quality of life in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if there is an effect for sensorimotor training on gait, ankle muscle strength&#xD;
      and quality of life in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, the patient will be&#xD;
      assessed before and after 6 weeks of treatment by measurement of ankle muscles strength using&#xD;
      isokinetic dynamometer, measurement of different spatiotemporal gait parameters using gait&#xD;
      trainer instrument , and assessment of quality of life of the patients using HRQL&#xD;
      questionnaire (SF-36) before and after the treatment sessions.&#xD;

    <description>Speed of walking is one of time variables for measurement of kinematic gait analysis. It measured by (meter/second).&#xD;
It will be measured using the Biodex Gait Trainer: It is a device designed specifically for assessment, rehabilitation and retraining of gait for all patients, which composed of a treadmill with an instrumented deck that monitors and records kinematic gait parameters with a high resolution color touch screen (Liquid-Crystal Display) attached to the treadmill to control the device settings and display results.</description>

    <measure>Measurement of step length</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Step length is one of distance variables for measurement of kinematic gait analysis. It is the linear distance from the posterior aspect of the heel of one foot to the posterior aspect of the heel of the opposite foot and measured by (meter)&#xD;
It will be measured using the Biodex Gait Trainer</description>

    <description>Stride length is one of distance variables for measurement of kinematic gait analysis. It is the linear distance from the posterior aspect of the heel of one foot to the posterior aspect of the heel of the same foot and measured by (meter)&#xD;

    <measure>Muscle strength of ankle dorsiflexors and plantar flexors</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The strength of the dorsiflexors and plantar flexors muscles of the ankle will be measured by Biodex Isokinetic dynamometer system (Biodex Medical Incorporated., Shirley, New York, USA).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured by the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire.&#xD;
The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale.&#xD;
The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.&#xD;
The eight sections are:&#xD;
vitality&#xD;
physical functioning&#xD;
bodily pain&#xD;
general health perceptions&#xD;
physical role functioning&#xD;
emotional role functioning&#xD;
social role functioning&#xD;
mental health</description>

    <description>Sensorimotor exercises progressed from stable surfaces to unstable surfaces, training gait in a line (tandem walk or walking straight) followed by gait including change in directions, gait without obstacles to gait with obstacles, change in the support base (feet apart and then together), physical exercises with eyes opened and closed, always respecting the functional capacity of each patient and progressively increasing the difficulty of each exercise. To help the training, cones, balance board, bars, mats and a mini-trampoline will be used. According to the patient progress, the exercises will be combined, generating circuits</description>
