  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic airway inflammation rich in eosinophils is an important feature seen in asthma.&#xD;
      Airway and blood eosinophilia is associated with increased rates of asthma exacerbations and&#xD;
      more intense treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the existence of two distinct eosinophils subtypes was revealed-lung-resident&#xD;
      eosinophils (rEOS), which maturate independently to interleukin (IL) 5, with the primary&#xD;
      function to maintain tissue homeostasis, and inflammatory eosinophils (iEOS), which mature in&#xD;
      IL-5-dependent manner and are mainly involved in immune responses. Eosinophils' effect on the&#xD;
      airway remodeling in asthma depends not only on the activity but also by their viable number&#xD;
      in the lungs. Blood iEOS infiltrate the airways mainly after the environmental stimulus like&#xD;
      allergen and leave the airways with bronchial secretions. However, rEOS reside lung tissue&#xD;
      for their entire lifetime regulating local immunity. Blood rEOS and iEOS ratio alters in&#xD;
      asthma, compared with healthy controls. It is known that the predominant eosinophils subtype&#xD;
      in allergic asthma are iEOS, while rEOS are basic subtype in severe eosinophilic asthma&#xD;
      patients, moreover, they are different in adhesive properties and survivability as well.&#xD;
      Distinct biological properties allows to speculate about their different functions in asthma,&#xD;
      however, there are still little information. Data about differently expressed microRNA&#xD;
      (miRNA) profiles in eosinophils in asthma suggests, that eosinophils subtypes can be distinct&#xD;
      in non-coding RNA (ncRNA) - microRNA (miRNA), piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) and long&#xD;
      non-coding RNA (IncRNA) profiles that could describe their role in asthma pathogenesis and&#xD;
      act as biomarkers to discern asthma phenotypes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is not cured, and only well-balanced treatment can control the course and severity of&#xD;
      the disease. Most clinical symptoms rise from aberrant chronic airway inflammation mostly&#xD;
      eosinophilic. Eosinophils are terminally differentiated granulocytes that actively contribute&#xD;
      to innate and adaptive inflammatory cascades through the production and release of diverse&#xD;
      chemokines, cytokines, lipid mediators and other growth factors. IL-5 plays a fundamental&#xD;
      role in eosinophils maturation in the bone marrow, their recruitment, and activation at sites&#xD;
      of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically eosinophils were described as a critical player in host defense, including&#xD;
      parasites, viruses, fungi, or bacteria, giving them a destructive inflammatory cell label.&#xD;
      However, it became clear that steady-state eosinophils can contribute to the immunoregulation&#xD;
      and tissue homeostasis as well. Studies revealed that there are distinct eosinophils subtypes&#xD;
      - immunoregulatory lung-resident eosinophils (rEOS) and inflammatory eosinophils (iEOS),&#xD;
      involved in immune responses. Distinct eosinophils subtypes with different functions&#xD;
      determines the separate treatment. There are still only a few studies describing distinct&#xD;
      eosinophils subtypes in the lungs or blood. It is the beginning of a new promising research&#xD;
      area for better individualized eosinophilic asthma treatment, moreover, other eosinophilic&#xD;
      diseases as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood eosinophils studies are sufficiently relevant to the tissue eosinophils&#xD;
      studies, as blood eosinophils are released into the bloodstream in a fully maturated form.&#xD;
      Moreover, peripheral blood study could give additional information with possibilities to&#xD;
      prevent eosinophils effects in the early stage, before migration to the airways. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the existence of tissue-resident eosinophils in peripheral blood is confirmed and primary&#xD;
      research for eosinophil subtypes surface markers was made according to the data of human&#xD;
      blood eosinophils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data about differently differently expressed microRNA (miRNA) profiles in eosinophils in&#xD;
      asthma suggests, that eosinophils subtypes can be distinct in non-coding RNA (ncRNA) -&#xD;
      microRNA (miRNA), piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) and long non-coding RNA (IncRNA) profiles that&#xD;
      could describe their role in asthma pathogenesis and act as biomarkers to discern asthma&#xD;
      phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers have plan to expand research by analyzing non-coding RNA (ncRNA) - miRNA, piRNA&#xD;
      and lncRNA profiles of rEOS and iEOS as well as selected ncRNA signatures in blood plasma&#xD;
      estimating their diagnostic value. Moreover, additional investigation of ncRNA in&#xD;
      eosinophil-derived exosomes will provide important data about possible effect of eosinophils&#xD;
      subtypes on airway remodeling via secreted ncRNA. ncRNAs are key regulators for gene&#xD;
      transcription. However, there is evidence about their dysregulation in eosinophils during&#xD;
      asthma. It will give important information about molecular signaling pathways that regulate&#xD;
      the activity of distinct eosinophil subtypes during health and asthma, and provide the&#xD;
      essential information about possible new therapeutic targets for their control. Additionally&#xD;
      researchers will investigate the biological differences between rEOS and iEOS, including&#xD;
      surface integrins and eosinophilopoietins receptors expression, adhesive properties,&#xD;
      survivability, synthesized reactive oxygen species and apoptosis, as well as their effect on&#xD;
      pulmonary structural cells physiological activity as proliferation, apoptosis, migration,&#xD;
      contractility and proteins production, and will relate it with molecular signaling pathways,&#xD;
      regulated by distinct expressed ncRNAs. ncRNAs can be stored in eosinophils exosomes and&#xD;
      expressed to the surrounding environment. Information about ncRNAs in eosinophils-derived&#xD;
      exosomes will demonstrate their function by affecting the other cells, especially after&#xD;
      migration to airways. Moreover, ncRNAs are stable and resistant to blood RNases and&#xD;
      differentially expressed in several pathologies. Researchers suppose that altered blood&#xD;
      levels of ncRNAs could act as a possible new diagnostic biomarker in asthma.&#xD;
