  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the incidence and risk factors of ethanol-induced symptoms, this multicenter,&#xD;
      prospective, observational study is designed to include patients in Korea who are receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy with ethanol-containing docetaxel alone or in combination. Subjects who&#xD;
      voluntarily provide written informed consent to provide information for this study and meet&#xD;
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be given an enrollment number and will be followed&#xD;
      during the observation period to collect study-related data in the Case Report Forms (CRFs)&#xD;
      as predefined in the study protocol. Patients' decision to participate (or not) in this study&#xD;
      will not affect their treatment (physician's prescriptions or diagnostic/therapeutic&#xD;
      decisions).&#xD;

      Ethanol-induced symptoms questionnaire will be administered three times during the baseline&#xD;
      visit (Visit 1) - before, during, and within 30 minutes after treatment with docetaxel - and&#xD;
      then during the follow-up visit (or phone call) at 24 hours after the treatment. There will&#xD;
      be no restrictions as to what concomitant medications can be used before and after treatment&#xD;
      with ethanol-containing docetaxel, and investigators will determine the manufacturer,&#xD;
      preparation method, and dosage regimen of docetaxel as per routine care at their study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics (gender, age, drinking history)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height, body weight and body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cancer-related data (diagnosis, date of diagnosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG PS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Underlying diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior and concomitant medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data on docetaxel therapy (timing of initiation of the chemotherapy,&#xD;
           monotherapy/combination therapy, intervals between chemotherapy treatments, product&#xD;
           name, dose (mg), administered ethanol dose (g), blood alcohol content (BAC*), type and&#xD;
           volume of intravenous (IV) fluid administered before and after treatment and fluid mixed&#xD;
           with docetaxel, duration of injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
           * Blood alcohol content (BAC): Widmark formula = administered ethanol dose (g) / body&#xD;
           weight (kg) × gender constant (0.68 for males and 0.55 for females)&#xD;
