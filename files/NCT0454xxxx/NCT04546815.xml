  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to collect and analyze clinical data of daptomycin to explore the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of daptomycin in the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections. And optimize&#xD;
      the dosing regimen based on these data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the gradual increase in the detection rate of drug-resistant bacteria, bloodstream&#xD;
      infections, skin and soft tissue infections, infective endocarditis and other infectious&#xD;
      diseases caused by MRSA, MRCNS, and VRE have greatly increased patient mortality and medical&#xD;
      burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daptomycin has strong anti-bacterial activity and rapid sterilization. It is almost 100%&#xD;
      sensitive to common Gram-positive bacteria. Both domestic and foreign guidelines recommend&#xD;
      its use for the treatment of infectious diseases such as bacteremia, central venous&#xD;
      catheter-related bloodstream infections, infective endocarditis, skin and soft tissue&#xD;
      infections, bone and joint infections，and so on. However, there is a lack of actual clinical&#xD;
      use of daptomycin in China, as well as efficacy and safety assessments based on real world&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to collect and analyze data on the use of daptomycin in the real&#xD;
      world. The clinical cure rate and inefficiency, temperature drop time, 28-day mortality rate&#xD;
      are the primary outcome measures, and the overall incidence of adverse events, the results of&#xD;
      CPK monitoring and its correlation with dose, renal function, length of hospital stay, and&#xD;
      treatment costs are secondary outcome measures to investigate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      daptomycin in the treatment of gram-positive bacterial infection.&#xD;

After the end of the treatment, all the symptoms and signs of the patients at the time of inclusion continued or worsened.&#xD;
Recurrence.&#xD;
Termination of treatment due to adverse reactions.</description>

    <measure>Bacteria clearance rate (if available, such as bacteremia)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day of the end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Bacterial clearance includes clearance and hypothetical clearance. Bacterial clearance is defined as the specimens from the original infection site after treatment have not cultivated the pathogenic bacteria of the original infection.&#xD;
When the patient's symptoms and signs disappear so that cultivable materials cannot be obtained, or the method of obtaining specimens is too invasive for the recovered patient, the bacteriological result is considered to be a hypothetical clearance.</description>

    <time_frame>14 days of the end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events refer to adverse medical events that occur after patients or clinical trial subjects receive a drug, but they do not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment.</description>
