      Prospective multicenter open-label randomized clinical trial comparing videoconsultation to a&#xD;
      face-to-face consultation during the follow-up of apneic patients treated by continuous&#xD;
      positive pressure (CPAP) .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The annual management of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) patients treated by continuous&#xD;
      positive air pressure (CPAP) aims to maintain an optimal level of care while offering to the&#xD;
      patients a combined management of their pathology. This management aims to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the high prevalence of OSA in the general population reduces the ability to explore&#xD;
      undiagnosed patients. The contribution of videoconsultation is now available and allows the&#xD;
      management of OSA patients treated by CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to compare the videoconsultation to a face-to-face&#xD;
      consultation during the follow-up of apneic patients treated by continuous positive pressure&#xD;
      (CPAP) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study could provide very important new data on the impact of&#xD;
      videoconsultation on the monitoring a chronic respiratory pathology such as sleep apnea.&#xD;
