  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transmen who have undergone gender-affirming surgery require long-lasting treatments with&#xD;
      androgens to maintain male phenotypic characteristics and to preserve their health. In this&#xD;
      population the effects on muscle and the relative role of testosterone and its metabolite&#xD;
      dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on the skeletal muscle are still largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study, we evaluated the effects of testosterone and DHT on muscle strength,&#xD;
      body composition, metabolism. Also cutaneous androgenic effects such as acne and androgenetic&#xD;
      alopecia were evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, in this randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled pilot trial we treated&#xD;
      variectomized transmen for 54 weeks with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testosterone Undecanoate (TU) 1000 mg i.m. at weeks zero, six, 18, 30, 42 + a daily oral&#xD;
           placebo pill (TU+PL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TU 1000 mg i.m. at weeks zero, six, 18, 30, 42 + dutasteride 5 mg/day (TU+DUT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, phase III, randomized study design was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were seen every 12 weeks for safety monitoring that included evaluation of&#xD;
      hematocrit, transaminases, alkaline phosphatases and bilirubin, creatinine, urea and serum&#xD;
      electrolyte as potassium and sodium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and week-54 evaluations included the following measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      blood drawings for measurements of: hormonal profile (serum testosterone, estradiol,&#xD;
      luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, sex hormone binding&#xD;
      globulin, and thyroid stimulating hormone), haematocrit (Ht) and haemoglobin (Hb), glucidic&#xD;
      and lipidic profile (fasting glucose, fasting insulin, total cholesterol, high- and&#xD;
      low-density lipoproteins, and triglycerides), hepatic function (aspartate and alanine&#xD;
      aminotransferases) and bone related markers (osteocalcin, parathyroid hormone, bone alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase and 25-hydroxyvitamin, 24h urinary excretion of calcium, potassium, magnesium and&#xD;
      creatinine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      anthropometry: weight, measures DEXA for bone mass determination and body composition&#xD;
      Isokinetic knee extension and flexion peak torque (PT-IKE and PT-IKF) Handgrip strength&#xD;
      evalutation of the psychological profile with the brief Profile of Mood State (POMS) sexual&#xD;
      life satisfaction evalutation with a Visual Analogue General Satisfaction Scale (VAS)&#xD;
      physical examination: inspection of external genitalia (clitorides) and a visit to detect&#xD;
      appearance of acne and gynecomastia&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment phase all injections will be administered by the investigator or&#xD;
      co-investigators for the entire study. Fasting (10 hours) blood samples will be taken&#xD;
      (immediately before giving the injections) every time subjects come for injections (week 0,&#xD;
      6, 18, 30 and 42) and at the end of the treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the sexual and behavior questionnaire the subjects will judge their sexual activity and&#xD;
      behavior in the period between visits. The subjects have the possibility to making additional&#xD;
      comments about important events and disturbances.&#xD;

    <description>using a Visual Analogue General Satisfaction Scale (VAS). A VAS for satisfaction is a horizontal line of 10-cm long. At the start and finish there are two descriptors representing extremes of satisfaction (i.e. no satisfaction and extreme satisfaction). Subjects respond to the question 'Are you satisfied with your sexual life now?' and rate their satisfaction by making a vertical mark on the 100-mm line. The measurement in millimeters is converted to the same number of points ranging from zero to 10 points.</description>
