      This is a first-in-human, two-part, Phase 1 study that will characterize the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, PK, and immunogenicity of HuL001 after single ascending doses in healthy&#xD;
      subjects followed by multiple doses in MS subjects. The study will be conducted in 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part A will enroll 3 single ascending doses (SAD) cohorts in healthy subjects.&#xD;
           (HuL001:Placebo=4:2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part B will enroll 1 multiple-dose cohort in MS subjects. The proposed dose of HuL001&#xD;
           will be selected from the single-dose range of HuL001 evaluated in the healthy subjects&#xD;
           of Part A. (HuL001=6)&#xD;
