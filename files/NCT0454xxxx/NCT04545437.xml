  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim this study will be to find out which patients are at risk of heart attacks/strokes up&#xD;
      to several years after discharge from an ICU. This study will also investigate whether&#xD;
      treatments and events occurring in ICU contribute to this risk.&#xD;

      Undertake a retrospective observational cohort study of patients admitted to intensive care&#xD;
      units between 2006 and 2023.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participants: Adult patients admitted to a general adult intensive care unit at one or&#xD;
      more of the study sites between 2006 and 1st of August 2023.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the short and long-term cardiovascular consequences of critical illness and&#xD;
      identify in-ICU factors that affect them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation/flutter occurring during&#xD;
      critical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the association between poor cardiovascular function during critical illness and&#xD;
      long-term cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide new knowledge about the associations between baseline cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk, the disease resulting in ICU admission and therapies / events on ICU with subsequent&#xD;
      major adverse cardiac events (MACE), to allow the ongoing risk of these events to be&#xD;
      determined. If clinicans can idetnify who is at risk, then risk factors can potentially be&#xD;
      modified .&#xD;
