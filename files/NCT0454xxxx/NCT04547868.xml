  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disruption of the normal gastrointestinal (GI) motility is a well-known consequence of major&#xD;
      surgery. The pathophysiology behind this phenomenon is not fully understood but involves the&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system as well as a systemic stress response to surgery. A number of&#xD;
      factors interfere with GI motor activity, such as the direct manipulation of intestines&#xD;
      during surgery and the use of opioid analgesia. Post-operative ileus (POI) refers to a delay&#xD;
      in regaining GI motility beyond the anticipated normal duration of time. Signs and symptoms&#xD;
      include nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, the absence of flatus or stool in the&#xD;
      preceding 24 hours, and/or an inability to tolerate oral intake. The incidence of POI in&#xD;
      abdominal surgery is estimated to be approximately 10%-30%. Beyond increased patient&#xD;
      discomfort and distress, the development of POI is associated with increased healthcare&#xD;
      costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coffee is a popular beverage: two thirds of Canadians are coffee drinkers, averaging&#xD;
      approximately 3.2 cups per day. Coffee is composed of hundreds of chemicals, many with&#xD;
      demonstrated pharmacologic effects. The most well-known of these compounds is caffeine, known&#xD;
      to exert a stimulatory effect on the cardiovascular and nervous system. A recent systematic&#xD;
      review of 7 randomized controlled trials (N=606 colorectal and gynecology surgical patients)&#xD;
      determined that the consumption of coffee reduced the time of several measures of GI&#xD;
      recovery, such as time to tolerance of food, without any increased rate of complications or&#xD;
      adverse events although overall, the evidence was graded as low to moderate certainty, and&#xD;
      further confirmatory studies are needed. In this trial, patients aged 18 years or higher who&#xD;
      undergo laparoscopic or open abdominal surgery, with an estimated length of stay &gt; 24 hours&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive approximately one cup of either coffee, decaffeinated coffee,&#xD;
      or warm water, three times daily. This trial will be conducted under the IMPACTS (Innovative,&#xD;
      Multicentre, Patient-centred Approach to Clinical Trials in Surgery) program umbrella and&#xD;
      will follow IMPACTS methodology. For the Vanguard trial, the aim is to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility of conducting a definitive trial. Future outcomes of interest include: time to&#xD;
      first flatus, time to first bowel movement, placement of an NG tube, length of stay in&#xD;
      hospital, 30-day mortality, and 30-day postoperative complications.&#xD;

      Background/rationale: The development of POI is a common complication of surgery that is&#xD;
      detrimental to patient well-being and ultimately leads to significant healthcare costs.&#xD;
      Coffee is a popular drink among Canadians and appears to exert a positive effect on GI&#xD;
      motility. This beverage may provide an inexpensive, easily administered and well-tolerated&#xD;
      intervention to accelerate post-operative GI recovery, and thus reduce POI. The current&#xD;
      literature, while promising, is insufficient and merits further investigation in the form of&#xD;
      a high-quality randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Before embarking on a definitive RCT, this pilot trial has five specific&#xD;
      feasibility objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess our ability to accrue patients using the IMPACTS Program platform, at multiple&#xD;
           institutions, over the course of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess our ability to adaptively randomize patients and deliver the randomized&#xD;
           assignment using the IMPACTS Program platform, over the course of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess our ability to collect complete data directly from participants (patients and&#xD;
           clinicians) on time to first flatus and time to first bowel movement over the course of&#xD;
           one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To examine our ability to carry out data linkages using the IMPACTS Program platform&#xD;
           over the course of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To estimate the change in time to first flatus to inform the sample size calculation for&#xD;
           the definitive trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a multicentre, pragmatic, 3-arm parallel group Vanguard feasibility&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to consume coffee,&#xD;
      decaffeinated coffee, or warm water. If feasibility is demonstrated during the pilot trial,&#xD;
      we will plan to conduct a definitive trial. If there are only minimal changes to the&#xD;
      protocol, we will include data from the pilot phase into the definitive trial analysis (i.e.&#xD;
      a Vanguard design).&#xD;

    <description>Once the surgical team deems it appropriate to begin a clear liquid diet (in the post-operative period), approximately one cup of coffee will be provided to the patient three times daily. Additives such as cream, milk, sweetener and sugar, will be permitted. The intervention(s) will continue until a change is required as per the treating team or until hospital discharge. Patients will be asked to avoid any additional caffeine intake, such as tea, for the duration of the trial. If a patient receives an NG tube or is placed NPO by the treating team, the intervention will be halted and restarted once a clear liquid diet is restarted. All other aspects of the patients' care will be at the discretion of the treating team as per their standard practices.</description>
