  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be supplemented BFKE for a period of 8-weeks to improve skin health. The&#xD;
      objective of the study is to evaluate the 'Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL)' that&#xD;
      characterizes the skin barrier function of stratum corneum. Additional parameters include,&#xD;
      evaluation of skin moisture content, wrinkling, elasticity, sagging, radiance and also on&#xD;
      inflammatory biomarkers.&#xD;
