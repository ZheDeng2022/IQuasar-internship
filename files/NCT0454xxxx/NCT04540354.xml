      The objective of the study is to demonstrate that in post-MI patients with symptomatic heart&#xD;
      failure who receive optimal medical therapy for this condition, and with reduced LVEF ≤ 35%&#xD;
      but low risk for SCD according to a personalised risk score, optimal medical therapy without&#xD;
      ICD implantation (index group) is not inferior to optimal medical therapy with ICD&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a major public health problem, causing ~50% of cardiac&#xD;
      fatalities and accounting for ~20% of all deaths in Europe. The majority of SCD cases are&#xD;
      associated with coronary artery disease, mostly as a result of ventricular tachyarrhythmias&#xD;
      (ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation) after previous myocardial infarction&#xD;
      (MI). A predictor for increased risk of SCD after MI is a severely impaired heart function as&#xD;
      expressed by a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Based on this and on&#xD;
      historical multi-national landmark trials, which found improved survival in patients with&#xD;
      severely reduced LVEF who received an ICD, current clinical guidelines recommend prophylactic&#xD;
      ICD implantation in post-MI patients with a LVEF ≤35% to improve overall survival by&#xD;
      prevention of SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current practice of ICD implantation based solely on LVEF has significant limitations and&#xD;
      results in substantial over- and undertreatment of patients. Furthermore, current clinical&#xD;
      practice is substantially limited by the fact that it is based on out-dated evidence, a point&#xD;
      already highlighted in the last version of the ESC guidelines for prevention of SCD. Indeed,&#xD;
      since then, mortality and specifically SCD following MI has dramatically decreased. As a&#xD;
      result, the risk for SCD has decreased significantly in the last decades rendering&#xD;
      questionable whether the clinical benefits attributed to ICD implantation may not be much&#xD;
      lower nowadays than that observed in the pivotal trials conducted 15-20 years ago. Due to the&#xD;
      inherent risks and considerable costs of the ICD, detailed evaluation of the patient's risks&#xD;
      and benefits of ICD implantation is required on a case-by-case basis - leading to a&#xD;
      personalised rather than a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; treatment approach. To do so, identification&#xD;
      of low-risk patients who would not benefit from ICD implantation in parallel with&#xD;
      identification of post-MI patients who are at true high risk of SCD regardless of LVEF status&#xD;
      is urgently needed. Thus, in sum-mary there is a compelling clinical need to identify&#xD;
      patients at high individual risk for SCD in order to protect them effectively with ICD&#xD;
      implantation but at the same time refrain from ICD implantation in patients with low&#xD;
      individual risk for SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to demonstrate that in post-MI patients with symptomatic heart&#xD;
      failure who receive optimal medical therapy for this condition, and with reduced LVEF ≤ 35%&#xD;
      but low risk for SCD according to a personalised risk score, optimal medical therapy without&#xD;
      ICD implantation (index group) is not inferior to optimal medical therapy with ICD&#xD;
      implantation (control group) with respect to all-cause mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROFID-Reduced is a non-commercial, investigator-driven, prospective, parallel-group,&#xD;
      randomised, open-label, blinded outcome assessment (PROBE), multi-centre, non-inferiority&#xD;
      trial without dedicated investigational medical device (Proof of Strategy Trial) with two&#xD;
      groups with 1:1 randomi-sation. It will be conducted in about 12 European countries with more&#xD;
      than 150 clinical sites participating&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is event driven and the number of randomised patients is estimated to be 2,480,&#xD;
      required to collect 374 first primary outcome events within 30 months of mean follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total study duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment of 30 months. All patients will be followed until 374 valid primary endpoints are&#xD;
      reached (event-driven trial) which is expected about 15 months after last patient in. Total&#xD;
      study duration of 47 months is expected which might be adapted based on a blinded interim&#xD;
      analysis of the overall occurrence of the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual study duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected median follow-up time will be about 30 months per patient with a minimum follow-up&#xD;
      time of 15 months and a maximum follow-up time of presumably 45 months.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)</intervention_name>
    <description>An ICD consists of an electronic medical device and electrode leads. The surgery can be performed in local anaesthesia, but a short general anaesthesia is required if the ICD has to be tested giving the patient an electric shock. Besides the possibility to shock during arrhythmias the ICD can potentially terminate ventricular tachycardias by rapid pacing for short periods (small bursts of pacing).&#xD;
The subcutaneous defibrillator is an established and valid alternative to the conventional ICD for the preven-tion of SCD. According to current guidelines, the subcutaneous defibrillator should be considered as an alternative to transvenous defibrillators in patients with an indication for an ICD when pacing therapy for bradycardia support, cardiac resynchronisation or antitachycardia pacing is not needed.</description>
