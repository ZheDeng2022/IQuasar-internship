  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, pilot study of the feasibility and safety of dapagliflozin (in&#xD;
      addition to standard of care treatment) for the treatment of patients with metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The primary hypothesis is that dapagliflozin is&#xD;
      well-tolerated and safe to use in this patient population. The investigators also hypothesize&#xD;
      that dapagliflozin will be efficacious as an adjunct to front-line chemotherapy assessed by&#xD;
      decreased tumor markers mediated by its pleiotropic metabolic effects.&#xD;

    <description>Dapagliflozin is an oral drug which will be administered on an outpatient basis. Dosing will start at 5 mg daily and will increase to 10 mg daily after 2 weeks (after consulation with a study endrocrinologist) if the patient is tolerating the 5 mg dose. Dapagliflozin will be given for a total of 8 weeks (2 weeks at 5 mg and 6 weeks at 10 mg)&#xD;
Treatment with dapagliflozin will be initiated on Cycle 1 Day 1 of standard of care chemotherapy.&#xD;
Participants will use the BIOSENSE meter once daily</description>

             prior therapy for their brain metastases and whose CNS disease is radiographically&#xD;
             stable at study entry, are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one&#xD;
             dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 10 mm with CT scan, as ≥ 20 mm by&#xD;
             chest x-ray, or ≥ 10 mm with calipers by clinical exam.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative&#xD;
