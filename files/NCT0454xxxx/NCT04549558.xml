      Breast cancer (BrCa) is the most common malignant neoplasm in women worldwide with a&#xD;
      continuous rise on both its incidence and cancer-related deaths. Accurate evaluation of the&#xD;
      presence, extent and status (benign or malignant) of axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) in patients&#xD;
      with BrCa has an important prognostic value, and is essential for disease staging and&#xD;
      treatment planning. Many radiological diagnostic modalities have been utilized to assess the&#xD;
      nature of ALNs in the pre-operative stage. Each modality has its weaknesses and strengths.&#xD;
      Multimodal imaging combines two or more imaging modalities into one system to produce details&#xD;
      in clinical diagnostic imaging that are more precise than any conventional imaging alone.&#xD;
      Therefore, the present study is designed to assess the role of simultaneous multi-modal&#xD;
      sonographic tools [conventional grey-scale ultrasound; US, Color-Doppler ultrasound; CDU,&#xD;
      strain ultrasound elastography; UE) in evaluating the nature (benign or malignant) of&#xD;
      ipsilateral ALNs in patients with primary BrCa together with comparing the diagnostic indices&#xD;
      of each with that of all-together (combined modalities). A total of 30 patients with BrCa and&#xD;
      US-visible ALNs will be included. All will be subjected to simultaneous examination by US,&#xD;
      CDU, UE and US-guided FNA cytology examination of their ipsilateral ALNs. Data will be&#xD;
      collected and analyzed using SPSS version 23. Area under the receiver Operating&#xD;
      Characteristic (ROC) curve will be calculated and the diagnostic indices of each modality and&#xD;
      of all modalities will be measured.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Breast cancer (BrCa) is the most common malignant neoplasm in women worldwide with&#xD;
      a continuous rise on both its incidence and cancer-related deaths (1-3). Accurate evaluation&#xD;
      of the presence, extent and status of axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) in patients with BrCa has&#xD;
      an important prognostic value, and is essential for disease staging and treatment planning&#xD;
      (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and histopathology was used for staging&#xD;
      BrCa, but with inevitable short- and long-term complications such as lymphedema, nerve&#xD;
      injury, seroma and infection (5). Afterwards, sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB) has&#xD;
      gradually replaced ALND despite its invasive nature, unavoidable false negative results and&#xD;
      post-operative complication, which are far less than those encountered with ALND (6).&#xD;
      According to the American Society of Oncology Guidelines, If the SLNB results are negative,&#xD;
      no further dissection is done because there is no survival benefit for performing ALND in&#xD;
      this setting. Patients with positive SLNB results traditionally undergo &quot;completion&quot; ALND&#xD;
      (6,7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grey-scale ultrasound (US) is a non-invasive method that plays an important role in the&#xD;
      preoperative evaluation of ALNs and obtaining samples in patients with BrCa (8-11).&#xD;
      Nevertheless, US is operator dependent and focuses mainly on the morphological features lymph&#xD;
      nodes (LNs). Addition of Color-Doppler Ultrasound (CDU helps in assessing the presence and&#xD;
      distribution of vasculature pattern as well as the resistive index (RI) of ALNs (11-13).&#xD;
      Despite their promising results, US and CDU, studies showed very wide ranges and variations&#xD;
      in sensitivity and specificity (8-13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real-time strain ultrasound elastography (UE) is an imaging technique that utilizes the&#xD;
      long-established clinical concept that malignant lesions are often stiffer than normal&#xD;
      tissues. The stiffness, a characteristic that can't be assessed by US nor CDU (14) and the UE&#xD;
      has therefore been utilized to assess pathological changes in many organs, such as liver,&#xD;
      breast, thyroid, muscle, Kidney, Prostate, and cervical LNs (Nicely reviewed in 14).&#xD;
      Additionally, elastograms obtained by UE are color-coded images indicating differences in&#xD;
      stiffness of portions of a target tissue. These color maps or images arise from analysis of&#xD;
      the changes in the radiofrequency impulses before and after the rhythmic manual compression&#xD;
      directed along the radiation axis. In addition, UE images are produced simultaneously with&#xD;
      the conventional gray-scale US to ensure that images of the same node are precisely obtained&#xD;
      (14). UE has also been used in assessing ALNs, but with variable and conflicting results&#xD;
      (15,16). Two recent meta-analyses concluded that UE can provide additive useful information&#xD;
      regarding ALN assessment prior to surgical procedure selection (17,18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other imaging modalities such as mammography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),&#xD;
      multi-detector computed tomography (CT), Positron-emission tomography (PET-CT) were also&#xD;
      tried, but their wide use is limited by their moderate sensitivity, low specificity, need for&#xD;
      special protocol for ALNs assessment, law availability, high cost and radiation hazard&#xD;
      (19-25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multimodal imaging combines two or more imaging modalities into one system to produce details&#xD;
      in clinical diagnostic imaging that are more precise than any conventional imaging alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS The present study is designed to assess the role of simultaneous multi-modal sonographic&#xD;
      tools (US, CDU, UE) in evaluating the nature (benign or malignant) of ipsilateral ALNs in&#xD;
      patients with primary BrCa together with comparing the diagnostic indices of each with that&#xD;
      of all-together (combined modalities). In other words, whether adding UE to conventional&#xD;
      grey-scale US and CDU will increase their diagnostic accuracy or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS A: Type of the study: A prospective cohort diagnostic hospital-based study B: Study&#xD;
      Setting: Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Assiut University Hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C: Sample Size Calculation: The study will include 30 consecutive patients with primary BrCa&#xD;
      and ipsilateral ALNs of obscure nature visible by axillary conventional/grey-scale ultrasound&#xD;
      (US) scan. In Each patient, one or more LN may be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D: Study tools: All participants will be subjected to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Screening clinical physical and Grey-scale ultrasound examination of the axilla With&#xD;
      patients in the supine position, an experienced radiologist in conventional US, CDU, UE will&#xD;
      perform the physical clinical examination using a Gray-scale digital US scanner (General&#xD;
      Electric (GE, USA), equipped with a 7.5-13 MHz liner transducer will be performed first to&#xD;
      assess for the presence of ALNs. Only the ipsilateral axillary region will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Conventional (grey-scale) ultrasound (US) Scoring of the ALNs A gray-scale conventional&#xD;
      US scoring system of 5 criteria will be implemented. These include 1) Short-axis (S) diameter&#xD;
      (S &gt;7 mm = score 1; S ≤7 mm = score 0), 2) Long-to-short axis (L/S) diameter ratio (L/S; &lt;2 =&#xD;
      score 1; ≥ 2 = score 0), 3) The hilum long axis-to-node long axis (H/L) diameter ratio (H/L&#xD;
      &lt;0.5 = score 1; H/L ≥ 0.5 = score 0). 4) Border (irregular = score 1; regular =score 0), and&#xD;
      5) Cortical thickness (T &gt;3 mm = score 1; T ≤ 3 mm = score 0). When the node did not have a&#xD;
      hilar region, the cortical thickness will be regarded as ≥ 3 mm when the short-axis diameter&#xD;
      is &gt;3 mm (26) and Figure 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Color Doppler Ultrasound (CDU) examination of the ALNs After US, CDU will be performed&#xD;
      as previously described (11-13) with the following precautions: 1) use of low wall filter and&#xD;
      low velocity scale to be able to detect slow flow. 2) adjust color gain to maximum to help&#xD;
      better blood flow demonstration and avoid noise artefacts. 3) place the transducer gently to&#xD;
      avoid superficial vessels compression that may lead to an increase in vascular resistance.&#xD;
      Intra-nodal blood flow in color Doppler studies will be classified into 4 categories: 1)&#xD;
      central flow; 2) peripheral flow; or 3) Mixed peripheral and central, 4) absent flow. Central&#xD;
      vessels are those appearing in both hilar and peri-hilar branches only. Peripheral vessels&#xD;
      are those in the periphery that have no connection with the hilar vessel. Lymph nodes with&#xD;
      both peripheral and central (mixed) flow will be grouped as mixed. If blood vessels are&#xD;
      detected, 3 Doppler spectral waveforms will be obtained, and their mean will be calculated&#xD;
      and considered as the resistivity index (RI). The RI is chosen as it is not dependent on the&#xD;
      angle of insonation, and therefore, it can be accurately calculated even in small vessels. RI&#xD;
      is calculated as follows: RI = Peak systolic velocity - end diastolic velocity/peak systolic&#xD;
      velocity&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Strain ultrasound elastography (UE) of the ALNs UE images will be evaluated with a&#xD;
      scoring system based on the percentage and distribution of the hypoechoic cortex regions with&#xD;
      a visible hilum in ALN (Pattern I) or all the hypoechoic lymph nodes with an absent hilum&#xD;
      (Pattern II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Pattern I (LN with Hila), scoring will be as follows (26):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the green portion occupied almost all of the cortex;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the blue portion occupies &lt;50% of the cortex;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the blue portion occupies &gt;50% of the cortex, with scattered the green portions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the blue portion occupies almost all of the cortex;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. the blue portion occupies almost all of the cortex, with a green ring on the edge of the&#xD;
           node.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pattern II (LN without Hila), scoring will be as follows (26):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Green portion occupying almost all of the cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blue portion occupying less than 50% of the cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blue portion occupying more than 50% of the cortex, with a scattered green portion&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blue portion occupying almost all of the cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Blue portion occupying almost all of the cortex, with a green ring on the edge of the&#xD;
           node.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of the Strain Ratio (SR) by UE. The SR is a ratio between the strain value of the&#xD;
      two regions of interest (ROI) A and B, where ROI-A is the deepest blue portions of the&#xD;
      hypoechoic regions within the nodes, and ROI-B is the surrounding soft and adipose tissue at&#xD;
      the same depth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (SR = strain value of ROI-B / strain value of ROI-A) Of note, SR is automatically calculated&#xD;
      by the software built into certain equipment and displayed on its monitor (26).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Combined evaluation of gray-scale US, CDU and UE. The score of combined evaluation for&#xD;
      each lymph node will be the sum of the gray-scale US (5 points), the CDU (1 point), and the&#xD;
      UE (5 points) scores. A cut-off value will be evaluated with the pathological diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Ultrasound-guided FNA from the ALNs After completion of the above 3 sonographic&#xD;
      modalities' examinations, and under local anesthesia using 5 ml of subcutaneous 1% Xylocaine,&#xD;
      US-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) will be performed by the same radiologist for all&#xD;
      visible ALNs using 20-22 gauge needles attached to a 10 ml plastic syringe. Under UE&#xD;
      guidance, the needle will be inserted into the cortex with 3 passes as routinely performed&#xD;
      and previously described (27). When 2 or more abnormal LNs are identified, the node that&#xD;
      looks the most suspicious will be aspirated. Samples will then be spread and fixed on&#xD;
      glass-slides using 95% alcohol and air-dried for Pap &amp; Diff-Quik (American Scientiﬁc&#xD;
      Products, McGraw Park, IL, USA) staining in the Pathology Department prior to being examined.&#xD;
      The final pathological diagnosis for the LNs will be made by a pathologist blinded to the&#xD;
      imaging findings. Results of the US modalities will be correlated with the results of the&#xD;
      FNAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E: Data Management and Statistical Analyses Data collection will be done in a preformed &quot;Data&#xD;
      Collection Form&quot; (Appendix 1) prior to being entered in Microsoft Exel 2016. Afterwards, data&#xD;
      will be exported to the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23.0 software&#xD;
      package (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for the statistical analysis. Comparisons of numeric&#xD;
      (continuous) variables and categorical variables will be done using the Wilcoxon's rank sum&#xD;
      test or Student's t-test and Chi-Square or Fisher's Exact test respectively and as&#xD;
      appropriate. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative&#xD;
      predictive value (NPV) and accuracy will be calculated to compare the diagnostic performance&#xD;
      of each modality. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC)&#xD;
      will be calculated and compared using the U-test. All cutoff values will be determined&#xD;
      depending on the best accuracy identified by ROC curves. A probability value of (P&lt;0.05) will&#xD;
      be considered Statistically significant for all tests. The cytopathological diagnosis will be&#xD;
      considered as the reference gold standard.&#xD;
