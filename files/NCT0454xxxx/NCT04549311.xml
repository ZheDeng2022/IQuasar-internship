  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most perianal abscesses (PA) result from an infection originating in anal crypts that extend&#xD;
      into anal glands in the intersphincteric plane. Patients commonly present to the ER and&#xD;
      usually require surgical intervention, which poses a burden on the healthcare system. If left&#xD;
      undrained, a PA can expand into the adjacent tissues as well as progress to systemic&#xD;
      infection. One of the major complications of PA are perianal fistulae; the creation of a&#xD;
      tract between the anal canal and the perianal skin that is lined with granulation tissue or&#xD;
      skin cells. Up to 1/3 of patients with a PA will develop a fistula; which occurs if a PA&#xD;
      drains spontaneously through the perianal skin, and the infection becomes chronic. If this&#xD;
      happens, surgical intervention is needed and abscesses may reoccur. Post incision and&#xD;
      drainage (I&amp;D) antibiotics in PA have been used to address complications but their use is&#xD;
      still controversial and there are no specific recommendations on their use to prevent the&#xD;
      formations of fistulae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent findings from a systematic review (6 studies, N=817 patients) published in 2019&#xD;
      demonstrated that antibiotic use following I&amp;D of PA was associated with a 36% lower odds of&#xD;
      fistula formation, though the quality of the evidence was low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there are no established prophylactic treatments for fistulae, and because they are&#xD;
      difficult to treat, further study of this simple intervention seems warranted. In this trial,&#xD;
      adults with a PA requiring I&amp;D will be randomly assigned to receive standard of care with&#xD;
      antibiotics or standard of care without antibiotics after I&amp;D. This trial will be conducted&#xD;
      under the IMPACTS (Innovative, Multicentre, Patient-centred Approach to Clinical Trials in&#xD;
      Surgery) program umbrella and will follow IMPACTS methodology. For the Vanguard trial, the&#xD;
      aim is to determine the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial. Future outcomes of&#xD;
      interest are incidence of fistula formation (defined as drainage of the perianal region at or&#xD;
      after 2 months), need for re-intervention (i.e., any intervention on the perianal region),&#xD;
      quality of life, healthcare utilization, healing time and mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of perianal abscesses is relatively common with an estimated incidence in the&#xD;
      UK of 40 per 100,000 habitants (Canadian incidence unknown). It is uncertain if there is any&#xD;
      benefit to using prophylactic antibiotics after incision and drainage of a perianal abscess&#xD;
      in order to reduce the formation of fistulae, the need for re-intervention, health system&#xD;
      costs, and healing time. Further research from high-quality RCTs is needed to establish a&#xD;
      benefit, if any, for this practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Before embarking on a definitive RCT, this pilot trial has five specific&#xD;
      feasibility objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess our ability to accrue patients using the IMPACTS Program design platform at&#xD;
           multiple institutions, over the course of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess our ability to adaptively randomize patients and deliver the randomized&#xD;
           assignment using the IMPACTS Program design platform, over the course of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess our ability to collect complete data directly from participants (patients and&#xD;
           clinicians) on: re-intervention, fistula formation, quality of life, and healing time&#xD;
           over the course of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To examine our ability to carry out data linkages using the IMPACTS Program design&#xD;
           platform over the course of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To estimate the incidence of fistula formation to inform the sample size calculation for&#xD;
           the definitive trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a multicentre, pragmatic, open label, three-arm parallel-group Vanguard&#xD;
      feasibility randomized controlled trial. Adult patients with perianal abscesses requiring&#xD;
      incision and drainage will be randomized to receive standard of care with antibiotics or&#xD;
      standard of care without antibiotics after incision and drainage. If feasibility is&#xD;
      demonstrated during the pilot trial, we will plan to conduct a definitive trial. If there are&#xD;
      only minimal changes to the protocol, we will include data from the pilot phase into the&#xD;
      definitive trial analysis (i.e. a Vanguard design).&#xD;
