  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to confirm using polysomnography (PSG) that lemborexant&#xD;
      10 milligram (mg) is superior to placebo on objective sleep onset as assessed by latency to&#xD;
      persistent sleep (LPS) during the last 2 nights of 1 month of treatment in participants with&#xD;
      insomnia disorder.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study will have 2 phases: the Prerandomization Phase and the Randomization Phase. The&#xD;
      Prerandomization Phase will comprise 3 periods that will last up to a maximum of 35 days: a&#xD;
      Screening Period, a Run-in Period, and a Baseline Period. The Randomization Phase will&#xD;
      comprise a Treatment Period during which participants will be treated for 30 nights (1 month)&#xD;
      and a minimum 14-day Follow-up Period before an End of Study (EOS) Visit (up to 54 days). The&#xD;
      total study duration for each participant on this study is 89 days.&#xD;
