  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two parts. The main purpose of Part 1 of this study will be to examine how&#xD;
      safe and effective two doses of SelK2 is on participants with mild asthma. Lung function and&#xD;
      inflammatory cell numbers will be measured in response to the administration of an allergen&#xD;
      (a compound to which the participant is allergic) into the lungs in the presence or absence&#xD;
      of SelK2. Part 2 of this study will examine how safe and effective one dose of SelK2 is on&#xD;
      participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Lung function and&#xD;
      inflammatory cell numbers will be measured in COPD patients in the presence or absence of&#xD;
      SelK2. SelK2 may block the movement of key inflammatory cells into the lungs and consequently&#xD;
      improve lung function in these two patient populations.&#xD;
