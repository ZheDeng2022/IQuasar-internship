      The purpose of this study is to compare the Vivaer procedure for treatment of nasal airway&#xD;
      obstruction (NAO) with a sham procedure that simulates the actual procedure as closely as&#xD;
      possible absent the delivery of radiofrequency (RF) energy to the nasal tissue.&#xD;

    <measure>Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) Scale Responder Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months visit following the study procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>The Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) Scale is a patient self-reported questionnaire consisting of 5 symptoms of nasal obstruction: nasal congestion, nasal blockage, trouble breathing, trouble sleeping, and getting enough air during exercise. Patients will report over the past 1 month how much the symptoms have been a problem. Total score ranges from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate worse obstruction. Severity of symptoms can be classified as mild (range, 5-25), moderate (range, 30-50), severe (range, 55-75), or extreme (range, 80-100) nasal obstruction, based on responses.&#xD;
The study will measure the responder rate, which is defined as at least 1 NOSE Scale class improvement or an improvement (decrease) in NOSE Scale score of 20% or more from baseline at the 3-month evaluation.</description>

    <description>The Vivaer procedure will be performed in the study clinic using the Vivaer ARC Stylus and Aerin Console. The Vivaer ARC Stylus is a disposable handheld device capable of delivering bipolar radiofrequency energy to tissue when connected to the Aerin Console radiofrequency generating device. Participants in this study will undergo bilateral treatment of the nasal valves in a single study session. Each side of the nose will be treated with up to four (4) non-overlapping applications of RF energy at the junction of the upper and lower lateral cartilage on the lateral nasal wall. Treatment settings to be used are: temperature 60° C, power 4 watts, treatment time 18 seconds, and cooling time 12 seconds. No repeat (&quot;touch up&quot;) procedures will be permitted after the initial procedure through the end of the study (24 months).</description>

All other aspects of the procedure will be the same as used for the active treatment, including administration of anesthetic agent(s).</description>

             Study Protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Seeking treatment for nasal obstruction and willing to undergo an office-based&#xD;
             procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Baseline Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) Scale score ≥ 55.&#xD;
