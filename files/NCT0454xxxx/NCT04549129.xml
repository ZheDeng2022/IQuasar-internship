  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot randomized control trial, the investigators will evaluate the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of using a video and website in a prenatal visit to provide breastfeeding&#xD;
      education, focusing on how to hand express (HE) breast milk. Participants will be randomized&#xD;
      to the video/website intervention group or to the control standard of care group. After&#xD;
      delivery, participants will be asked to provide information on how long they breastfed and if&#xD;
      they used the information in the video and website. Differences in the outcome measures will&#xD;
      be analyzed between the two groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a new method for teaching breastfeeding&#xD;
      skills, and may provide evidence that hand expression (HE) to augment milk production in the&#xD;
      first days postpartum can help women breastfeed. Few studies have evaluated the use of HE for&#xD;
      improving breastfeeding outcomes. This study will also evaluate the impact of a new&#xD;
      video/website which can be utilized widely and adapted for other populations, both in&#xD;
      clinical and non-clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prenatal patients receiving care at a community health center in the Boston area will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the study at approximately 28 weeks gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a baseline questionnaire prior to randomization which will occur&#xD;
      at the ~36 week prenatal visit. A 1:1 randomization schedule will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control arm: participants will be given usual care handouts and the study provider will&#xD;
      provide anticipatory guidance and offer to answer any questions about breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention arm: participants will be shown the breastfeeding education video on a study&#xD;
      tablet, and provided a QR code which will give them access to the associated website. After&#xD;
      watching the video, study staff will then offer to review hand expression by answering&#xD;
      questions and reviewing steps, and physically helping the patient to practice hand&#xD;
      expression. Hands-on teaching of hand expression will be opt-in only and not required for&#xD;
      study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Text messages will be sent to the intervention arm participants with the link to the&#xD;
      intervention video and website, and a brief message reminding them to review the materials&#xD;
      and to hand express frequently starting immediately after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants (both arms) will be contacted to fill out a very brief, 10-item&#xD;
      questionnaire (approximately 5 minutes) at 3 days postpartum, and short questionnaires (10-15&#xD;
      minutes) at 14 days and 60 days postpartum. Questionnaires will ask about use of hand&#xD;
      expression, breastfeeding, formula use, perceived breastfeeding problems, breastfeeding&#xD;
      efficacy and satisfaction with prenatal breastfeeding education. In all questionnaires&#xD;
      participants will be asked about pain and potential adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant and neonatal electronic medical records will reviewed through 2 months&#xD;
      postpartum.&#xD;

    <description>Breast feeding confidence will be assessed using the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale Short form (BSES-SF) is a 14-item self-administered instrument derived from the original 33-item BSES that measures breastfeeding confidence. All items are preceded by the phrase ''I can always'' and rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (not at all confident) to 5 (always confident). Scores can range form 14 to 70 and higher scores are associated with higher levels of breast feeding confidence.</description>
