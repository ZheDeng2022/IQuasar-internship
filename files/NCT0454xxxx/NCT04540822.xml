  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral venous catheterisation is a multi-daily practice in a paediatric ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our pediatrics department, nurses have observed for several years now the appearance of&#xD;
      pressure sore-like skin lesions at the junction of the peripheral venous catheter with the&#xD;
      extension tube. A ward habit has spontaneously developed of applying a compress under this&#xD;
      junction. The objective is to minimize physical or emotional aggression as well as pain. Pain&#xD;
      that is denied or not identified and not relieved is memorized by the child, which can have&#xD;
      consequences on the perception of pain and the subsequent acceptance of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, through their reading and research, investigators have been able to find articles&#xD;
      mentioning the risks of pressure ulcers in children related to medical devices. However, few&#xD;
      elements are developed concerning catheter-related pressure ulcers, especially on this&#xD;
      specific technique for preventing injuries at the catheter-extension tube junction.&#xD;
      Investigators have not found any recommendations on this subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the aim of this study is to compare two peripheral venous catheter fixation devices,&#xD;
      with compress and without compress, and to analyse the frequency of pressure ulcer occurrence&#xD;
      and the intensity of this lesion.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The childcare assistant in charge of primary outcome assessment should not having taken care of the child before. In addition, the catheter-extension tube junction, with or without compress,will be secured by placing a crepe bandage. The nurse will call him to assess the primary outcome after the catheter ( and compress and crepe bandage) will have been removed.</masking_description>

    <description>Will be defined as a peripheral venous catheter culture &gt; 10^3 Colony Forming Unit/ml, if the peripheral venous catheter is referred in culture on suspicion of infection and in the absence of antibiotic treatment. In the presence of antibiotic treatment, it will be defined by the presence of pus and/or regression of infectious signs within 48 hours after removal of the peripheral venous catheter.</description>

The catheter is placed while respecting the detersion and disinfection of the skin with the appropriate products and according to the procedure in force in the department. Once the venous return has been checked, a 10 cm extension with a BECTON-DIC® 3-way valve will be connected, which is previously purged with 0.9% Sodium Chloride. Under the catheter-extension tube junction will be inserted a sterile non-woven compress, cut sterilely (3.5x1.5 cm). The assembly will be held in place by a transparent sterile semi-permeable adhesive dressing such as Tegaderm® (5x7 cm). This area will be secured by placing a crepe bandage (crepe bandage 4 m x7 cm).</description>
