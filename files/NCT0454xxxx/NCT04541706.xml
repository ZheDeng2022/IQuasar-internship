  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lorlatinib is a third-generation, oral, reversible, ATP-competitive, macrocyclic TKI of ALK&#xD;
      and ROS1. Lorlatinib was specifically designed to penetrate the CNS and to overcome known&#xD;
      secondary resistance mutations in the ALK tyrosine kinase domain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 4, open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, prospective, single arm study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of lorlatinib in adult participants with unresectable&#xD;
      advanced and/or recurrent ALK-positive NSCLC with resistance or intolerance to at least 1&#xD;
      prior ALK inhibitor treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being conducted as a post approval study to fulfill Central Drugs Standard&#xD;
      Control Organization (CDSCO) request relating to additional information on use of Lorlatinib&#xD;
      in Indian patients.&#xD;

             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of&#xD;
             study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the participant&#xD;
