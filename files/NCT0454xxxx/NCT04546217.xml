  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A variety of rehabilitation techniques focused on improving disability after stroke have&#xD;
      shown significant changes on walking speed, and endurance. Also, the administration of&#xD;
      combined techniques showed better results. Previous studies have suggested that embedding&#xD;
      behavioral strategies in neurorehabilitation protocols can enhance patient's adherence and&#xD;
      participation outside the clinical setting. The addition of a group of behavioral strategies&#xD;
      called Transfer Package (TP) has been widely used in motor training protocol (e.g.&#xD;
      Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy). The TP has shown to enhance the effects of treatment&#xD;
      2.4 times when compared to motor training alone. However, the effect of TP when combined with&#xD;
      robotic gait training remains unexplored. In this study our goal is to combine the TP with&#xD;
      robotic gait training. The hypothesis is that using the TP in combination with robotic gait&#xD;
      training will enhance the outcome of robotic gait training alone and will induce long term&#xD;
      transference and retention of the motor skills observed after treatment. More importantly,&#xD;
      this experimental intervention is more meaningful to the patient and can be more easily&#xD;
      implemented on the clinical setting. The aims of this study are (1) to assess transfer and&#xD;
      long-term retention of walking and balance skills after robotic treadmill gait training&#xD;
      combined with the TP, (2) to understand participants' acceptability and perceptions of the TP&#xD;
      as a tool to enhance transfer of skills to real-world situations, and (3) to examine the&#xD;
      feasibility of these combined intervention to improve walking and balance after stroke.&#xD;

      This proposal seeks to investigate the effect of gait training combined with behavioral&#xD;
      strategies on long-term retention of improvements on gait parameters and use of the affected&#xD;
      lower-extremity in real-world situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To assess transfer and long-term retention of walking and balance skills after robotic&#xD;
      treadmill gait training combined with the TP. A total of 24 participants with chronic stoke&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated to either treadmill training combined with the TP (TT+TP) or usual&#xD;
      TT with an educational approach. The 8-week intervention will consist of three weekly&#xD;
      sessions of 1 hour of TT. The experimental group will also receive the TP for 30 minutes and&#xD;
      the control group will receive a manual with exercises to be performed at home. The primary&#xD;
      outcome is the change in Lower-Extremity Motor Activity Log. Also, change in walking speed,&#xD;
      endurance, functional strength and use of the affected LE will be assessed at 3- and 6-months&#xD;
      after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To understand participants' acceptability and perceptions of the TP as a tool to&#xD;
      enhance transfer of skills to real-world situations. A qualitative approach will be used for&#xD;
      evaluating the acceptability of the TT + TP protocol. Individual interviews will be conducted&#xD;
      with all participants to assess their opinion about TP, particularly, their perceived&#xD;
      influence of the TP on real-life situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To examine the feasibility of body weight support treadmill training combined with&#xD;
      behavioral strategies to improve walking and balance after stroke. Compliance with the&#xD;
      intervention will be measured as the number of sessions attended and number of activities&#xD;
      performed outside the clinical setting. Also, the relationship between the outcome changes&#xD;
      after the intervention and the participants' perceptions will be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the use of the TP will promote long-term retention of the positive&#xD;
      changes in walking and balance and also changes in real-world situations. This pilot study&#xD;
      will lead to future studies with larger samples in order to compare the effect of body weight&#xD;
      support treadmill training combined with the TP. The long-term goal is to provide a&#xD;
      systematic combination of strategies to improve gait and mobility after stroke that can be&#xD;
      implemented in the clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study our goal is to combine gait training with a robotic treadmill and the TP. The&#xD;
      TP is adapted from our previous work with Lower-Extremity Constraint-Induced Movement&#xD;
      Therapy. The effect of the combined gait training will on real-world use of the affected&#xD;
      lower extremity, walking speed, endurance, functional strength will be tested as well as the&#xD;
      effect of the TP on long-term retention. Furthermore the combined TP + treadmill training&#xD;
      will be meaningful to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants: sampling and selection criteria Participants will be recruited from a list&#xD;
           of patients that have been discharged from the Spain Rehabilitation Center at University&#xD;
           of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). Participants will be recruited from a registry of&#xD;
           individuals who have had a stroke and whom are interested in research managed by the&#xD;
           Department of Neurology at UAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The inclusion criteria is as follows: (1) 18 years of age or older; (2) at least 6&#xD;
           months post stroke; (3) present lower extremity motor impairment secondary to stroke,&#xD;
           (4) able to walk at least 10 feet with or without personal assistance; (5) discharged&#xD;
           from rehabilitation. Participants will be excluded if present uncontrolled clinical&#xD;
           conditions, weight &gt; 400lb because this is limit supported by the KineAssist, other&#xD;
           neurologic conditions, a Mini-Mental State Examination score (MMSE) &lt;24, inability to&#xD;
           provide the informed consent, and insufficient language skills to answer the screening,&#xD;
           assessments and interview questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will be first contacted by phone and the study will be fully explained, if&#xD;
           the participant is interested the first screening interview will be conducted. During&#xD;
           this first screening the inclusion criteria and the availability of the participants&#xD;
           will be checked. After assuring the inclusion criteria have been met, a more thorough&#xD;
           in-person screening examination will be scheduled in order to assess participants'&#xD;
           cognitive and motor functions. All participants will be asked to voluntarily provide&#xD;
           informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A total of 24 people with chronic stroke will be selected and will be randomly allocated&#xD;
           to TT+TP (N=12) or TT group (N=12). Sample calculation was performed using standard&#xD;
           deviation and effect size of the LE-MAL which was obtained from a previous study&#xD;
           conducted by the PI.20 This proposal is 90.9% powered to detect a significant difference&#xD;
           between study arms of 1.55 improvement on the LE-MAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention All participants will receive the same robotic treadmill training. The&#xD;
           training conducted on the robotic treadmill device will be based on different constructs&#xD;
           of walking and balance, including standing, stepping, propulsion, speed, strength, and&#xD;
           endurance. The KineAssistTM (KA) robotic device will be used for targeted training of&#xD;
           participants. The KA uses a patented force-sensing, pelvic support mechanism to sense&#xD;
           the user's intended walking speed and direction to drive a moving surface, thus allowing&#xD;
           a person to move at their own intended walking speed and pace. The device is sensitive&#xD;
           enough to allow sudden starting and stopping movements, so that balance tasks and&#xD;
           responses to sudden disturbances can be accommodated. This system is uniquely different&#xD;
           compared to a treadmill, which only moves at a fixed speed and can only allow repetitive&#xD;
           stepping protocols. The robotic system that allows individuals to move at self-driven&#xD;
           speeds against challenging conditions in order to implement a combinatorial approach to&#xD;
           assessment and intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The transfer package element of the body weight support treadmill training, was modified&#xD;
           accordingly in order to fit the gait training intervention. The TP procedures will be&#xD;
           administered as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
           On the first day of treatment, participants will be asked to sign the behavioral&#xD;
           contract (BC). The purpose of the BC is to: (1) achieve safety while engaging in&#xD;
           improved use of the LEs, (2) increase use of the more-affected LEs in functional&#xD;
           activities whenever possible, and (3) increase use of both LEs in a more coordinated&#xD;
           manner. Additionally, the behavioral contract formally engages the patient in actively&#xD;
           exploring more ways to use their more-affected LE in their home environment and in&#xD;
           adopting a problem-solving approach to accomplish that end. The BC will be worked out&#xD;
           with the patient at the end of the first treatment day. Before discussing the contract,&#xD;
           therapist will develop in conjunction with the participant a daily activity schedule&#xD;
           from the time of awakening in the morning until arrival at the clinic for training on&#xD;
           subsequent days, and between sessions..&#xD;
&#xD;
           Also a list of activities to be performed outside the clinical setting, the Home Skill&#xD;
           Assignment (HSA), will be developed for each day of the week during the treatment&#xD;
           period. The HSA process is a transfer technique designed to encourage use of the&#xD;
           more-affected LE during activities of daily living (ADL). The HSA supports and should be&#xD;
           in agreement with the behavioral contract. It will be given to the patient as a written&#xD;
           set of activities to be accomplished after the end of the treatment session and it has a&#xD;
           check-off component. After each activity is accomplished outside the treatment setting&#xD;
           the patient checks that item Another component of the TP is the Home Practice after&#xD;
           treatment. The purpose of home task practice after the intervention period is to assure&#xD;
           continued progress with LE use after the intervention program is completed. With home&#xD;
           practice, participants are encouraged to engage in functional skills and fitness&#xD;
           activities on a daily basis. These activities will maintain improvements in LE use&#xD;
           realized during the LE-CIMT protocol and possibly enhance them. Toward the end of&#xD;
           treatment, a written individualized post-treatment home practice program will be&#xD;
           developed and given to the patient. The program consists of 7 separate lists, one for&#xD;
           each day of the week, repeated weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The last TP element is the administration of the Lower-Extremity Motor Activity Log&#xD;
           (LE-MAL) during all treatment sessions. A full description of the LE-MAL is provided in&#xD;
           the Results/Outcomes section below.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The 8-week intervention will consist of three weekly sessions of 1 hour of TT. The&#xD;
           experimental group will also receive the TP for 30 minutes and the control group (TT&#xD;
           group) will receive a handbook with exercises and stretching techniques. Therapists will&#xD;
           ask the participants of this group to pick up at least 2-3 activities and perform them&#xD;
           for 30 minutes everyday.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Outcomes In order to assess LE physical performance and use, the following primary&#xD;
           outcome tools will be used: (1) the primary outcome is the Lower Extremity Motor&#xD;
           Activity Log (LE-MAL);20,21 (2) Berg Balance Scale (BBS);22 (3) 10 meters walk test&#xD;
           (10MWT);23 and (4) 6 minutes walking test (6MWT).24 The secondary outcomes are: (1) 5&#xD;
           times sit to stand (5TSTS);25 (2) Fear of Falling Avoidance Behavior Questionnaire&#xD;
           (FFABQ).36 The LE-MAL is a semi-structured interview, created in the UAB&#xD;
           Constraint-Induced Therapy Research Group laboratory, that consists of questions asking&#xD;
           the participant the level of assistance, how well her/his performance is, and level of&#xD;
           confidence while executing 14 different daily tasks (e.g. walking indoors, climbing&#xD;
           stairs) in real world environment.20,41 The LE-MAL investigates the transference of the&#xD;
           skills addressed during the treatment to different contexts. The principal investigator&#xD;
           of this proposal has used the test extensively and has participated in a reliability and&#xD;
           validity study of the LE-MAL which showed that the LE-MAL is a reliable tool in both&#xD;
           test-retest results (r=0.93) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.96).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will be administered during pre-, post-treatment and follow up visits (3 and 6&#xD;
      months after the end of the intervention protocol). Each assessment visit will last&#xD;
      approximately 40 minutes. The follow up assessment will provide information regarding&#xD;
      long-term retention of results and will serve as the basis for future research. Pre-,&#xD;
      post-treatment, and follow up assessments will be compared in order to investigate changes&#xD;
      observed compared to the baseline and long term retention of these changes. For this, an&#xD;
      analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be utilized to analyze the changes among different time&#xD;
      points (post-treatment and follow up assessments). Those subjects with complete data will&#xD;
      contribute to the analysis. In case of missing data, a last observation carried forward&#xD;
      (LOCF) sensitivity analysis will be conducted. In addition, those with incomplete follow-up&#xD;
      data will be compared to subjects with complete data to see if the groups differ&#xD;
      significantly in baseline characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance will be described by the percentage of sessions attended and number of activities&#xD;
      performed outside the clinical setting. Considering that the participants will receive a list&#xD;
      with 10 activities to be performed in the real world (Home Skill assignment), a total of 560&#xD;
      activities will be listed during the intervention. In a previous LE Constraint-induced&#xD;
      therapy study, participants performed approximately 85% of the activities. However, this was&#xD;
      a shorter intervention (2 weeks) and a lower percentage might be observed in longer protocol&#xD;
      as the purposed here. Thus, a minimum of 60% of compliance regarding the list of activities&#xD;
      will be expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A qualitative strand will be conducted after the conclusion of the treatment. Participants&#xD;
      will be interviewed face-to-face to determine perspectives regarding the intervention&#xD;
      protocol, especially acceptability. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews will be conducted&#xD;
      regarding how time consuming the TP is (outside the clinical setting), potential routine&#xD;
      modifications, and potential suggestions. The interviews will be conducted by other&#xD;
      researchers who are knowledgeable and skilled in qualitative interviewing and are uninvolved&#xD;
      in the delivery of the treatment to avoid influence on participants' responses. The&#xD;
      interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. The interviewer will follow a&#xD;
      script which provides participants with an overview of the interview protocol. The interview&#xD;
      questions will include participant's impression about the elements of the TP, the&#xD;
      transference of motor skills trained during the gait sessions to other environments,&#xD;
      compliance with procedures, and suggestions for modifications. Perceptions regarding the&#xD;
      control condition will also be collected using the same procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative data will be analyzed through thematic analysis procedures in which the main&#xD;
      themes collected along the interview will be categorized and reported.27 Two researchers will&#xD;
      code the transcripts independently. The themes will be compared and revised by both coders.&#xD;
      The themes will be refined if needed, and the final list of themes will be reported in a&#xD;
      joint display.&#xD;
