  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutrition supplements have tremendous impact upon the nutritional and developmental status of&#xD;
      malnourished children. These products have been designed to be acceptable to children (often&#xD;
      by adding nutritive sweeteners to make them more palatable), but to date there has been&#xD;
      little rigorous testing of their palatability for infants, toddlers and young children. The&#xD;
      overall goal of this project is to investigate whether:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. children's acceptance of a nutrition supplement is associated with maternal persistence&#xD;
           in offering the food to her child over a 2-week period;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. an unsweetened version of the nutrition supplement differs in short- and long-term&#xD;
           acceptance; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. maternal liking of the supplement is associated with her persistence in offering the&#xD;
           food to her child.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More rigorous pre-testing of nutrition supplements, with a focus on palatability (i.e.,&#xD;
      observations of behavioral and facial responses to its taste) and its relation to children's&#xD;
      acceptance (defined here as consumption), could provide important insights into the capacity&#xD;
      for these products to transition from being perceived as &quot;medicine&quot; to being accepted as&#xD;
      &quot;food,&quot; or part of the usual child diet. A clearer understanding of the relation between&#xD;
      observed child indicators of palatability and acceptance, both initially and over time (i.e.,&#xD;
      repeated exposure effects), is important for predicting the longer-term impacts on children's&#xD;
      dietary intake, growth and health. Further, a better grasp of caregiver perceptions of the&#xD;
      acceptability of these products, both their child's and their own, is critical in paving the&#xD;
      way for overcoming barriers and identifying facilitators associated with longer-term&#xD;
      acceptance of these nutritional supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We secondarily will also explore the effects of potential mediators on caregiver persistence&#xD;
      and infant acceptance of a sweetened and an unsweetened small-quantity lipid nutrition&#xD;
      supplement (SQ-LNS) such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maternal feeding self-efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Caregiver food neophobia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Caregiver feeding styles using the Infant Feeding Style Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infant feeding history and food experience&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Toddler eating behaviors using the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire for Toddlers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infant behaviors using the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (Garstein &amp; Rothbart&#xD;
           2003 Inf Behav Dev)&#xD;

    <description>Acceptance is measured at the conclusion of each offered bite using an adaptation of the Feeding Infants: Behavior and Facial Expression Coding System (FIBFECS) on a 4-point scale from 0-3 where 0 = refusal and 3 = early acceptance of food</description>

    <description>Consumption of each type of supplement will be measured in grams. The weight of the remainder of each supplement will be subtracted from the initial weight of the supplement prior to offering. The remainder of the supplements offered at home will be frozen and returned to the lab to be weighed.</description>

    <description>After feeding each version of the supplement, the caregiver will be instructed to rate how much he/she thought his/her infant liked the supplement by placing a mark on a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from &quot;dislikes extremely&quot; to &quot;likes extremely&quot;. The distance of the caregivers' marking on the 100mm line is measured from &quot;dislikes extremely&quot; in mm, with higher measurement values meaning caregivers perceive the infants like the supplement more.</description>
