  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than five decades have passed since the identification of the etiologic agent of&#xD;
      hepatitis B and yet this infection is a challenge for public health worldwide. The&#xD;
      development and availability of the first hepatitis B vaccines, still in the 1980s, was a&#xD;
      milestone for the prevention of the hepatitis B virus, and currently known as the gold&#xD;
      standard strategy for the elimination of this infectious disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In several countries, the introduction of the immunobiological occurred gradually, by age&#xD;
      groups and risk groups, and in general, started with newborns and children. This universal&#xD;
      immunization strategy has contributed to reducing the incidence and changing the&#xD;
      epidemiological profile of HBV worldwide. At the beginning of the 21st century, it was&#xD;
      already possible to shift the epidemiological curve of the infection to parasitize with 50&#xD;
      years or more. On the other hand, despite vaccination against hepatitis B being the most&#xD;
      assertive tool for the prevention of HBV, the low performance of the vaccine in older groups&#xD;
      remains a challenge for public health and the object of this study. To our knowledge, there&#xD;
      are no data showing the efficacy of doses of enhanced hepatitis B vaccines for older adults,&#xD;
      and the purpose of this study is to investigate and compare the immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      hepatitis B vaccine in adult adults aged 50 years and over, using conventional doses (20μg)&#xD;
      versus (vs) booster doses.&#xD;

      More than five decades have passed since the identification of the etiologic agent of&#xD;
      hepatitis B and yet this infection is a challenge for public health worldwide. The&#xD;
      development and availability of the first hepatitis B vaccines, still in the 1980s, was a&#xD;
      milestone for the prevention of the hepatitis B virus, and currently known as the gold&#xD;
      standard strategy for the elimination of this infectious disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In several countries, the introduction of the immunobiological occurred gradually, by age&#xD;
      groups and risk groups, and in general, started with newborns and children. In Brazil, only&#xD;
      in 2015, a free offer of the hepatitis B vaccine expanded a population aged 50 years or&#xD;
      older. This universal immunization strategy has contributed to reducing the incidence and&#xD;
      changing the epidemiological profile of HBV worldwide. At the beginning of the 21st century,&#xD;
      it was already possible to shift the epidemiological curve of the infection to parasitize&#xD;
      with 50 years or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consider this scenario of vulnerability to HBV in older adults, it is important to highlight&#xD;
      some aspects. The increase in life expectancy around the world is real data and must be&#xD;
      evaluated. In addition, contemporary aging is accompanied by an increase and improvement in&#xD;
      sexual performance, overcoming myths about &quot;asexual old age&quot; and outdated stereotypes about&#xD;
      sexuality for an adult population in the middle and late stages. On the other hand, sexual&#xD;
      risk behavior in older people being observed, including unprotected sexual intercourse,&#xD;
      multiple sexual partnerships, sexual intercourse with a sex worker, among others. Studies&#xD;
      have been increasing the high prevalence of Sexually Transmitted Infections, especially&#xD;
      hepatitis B in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given this situation, hepatitis B vaccination is the most assertive tool for preventing HBV.&#xD;
      However, even in countries that expand the offer of the vaccine to the entire population,&#xD;
      poor performance of the hepatitis B vaccine in older groups remains a challenge for public&#xD;
      health and is the object of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study conducted by Meeren and collaborators, characterized the relationship age vs. age.&#xD;
      vaccine response to hepatitis B in immunocompetent adults. The protection index identified,&#xD;
      considering all age groups, was 94.5%. However, there was a continuous reduction in&#xD;
      seroprotection associated with age, ranging from 98.6% for young adults aged 20-24 years to&#xD;
      64.8% for the elderly (≥65 years). In addition, this study suggested that the aging of the&#xD;
      immune system starts in adulthood and is intensified after 50-60 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the United States, research conducted with competence aged ≥50 years, showed lower rates&#xD;
      of seroconversion compared to younger people, with protection rates ranging from 68% to&#xD;
      82.2%. Another study carried out in this country, elucidated the risk of non-response to the&#xD;
      anti-HBV vaccine in 63% for products ≥40 years old (p = 0.046).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, in Brazil, an investigation conducted by Caetano et al. with settlers in Goiás, also&#xD;
      illustrated a low responsiveness to the hepatitis B vaccine in the older population. In the&#xD;
      age group aged 40-49 years, seroprotection was identified in only 61.9% of the participants,&#xD;
      and for the age group aged 50-59 years the rate of seroresponse was even lower, only 55.9%&#xD;
      protective titles of anti- HBs. Another study with this same population in Mato Grosso do&#xD;
      Sul, showed an average age above 40 years for our non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the program that supplants this limitation is necessary, until the cohort of children&#xD;
      immunized at birth from a late adulthood. The use of third generation vaccines for this&#xD;
      population seems to be difficult to implement due to the high cost of this immunogen. In this&#xD;
      way, more frequent or more concentrated doses of the second generation vaccine can be a safe&#xD;
      alternative for the older population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, there are no data showing the efficacy of doses of enhanced hepatitis B&#xD;
      vaccines for older adults, and the purpose of this study is to investigate and compare the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the hepatitis B vaccine in adult adults aged 50 years and over, using&#xD;
      conventional doses (20μg) versus (vs) booster doses.&#xD;
