  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has found that adversity (e.g., abuse) and substance use (i.e., drug and alcohol&#xD;
      use) influence an individual with a psychotic disorder's recovery: people with psychosis have&#xD;
      significantly higher rates of adversity and substance use than people with other mental&#xD;
      illnesses. Currently, there are few treatment options for people living with psychosis,&#xD;
      substance misuse, and adversity-related symptoms (e.g. anxiety, depression). This is&#xD;
      especially true for young adults who are in the first years of a psychotic illness (i.e.,&#xD;
      early phase psychosis; EPP) who may be in the best position to benefit from treatment.&#xD;
      Research has demonstrated that Prolonged Exposure (PE), a psychological therapy, may be&#xD;
      appropriate for people in EPP, although there is limited evidence regarding its adaptation&#xD;
      from use in chronic psychosis to EPP. The aim of the proposed study is to adapt and optimize&#xD;
      PE therapy for young adults in EPP. We aim to recruit 20 individuals from the Nova Scotia&#xD;
      Early Psychosis Program (NSEPP) aged 19-35 who will participate in 15 sessions of adapted PE;&#xD;
      we will compare their scores before and after treatment on measures of psychotic symptoms,&#xD;
      amount and frequency of substance use, and adversity-related problems. Our goal is to improve&#xD;
      two qualities that may be contributing to worse outcomes: avoidance and hopelessness. These&#xD;
      are addressed by facing feared reminders of adversity and learning new ways to think about&#xD;
      adverse experiences and mental health problems. The application of this evidence-based&#xD;
      intervention has the potential to create a new treatment avenue for EPP, reducing impairment&#xD;
      and distress, and improving recovery rates.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A single-case experimental design (SCED), specifically, a multiple-baseline design (MBD) [1] will be used; the MBD temporally staggers intervention start times across participants, thereby creating a control group composed of each individual's pre-intervention scores. Randomization of each participant's treatment start time will be used to increase internal validity and minimize bias [2],[3]. Participants will be randomized using a random sampling/assignment generator (randomizer.org). An MBD is most appropriate for a study focused on the optimization of PE+ as it will allow a fine-grained assessment of what components have more or less effectiveness in EPP. This design can also detect significant change during each phase of the intervention. In order to meet standards of evidence for SCEDs, this study will include a total of five treatment phases, which exceeds the recommended minimum of three phases [4].</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The CGI-S measures the clinician's judgement of the severity of the participant's mental illness at this time and the CGI-I measures the degree of improvement from baseline; we will use the total severity score of the CGI-S and the total improvement score of the CGI-I. CGI-I scores range from 1 (Very much improved) to 7 (Very much worse); higher scores indicate worsening, lower scores indicate improvement. CGI-S scores range from 1 (Normal, not ill at all) to 7 (Among the most extremely ill); higher scores indicate greater illness severity, lower scores indicate low severity.&#xD;

    <measure>Session rating scale Version 3 (SRS V3); Change in therapeutic alliance</measure>
    <time_frame>Depending on randomization to intervention start time, this measure is administered after each intervention session; meaning it is administered through study weeks 4 to 18; 5 to 19; or 6 to 20.</time_frame>
    <description>The SRS is a measure of therapeutic alliance. This instrument measures the therapeutic relationship, goals and topics covered in session, therapist approach/method, and the therapy session overall for each therapy session. This information will allow us to assess the impact of therapeutic alliance on symptom change. Participants will fill out this form following each therapy session and will place it in a sealed envelope; therapists will not have access to this information. Total scores range from 0 to 40; higher scores indicate greater therapeutic alliance and lower scores indicate problems in one or more areas of session therapeutic alliance.</description>
