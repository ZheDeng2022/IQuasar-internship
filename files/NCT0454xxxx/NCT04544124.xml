  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine misuse has become a growing concern in Alberta, creating a burden on the&#xD;
      health care system. Further, individuals who use methamphetamine in Alberta exhibit&#xD;
      significant difficulty remaining in treatment. These troubling patterns necessitate the&#xD;
      provision of evidence-based practices (EBPs)-those grounded in empirical evidence-to ensure&#xD;
      the best possible care and outcomes for those struggling with this addiction. Within the&#xD;
      field of substance use (SU), contingency management (CM) is an extensively studied&#xD;
      evidence-based treatment (EBT) for addictive disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CM is an intervention that provides incentives to encourage positive behavioural change.&#xD;
      Compared to standard care (treatment-as-usual (TAU)), CM has resulted in improvements in&#xD;
      abstinence, attendance, adherence, retention, and quality of life. The efficacy of CM has&#xD;
      largely been investigated in the context of reinforcing abstinence, though the literature&#xD;
      suggests that CM which reinforces attendance may be as effective. Research from the US has&#xD;
      examined the cost-effectiveness of CM and found that although CM costs more, it was&#xD;
      associated with greater abstinence, treatment completion, and substance-absent urine compared&#xD;
      to TAU. Despite the promising literature, the uptake of CM in Canada is limited making it&#xD;
      difficult to understand whether this EBT is equally efficacious as compared to the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will implement and evaluate the efficacy of virtually delivered attendance-based&#xD;
      CM in outpatient addiction treatment in Alberta. Participants (N=544) will be individuals&#xD;
      seeking treatment for methamphetamine use (n=304) and individuals seeking treatment for&#xD;
      substance use issues other than methamphetamine use (n=240). It is hypothesized that compared&#xD;
      to participants in TAU, participants in CM will evidence: (1) greater retention, (2) greater&#xD;
      attendance, (3) greater abstinence from methamphetamine and less methamphetamine use, (4)&#xD;
      greater abstinence from other SU and less SU, and (5) greater improvement in quality of life&#xD;
      over the intervention and follow-up periods. Exploratory aims include understanding how:&#xD;
      outcomes differ based remote versus in-person delivery of CM; outcomes differ between&#xD;
      participants who use methamphetamine and participants who use substances other than&#xD;
      methamphetamine; the costs of CM differ from TAU; CM changes health service use.&#xD;
