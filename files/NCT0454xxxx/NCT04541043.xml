    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3b, multicenter, open-label extension (OLE) study to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of Nefecon treatment in patients with IgAN who have completed the Phase 3 Study&#xD;
      Nef-301 and continue to be treated with a stable dose of RAS inhibitor therapy (ACEIs and/or&#xD;
      ARBs). Patients who previously received Nefecon in Study Nef-301 will receive retreatment,&#xD;
      whereas patients who previously received placebo in Study Nef-301 will be treatment naïve to&#xD;
      Nefecon.&#xD;

      This is a Phase 3b, multicenter, open-label extension (OLE) study to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of Nefecon treatment in patients with IgAN who have completed the Phase 3 Study&#xD;
      Nef 301 and continue to be treated with a stable dose of RAS inhibitor therapy (ACEIs and/or&#xD;
      ARBs). Patients who previously received Nefecon in Study Nef-301 will receive retreatment,&#xD;
      whereas patients who previously received placebo in Study Nef-301 will be treatment naïve to&#xD;
      Nefecon. During Study Nef-301 OLE, the patients and Investigators will remain blinded to&#xD;
      treatment given in Study Nef-301.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Study Nef-301 OLE, patients will receive Nefecon for a 9-month period. The dose may be&#xD;
      reduced if clinically relevant adverse events (AEs) develop during the 9-month Treatment&#xD;
      Period that the Investigator considers related to the study drug and that mandate dose&#xD;
      reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will remain on a stable dose of RAS inhibitor therapy (ACEIs and/or ARBs) throughout&#xD;
      the study. The patient will come for a follow-up visit at 12 months after first dose.&#xD;
