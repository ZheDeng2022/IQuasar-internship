  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most patients presenting to hospital with chest pain are discharged home without further&#xD;
      tests once a heart attack has been ruled out. Current strategies to assess patients with a&#xD;
      suspected heart attack involve blood tests to measure troponin, a protein released into the&#xD;
      bloodstream when the heart muscle is damaged. Despite having had a heart attack ruled-out,&#xD;
      some patients have unrecognised coronary heart disease and are at risk of having a heart&#xD;
      attack in the future. However, we do not know what is the best approach to identify and treat&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a heart scan known as computed tomography coronary angiogram (CTCA) to&#xD;
      look for underlying coronary heart disease in patients who have had a heart attack ruled out.&#xD;
      In an earlier study, we performed this scan in patients referred to the outpatient cardiology&#xD;
      clinic with stable chest pain and found that this improved the diagnosis of coronary heart&#xD;
      disease, leading to improvement in patient care that prevented many future heart attacks. Our&#xD;
      research has also demonstrated that troponin levels below the threshold used to diagnose a&#xD;
      heart attack identify those who are at greater risk of having a heart attack in the future.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to confirm whether these low levels of troponin can identify&#xD;
      patients who have underlying coronary heart disease and may benefit from further testing and&#xD;
      preventative treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a newer, more sensitive troponin test, we now know that troponin levels even below the&#xD;
      threshold used to diagnose a heart attack identify patients who are at risk of having a heart&#xD;
      attack in the future. Our research in patients with stable chest pain demonstrated that&#xD;
      computed tomography coronary angiogram (CTCA) improved the diagnosis of coronary heart&#xD;
      disease, leading to improvement in patient care that prevented many future heart attacks.&#xD;
      This study will build on these two major strands of research to confirm whether these low&#xD;
      levels of troponin can identify patients who have underlying coronary heart disease and may&#xD;
      benefit from further testing and preventative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate consecutive patients presenting to hospital with suspected&#xD;
      acute coronary syndrome and cardiac troponin concentration within the normal reference range&#xD;
      for the presence of underlying coronary artery disease. All participants will be invited for&#xD;
      an outpatient CTCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings from this study will help inform a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the role&#xD;
      of CTCA in patients who have a heart attack ruled out, but are identified as intermediate&#xD;
      risk on troponin testing.&#xD;
