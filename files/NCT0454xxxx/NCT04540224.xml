      While classification of malignant breast tumors has traditionally been made according to&#xD;
      their histological appearance, nowadays some subtypes have been defined according to their&#xD;
      molecular features. The different behaviors of tumors in the luminal group necessitated the&#xD;
      need to separate this group into luminal A and B subtypes. Luminal A group has the highest&#xD;
      prevalence among breast cancers; It includes Her2 negative tumors with low proliferative&#xD;
      activity, mitosis rate and low histological grade. The prognosis of patients with luminal A&#xD;
      tumors is very good and metastases are often limited to bones. Luminal-B tumors are more&#xD;
      aggressive. There are some studies investigating the relationship between blood cytokine&#xD;
      levels (TGFβ1, IFNγ) and breast cancer. Human studies have generally evaluated a limited&#xD;
      number of cytokines. The study evaluating the largest number of different cytokines was an&#xD;
      animal study, and 24 different cytokine levels were compared with healthy control rats with&#xD;
      breast cancer. Our aim in this study is to evaluate the relationship between the differences&#xD;
      in blood cytokine values and disease stage in Luminal A, Luminal B, and triple negative&#xD;
      breast cancers.&#xD;

      Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women and the second most common cause of&#xD;
      death after lung cancer. In epidemiological studies, its prevalence is 22-26%, and the risk&#xD;
      of mortality due to breast cancer is around 18%. While classification of malignant breast&#xD;
      tumors has traditionally been made according to their histological appearance, nowadays some&#xD;
      subtypes have been defined according to their molecular features. The different behaviors of&#xD;
      tumors in the luminal group necessitated the need to separate this group into luminal A and B&#xD;
      subtypes. Luminal A group has the highest prevalence among breast cancers; It includes Her2&#xD;
      negative tumors with low proliferative activity, mitosis rate and low histological grade. The&#xD;
      prognosis of patients with luminal A tumors is very good and metastases are often limited to&#xD;
      bones. Luminal-B tumors are more aggressive. The most important difference of this group is&#xD;
      that tumors have a high proliferation rate. The breakpoint between Luminal A and B is&#xD;
      generally accepted immunohistochemically as less than 14% of tumor cells show nuclear Ki67&#xD;
      expression. In addition, approximately 30% of Her2 positive tumors are immunohistochemically&#xD;
      in the luminal B phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection and inflammation constitute approximately 25% of the causes of cancer.Cancers&#xD;
      associated with inflammation usually occur as a result of mutations in DNA. Examples of&#xD;
      cancers associated with chronic infections include Schistosoma haematobium-bladder cancer,&#xD;
      Helicobacter pylori-stomach cancer, human papillomavirus-cervical cancer, Epstein-Barr&#xD;
      virus-nasopharynx cancer, while chronic inflammation due to pro-inflammatory factors&#xD;
      (asbestos, nanomaterials, Barrett's esophagus and ulcerative colitis etc.) plays a role in&#xD;
      cancer development. Chronic inflammation also plays an important role in the development and&#xD;
      recurrence of breast cancer. NF-κB pathway proteins, CRP, serum amyloid, matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinase enzyme family (MMP2, MMP9), urokinase type tissue plasminogen activators&#xD;
      are associated with inflammatory cell migration and breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are some studies investigating the relationship between blood cytokine levels (TGFβ1,&#xD;
      IFNγ) and breast cancer. Human studies have generally evaluated a limited number of&#xD;
      cytokines. The study evaluating the largest number of different cytokines was an animal&#xD;
      study, and 24 different cytokine levels were compared with healthy control rats with breast&#xD;
      cancer.In this study we aimed to evaluate the relationship between the differences in blood&#xD;
      cytokine values (IL-1β, IFN-α2, IFN-γ, TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p (70), IL-17A,&#xD;
      IL-18, IL-23 and IL-33) and disease stage in Luminal A, Luminal B, and triple negative breast&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
