    <measure>Number of subjects experiencing dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the first 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>DLTs will be assessed during the first 4 weeks of treatment for dose-escalation phase and are defined as toxicities that meet pre-defined severity criteria, and assessed as having a suspected relationship to study drug, and unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications that occurs within the first cycle (4 weeks) of treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the time of informed consent signed through to 60 days after last dose of AK109</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence or the deterioration of existing medical event in a clinical study subject administered an investigational drug, which does not necessarily have an unequivocal causal relationship with the investigational product. Incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) , treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) as assessed by CTCAE v5.0.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with confirmed CR or PR, based on RECIST v1.1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease control rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with confirmed CR, PR, or SD, based on RECIST v1.1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the start of treatment with AK109 until the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time from the start of treatment with AK109 until death due to any cause.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Observed pharmacokinetics (PK) exposure of AK109</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of AK109 through 30 days after last dose of AK109</time_frame>
    <description>The endpoints for assessment of PK of AK109 include serum concentrations of AK109 at different timepoints after AK109 administration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of AK109 through 30 days after last dose of AK109</time_frame>
    <description>The immunogenicity of AK109 will be assessed by summarizing the number of subjects who develop detectable ADAs.</description>
