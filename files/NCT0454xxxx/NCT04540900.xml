      A Phase I Study of KB301, a Replication-Incompetent, Non-Integrating Vector Expressing Human&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to thirty-seven (37) subjects divided into two (2) cohorts are planned for this Phase I&#xD;
      study. Subjects enrolled in Cohort I will present a region of healthy buttock skin as a&#xD;
      non-facial target area to receive two (2) injectable doses of KB301 (low or high). Cohort Ia&#xD;
      will also present two regions of healthy buttock skin as a non-facial target area to receive&#xD;
      two (2) injectable doses of KB301 (low or high) as well as a placebo injection. The objective&#xD;
      of this cohort is to evaluate COL3A1 transgene expression (as measured by qRT-PCR of skin&#xD;
      biopsies) and determine the optimal dose. Subjects enrolled in Cohort II will present with&#xD;
      bilaterally symmetrical regions of moderate to severe fine lines and skin roughness as the&#xD;
      target areas; these areas will be randomly assigned to receive either KB301 or a placebo to&#xD;
      determine the extent of skin improvement in the KB301 arm. Throughout the study participants&#xD;
      will complete questionnaires, have images captured of the target areas, undergo physical&#xD;
      examinations, and have safety labs monitored.&#xD;
