  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose is to perform a pragmatic, multicenter, open-label, randomised&#xD;
      clinical trial to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of either continuing or further&#xD;
      de-escalating BMA after a minimum of two years of BMA treatment in patients with bone&#xD;
      metastases from breast cancer and castration-resistant prostate cancer&#xD;

    <measure>Health related quality of life scores</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks after randomization (one year of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Health related quality of life (HR-QoL) scores measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 physical functioning subscale and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)- Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)- for patients with bone metastasis (BM)22 functional interference subscale. The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is an internationally accepted and validated tool in multiple large study cohorts capturing HR-QoL from a multi-dimensional and global perspective in oncology. EORTC-QLQ-BM22 has been validated for use specifically in bone metastases. They were developed in collaboration with patients, healthcare professionals and thorough review of the literature, and therefore important to all stakeholders; the scales are well-defined and easily measured, and HR-QoL is a relevant goal of care in the palliative care setting.</description>
