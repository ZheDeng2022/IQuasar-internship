  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AstraZeneca AB is developing the test medicine, AZD9833, for the potential treatment of&#xD;
      oestrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer. ER-positive breast cancer is where the cancer&#xD;
      cells grow in response to the hormone oestrogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will try to identify and compare how much of the test medicine formulations&#xD;
      (recipes) are taken up into the blood when given as a tablet, a solution and as an injection&#xD;
      directly into the vein. The dose given directly into the vein will be radiolabelled, meaning&#xD;
      that it contains a radioactive component in order to track where the drug is in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also look at the effect of food when taking the test medicine in the form of&#xD;
      the tablet. The test medicine safety and tolerability will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a one-part study involving up to 32 healthy post-menopausal female volunteers aged 50&#xD;
      to 70. Volunteers will be randomly assigned to a group of up to 8, two groups will partake in&#xD;
      four study periods and two groups will partake in three study periods. Volunteers will be&#xD;
      admitted to the clinical unit on the day before dosing (Day -1) for each study period. On Day&#xD;
      1 of each study period, volunteers will receive either a single oral dose (tablet or&#xD;
      solution) of AZD9833 or a single oral dose (tablet) of AZD9833 co-administered with a single&#xD;
      radiolabelled IV dose of [14C]AZD9833, in either the fed or fasted state. There will be a&#xD;
      minimum 7 day washout between periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will remain resident until 72 hours post dose (Day 4) of each study period. A&#xD;
      follow-up phone call will take place 5 to 7 days post-final dose to ensure the ongoing&#xD;
      wellbeing of the volunteers.&#xD;
