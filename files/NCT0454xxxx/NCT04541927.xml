  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BCL11B related disorder, also known as Gabriele-de-Vries syndrome, is mainly characterised by&#xD;
      developmental delay (DD) and intellectual disability (ID), ranging from mild to severe, and&#xD;
      neuroimaging abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are first to better delineate the clinical phenotype, as well as the&#xD;
      neuropsychological profile, and the brain MRI characteristics; and, second, to study the&#xD;
      epigenetic signatures in a cohort of individuals with BCL11B intragenic pathogenic variants.&#xD;
      This work will conduct to a MD thesis of a clinical resident geneticist in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physician that will participate will fill an Excel sheet regarding the clinical and&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessment. The investigators will be also happy to have either CD-ROM or&#xD;
      a link to have access to the brain MRI data as well as a DNA sample with a minimum 0.5ug of&#xD;
      peripheral blood genomic DNA. The investigators will gather the DNA in Montpellier genetic&#xD;
      lab (Dr Mouna BARAT) and send the batch to the Dr Sadikovic' lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 2019 and 2020, The investigators have already recruited data from individuals with&#xD;
      BCL11B pathogenic variants from several European and American genetic centres.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to better understand and delineate the genetic syndrome BCL11B (a.k.a.&#xD;
      Intellectual developmental disorder with dysmorphic facies, speech delay, and T-cell&#xD;
      abnormalities syndrome or IDDSFTA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This genetic disorder was described in June 2017 in the American Journal of Human Genetics&#xD;
      (PMID 28575647).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this first publication of 23 individuals carrying the pathogenic mutation BCL11B,&#xD;
      another individual has been reported in the literature (PMID 30549423).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the first paper focused on the clinical description as well as the effect of&#xD;
      pathogenic BCL11B variations in chromatin regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are seeking to better define the phenotype of individuals with pathogenic&#xD;
      variants of BCL11B, to better understand intellectual functioning as well as the strengths&#xD;
      and weaknesses of intellectual functioning by collecting standardized neuropsychological&#xD;
      assessments already performed such as WPPSI/WISC and WAIS. For this purpose, The&#xD;
      investigators will gather clinical and neuropsychological data already carried out in the&#xD;
      context of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also aim to gather the cerebral MRI scans already performed in order to&#xD;
      better delimit the cerebral anomalies observed in individuals and if the sequence is adapted,&#xD;
      The investigators will perform VBM studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, The investigators will attempt to identify an epigenetic signature in this genetic&#xD;
      disease. To this end, The investigators will collect genomic DNA from peripheral blood&#xD;
      already collected for genetic analysis and send an anonymized batch of samples to our&#xD;
      collaborator, Dr. Bekim Sadicovik. Dr. Bekim Sadicovik and his team will compare the&#xD;
      epigenetic DNA methylation-type markers with the corresponding sex and age controls. If&#xD;
      specific probes are abnormally methylated in BCL11B individuals, this will determine a&#xD;
      disease-specific epigenetic signature. The investigators will then be able to propose an&#xD;
      epigenetic signature for individuals with uncharacterized BCL11B variations (class 3, VUS).&#xD;
      This method will make it possible to define whether the variation is responsible for the&#xD;
      disease or not without going through functional analysis steps that are difficult to&#xD;
      implement routinely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected benefits are a better understanding of BCL11B disease, keys to&#xD;
      neuropsychological rehabilitation, a better understanding of human brain functions, the&#xD;
      possibility of proposing an epigenetic signature for people in whom it is not possible to&#xD;
      decide whether a variation in the BCL11B gene is pathological or not&#xD;
