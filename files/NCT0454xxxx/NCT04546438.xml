  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary localized hyperhidrosis is a dermatological disorder that involves excessive sweat&#xD;
      production without an underlying cause. The disease usually affects the axillae but can also&#xD;
      involve palms, soles of the feet or face and causes major problems in many social situations&#xD;
      with a negative impact on quality of life and mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators want to investigate the effect of microwave therapy&#xD;
      (MiraDry®) on self-rated sweating, quality of life and anxiety in participants with severe&#xD;
      axillary hyperhidrosis. The study also aims to evaluate the safety (side effects) of the&#xD;
      method and long term effects over 1 year of follow upp.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is conducted during several visits or telephone follow-ups at the clinic over a&#xD;
      period of 12 months and each patient receives a maximum of two treatments with MiraDry® (at&#xD;
      3-month intervals). 100 participants are planned to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of the miraDry ® treatment measured by&#xD;
      Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale(HDSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the side effects and the quality of Life by assessment&#xD;
      of The Dermatology life Quality Index, The Hyperhidrosis Quality of Life Index, and Hospital&#xD;
      Anxiety and Depression Scale.&#xD;

    <measure>Dermatology Life Quality Index assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The participants will be asked to complete the Dermatology Life Quality Index, calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. The paticipants will complete the questionnaire at baseline, at 3 months follow-up visit and 1 year follow-up visit.</description>

    <measure>Hospital anxiety and depression scale assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The participants will be asked to complete the questionnaire at baseline, at 3 months follow-up visit and 1 year follow-up visit. The questionnaire has seven items each for depression and anxiety subscales. Scoring for each item ranges from zero to three, with three denoting highest anxiety or depression level. A total subscale score of &gt;8 points out of a possible 21 denotes considerable symptoms of anxiety or depression.</description>

    <description>The participants will be asked to complete the Hyperhidrosis Quality of Life Index at baseline, at 3 months follow-up visit and 1 year follow-up visit. There are 18 items and score ranges from 0 to 36, with higher scores indicating a lower Hyperhidrosis Quality of Life Index.</description>
