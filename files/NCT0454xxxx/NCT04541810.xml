  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease of the joints characterized by the&#xD;
      swelling of multiple joints and tenderness caused by progressive inflammatory synovitis,&#xD;
      which leads to serious and debilitating diseases. This study will assess the adverse events&#xD;
      and change in disease symptoms in Korean participants with RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upadacitinib is a drug approved for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis. Adult Korean participants with moderate to severe RA who have been prescribed&#xD;
      upadacitinib by their physicians will be enrolled. Approximately, 3000 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled this study, in multiple sites within Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive Upadacitinib as prescribed by the physician and will be followed&#xD;
      for approximately 28 Weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no additional burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard&#xD;
      of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the course of the study at a hospital&#xD;
      or clinic and will be asked to provide additional information by questionnaire at each visit.&#xD;
