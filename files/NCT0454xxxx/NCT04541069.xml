      In the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the conversation has shifted&#xD;
      from the complexity of ensuring decrease in infant mortality to that of holistic wellbeing of&#xD;
      children from conception onwards by ensuring early learning opportunities along with&#xD;
      nutrition, security and safety. About 13 - 23 percent children in Bangladesh present symptoms&#xD;
      of diagnosable and preventable mental health conditions in early childhood. The aim of this&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 2 cluster randomized trial is to implement training&#xD;
      program to enhance parental understanding of child's social communication and emotional&#xD;
      development, ways to support positive behavior management skills, and to enhance parents'&#xD;
      cognizance about when professional help may be sought. Shuchona Foundation's module-based&#xD;
      training manual on Social Communication and Emotional Skill Development (SCESD) is designed&#xD;
      to sensitize and educate parents/ caregivers on child development. This module will be&#xD;
      implemented in Sonargaon, Gojaria and Raiganj Upazilas. The administrative wards in the&#xD;
      unions will serve as clusters for the study's first phase. The first phase of six months&#xD;
      duration will explore qualitatively the adaptability of existing health system, train field&#xD;
      level health workers, training of the data collectors on administering Ages and Stages&#xD;
      Questionnaire (ASQ), enrol mothers for equipping them with knowledge and skill to stimulate&#xD;
      Early Childhood Development (ECD) and identify delayed childhood development, followed by&#xD;
      assessment of ability of mothers to note secondary outcomes or delay at the earliest. The&#xD;
      sessions for mother will be conducted using the existing health system of Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mixed-methods approach comprising of process mapping, qualitative and quantitative data&#xD;
      analyses will be used to assess implementation of the intervention with focus on identifying&#xD;
      failures in implementation, why they exist and how to reduce them for future implementation&#xD;
      and scale-up.&#xD;

      2. Introduction The last five years have witnessed a plethora of literature on early&#xD;
      childhood development, the first 1000 days in infancy, and holistic wellbeing of children&#xD;
      from conception onwards. In large part due to the United Nation's Sustainable Development&#xD;
      Goals (SDGs), the conversation has shifted from the complexity of ensuring decrease in infant&#xD;
      mortality to that of ensuring nutrition, prenatal health care, security and safety, early&#xD;
      learning opportunities all of which work together to lead to better outcomes for children.&#xD;
      This is a significant shift for most low and middle income countries (LMIC's), like&#xD;
      Bangladesh, where a well-prepared plan to implement effective programs that are also low-cost&#xD;
      and applicable to the existing infrastructure does not exist. According to the Early&#xD;
      Childhood Nurturing Care Framework, nutrition, health, early learning, responsive caregiving,&#xD;
      security and safety are important components that ensure that countries can achieve their&#xD;
      SDG's and thereby enable better outcomes in later childhood and adulthood. 1 In addition,&#xD;
      planning for an approach that ensures children at risk for conditions like autism and other&#xD;
      developmental disorders are identified sufficiently early in infancy is an added challenge.&#xD;
      According to Munir et al (2018), parents in LMIC's rarely reach out to health professionals&#xD;
      for behavioral and developmental concerns due to social stigma and lack of evidence-based&#xD;
      services, unless their child is experiencing acute medical distress. This in large part&#xD;
      explains why, in a country like Bangladesh, which has a comprehensive policy for children,&#xD;
      disabilities, health care and nutrition, there still continues to be delay in providing early&#xD;
      intervention services and medical services to children with neurodevelopmental disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure 1 The nurturing care framework (Wertlieb, 2019) Nurturing care refers to giving&#xD;
      children the opportunity to learn in their early childhood years through interactions with&#xD;
      peers and adults in a responsive and emotionally supportive environment, which is the result&#xD;
      of public policies, programs, and services that include health, nutrition and security.&#xD;
      Global research indicates that nearly 385 million children are living in extreme poverty, 155&#xD;
      million children under five have stunted growth, and more than 240 million affected by&#xD;
      conflict.2-4 About 300 million children between ages two and four are regularly subjected to&#xD;
      violent discipline, including physical punishment and psychological aggression.4 Moreover,&#xD;
      around 250 million children (43%) less than 5 years of age in low- and middle-income&#xD;
      countries are at risk of not reaching their developmental potential.5 Researches with&#xD;
      0-5-years old indicate that health risks before 24 months impacts mental development of the&#xD;
      child. More than 200 million children under 5 years of age are not reaching their&#xD;
      developmental potential because of poor health, lack of nutrition and poverty. Medical issues&#xD;
      such as delivery by unskilled attendant; infections like malaria and cholera, inadequate&#xD;
      nutrition, and inadequate stimulation significantly increase risk for disabilities and reduce&#xD;
      the potentiality for greater success in life.6-8 Bangladesh has implemented several programs&#xD;
      in order to mitigate the effects of poverty, prenatal and early childhood malnutrition and&#xD;
      adverse living conditions. Programs to educate pregnant women, provide health education in&#xD;
      communities, adequate vaccinations, stipends and various forms of nutritional programs are&#xD;
      currently being provided in many parts of the country through a variety of programs.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, according to the recommendations of research in the area of early childhood&#xD;
      intervention (EDI) and inclusive early childhood education (IEDE), the most effective&#xD;
      programs should encompass both health, learning and stimulation9,10. According to results&#xD;
      from the INTERGROWTH-21ST Project, when adequate nutrition and education are given to primary&#xD;
      caregivers (mostly mothers) of under two years old children, it accounts for 10% variance in&#xD;
      the acquisition of all developmental milestones across all domains, nullifying the supposed&#xD;
      effects of cultural child-rearing practices11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influence of risk and protective factors cannot be evaluated separately from each other;&#xD;
      the balance between the burden experienced by parents, and the capacity and resources of the&#xD;
      parents should always be evaluated together.12 A population based study in Bangladesh&#xD;
      indicated that 14.6% of children have a diagnosable behavioral impairment13 with a higher&#xD;
      prevalence (40.4%) among orphan children.14 Male children were found to be present with&#xD;
      increased risk factors.15 A systematic review published in 2014 in Bangladesh indicated that&#xD;
      13.4 to 22.9% children in Bangladesh present symptoms of diagnosable mental health&#xD;
      condition.16 Bronfenbrenner17 evidenced that environmental factors play a critical role in&#xD;
      coordinating the timing and pattern of gene expression, which in turn determine initial brain&#xD;
      architecture. He stated that the development of children is rooted within a bigger context,&#xD;
      which includes the characteristics of both the parents and the child, and are a result of&#xD;
      constant interaction, as one influences the other: the bioecological model of specific&#xD;
      experiences facilitates or inhibit neuronal connectivity at key developmental stages. Our&#xD;
      perceptual, cognitive, and emotional capabilities are built upon the platform provided by&#xD;
      early life experiences18 It has been evidenced that knowledgeable and skilled parenting can&#xD;
      facilitate a supportive relationship and enhance the future positive psychosocial development&#xD;
      of the child.12&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of clinically validated biomarkers and the significant variation in the&#xD;
      presentation of milder autism cases (typically referred by clinicians as 'high functioning'&#xD;
      autism), it is extremely necessary to find a methodology for early detection of risk factors&#xD;
      that are easily noticeable by caregivers, coupled with intervention techniques that can be&#xD;
      used effectively in the natural environment of the child. The median age of autism diagnosis&#xD;
      and intervention in the United States, where tremendous awareness activities are being done,&#xD;
      is still at 4.5 years of age. A recent review of the research on when and how parents should&#xD;
      be informed about their child's autism diagnosis (See Figure 2) shows that although core&#xD;
      areas of deficit in social communication and repetitive stereotypical behaviors do not become&#xD;
      apparent till nearly 24 months of age, many early indicators do exist that have been&#xD;
      substantiated as prodromal features in the first 6 months 20. And given our understanding of&#xD;
      brain plasticity and developmental peaks, there is a strong likelihood that well-trained&#xD;
      caregivers can effectively prevent core symptoms of autism from manifesting. At the very&#xD;
      least, methods, as prescribed by the Social Communication and Emotional Skill Development&#xD;
      (SCESD) manual, could enable a reduced intensity of the delays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early identification of developmental disorders is critical to the well-being of children and&#xD;
      their families.21 The earlier identification of delay increases the opportunity to provide&#xD;
      early intervention, maximizing the benefit of that intervention.22 Thus promoting the&#xD;
      development of the child in later years.12 Although evidence shows that early intervention&#xD;
      can reduce the impact on the functioning of the child and the family, identification of&#xD;
      inadequate social communication and emotional skills in young children has always been a&#xD;
      challenging process.22 Family members can play a vital role in the identification and&#xD;
      application of the intervention process especially in children under 5 years of age.23 In&#xD;
      developing countries with increased child survival, the number of children with&#xD;
      social-communication delay is also increasing24. Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)&#xD;
      and the Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities (CRPD), both state that children&#xD;
      with disabilities have the right to develop to their maximum potential. Investment in Early&#xD;
      Childhood Development (ECD), should also focus on children at risk of developmental delays or&#xD;
      disabilities24. In a report of the project &quot;Developing an Inclusive Education and ECD&#xD;
      Strategy&quot; (2013-2014), Plan Sri Lanka in collaboration with the faculty of medicine&#xD;
      university of Kelaniya recommended each early learning activity to be broken down into small&#xD;
      steps to support children with delays/ disabilities. It also recommended that the staff/&#xD;
      teachers involved in pre-school cares should be well equipped with the knowledge of screening&#xD;
      of early delays/ disabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to lack of proper tools and resources, many children with developmental delays are not&#xD;
      being identified early in LMICs. Moreover, after the first concern, it requires a long time&#xD;
      to get professional help. As a result, these children often must wait until they start going&#xD;
      to school before they receive help25. Therefore, ECD programs beside providing child&#xD;
      development strategies also need to make parents/ caregivers aware of the stages of regular&#xD;
      child development which will potentially enable the families to pick up any difference from&#xD;
      the typical developmental trajectory. This will in turn help early detection of developmental&#xD;
      delays. With proper support, these delays can be prevented from growing into a disability or&#xD;
      reducing the severity of the disability and thereby potentially leading to lesser poverty and&#xD;
      marginalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be noted that for LMIC's like Bangladesh, an early intervention model is needed&#xD;
      that can be implemented by non-experts with minimal training, and at a low cost. It is also&#xD;
      important that the model can be easily scaled up and implemented within the existing&#xD;
      childcare service settings 26. In order to achieve these goals, Shuchona Foundation developed&#xD;
      a training program that can be learned/adopted by parents, caregivers, daycare workers and&#xD;
      others. The primary philosophy of the training is based on principals of the Early Start&#xD;
      Denver Model and is focused on teaching social communication skills and behavior management&#xD;
      techniques, which could be used within day-to-day typical childcare practices such as&#xD;
      feeding, bathing, etc. Additionally, the current project would explore the possibility of&#xD;
      parental skills training; in addition to a home-based early intervention model could be&#xD;
      effectively incorporated into a variety of existing government programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shuchona Foundation's module-based training manual on Social Communication and Emotional&#xD;
      Skill Development (SCESD) is designed to sensitize and educate parents and other caregivers&#xD;
      on the development of the child under their care. Developed in Bangladesh and field-tested,&#xD;
      the manual is based on the premises of social interaction challenges often experienced by&#xD;
      children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). It is based on the premise that enabling&#xD;
      parents to recognize early indicators of social-communication delay and teaching them simple&#xD;
      adaptations to everyday childcare practices, may serve as an effective prevention practice&#xD;
      that possibly could mitigate the need for further screening and/or seeking specialist care&#xD;
      for the milder delays 27. In addition, by teaching functional strategies applicable in the&#xD;
      natural home environment, parents with children who later receive a diagnosis and require&#xD;
      professional intervention would find it relatively easier to implement the professional's&#xD;
      recommendations in the home. Thus, enabling the intervention to be more effective and&#xD;
      increasing the likelihood that the parents would be partners in the treatment process of&#xD;
      their child over the years. Recent studies on early autism interventions indicate programs&#xD;
      that include parent skill-building programs are a key component to ensuring that the effects&#xD;
      of the intervention remain in later childhood and those children do better in social&#xD;
      interactions with peers28, although existing community-based programs appear not to be as&#xD;
      effective as those implemented in clinical settings 29. The aim of this training is to&#xD;
      enhance parental understanding of typical child development with significant focus on social&#xD;
      communication and emotional development; to teach parents positive behavior management&#xD;
      skills; teach parents and other caregivers simplified evidence-based strategies that can be&#xD;
      implemented in the typical care of their child; to enable parents to be more cognizant for&#xD;
      when professional help needs to be sought, and be effective partners with the professionals&#xD;
      involved in the therapeutic treatment of their child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 General objective To design of a social communication and emotional skill development&#xD;
      intervention and determine its' efficacy in promoting Early Childhood Development (ECD) and&#xD;
      controlling developmental delay among under 5 children using existing health system in&#xD;
      Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Specific objectives&#xD;

           intervention for infants and young children in community health care settings&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the effectiveness of the community centered module-based approach in&#xD;
           monitoring social communication and emotional development and those factors which may&#xD;
           influence social-emotional development, in infants and young children.&#xD;
&#xD;

           population of trained carers to carers as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the predictive values of community-based approach, in accurately identifying&#xD;
           specific social-emotional problems among sample population&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate the quality of care and carers' compliance regarding responsive parenting,&#xD;
           disclose concerns, as compared to carers as usual.&#xD;

           care settings to integrate and deliver the proposed intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. To determine the cost effectiveness of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Brief description of the module for intervention The intervention, Social Communication&#xD;
      and Emotional Skill Development (SCESD) module, is based on the basics of the neuroscience of&#xD;
      child development. Some basic behaviors in early childhood, starting from infancy can predict&#xD;
      future cognition, socialization and language acquisition. The module has focused on these&#xD;
      basic behaviors of infants, and has incorporated strategies to enhance the five basic&#xD;
      behaviors i.e. eye contact, attention to others, joint attention, imitation and non-verbal&#xD;
      communication. The development of typical brain functioning requires input via all of the&#xD;
      major sensory systems. Therefore, different fun activities have been shown to encourage&#xD;
      children's tactile, auditory and visual sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The techniques used in this training can be used throughout the day during caregiving and&#xD;
      other daily activities, based on the principles of the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM). ESDM,&#xD;
      which is mainly used for children with ASD, is based on normal child development model,&#xD;
      therefore the basic developmental stages and strategies to enhance child development in&#xD;
      different domains can be applicable for all children. This has made the ECD module inclusive&#xD;
      for all children and has reduced the gap between research and practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The module has been developed after analysing the financial and other resource support system&#xD;
      operating in the community, and as such has incorporated evidence based measures in ESDM for&#xD;
      encouraging parent-child dyadic interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are some chapters in the module that focus on children's 'Receptive' and 'Expressive'&#xD;
      language development. Using non-verbal communication has also been encouraged through 'Least&#xD;
      to Most technique'. After each chapter different stages of development on the specific topic&#xD;
      have been described in an easy to understand way (including pictorial) to help the caregivers&#xD;
      understand the level of functioning of the child and what steps need to be taken to advance&#xD;
      the development. The basics of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) and Positive behavior Support&#xD;
      (PSP) techniques have been explained in a way that can be translated into the real-life&#xD;
      situation by parents and other caregivers. Two separate sections have been incorporated to&#xD;
      encourage to support children's behaviors in a positive way. The need for setting up rules&#xD;
      and how to do that has been explained in one. Strategies to tackle children's difficult&#xD;
      behaviors has been discussed in another section. Besides teaching the behavioral strategies,&#xD;
      the main focus of these chapters is to make sure that the children know about their emotions,&#xD;
      and how to support them to express it properly; this is mainly based on the principles of&#xD;
      children version of 'Cognitive Behavior Therapy' model. The chapter on children's attention&#xD;
      skills and motor development has also been incorporated in the module.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also a small booklet for the mothers with the key messages and relevant pictorial&#xD;
      contents. The complete module takes a total of 19 hours to be delivered. The total content is&#xD;
      split into 4 sessions. However, for the first phase of the project, only the first 3 sessions&#xD;
      will be provided to the mothers. These 3 sessions will be distributed between 2 classes. The&#xD;
      first class will be 30 minutes long, the second class which will also include some activity&#xD;
      will be an hour long. The sessions will be taken in spaced intervals, and will be delivered&#xD;
      personally to mothers and families at households by multi-purpose volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The module was reviewed by international experts in the field of child development. Further&#xD;
      revisions were done based on the experience and feedback from trainings conducted with&#xD;
      different audience, including audience with limited or no literacy. The module was finalized&#xD;
      by Shuchona Foundation Expert Team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Study Overview 6.1 Study setting The study setting for this effectiveness-implementation&#xD;
      hybrid type 2 cluster randomized trial will be in three Upazilas of Bangladesh, namely&#xD;
      Sonargaon, Gojaria and Raiganj. Each Upazilla usually comprises of 10 unions and each union&#xD;
      has 9 wards in it. The wards in the unions will serve as clusters for the study. Usually,&#xD;
      there is one Upazila Health complex (UHC) in each Upazila, while each ward consists of one&#xD;
      community clinic, and five multipurpose volunteers. The community clinics are under the&#xD;
      supervision of respective UHC. The community clinics and Upazila Health Complexes are the&#xD;
      primary level of health care services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Study duration&#xD;
&#xD;
      For effective intervention, the study has been divided into four phases as shown in figure 4.&#xD;
      The first, second, third and fourth phase will be the focus of this study which will last for&#xD;
      about 6 months. It would be pertinent to explain the phases to highlight the content of the&#xD;
      four phases. The first phase will include an exploration to assess whether the health system&#xD;
      is adaptive and ready for the implementation of this project. In the second phase, training&#xD;
      of the primary health care providers who will give antenatal services and enrolment of&#xD;
      mothers in the study, training of the Health Assistants (HA), Family Welfare Assistant (FWA)&#xD;
      and Community Health Care Providers (CHCP) who will work in the community at household level&#xD;
      to deliver the training to mothers and families, and also training of the data collectors who&#xD;
      will measure the study outcomes at household level. Second phase will start enrolling mothers&#xD;
      of children under 2 months of age, which will continue in subsequent phases of the study. In&#xD;
      the third phase, mothers will be trained and data will be collected on the information of&#xD;
      child development. The later phase of the study will assess children and mothers at different&#xD;
      stages of the children's lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial two months of the first phase will be used for qualitative data collection and,&#xD;
      analysis, followed by designing the intervention incorporating the findings. Accordingly,&#xD;
      antenatal care (ANC) providers, Health Assistants (HA), Family Welfare Assistant (FWA),&#xD;
      Community Health Care Providers (CHCP), and data collectors will be trained, and enrolment of&#xD;
      study participants will commence. During the next four months the designed intervention will&#xD;
      be implemented, along with continuation of the enrolment of study participants. When mothers&#xD;
      enrolled for the study have finished undergoing the training sessions, the respective&#xD;
      children will be primarily assessed with the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ), followed by&#xD;
      assessment of ability of mothers to note secondary outcomes or delay at the earliest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Study participants 7.1 Sample and sample size calculation All available clusters (wards)&#xD;
      will be listed in the study area and thus a sampling frame will be generated. Required number&#xD;
      of clusters calculated during sample size estimation will be selected from this frame&#xD;
      randomly for entering the study using a random sequence generator in Microsoft Excel.&#xD;
      Randomization of the available clusters into intervention and control groups will be done in&#xD;
      the same manner using random numbers. Control and intervention groups will be selected in 1:1&#xD;
      ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All mothers (primary caregivers) of children under 2 months of age in the study area will be&#xD;
      approached for enrolment. The calculation of sample size is as follows. Prevalence of&#xD;
      behavior problem of young children in Bangladesh was considered as the indicator for&#xD;
      calculating the sample size of this study. The sample size has been calculated considering&#xD;
      the prevalence to be 14.6%.16 To measure a 35% effect size, an equal and minimum number of&#xD;
      624 mothers for each of the interventions and control arm will be recruited to gain a power&#xD;
      of 80% at a 5% level of significance (two sided) with the formula for Randomized control&#xD;
      trials. To address the cluster effect of the design, the sample size is multiplied by 1 + (m&#xD;
      - 1)ρ, where m is the average cluster size and ρ is the is the inter cluster correlation&#xD;
      coefficient (ICC).21,22 Considering inter cluster correlation of 0.05,22 and an average&#xD;
      number of 10 eligible mother in each cluster the design effect is 1.45 [1+(10-1)*0.05]. Thus,&#xD;
      we determined that we need a minimum of 905 eligible participants per arm. Considering 10%&#xD;
      drop out the size will be 1002. Which in turn makes 101 clusters per arm. Total 2004 mother&#xD;
      will be recruited for intervention and control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2 Participants Recruitment The study will focus on the rural population as majority of the&#xD;
      country's population reside in rural areas, and are less likely to be exposed to ECD&#xD;
      interventions. Primarily, the mothers of children under 2 months of age will be continuously&#xD;
      enrolled as study participants. These mothers will be equipped with the knowledge and skill&#xD;
      for stimulating ECD and identifying indicators of delayed development of children (training&#xD;
      sessions), which will take place during the Inter personal communication (IPC), and Expanded&#xD;
      Programme on Immunization (EPI) sessions where the mothers visit to get their children&#xD;
      vaccinated. For the first phase, data of mothers who will undergo at least 2 training&#xD;
      sessions will only be included for analysis. The mothers will then be followed up for the&#xD;
      next two years covering both phases. In this second phase the mother child unit who were&#xD;
      trained will be followed every two months, as well as the enrolment and training of new&#xD;
      mothers will continue. The family of the mother will also receive the intervention which is&#xD;
      thought to enable a supportive environment for the mother and also due to the fact that,&#xD;
      children are exposed to and influenced by other family members as well. Mothers, however, are&#xD;
      the main recipient of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mothers will be identified at the primary health care center where they receive their&#xD;
      antenatal check-ups. Assistance of field health workers will also be taken to identify and&#xD;
      enroll the mothers. The health care provider at the center or field health workers will be&#xD;
      responsible for taking consent, recording the enrolment of the eligible participant in the&#xD;
      intervention and control clusters, and taking anthropometric measurements of all enrolled&#xD;
      mothers. After randomization, the mothers enrolled in the control clusters of this study will&#xD;
      receive conventional antenatal care. The contact information of these mothers will be&#xD;
      collected and maintained by the manager of the primary health care center where mother&#xD;
      receives antenatal service. This information will then be passed on to the Coordinators who&#xD;
      will then coordinate with the data collectors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mother of children under 2 months of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible mother who will give consent to participate in the study&#xD;

           these 243 to 270.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. 101 of the wards will be randomly assigned to intervention arm and another 101 wards&#xD;
           will be randomly assigned to control arm&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Total of 7 wards per Union will be selected.&#xD;
