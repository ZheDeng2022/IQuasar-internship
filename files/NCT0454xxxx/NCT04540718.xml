  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate the effects of including regular heat therapy when included to&#xD;
      exercise. Specifically, participants in the sauna intervention group will undergo 15 minutes&#xD;
      of sauna exposure immediately after a 50-minute session of exercise, 3 times a week, while&#xD;
      participants in the exercise intervention group will follow only the same exercise protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 50-minute exercise session consists of 20 minutes of moderate intensity strength&#xD;
      exercise, followed by 30 minutes of moderate-vigorous aerobic exercise on stationary bikes.&#xD;
      This exercise intervention protocol was selected in order to meet and adhere to the&#xD;
      recommended physical activity guidelines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The main purpose of the experiment is to investigate the cardiovascular modulations of sauna&#xD;
      use with respect to vascular compliance and hemodynamics. The investigators seek to&#xD;
      understand the long-term adaptations of regular sauna bathing in conjunction with exercise,&#xD;
      particularly in sedentary populations with cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of particular interests are the cardiovascular adaptations of regular sauna bathing when used&#xD;
      in conjunction with exercise training; which meets the recommended minimum of current&#xD;
      physical activity guidelines. Recent studies have shown that long-term sauna use with&#xD;
      exercise is more effective than sauna use alone in patients with chronic heart failure.&#xD;
      However several questions pertaining to regular exercise in combination with sauna use remain&#xD;
      to be answered, as experimental data in the general population is still lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project aims to find out the differences (if any) in cardiovascular and&#xD;
      hemodynamic-related outcome parameters, between regular exercise according to the minimum&#xD;
      recommended guidelines, and the same exercise program with an additional regular 15 minute&#xD;
      sauna session post exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training intervention will last for 8 weeks, with each session consisting of 20 minutes&#xD;
      of moderate intensity resistance training, followed by 30 minutes of aerobic training.&#xD;
      Participants in the exercise only group rested in the training area for 15 minutes while the&#xD;
      exercise and sauna participants went to the sauna for 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temperature of the sauna room was increased by 5 degrees celsius every fortnight starting&#xD;
      from 65 degrees celsius; during the final 2 weeks of the intervention the sauna temperature&#xD;
      was at 80 degrees celsius. (65, 70, 75, 80). Participants were told that they could leave the&#xD;
      sauna room anytime they felt uncomfortable or if they wish to.&#xD;
