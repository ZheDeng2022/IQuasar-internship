  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a single arm, two cohorts, phase II study. All patients are stage IIIB-IV&#xD;
      NSCLC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1 and no sensitizing&#xD;
      mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene or translocation of the anaplastic&#xD;
      lymphoma kinase gene. Cohort 1 includes patients with metastatic or recurrent NSCLC after&#xD;
      progression on treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1, given concurrently&#xD;
      or sequentially. Cohort 2 includes treatment na√Øve patients with advanced NSCLC. All patients&#xD;
      will recieve AK104 15mg/kg every 3 weeks(for up to 2 years) and anlotinib(12mg/d). The&#xD;
      primary end point are objective response rate per RECIST1.1 and safety. Secondary end points&#xD;
      are progression-free survival and overall survival.&#xD;
