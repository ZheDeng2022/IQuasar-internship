    <intervention_model_description>This is a fully remote trial where participants engage at home in the study using the ProofPilot study platform. All potential participant enrollment data, including proof of identity via government ID will be reviewed by licensed medical professionals in the participant's state prior to their full enrollment.&#xD;
Participants will be randomized into an immediate or delayed treatment arm. The immediate treatment arm participants will be shipped an active Fisher Wallace device limited to Level 2 output even if a participant raises the dial beyond that. The participant will remain with the active device for the full 8 weeks.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>This is a fully remote trial. Participants will be randomized in ProofPilot, and only the fulfillment center will know whether the participant is in the placebo or control arm.&#xD;
Participants will be unblinded at week 4 at the crossover.</masking_description>

    <description>In the delayed treatment arm, the participants will receive a sham device that looks exactly the same, but only provides treatment for 2 seconds. At week 4, sham arm participants will be unblinded and shipped an active device (limited to Level 2 output even if a participant raises the dial beyond that). The delayed arm participants will continue with active devices for the remaining 4 weeks of the trial.</description>
