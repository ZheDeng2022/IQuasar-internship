    <textblock>
      FITSTART (Feedback Intervention Targeting Student Transitions and Risk Trajectories) is a&#xD;
      parent-based social norms intervention that has been shown to reduce risky drinking in&#xD;
      incoming first year students.This program uses normative feedback to correct parents&#xD;
      overestimation of other parents negative alcohol-related parenting practices (e.g., number of&#xD;
      drinks parents would permit their college student to consume). Theory and research suggests&#xD;
      that correcting those common misperceptions can motivate parents to adjust their own&#xD;
      behaviors (e.g., reducing the number of drinks they would permit), which, in turn, can impact&#xD;
      college student drinking. Despite FITSTARTs success, the design of the program limits&#xD;
      participation to only students who have parents who can attend on-campus orientation sessions&#xD;
      during the summer months before the start of the Fall semester. To address this limitation&#xD;
      and extend the previous work, the proposed randomized clinical trial (RCT) will evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of an online adaptation of the FITSTART(+) PBI program. To examine the efficacy of&#xD;
      the newly developed FITSTART+ PBI web app, the proposed RCT will use a longitudinal design to&#xD;
      examine if students self-report drinking and related negative consequences during their first&#xD;
      semester in college significantly differed between FITSTART+ PBI (intervention app) and a&#xD;
      control version of the app. Self-reported drinking and consequences are expected to be lower&#xD;
      amongst students with parents randomized to FITSTART+ PBI relative to those with parents&#xD;
      randomized to the control app.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Heavy episodic drinking (HED) rates remains at unacceptably high levels on college campuses.&#xD;
      Researchers on parent-based interventions (PBIs) has revealed promising results. but studies&#xD;
      have generally failed to reduce HED in college students. FITSTART was developed to address&#xD;
      two limitations of traditional PBIs that may contribute to the lack of the aforementioned&#xD;
      effects: (I) they are purely informational and (II) they typically lack a motivational&#xD;
      component to capture parents' attention and increase motivation to proactively engage their&#xD;
      students. Pilot work has revealed that parents display predictable normative misperceptions&#xD;
      (e.g., overestimate how approving other parents are of drinking and underestimate how often&#xD;
      other parents engage with their students about drinking). As predicted by social norms&#xD;
      theory, these false beliefs are associated with parents displaying more approving attitudes&#xD;
      themselves and communicating less frequently. Correcting these norms should motivate parents&#xD;
      to proactively engage their child in risk-reducing directions. FITSTART combined a social&#xD;
      norms feedback component with informational material (&quot;tips&quot;) characteristic of a traditional&#xD;
      PBI in an in-person interactive format and successfully reduced HED. While the effects on&#xD;
      weekly drinking, HED, and non-drinker alcohol use initiation were robust 1-month into college&#xD;
      (3-months post intervention). FITSTART's usefulness as a universal approach is limited&#xD;
      because it was delivered to parent groups on-campus during pre-college orientation sessions&#xD;
      and many colleges do not hold summer orientations and/or lack the resources to administer&#xD;
      FITSTART. To address this limitation, a web-based platform (or app) was developed using a new&#xD;
      cutting-edge modality that draws from the computer science literature on virtual co-presence&#xD;
      to create an online environment that mimics the effects of a live group social norms session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current pilot study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of the FITSTART+ PBI in a randomized&#xD;
      control trial (RCT) by evaluating changes in incoming first-year students' alcohol use and&#xD;
      related negative consequences during the transition into college. The sample will consist of&#xD;
      parent-student dyads recruited from Loyola Marymount University (LMU). Eligible dyads are&#xD;
      those that include a parent of an incoming LMU first-year student. The parent needs to have&#xD;
      downloaded and registered for the FITSTART+ app and the student needs to have completed a&#xD;
      baseline survey prior to the parent receiving the app. Parents will be invited to download&#xD;
      the intervention/control app two weeks prior to their student's arrival on campus in the fall&#xD;
      (beginning of August). To examine the short- and long-term effects of the intervention,&#xD;
      students will complete a baseline survey at the end of July (pre-matriculation) and two&#xD;
      follow-up surveys, approximately 1 month (October) and 6 months (April) after the students&#xD;
      arrive on campus in the spring.&#xD;
