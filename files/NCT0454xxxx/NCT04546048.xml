  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation (LT) is a current life-saving procedure performed as an open-abdominal&#xD;
      surgery for patients with end-stage liver diseases (ESLD). However, a high risk of&#xD;
      post-surgical complications is relevant to major intra-abdominal interventions. In managing&#xD;
      post-LT recovery, it is important to consider the extending pre-transplant physical status of&#xD;
      ESLD patients concerning an impaired exercise capacity, a prolonged period of deconditioning,&#xD;
      fatigue and muscle weakness, which leads to global motor impairment and decreased functional&#xD;
      capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcopenia and physical deconditioning are known as the hallmark features of ESLD. The&#xD;
      quality and the quantity of skeletal muscle mass have been closely correlated with&#xD;
      post-transplantation mortality in individuals undergoing LT. In addition to chronic&#xD;
      deconditioning or myopathy related to chronic liver failure, post-transplant&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medication contributes to increased risk for age-related decline in&#xD;
      muscular strength and physical ability. It reportedly persists impaired physical function&#xD;
      including reduced muscle strength, which have been consistently associated with impaired&#xD;
      quality of life after a liver transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise interventions in solid-organ recipients provide improvements in physical function&#xD;
      including skeletal muscle strength. The literature has defined many types of exercise-based&#xD;
      interventions including aerobic and resistive training or physical activity counselling in&#xD;
      improving physical performance tasks, muscle strength and physical domain of quality of life&#xD;
      in postoperative liver transplanted adults. Although there are studies in improving muscle&#xD;
      performance and functional status, no study conducted in the post-transplant early period and&#xD;
      an optimal exercise regimen for post-liver recipients. In the present study, it will be&#xD;
      provided a framework for a possible change in practice aiming to improve muscle strength and&#xD;
      functionality in liver recipients through a strength training exercise intervention at the&#xD;
      early post-transplant period. The purposes of this trial were: 1) to evaluate the feasibility&#xD;
      and safety of a strength exercise training program on functional mobility and quality of life&#xD;
      of liver transplanted individuals and 2) to initiate physiotherapy protocols in this&#xD;
      population. A key component of this approach was that it was individualized, providing&#xD;
      one-to-one therapy with tailored progression specific to a person's individual mobility&#xD;
      goals.&#xD;

The usual post-transplant care consisting of preoperative patient education, respiratory physiotherapy program, active/active assistive exercises of cervical, upper and lower extremities, and early mobilization.&#xD;
Patients were instructed about the postoperative physiotherapy process including all details within the preoperative education. Respiratory physiotherapy consisted of positioning, lung expansion exercises and bronchial hygiene techniques.&#xD;

    <description>The 8-week exercise-training program consisted of two 30-min sessions a day for 5 days/week and conducted by elastic exercise bands in 2-3 sets, 6-10 repetitions, with 1-2 min rest between sets (M. Deltoideus and M. Quadriceps are trained as major muscle groups). The 8-repetition maximum(8RM) is used to determine training loads with the rated perceived exertion(RPE) lower than 5-7 on the Modified Borg scale(MBS). The program consisted functional exercises by half squat to squat and sit-to-stand chair exercises. Exercise sessions were supervised twice daily during the 1st week, the 2nd week training included one supervised and one unsupervised daily sessions. The remaining 6-week training program conducted at home individually after discharge. Patients instructed for the ongoing 8-week training program and a patient-specific schedule delivered to subjects. Phone calls are provided weekly and training load is assessed while generating 4th week evaluations.</description>
