  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To address perceived loneliness via citizen empowerment, ARTISAN (Aspiration and Resilience&#xD;
      Through Intergenerational Storytelling and Art-based Narratives) was developed by the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator in partnership with the National Arts Council and the National Museum&#xD;
      of Singapore. A 2018 pilot study was conducted with the aim to establish ARTISAN's&#xD;
      intervention framework, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in&#xD;
      promoting resilience, social connectedness, wellbeing, personhood and nationhood. The current&#xD;
      research builds on the empirical foundation of the pilot study and seeks to deconstruct the&#xD;
      ARTISAN intervention for gaining a deeper understanding of its underlying mechanisms for&#xD;
      promoting positive life changes among youth and senior participants such as reduced&#xD;
      loneliness, enhanced resilience, psychological wellbeing, social connectedness and sense of&#xD;
      nationhood.&#xD;

      Objective: The core objective is to critically investigate and assess the independent and&#xD;
      combined efficacy of each key intervention components of ARTISAN's multimodal framework,&#xD;
      which consist of: 1) full ARTISAN condition; 2) intergenerational participatory arts&#xD;
      condition; 3) intergenerational art space condition; 4) intergenerational storytelling&#xD;
      condition; and 5) control condition of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Utilizing a five-arm, multicentre randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, 70&#xD;
      youths and 70 seniors (N=140) from 10 collaborating sites will be invited to participate in a&#xD;
      5-weeks intervention programme under one of five conditions (ARTISAN condition, Participatory&#xD;
      Arts condition, Art-space condition, Storytelling condition, Control condition). Quantitative&#xD;
      measurements will be taken at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and ten week post&#xD;
      baseline the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The results generated will serve to illuminate the intricate pathways in which&#xD;
      arts and heritage can cultivate positive life changes, and address misconceptions and about&#xD;
      the pivotal roles that arts and heritage play in health promotion.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Using site randomization, each higher education institution will be randomized into one of the five RCT conditions (i.e. full ARTISAN, participatory arts, art space, storytelling and control), and each elderly care agency will be randomized into one of the same five conditions. Based on randomization outcome, one higher education institution will be paired with one elderly care agency, the paired collaborating sites will be allocated to the same RCT condition. Participant recruitment will be simultaneously conducted at each paired sites through 5 sequential rounds, and each round will recruit 2 groups, totalling 10 groups for the entire study. Each group will comprise 14 participants with youths and senior to be randomized paired as dyads, who will undergo a 5-week RCT condition with a follow-up assessment at 10-weeks. At any given time during the study, 2 groups will be run concurrently until all 10 groups complete the RCT.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Youth and senior participants will be randomly paired and engage in the 5-weekly, 3-hour ARTISAN intervention as dyads (totaling 15 hours of intervention). In the first four weeks of the ARTISAN, dyads will engage in themed museum tours facilitated by a docent (45min), guided storytelling (45 min) and professionally-led art-making (45 min). The remaining time (45 min) is allocated for session breaks, session introduction/closing, and buffer time for movement around the gallery. The final week involves an exhibition where participants share their artworks with the public and reflect on their experiences and artworks. The weekly session themes are as follows: Week 1: Discovering our National Heritage (Art medium: Clay); Week 2: Strengthening Social Bonds (Art medium: Acrylic Paints); Week 3: Overcoming Adversities and Resilience (Art medium: Beads); Week 4: Building Dreams and Aspirations (Art medium: Recycled Materials); Week 5: Sharing our Stories and Legacies (Community Showcase)</description>
