  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The training of robotic surgical procedural skills has been challenged by changes in work&#xD;
      practices and safety concerns specifically related to training. In surgery and procedural&#xD;
      medicine simulation-based training has been demonstrated to supplant the early part of the&#xD;
      learning curve. Training in the skills laboratory is however expensive because of equipment&#xD;
      and supervision burdens. In this study the investigators will assess the economic impact of&#xD;
      proficiency-based progression (PBP) e-learning training prior to training in the skills&#xD;
      laboratory. 48 trainees will be randomly assigned to one of four groups. 1) will receive an&#xD;
      apprenticeship type training (Group 1 ; n=12), 2) A standard or traditional trained group&#xD;
      (Group 2; n=12) will then receive face-to-face lectures on how to perform the robotic&#xD;
      surgical training task (i.e., ORSI chicken anastomosis task for learning robotic suturing and&#xD;
      knot tying.) 3) The third group (Group 3; n=12) will have e-learning training prior to&#xD;
      training in the skills laboratory and then learn the same task. 4) The fourth group (Group 4;&#xD;
      n=12) will have the exact same pre-course e-learning curriculum as Group 3 but will be&#xD;
      required to study it until they score at the quantitatively defined proficiency benchmark of&#xD;
      experienced robotic surgeons, i.e., the mean performance level of experienced robotic&#xD;
      surgeons - they can complete the task with &lt;10 performance errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be conducted at the laboratory skills lab of Orsi Academy, Proefhoevestraat&#xD;
      12 9090 Melle. It will be conducted by Maxime Lasseel and Laura Langhendries, under direct&#xD;
      guidance of Dr. S. Puliatti, Prof. A.G. Gallagher and Prof. A. Mottrie.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Simulation-based training has been shown to be an effective way to prepare the trainee for&#xD;
      the operating room. Gallagher et al. have demonstrated in a number of studies that&#xD;
      proficiency-based progression (PBP) simulation training works best when it is integrated into&#xD;
      a curriculum. Learning is optimal when trainees receive metric-based feedback on their&#xD;
      performance. Metrics should unambiguously characterize important aspects of procedure or&#xD;
      skill performance. They are developed from a task analysis of the procedure or skills to be&#xD;
      learned. The outcome of the task analysis should also shape how the simulation looks and&#xD;
      behaves. Metric-based performance characterization can be used to establish a benchmark&#xD;
      (i.e., a level of proficiency) which trainees must demonstrate before training progression.&#xD;
      This approach ensures a more homogeneous skill-set in graduating trainees and can be applied&#xD;
      to any level of training. Prospective, randomized and blinded clinical studies have shown&#xD;
      that trainees who acquired their skills to a level of proficiency on a simulator in the&#xD;
      skills laboratory perform significantly better in vivo in comparison to their traditionally&#xD;
      trained colleagues. Although simulation-based training has been shown to be very effective in&#xD;
      helping trainees acquire skills for the operating room. Acquiring skills in the skills&#xD;
      laboratory, outside the operating is no doubt significantly safer for patients as they can&#xD;
      acquire skills at the start of their learning curve, away from the operating room. The skills&#xD;
      laboratory is however a very expensive resource particularly for the acquisition of skills to&#xD;
      used advanced technologies such as surgical robots. It is recognised that inadequate training&#xD;
      in robotic surgery results in increased complications and higher costs. Standardising modular&#xD;
      training with defined steps and the errors to avoid will enable proficiency-based progression&#xD;
      (PBP) training. Skills training for robotic surgery is some of the most expensive training&#xD;
      space in medicine. It therefore should be used efficiently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E-learning is naturally suited for the delivery of multisensory information such as material&#xD;
      associated with learning to perform surgery. It can provide a flexible learning environment&#xD;
      that can be used as an adjunct to face-to-face teaching, skills laboratory training and&#xD;
      clinical surgery training for both novice and very experienced operators. E-learning offers&#xD;
      particularly exciting opportunities for augmenting the learning process in surgery and&#xD;
      procedural medicine. For example, in a well-delivered traditional lecture, the academic has&#xD;
      very few ways of knowing how effectively they have imparted the information that they are&#xD;
      trying to communicate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, it would be unrealistic to expect that all of the audience would be learning at&#xD;
      the same pace, but the traditional lecture is delivered in the standard 40 - 50 minute time&#xD;
      period to the individuals sitting in the same room. The hope is that by the time of the exam,&#xD;
      everyone is at a sufficient standard to at least pass the course. If the material is&#xD;
      delivered on an e-platform, the progress of each individual can be tracked with a formative&#xD;
      assessment process. This means that individuals who learn at a slower pace can have their&#xD;
      education supplemented automatically or they can be flagged for direct academic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E-learning also suits the PBP methodology in that only trainees who have demonstrated the&#xD;
      requisite proficiency benchmark actually get training in the skills laboratory. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to quantitatively assess the economic impact and cost savings (if any) of&#xD;
      requiring trainees to study a robotic surgical task until they demonstrate a defined&#xD;
      performance benchmark before commencing their technical skills training in the skills&#xD;
      laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As recently outlined during the first European multi-specialty consensus meeting on robotic&#xD;
      surgery training, a fundamental step in creating a proficient robotic surgeon is the&#xD;
      acquisition of basic surgical skills, such as suturing, knotting, coagulating and dissecting.&#xD;
      Among numerous dry models, the Venezuelan chicken model seems to be ideal for suturing,&#xD;
      anastomosis and knotting exercises, not only in the urological field but in all robotic&#xD;
      surgical disciplines. The participants will be working with this model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of this study is shown in Figure 1. It is a prospective, randomized and blinded&#xD;
      study where 48 trainees will be randomly assigned to one of four groups. They will all&#xD;
      complete educational and training tasks that prepare them for the completion of the ORSI&#xD;
      chicken anastomosis task. They will continue training on the task until they can perform the&#xD;
      task to quantitatively defined proficiency benchmarks. The outcome of this study is the&#xD;
      amount of resources used by each group to get to the proficiency benchmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      48 university educated novice subjects will be randomly assigned to four different training&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ORSI robotic surgery chicken anastomosis task:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chicken has all the abdominal organs removed, except 6-8 cm of the cloaca (starting&#xD;
      measurements from the anus) and the stomach. The stomach will simulate the human bladder neck&#xD;
      and the cloaca will simulate the human urethra. The similarity of the model is increased by&#xD;
      the possibility of positioning a catheter inside the cloaca both during and at the end of the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments and Robot positioning:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The model must be placed on the surface of a table, at the same height as a normal operating&#xD;
      table. All models of surgical robots currently on the market can be used to perform the task.&#xD;
      The docking of the robot must be performed following the normal rules used for robotic&#xD;
      surgery. In particular, the camera trocar must be at a distance of 18-20 cm from the target.&#xD;
      Robotic trocars must be positioned at a distance of 8-10 cm apart. The instruments suggested&#xD;
      are 2 large needle drivers and 1 prograsp forceps. 2 polysorb stitches of 10 cm each, knotted&#xD;
      at the end with 4 knots can be used to perform the anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metrics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure metrics for a reference anastomosis and knotting in a chicken model were&#xD;
      developed by a procedure characterization group consisting of 4 surgeons and a behavioral&#xD;
      scientist. The surgeons had previous large substantial hand-on training experience in the&#xD;
      lab. Procedure phases steps, errors and critical errors were also outlined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suturing and knotting task:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the exercise is to perform a hermetic circular anastomosis that allows connecting&#xD;
      two anatomical tubular structures. Always using an outside-inside direction in the stomach,&#xD;
      and inside-outside in the cloaca, two hemi-continuous sutures must be performed, knotting the&#xD;
      two threads at the end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic steps into which the exercise is divided are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  posterior Wall (first 4 bites on stomach and cloaca);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  right and left lateral wall (the bites between the posterior and the anterior wall;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anterior wall (the last 4 bites on stomach and cloaca);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  knotting (one double knot and two single knots to close the anastomosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The errors that the trainee can commit during the execution of the task can be divided into&#xD;
      two categories: suturing operative errors and knotting operative errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These technical errors result in alterations of the needle, breaking of the suture thread,&#xD;
      lesions to the biological tissue or can lead to inadequate final result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The breakage of the needle or suture thread and the leakage of water to the final test&#xD;
      performed through the catheter, are considered critical errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time limit for performing the exercise is 25 minutes. The lack of progress made in a&#xD;
      specific step of the anastomosis for the time of 1 minute is considered as a &quot;failure to&#xD;
      progress&quot; error.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment Pre-assessment of subjects Robotic surgery requires two-handed coordination of&#xD;
      instruments with a monitor image, in three-dimensional space and, consequently, necessitates&#xD;
      complex ambidextrous psychomotor, visio-spatial, and perceptual skills. These abilities are&#xD;
      not uniformly distributed in the population and therefore to ensure that subjects are of&#xD;
      comparable abilities all participating subjects will undergo a psychometric assessment which&#xD;
      will assess their visio-spatial, perceptual and psychomotor coordination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychomotor Assessment All participating subjects will be required to perform a simple task&#xD;
      psychomotor task on the robot prior to training proper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visuospatial Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visuospatial assessment includes the use of three fixed length, fixed format,&#xD;
      self-administered tests to evaluate the ability to receive, interpret, and apply meaning to&#xD;
      visual information as measured in constructional skills and visual perceptual tests. The&#xD;
      cognitive tests administered during this study will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cube Comparisons Test - designed to evaluate ability to detect differences in 3&#xD;
           dimensional cubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Card Rotations Test - designed to evaluate ability to detect differences in 2&#xD;
           dimensional figures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Map Planning Test - designed to evaluate ability to determine the shortest route between&#xD;
           two places Perceptual Assessment The perceptual assessment will include a fixed length,&#xD;
           fixed format, self-administered, computer generated test (PicSOr) used to evaluate the&#xD;
           ability to interpret three dimensional (3-D) structures from two dimensional (2D)&#xD;
           displays. It is scored using an interval/ratio scale with values that range between 0.0&#xD;
           and 1.0. A score of 1 = perfect ability to reconstruct 3-D from 2-D cues; a sore of 0 =&#xD;
           inability to reconstruct 3-D from 2D cues. In large-scale international studies most&#xD;
           surgical residents perform the task well but a small group have demonstrated they have&#xD;
           struggle with it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Group 1: Pre-trained Group (online didactic to proficiency- PBP++) Group 1&#xD;
      Pre-trained group will receive information on how to optimally perform the ORSI chicken&#xD;
      anastomosis task and the material will be delivered online via the ORSI e-learning platform.&#xD;
      They will be given access to the material two weeks before their training. Unlike the other&#xD;
      groups, Group 1 will be required to study the material to a pre-defined performance benchmark&#xD;
      or proficiency level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Pre-trained Group (online didactic- PBP+) The Pre-trained group (Group 2) will&#xD;
      receive the exact same information as Group 1 on how to optimally perform the ORSI chicken&#xD;
      anastomosis task but the participants are not required to study the material to a pre-defined&#xD;
      proficiency benchmark. The time the subjects spend on the task and effort expended will be&#xD;
      logged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: Standard training group The standard trained group will receive face-to-face&#xD;
      lectures on how to perform the ORSI chicken anastomosis task. It will not differ from what&#xD;
      they would normally receive during a traditional surgery training course when they arrive at&#xD;
      the ORSI academy for their training. The content of the face-to face lecture is the same as&#xD;
      in the e-learning courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4: Apprenticeship Group The apprenticeship trained group will not receive face-to-face&#xD;
      lectures or e-learning on how to perform the ORSI chicken anastomosis task. They will however&#xD;
      receive hands-on practical one-to-one training during a traditional surgical training course,&#xD;
      with deliberate practice. They will also receive published materials describing how best to&#xD;
      perform the task and mentoring on suturing and knot tying by a task expert who will guide&#xD;
      their performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proficiency definition Proficiency will be quantitatively defined on the mean of the&#xD;
      objectively assessed performance of experienced consultant surgeons who are also experienced&#xD;
      in performing robotic suturing, knot tying and anastomosis.&#xD;
