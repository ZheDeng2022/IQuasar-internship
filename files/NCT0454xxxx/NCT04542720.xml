  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adjacent segment disease (ASD) in the lumbar spine is a well-known sequela of lumbar fusion&#xD;
      surgery. The annual incidence of adjacent level re-operation is approximately 3% with a&#xD;
      ten-year prevalence of 20-30%. Frequently, the surgical treatment involves decompression of&#xD;
      the adjacent level coupled with extension of the instrumentation and fusion. Advocates of&#xD;
      this paradigm cite the altered kinematics and biomechanics of levels adjacent to a lumbar&#xD;
      fusion mass. Furthermore, decompressed levels adjacent to a fused segments are associated&#xD;
      with higher rates of ASD in retrospective studies. Yet, a retrospective review of higher&#xD;
      quality data concluded decompression adjacent to single-level fusion provides similar&#xD;
      outcomes compared to fusions extending across the decompressed segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the conflicting data currently available, higher quality data are needed to guide&#xD;
      surgical decision-making in ASD. The purpose of this trial is to prospectively compare&#xD;
      decompression and decompression with fusion in patients with lumbar ASD.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be identified for inclusion by surgeons who are co-investigators in this trial. All eligible patients will be submitted to the study coordinator and randomized to a surgical treatment cohort (exposure) regardless of their enrollment status to capture the eligibility to enrollment ratio. Randomization will be performed in random permuted blocks of 4 within strata. One stratum will be prior single level lumbar fusion or multilevel fusions. This randomization technique was selected given the relatively low sample size (N&lt;1000) and concern for unbalanced cohorts arising in relation to prior number of levels fused. The study coordinator will secondarily confirm eligibility of those enrolled. Baseline demographic (age, sex, ethnicity), clinical (BMI, Charlson co-morbidity index, number and levels fused prior), and radiographic data (disc height, disc angle, facet angle) will be collected in a standardized fashion on all patients.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>This is a single blinded study. The patient and surgeon will both know what cohort the patient belongs to. The outcomes assessor will not know which cohort each patient belongs to when assessing statistics. This will allow for a non-biased conclusion to which treatment cohort, decompression or decompression and fusion, provides a better outcome.</masking_description>

    <description>Patients will undergo decompression alone of the supradjacent level. The surgical technique will be surgeon dependent. All surgeons will be encouraged to avoid damaging facet joints above the fusion mass, retaining 50% of the pars of the decompressed level and performing as minimal of a medial facetectomy as necessary.</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo decompression and extension of posterior instrumentation and fusion. This may or may not include exchange of pre-existing instrumentation. The use of interbody cages will be left to the discretion of the treating surgeon.The purpose of introducing this heterogeneity is to increase the generalizability of the trial results. The fusion cohort will not utilize bone morphogenetic protein products.</description>

             single-level or multilevel&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptoms related to central and lateral recess at the supradjacent level&#xD;
             that have persisted despite at least six weeks of non-operative therapy modalities&#xD;
