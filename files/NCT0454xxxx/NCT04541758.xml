  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open, randomized, parallel controlled prospective clinical study design was used in this&#xD;
      study.Subjects were patients with 2-4 displaced non-flail rib fractures.Operation group&#xD;
      (Group 1) : minimally invasive internal fixation operation group under spontaneous breathing&#xD;
      anesthesia.In the operation group of minimally invasive internal fixation under autonomic&#xD;
      respiratory anesthesia, the fracture was determined preoperatively by chest CT+&#xD;
      three-dimensional reconstruction of the ribs, and the optimal incision location was&#xD;
      determined. The fracture was exposed through as many small incisions as possible, and fixed&#xD;
      with titanium plate or clon-type plate. During the operation, the autonomic respiratory&#xD;
      anesthesia and paraviral nerve block technology was adopted.In the conservative group (group&#xD;
      2), routine treatment measures such as analgesia and chest strap fixed were adopted.The&#xD;
      purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of minimally&#xD;
      invasive and conservative treatment for rib fractures with different Numbers of displaced&#xD;
      ends.&#xD;

      An open, randomized, parallel controlled prospective clinical study design type was used in&#xD;
      this study. Subjects were patients with two to four displaced non-flail chest fractures of&#xD;
      the ribs. Operation group (Group 1) : minimally invasive internal fixation operation group&#xD;
      under spontaneous breathing anesthesia. In the operation group of minimally invasive internal&#xD;
      fixation under autonomic respiratory anesthesia, the fracture was determined preoperatively&#xD;
      by chest CT+ three-dimensional reconstruction of the ribs, and the optimal incision location&#xD;
      was determined. The fracture was exposed through as many small incisions as possible, and&#xD;
      fixed with titanium plate or clon-type plate. During the operation, the autonomic respiratory&#xD;
      anesthesia and paraviral nerve block technology was adopted. In the conservative group (group&#xD;
      2), routine treatment measures such as analgesia, hemostasis and chest band fixation were&#xD;
      adopted. The effects of the two treatments on lung function, pain index, complications and&#xD;
      QoL were evaluated. It provides theoretical basis for the treatment of rib fracture&#xD;
