  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, dose-escalation study enrolling 15 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 3 cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cohort I: 5 subjects each receiving 1 injection of IGN-AMP001 (12.5mg AMP-001 in 3ml&#xD;
           Saline)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cohort II: 5 subjects each receiving 1 injection of IGN-AMP001 (25 mg AMP-001 in 3 ml&#xD;
           Saline)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cohort III: 5 subjects each receiving 1 injection of IGN-AMP001 (50 mg AMP-001 in 3 ml&#xD;
           Saline).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by&#xD;
      recurrent deep-seated boil-like abscesses and tracts under the skin. The most severe HS&#xD;
      lesions are characterized by chronic non-healing sinuses, which form a wound-like environment&#xD;
      as the abscesses heal; they produce significant skin scarring. Transcriptomic analysis of&#xD;
      lesioned skin from HS patients suggests that it has similar pathology to other chronic&#xD;
      wounds. IntegoGen's investigational product, IGN-AMP001, is manufactured from the amniotic&#xD;
      membrane of the human placenta. The amnion membrane contains various cytokines and growth&#xD;
      factors that promote wound healing. Local application of micronized dehydrated amnion&#xD;
      membrane has been shown effective in treating chronic refractory non-healing dermal wounds of&#xD;
      various etiologies in randomized clinical trials and case studies, which suggests it might be&#xD;
      effective in treating HS wounds as well. Patients treated with IGN-AMP001 within IntegoGen&#xD;
      associated clinics and other regenerative clinics have indicated positive responses. This&#xD;
      study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of IGN-AMP001&#xD;
      for HS.&#xD;
