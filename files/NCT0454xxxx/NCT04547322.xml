  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to determine the effect of virtual reality (VR) on the preoperative&#xD;
      anxietyof patients undergoing colorectal surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sample of this study consisted of 86 patients in experimental and control groups. The&#xD;
      experimental group received VR application in the preoperative period for 10 minutes. Anxiety&#xD;
      level was assessed with the Anxiety Specific to Surgery Questionnaire (ASSQ) and measured&#xD;
      with physiological responses of anxiety such as systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and peripheral oxygen saturation&#xD;
      (SpO2) before and after VR application.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The researchers involved in the data analysis and statistics stages were blinded to the group assignment, too. However, those involved in the running of the study were not blinded. Also, the person who performed the measurements was not blinded due to the nature of VR application.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change Anxiety Specific to Surgery Questionnaire score</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The psychological response of patients to preoperative anxiety was evaluated with Anxiety Specific to Surgery Questionnaire. With a total of 10 items, responses are made on a five-point Likert scale format ranging from 1 (do not agree at all) to 5 (completely agree). Anxiety Specific to Surgery Questionnaire score is obtained by adding the answers to all items (minimum score=10; maximum score=50). The increase in the scale score indicates that the level of anxiety increases.&#xD;
The researchers administered Anxiety Specific to Surgery Questionnaire to all the patients before their transfer from the general surgery unit to the operating room, to the experimental group after virtual reality application, and to the control group 10 minutes after the first measurement.</description>

    <description>Determine patients' physiological responses (systolic blood pressure) of preoperative anxiety after virtual reality application&#xD;
The researchers measured systolic blood pressure to all the patients before their transfer from the general surgery unit to the operating room, to the experimental group after virtual reality application, and to the control group 10 minutes after the first measurement. At the same time, their systolic blood pressure values were followed on the portable monitor (Vismo, Nihon Kohden, Germany).</description>

    <time_frame>10 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Determine patients' physiological responses (diastolic blood pressure) of preoperative anxiety after virtual reality application&#xD;
The researchers measured diastolic blood pressure to all the patients before their transfer from the general surgery unit to the operating room, to the experimental group after virtual reality application, and to the control group 10 minutes after the first measurement. At the same time, their diastolic blood pressure values were followed on the portable monitor (Vismo, Nihon Kohden, Germany)</description>

    <measure>Change heart rate</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Determine patients' physiological responses (heart rate) of preoperative anxiety after virtual reality application&#xD;
The researchers measured heart rate to all the patients before their transfer from the general surgery unit to the operating room, to the experimental group after virtual reality application, and to the control group 10 minutes after the first measurement. At the same time, their heart rate were followed on the portable monitor (Vismo, Nihon Kohden, Germany)</description>

    <measure>Change respiratory rate</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Determine patients' physiological responses (respiratory rate) of preoperative anxiety after virtual reality application&#xD;
The researchers measured respiratory rate to all the patients before their transfer from the general surgery unit to the operating room, to the experimental group after virtual reality application, and to the control group 10 minutes after the first measurement. At the same time, their respiratory rate were followed on the portable monitor (Vismo, Nihon Kohden, Germany)</description>

    <measure>Change peripheral oxygen saturation</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Determine patients' physiological responses ( peripheral oxygen saturation) of preoperative anxiety after virtual reality application&#xD;
The researchers measured peripheral oxygen saturation to all the patients before their transfer from the general surgery unit to the operating room, to the experimental group after virtual reality application, and to the control group 10 minutes after the first measurement. At the same time, their peripheral oxygen saturation were followed on the portable monitor (Vismo, Nihon Kohden, Germany)</description>

    <description>During the transfer from the general surgery clinic to the operating room (3-5 minutes) and in the surgery waiting room, the VR aplication group were asked to wear a virtual reality headset (VR BOX 2) and headphones minimizing sound loss (Earpods with Apple Lightning Connector) that are compatible with mobile phones with IOS operating system. The VR headset and the headphones were controlled by a mobile phone (iPhone 7 Plus). The researchers had the patients watch three-dimensional videos (e.g. underwater world, museum trips, forest and park walks, beach trips, and space travel) for 10 minutes with their preferred background and relaxing music.</description>
