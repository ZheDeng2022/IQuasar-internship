  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to EURAMOS-1, 17% of osteosarcoma patients were considered to have metastases at&#xD;
      diagnosis. In this selected cohort, the reported 5-year EFS from diagnosis of 28% compares&#xD;
      well to previous results reported from unselected cohorts of patients with only lung&#xD;
      metastases. Resection of pulmonary metastases from osteosarcoma is a treatment option which&#xD;
      has been shown to correlate with survival benefit and cure in select individuals. These&#xD;
      patients are best addressed in a multidisciplinary fashion, with the involvement of a&#xD;
      thoracic surgeon with experience in pulmonary metastasectomy. At the same time, the goal of&#xD;
      surgical resection of pulmonary metastases from osteosarcoma is to render the patient&#xD;
      completely disease free. &quot;Tumor debulking&quot; or &quot;cytoreductive surgery&quot; with incomplete&#xD;
      resection has not demonstrated any survival benefit for patients with pulmonary metastases.&#xD;
      Thus open thoracotomy is more preferred than VATS. However over the last decade in China,&#xD;
      thoracotomy has not been adopted generally. More patients had chosen VATS or even&#xD;
      hypo-fractionation radiotherapy, such as gamma knife, cyber knife and so on as a local&#xD;
      treatment method. This study aims to investigate the survival of consecutive patients who had&#xD;
      achieved a first complete surgical remission (CR) during combined-modality therapy on&#xD;
      neoadjuvant or adjuvant PKUPH-OS protocol so as to discuss reasonable local therapy for&#xD;
      resectable pulmonary osteosarcoma metastatic lesions.&#xD;

        This report includes all the patients with recurrences from a previously treated cohort of&#xD;
        678 consecutive, newly diagnosed patients with localized or primary metastatic high-grade&#xD;
        osteosarcoma of the trunk or limbs registered onto the neoadjuvant studies of Peking&#xD;
        University People's Hospital and Peking University Shougang Hospital between the end of&#xD;
        2009 and March 2020. Intended first-line treatment included pre- and postoperative&#xD;
        chemotherapy according to the PKUPH-OS protocol , as well as surgery of all operable&#xD;
        lesions. All protocols prescribed high-dose methotrexate, doxorubicin, cisplatin and&#xD;
        ifosfamide in varying combinations.&#xD;
