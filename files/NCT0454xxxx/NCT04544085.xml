      This study has two stages. At the first stage,the investigators will try to use noise&#xD;
      detectors to investigate the status of noise exposure in the pediatric intensive care&#xD;
      unit(PICU) and to analyze the main noise sources in it. At the second stage,the investigators&#xD;
      will try to evaluate the effect of noise management on noise exposure and health outcomes of&#xD;
      the pediatric patients in PICU.The investigators hypothesize that noise exposure in PICU is&#xD;
      higher than the standard.The investigators also hypothesize that the implementation of the&#xD;
      noise management will improve the noise exposure and health outcomes of the pediatric&#xD;
      patients in PICU.&#xD;

      This study has two stages. At the first stage,the investigators will try to use noise&#xD;
      detectors to investigate the status of noise exposure in the pediatric intensive care&#xD;
      unit(PICU) and to analyze the main noise sources in it. At the second stage,the investigators&#xD;
      will try to evaluate the effect of noise management on noise exposure and health outcomes of&#xD;
      the pediatric patients in PICU.The investigators hypothesize that noise exposure in PICU is&#xD;
      higher than the standard.The investigators also hypothesize that the implementation of the&#xD;
      noise management will improve the noise exposure and health outcomes of the pediatric&#xD;
      patients in PICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.For the investigation of the status of noise exposure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Preparation of noise monitor equipment: select noise detectors conforming to the national&#xD;
      standard. All noise detectors used in the study are of the same brand; (2) Use of noise&#xD;
      monitor: set the mode of noise monitor according to the national standard: place the monitor&#xD;
      in accordance with the requirements;(3) All the data of noise exposure will be collected and&#xD;
      sorted out by the investigator. (4) Spss20.0 software is used for descriptive analysis and&#xD;
      statistical inference. Mean ± standard deviation, median and quartile are used to describe&#xD;
      measurement data, while frequency and percentage are used to describe counting data.&#xD;
      Comparison between groups: when the measurement data obey normal distribution and the&#xD;
      variance is homogeneous, two independent sample t-test are used to compare whether there is&#xD;
      statistical difference between the two groups of indicators or index difference (measured&#xD;
      value baseline value); if it does not obey normal distribution or the variance is uneven, non&#xD;
      parametric statistical method is used; counting data: Chi square test is used to compare&#xD;
      whether there is statistical difference between the two groups of index values, test level: α&#xD;
      = 0.05 2.For the evaluation of the effect of noise management on noise exposure and health&#xD;
      outcomes of the pediatric patients in PICU:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1)General information and clinical data of patients will be collected through hospital&#xD;
      electronic information system, ICU nursing records, cases, doctor's advice and consultation.&#xD;
      The investigator will evaluate and record the delirium score of ICU children who met the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria each shift . At the time of discharge, PICU duration, hospital stay, MV&#xD;
      duration and in-hospital mortality were inquired by EMR. (2) Quality control of intervention&#xD;
      implementation are as follows:① According to the research results of early promotion&#xD;
      strategy, relevant training materials were made to carry out training and education for PICU&#xD;
      medical staff;② During the implementation of the intervention, irregular sampling of medical&#xD;
      staff was conducted to evaluate the implementation of the intervention and give timely&#xD;
      feedback.(3) Collection of information:① The data of patients will be collected by the&#xD;
      investigator;② Pediatric delirium score: in order to ensure the quality of the study, the&#xD;
      investigator will conduct random sampling and assess the delirium of children in the same&#xD;
      patient with the nurses from time to time to investigate the evaluation quality;③ Input the&#xD;
      data into EpiData, set reasonable numerical boundary value and logical check items. If there&#xD;
      is logical error, check the original data for correction, and import the data into spss20.0&#xD;
      for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (4) Sample size assessment: the assessment of sample size in experimental research can also&#xD;
      be divided into measurement data and counting data. The main outcome measures are delirium&#xD;
      rate and noise exposure. Therefore, the incidence of delirium will be used as the rate to&#xD;
      calculate the sample size.According to the calculation formula of the rate: n = (U α + U β)&#xD;
      22P (1-p) / (P1-P2) 2, the sample size of the control group and the intervention group are&#xD;
      calculated. Uα=1.64，Uβ=0.84。P1 and P2 are the estimated values of delirium incidence before&#xD;
      and after the intervention, and P is the total rate. The references showed that P1 = 33%, P2&#xD;
      = 14%.The sample size calculated by the formula is: (1.64 + 0.84) 2 * 2 * 0.47 * 0.53 / 0.192&#xD;
      = 85 cases, plus 20% of the sample loss, that is, 102 cases in the control group and 102&#xD;
      cases in the intervention group (5)Statistical Analysis:①Data set: use EpiData 3.1 software&#xD;
      to establish the data set, and clean up and check the data;② The data will be imported into&#xD;
      spss20.0 for statistical analysis. Descriptive analysis and statistical inference will be&#xD;
      carried out. Mean ± standard deviation, median and quartile are used to describe measurement&#xD;
      data, while frequency and percentage are used to describe counting data. Comparison between&#xD;
      groups: when the measurement data obeys normal distribution and the variance is homogeneous,&#xD;
      two independent sample t-test is used to compare whether there is statistical difference in&#xD;
      the indicators or index difference (measured value baseline value) between the two groups; if&#xD;
      the measurement data does not obey the normal distribution or the variance is uneven, non&#xD;
      parametric statistical method is used; counting data: Chi square test is used to compare&#xD;
      whether there is statistical difference between the two groups of patients Level: α = 0.05.&#xD;
