  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Edentulous patients commonly experience a deterioration in the quality of life; both in terms&#xD;
      of oral and general health. Studies demonstrated that conventional dentures do not adequately&#xD;
      restore masticatory function nor quality of life. In contrast, implant-supported overdentures&#xD;
      are considered the standard of care for edentulous patients as they offer a more stable&#xD;
      prosthesis that ultimately results in improved oral function and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precision attachments such as studs, magnets, telescopic crowns or a bars are commonly used&#xD;
      for implant supported overdentures. Implant overdentures supported by stud attachments gained&#xD;
      popularity for the rehabilitation of edentulous patients as they are self-aligning, offer&#xD;
      dual retention and compensate for divergence between implants up to angles of 40 degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it has been documented that the stud attachment system (Locators) requires a high&#xD;
      frequency of maintenance, particularly with regard to the replacement of the matrix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to overcome some of these limitations of existing attachment systems, a newer system&#xD;
      was developed consisting of a matrix made of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) instead of a&#xD;
      polymeric material. This system has an amorphous diamond like carbon-based abutment coating&#xD;
      (ADLC) and it was claimed to be more resistant to wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically and in vitro, no comparative studies have been performed addressing wear and&#xD;
      retention of the traditional stud attachment and the newer ADLC attachment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the aim of the present study is to clinically and in vitro evaluate the ADLC and study&#xD;
      attachment system.&#xD;

    <description>Each patient will receive 2 implants in the canine region using a guided-surgery protocol and a pre-prepared surgical stent. A healing abutment of an adequate size will be placed on the implant for transmucosal healing. The flaps will be subsequently sutured around the healing abutments. Patients' existing prostheses will be adjusted. Suture removal will be performed one week post implant placement.&#xD;
Three months later, implant level impressions will be made using the open tray technique. Each patient will be then be randomized using eCRF (electronic Case Report Form) to either ADLC group or LOC group. A final cast of the patients will be obtained and the attachments will be installed using an in-direct technique by a calibrated prosthodontists.</description>
