  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temporal summation of pain, which is defined as the perception of increasingly greater pain&#xD;
      evoked by repetitive painful stimuli, is highly variable between individuals. This study&#xD;
      aimed to determine the impact of the timing of rocuronium after induction with propofol on&#xD;
      temporal summation of pain in gynecologic laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>One hundred patients, between 18-60 years of age were randomly assigned to one of the two groups; group PRi received immediate injection of rocuronium after propofol administration, and group PRd received rocuronium injection when bispectral index score became below 60 after propofol administration</intervention_model_description>

    <description>withdrawal movements were graded by the investigator according to the following scale:&#xD;

- moderate pain (movement involving the arm only with elbow or shoulder);&#xD;
- severe pain (generalized response or movement in more than one extremity</description>
