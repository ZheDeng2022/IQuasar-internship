    <textblock>
      Prospective, single-center clinical study in consecutive patients undergoing carotid&#xD;
      revascularization with MicroNET-covered stent implanted through direct carotid artery access&#xD;
      with temporary, intraprocedural flow reversal neuroprotection to provide primary and&#xD;
      secondary stroke prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is an open-label, non-randomized single-arm study supported by the grant from Jagiellonian&#xD;
      University Medical college (K/ZDS/007819).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke is a major health problem affecting individual patients and their families and entire&#xD;
      societies with death and disability impact (fundamental disability cause in Poland, Europe,&#xD;
      and the USA). Atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis plays an important part in a stroke&#xD;
      etiology through embolic and/or hemodynamic mechanism).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endovascular treatment with first-generation carotid stents is inherently related to plaque&#xD;
      and thrombus prolapse through stent struts, as confirmed with the intravascular imaging (IVUS&#xD;
      and OCT), and monitoring of cerebral embolism by DW-MRI. Plaque prolapse related embolism may&#xD;
      occur after neuroprotection device removal. Postprocedural plaque-prolapse related ischemic&#xD;
      events are responsible for 40-60% complications up to 30 days, as indicated by 30-day results&#xD;
      of large clinical trials (CAPTURE, CREST, or ICSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A successful attempt to address this problem has been an introduction and routine use of&#xD;
      MicroNET-covered stent. The MicroNET attached to the metallic stent prevents intraluminal&#xD;
      plaque prolapse. MRI imaging indicated a significant reduction of intraprocedural embolism&#xD;
      and near-elimination of post-procedural brain embolism by CGuard application. Clinical&#xD;
      research and meta-analysis of studies confirmed the safety and efficacy of the stent.&#xD;
      Consistent results were demonstrated in registries such as PARADIGM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another critical approach in increasing the safety of the endovascular route of carotid&#xD;
      revascularization is development and increased clinical uptake of minimally invasive&#xD;
      endovascular strategies is the direct common carotid artery access for stenting procedures.&#xD;
      This way, one can avoid femoral cannulation and navigation through the aorta and aortic arch&#xD;
      branches. Trans-Carotid Arterial Revascularization (TCAR) offers a neuroprotection mechanism&#xD;
      by a temporary reversal of the cerebral flow similar to Mo.Ma Ultra or GORE Flow Reversal&#xD;
      systems, but without limitations of femoral access and aortic arch cannulation. TCAR system&#xD;
      was CE marked in 2014, and more than 20 000 TCAR procedures were performed worldwide. A&#xD;
      recent analysis by Yee et al. demonstrated that TCAR carotid stenting procedures are&#xD;
      equivalent to surgical endarterectomy regarding safety and efficacy, but with lower&#xD;
      invasiveness, avoiding the aortic arch (and its cannulation-related cerebral embolism) and&#xD;
      shortened procedure time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to published studies and our own experience, proximal neuroprotection, and in&#xD;
      particular, the one achieved through direct carotid artery access, minimizes cerebral&#xD;
      (micro)embolization risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our prospective TOP-GUARD study aims to evaluate early-, mid- and longterm outcome data (up&#xD;
      to 5 years) on the results of carotid revascularization combining two systems that are&#xD;
      currently considered safest: temporary cerebral flow-reversal during stent introduction via&#xD;
      direct carotid artery access and MicroNET-covered stent implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both systems are CE-marked (from 2014), have been successfully used in our center, and will&#xD;
      follow their on-label indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TCAR system from SilkRoad Medical (EnRoute) is the preferred method to obtain flow&#xD;
      reversal for transcervical CAS in the study. However, due to interruption of the EnRoute&#xD;
      system supplies (COVID19, SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic), routinely available sheaths, catheters, and&#xD;
      blood filters may be used according to literature to assemble the flow reversal circuit,&#xD;
      enabling continuation of the study as per the Ethical Committee updated approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients with symptoms or signs of cerebral ischemia (ie. patients with an&#xD;
      increased risk of complications when conventional carotid stents and neuroprotection systems&#xD;
      are used) will undergo NeuroVascular Team (neurologist, interventionalist, and vascular&#xD;
      surgeon) evaluation for their eligibility. They will be treated according to the center&#xD;
      standard of care, including necessary peri- and postprocedural medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI cerebral imaging will be performed at baseline, 24-48 hours post-procedurally and at 90&#xD;
      days in 50% of study participants.&#xD;
