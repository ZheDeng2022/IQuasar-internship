      In mechanically ventilated patients, driving pressure (ΔP) assess the strain applied to the&#xD;
      respiratory system and is related to ICU mortality. The aim of this randomized cross-over&#xD;
      trial was to compare ΔP selected by a closed-loop system and by physician tailored mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation mode. Pediatric patients admitted to PICU will be enrolled if they were&#xD;
      invasively ventilated without any detectable respiratory effort, hemodynamic instability, or&#xD;
      significant leakages. Two 60 minute periods of ventilation determined by randomization in&#xD;
      APV-CMV and ASV 1.1 will be compared. Settings were adjusted to reach the same minute&#xD;
      ventilation in both modes. ΔP will be calculated as the difference between plateau pressure&#xD;
      and total PEEP measured using end-inspiratory and end-expiratory occlusion maneuvers,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In 2015, Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference (PALICC) determined the pediatric&#xD;
      acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) definition. PALICC recommends using&#xD;
      patient-specific tidal volume (VT) according to disease severity. Moreover, in the absence of&#xD;
      transpulmonary pressure measurements (PL), an inspiratory plateau pressure limit of 28 cm H2O&#xD;
      is recommended, allowing for slightly higher plateau pressures (29-32 cm H2O) for patients&#xD;
      with reduced chest wall compliance. In adult ARDS, Amato et al. normalized VT to the&#xD;
      compliance(C) by using driving pressure (ΔP) and reported that ΔP was the ventilation&#xD;
      variable that best-stratified risk. Changes in ventilator settings resulting in a decrease in&#xD;
      ΔP were associated with increased survival. One of the most common modes used in pediatric&#xD;
      ventilation nowadays is synchronized controlled mandatory ventilation with adaptive pressure&#xD;
      ventilation (APV-CMV). As compared to pressure control mode (P-CMV), APV-CMV prevents low or&#xD;
      high VT when the compliance changes by adjusting the applied pressure. Adaptive support&#xD;
      ventilation (ASV) is closed-loop ventilation mode, which for a given minute volume set by the&#xD;
      clinician, adapts tidal volume (VT) and respiratory rate (RR) according to the patient's&#xD;
      respiratory mechanics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective randomized cross over study aimed to compare ΔP between physician tailored&#xD;
      APV-CMV mode and ASV 1.1 in pediatric mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory&#xD;
      failure. After the enrollment, the patients' ventilation periods will be determined by&#xD;
      randomization using sealed opaque envelopes. The minute ventilation, fraction of inspired O2&#xD;
      (FiO2) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set by the clinician before study&#xD;
      inclusion will be kept unchanged during all study periods. Patients will be ventilated in&#xD;
      each mode for 60 minutes. Three consecutive -inspiratory and end-expiratory occlusion will be&#xD;
      performed at 30 and 60 min and ΔP will be calculated for each period. Arterial blood gas will&#xD;
      be measured at the end of each period. A wash-out period of 30 min using the ventilation mode&#xD;
      and setting before inclusion will be performed in between the two study ventilation periods.&#xD;
      ΔP will be calculated as the difference between plateau pressure (Pplat) and total PEEP and&#xD;
      will be averaged for each ventilation period by using the mean of the six measurements&#xD;
      mentioned above. VT will be calculated by integration of flow measurement. Resistance will be&#xD;
      calculated by the least-squares fitting method. The expiratory time constant (RCexp) will be&#xD;
      derived from the volume-flow curve at 75% of the VT and corresponding flow value. Static&#xD;
      compliance (Cstat) will be calculated as VT divided by ΔP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be ΔP. The secondary outcome will be VT, RR, Pplat, Ti, Te, Cstat,&#xD;
      Resistance, RCexp, pH, PaO2, PaCO2 A pilot study was performed to calculate the sample size.&#xD;
      The mean ΔP was 12.4 (±3.31) cm H2O in ASV 1.1 and 13.5 (±4.2) cm H2O in APV-CMV. By using&#xD;
      these pilot data, and assuming the power of 0.95 and α-error of 0.05, investigators have&#xD;
      calculated the study size as 26 patients.&#xD;
