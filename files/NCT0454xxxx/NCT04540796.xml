    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize safety and to determine the putative recommended&#xD;
      Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2D[s]) and optimal dosing schedule(s) of JNJ-75348780 in participants with&#xD;
      relapsed/ refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)&#xD;
      in Part A and to further characterize the safety at the RP2D(s) in Part B.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      B-cell lymphoid malignancies include CLL and NHL and are defined by clonal populations of&#xD;
      B-lymphocytes expressing identical surface antigens. CD22 is a surface protein specifically&#xD;
      expressed on B-lymphocytes and is expressed in B-lymphocytic malignancies. It is known to&#xD;
      negatively regulate the B-cell receptor via its cytosolic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based&#xD;
      inhibitory motifs. JNJ-75348780 is a novel human bispecific antibody that recognizes the CD3&#xD;
      antigen on T-lymphocytes and the CD22 antigen on mature and malignant B-lymphocytes.&#xD;
      JNJ-75348780 is hypothesized to lead to cytotoxicity, T-cell activation and induction of&#xD;
      cytokines upon engagement of CD3 on T-cells and CD22 on malignant B-lymphocytes. The study&#xD;
      consists of screening phase, treatment phase and post-treatment phase. The total study&#xD;
      duration will be up to 2.7 years. Efficacy assessments will include radiographic image&#xD;
      assessments, positron emission tomography scan, bone marrow assessment, endoscopy or&#xD;
      colonoscopy, physical examinations. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
