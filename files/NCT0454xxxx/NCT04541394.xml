  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MolecuLight is a device that utilizes a special light which, when used on wounds, helps&#xD;
      identify the regions which pathogenic bacterial counts are the highest. The device applies&#xD;
      405nm violet light which is harmless to the human tissue. When specific components in&#xD;
      bacteria catches up the light, a photoluminescent reaction is triggered and the fluorescence&#xD;
      light is caught by the camera on this device in real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When treating an infected wound which requires debridement and/or reconstruction,&#xD;
      traditionally surgeons rely on many clinical clues to judge the severity and region of&#xD;
      infection. However, these clues, such as lab data, vital signs, bacterial culture growth, or&#xD;
      infection symptoms/signs, are usually indirect and also require several days to be fully&#xD;
      interpretated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantage of MolecuLight is its simple, direct, real-time, and flexible application,&#xD;
      which is very important and valuable when treating an infected wound. We aim to add this&#xD;
      device to our routines and see if the treatment course for these wounds can be more rapid and&#xD;
      effective, and also utilize the countless potential of immediate bacterial identification in&#xD;
      numerous aspects of our work.&#xD;
