  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop and test the effectiveness of a culturally-sensitive,&#xD;
      telephone-based, tailored dyadic problem-solving intervention to improve self-care in rural&#xD;
      heart failure (HF) dyads. The target population is rural-residing HF dyads (patient and&#xD;
      family caregiver). Rural dyads will be recruited from the Florida State University Institute&#xD;
      for Successful Longevity Participant Registry, outpatient HF/cardiac and rural healthcare&#xD;
      clinics affiliated with the Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, Bond Community Health Clinic, via&#xD;
      social medial and newspaper ads, and publicly available community sites (e.g., senior&#xD;
      centers, post offices, grocery stores, etc.). Phase I (Arm I) will include a one-time&#xD;
      telephone-based semi-structured interview. Dyads in Phase II (Arm II) will receive one&#xD;
      telehealth (virtual or telephone) session, followed by 7 follow-up telephone sessions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this research is to reduce morbidity and improve HF self-care by&#xD;
      enhancing family problem-solving and collaborative care management among rural HF dyads. The&#xD;
      initial step in meeting this goal is to develop and pilot-test a culturally-sensitive,&#xD;
      telephone-based, tailored dyadic problem-solving intervention to improve HF self-care in&#xD;
      rural HF dyads. Using a multi-phase, sequential qualitative and quantitative approach, the&#xD;
      following research aims are to: 1) identify the major dyadic HF-related problems dyads&#xD;
      experience and how these problems are managed; 2) develop a telephone-based, tailored dyadic&#xD;
      problem-solving intervention and determine its feasibility and acceptability for managing&#xD;
      HF-related problems; and 3) evaluate the preliminary effects of the telephone-based, tailored&#xD;
      dyadic problem-solving intervention on dyadic problem-solving and patient and family&#xD;
      caregiver contributions to HF self-care. As an exploratory aim, we will also evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the dyadic problem-solving intervention on caregiver burden, self-care, and&#xD;
      life changes. In Phase I, qualitative inquiry will guide in-depth semi-structured dyad&#xD;
      interviews (n = 12-20 dyads; 24-40 participants) to identify the dyadic HF-related problems&#xD;
      experienced by rural HF dyads and associated management strategies (Aim 1). Phase II will be&#xD;
      guided by qualitative and quantitative methods and include a repeated measures, single-group&#xD;
      design to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of the&#xD;
      12-week dyadic problem-solving intervention in a sample of rural HF dyads (n = 60 dyads; 120&#xD;
      participants) (Aims 2, 3). Participants for this study will be recruited from from the&#xD;
      Florida State University Institute for Successful Longevity Participant Registry, outpatient&#xD;
      HF/cardiac and rural healthcare clinics affiliated with Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, Bond&#xD;
      Community Health Clinic, via social medial and newspaper ads, and publicly available&#xD;
      community sites (e.g., senior centers, post offices, grocery stores, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I (Arm 1) will identify dyadic HF-related problems and management strategies using&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews in a sample of rural-residing HF dyads (n = 12-20 dyads; 24-40&#xD;
      participants). Following consent, interviews will occur once and be approximately 45 minutes&#xD;
      long. Qualitative data from Phase I will be analyzed using thematic analytic methods and&#xD;
      NVivo11. Information gained in Phase I will be used to develop the telephone-based, tailored,&#xD;
      dyadic problem-solving intervention for rural HF dyads tested in Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II (Arm II) will be guided by qualitative and quantitative inquiry and include a&#xD;
      single-group, repeated measures design with time and dyad-member as within-subject factors. A&#xD;
      sample size of 60 dyads (120 participants) is desired based on a power analysis for repeated&#xD;
      measures ANOVA with 4 time points, alpha level of .05, a medium effect size (f = 0.25), and&#xD;
      80% power, plus oversampling for potential attrition (20%). Following verbal informed consent&#xD;
      via telephone, all dyads will be screened for cognitive impairment using the Telephone&#xD;
      Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) prior to baseline data collection, which will include a&#xD;
      Sociodemographic and Clinical Survey, the Self-Care of HF Index (SCHFI; v. 6.2) (patients&#xD;
      only), the Caregiver Contribution to the Self-Care of HF Index (CCSCHFI) (caregivers only),&#xD;
      Healthcare Utilization Survey, the Social Problem-Solving Inventory Revised-Short (SPSIRS),&#xD;
      the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CESD), the Global Family Function Subscale&#xD;
      (GFF) of the Family Assessment Device Questionnaire, and the Interpersonal Support Evaluation&#xD;
      List-12 (ISEL-12). Caregivers will also complete the Dutch Objective Burden Inventory (DOBI),&#xD;
      Denyes Self-care Practice Instrument (DENYES), and the BAKAS Caregiving Outcomes Scale&#xD;
      (BAKAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a single group design, all dyads will participate in a problem-solving training&#xD;
      intervention over 12 weeks (Weeks 1-4, 6, 8, 10, 12), with follow-up data collection&#xD;
      occurring at weeks 5, 9, 11, 13. Qualitative data will be collected at weeks 5 and 11 via&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews with dyads. Quantitative data on study outcomes and covariates&#xD;
      will be collected at weeks 5, 9, and 13 and consist of the SCHFI (patient), CCSCHFI&#xD;
      (caregiver), healthcare utilization (patient), SPSIRS (dyad), REALM (dyad), CESD (dyad), GFF&#xD;
      (dyad),ISEL-12 (dyad), DOBI (caregiver), Denyes (caregiver) and the BAKAS (caregiver). All&#xD;
      data will be self-report and collected by a trained research assistant who will collect study&#xD;
      data over the telephone and mark participants answers on a computerized data spreadsheet.&#xD;
      Qualitative data will be analyzed using thematic analytic methods and NVivo11. Possible&#xD;
      treatment effectiveness on dyadic problem-solving, patient and caregiver contributions to HF&#xD;
      self-care, healthcare utilization, caregiver burden, caregiver self-care, caregiver life&#xD;
      changes, and differences among subgroups (gender, relationship type) over the 13 weeks will&#xD;
      be examined using multilevel modeling and dyadic Growth Curve Modeling (GCM).&#xD;

    <description>Caregiver self-care will be measured using the 18-item Denyes Self-care Practice Instrument (DENYES) which measures self-care activities that are universal self-care requisites (e.g., diet, rest, exercise, etc.). Response options for each item range from 0 to 156, with a total score calculated by averaging the time responses for all behaviors, with higher scores representing better self-care.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiving-related life changes will be measured using the 15-item Bakas Caregiving Outcomes Scale. This instrument measures care partners' perceptions of how caregiving has influenced their social functioning, subjective well-being, and physical health using a 7-point (-3 [1] to +3 [7]) Likert-type scale. Total scores range from 15 to 105, with higher scores indicating more positive caregiving-related life changes.</description>

    <description>The dyadic problem-solving intervention will be provided by a HF specialist nurse. The nurse will conduct the initial telehealth (virtual, telephone) session and provide dyads with an intervention booklet containing examples of common HF-related problems experienced by rural dyads and suggested management strategies tailored to the rural sociocultural context. The nurse will lead dyads in a card sorting task intended to help dyads prioritize current HF-related problems and will guide dyads in developing management strategies for the highest priority problem. Dyads will utilize these strategies until the next session at which time the nurse will guide dyads in evaluating the effectiveness of chosen strategies. The iterative process then begins again. Dyads will receive 7 follow-up telephone sessions with the nurse. In the intervention, the nurse will focus on problems related to self-care, including those specific to the rural population.</description>

    <intervention_name>Phase II: Problem-Solving for Rural HF Dyads</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants in the Intervention Group will be trained to use a 4-step problem-solving process based on the Theory of Social Problem-Solving (TSPS) to manage HF-related problems collaboratively over 12-weeks. The core belief of TSPS is effective problem-solving requires a positive problem orientation (i.e., viewing problems as a challenge versus a threat) and elicits rational problem-solving versus avoidance or impulsivity/carelessness. Dyadic problem-solving follows from a positive problem orientation and involves accurate problem identification, generation of appropriate potential solutions, active decision-making, and solution implementation and evaluation. The goal of this dyadic intervention is to move HF dyads toward a positive problem orientation and use of rational problem-solving strategies that support greater patient and family caregiver-contributed HF self-care.</description>
