    <textblock>
      Kidney stone disease has become a common phenomenon in the US and Europe with a growing&#xD;
      incidence of about 10%. Life style and dietary changes have a cardinal part in kidney stone&#xD;
      prevention. Therefore it was only natural to determine the impact of the addition of a&#xD;
      nutritionist to a stone clinic run by a urologist and a nephrologist.&#xD;

      Kidney stone disease has become a common phenomenon in the US and Europe with a growing&#xD;
      incidence of about 10%. A history of kidney stone disease has also been connected to&#xD;
      cardiovascular and renal insufficiency events to a point that kidney stones is looked at&#xD;
      today as a systemic predictor of hypertension, cardiovascular disease and more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seeing the importance of these risk factors we initiated a stone clinic for our kidney stone&#xD;
      patients several years ago run jointly by a urologist and a nephrologist. Seeing that life&#xD;
      style and dietary changes have a cardinal part in kidney stone prevention, it was only&#xD;
      natural to determine the impact of the addition of a nutritionist to a stone clinic run by a&#xD;
      urologist and a nephrologist on our patient parameters.&#xD;
