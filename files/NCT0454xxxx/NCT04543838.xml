  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to prospectively evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of&#xD;
      with blood pressure management using intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring with SSEP&#xD;
      and EEG to reduce perioperative stroke. The central hypothesis is that perioperative stroke&#xD;
      occurs from emboli in the setting of significant hypoperfusion resulting in ischemia, which&#xD;
      leads to infarction. The impact of the proposed research is that, if significant SSEP and EEG&#xD;
      changes can be used to identify cerebral perfusion, then timely therapeutic interventions to&#xD;
      effectively reduce the impact of perioperative stroke can be directed.&#xD;

      If the patient is eligible, interested, and provides consent, they will complete initial&#xD;
      preoperative baseline surveys and assessments. These assessments include: Medical History,&#xD;
      Medications, Neurological Exam, NIH stroke Scale, Questionnaire for Verifying Stroke-Free&#xD;
      Status (QVSFS), Delirium Screen, Modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, Cognitive Assessment:&#xD;
      The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Depression Scale, and Quality of Life scale.&#xD;
      General history, risk factor profile and physical examination (H&amp;P) will be performed prior&#xD;
      to entering the study. Neurological examinations, NIHSS, Modified Rankin Scale and Barthel&#xD;
      Index will be performed by study neurologist. A Questionnaire for Verifying Stroke-Free&#xD;
      Status (revised Questionnaire for Verifying Stroke-Free Status (QVSFS)), QOL assessment,&#xD;
      Delirium and Cognitive assessment will be administered to each potentially eligible patient&#xD;
      by a research coordinator. Subjects of child bearing age will complete a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline surveys and assessments will collected during a pre-operative session, either in&#xD;
      conjunction with a pre-op clinic visit in-person prior to surgery during their surgical&#xD;
      admission. This will allow maximum flexibility in timing, without interfering with clinical&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically collected data will be abstracted from the electronic medical record (EMR) for&#xD;
      research purposes. We will review the patients preoperative medical records to screen&#xD;
      patients for the use of intraoperative monitoring. This is currently a standard clinical&#xD;
      practice. After enrollment, the subject will be randomized into the control or intervention&#xD;
      group. Subjects will be computer randomized to condition 1:1. It will take approximately a&#xD;
      half an hour to complete surveys and study procedures. On the day of surgery, EEG and&#xD;
      somatosensory evoked potentials assessments will be performed preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: The cardiac surgeons who will be performing surgery will be informed by the&#xD;
      principal investigator. The medical management of patients before, during, and after the&#xD;
      procedure will be continued as routine medical care in standard medical therapy group. In the&#xD;
      intervention group, standard medical therapy with intraoperative monitoring and management&#xD;
      protocol will be done. Our IMMP will be a) intraoperative monitoring with SSEP and EEG during&#xD;
      surgery and continued for 4 hours after; b) management protocol will be treating patients&#xD;
      based on a SSEP and/or EEG changes. In patients with bilateral SSEP and/or EEG changes, we&#xD;
      will aim for a MAP target of the greater of 20% above the patient's preoperative baseline or&#xD;
      an absolute threshold of 80 mmHg. In patients with persistent unilateral SSEP and/or EEG&#xD;
      changes, the higher MAP target will be maintained followed by immediate post-operative&#xD;
      evaluation for stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group, the patient will receive standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Procedure/Pre-Discharge: Brief history and physical examination daily while patient is&#xD;
      in hospital. Neurological examination performed by study Neurologist. Delirium screen will be&#xD;
      performed. NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) performed by study neurologist 18 to 54 hours post&#xD;
      procedure. MRI will be performed before discharge. The MRI will be completed at the MRI&#xD;
      Research Center.The Cognitive Assessment: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: At 30 days post-op: Modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, Questionnaire for&#xD;
      Verifying Stroke-Free Status (QVSFS), Quality of Life Assessment, and Cognitive Assessment:&#xD;
      The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: At 1 year: Neurological exam, Modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, TIA/Stroke&#xD;
      Questionnaire, Quality of Life Assessment and cognitive evaluation will be performed.&#xD;

    <description>Proportion of patients with a decrease in quality of life will be assessed by the EuroQol 5-dimension (EQ-5D). The EQ-5D questionnaire consists of two parts. The first part contains the EQ-5D descriptive system, comprising of 5 questions regarding mobility, selfcare, usual activities, pain, and depression (scores range from 0 to 1). The second part is a vertical, visual analogue scale with the end-points of &quot;best imaginable health state&quot; and &quot;worst imaginable health state&quot; (scores range from 0 to 100). A tool &quot;EQ-5D-5L Crosswalk Index Value Calculator&quot; calculates the crosswalk index values for the EQ-5D-5L dimension scores.</description>
