      In this study, the investigators aim to understand the role of transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) in modulating aberrant neurocognitive processes implicated in pediatric&#xD;
      patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The investigators propose two arms of the&#xD;
      study that will investigate fear extinction learning and inhibitory control in one arm (A),&#xD;
      and goal orientated versus habit-based behavior and inhibitory control in the other (B). All&#xD;
      subjects will undergo three study conditions: two with active tDCS to each of two different&#xD;
      brain targets and one under sham tDCS. The order of stimulation (sham or active tDCS) will be&#xD;
      randomized.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Outpatient youth between the ages 10-17 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) ≥16 (moderately severe).&#xD;
             OCD must be determined to be the primary or co-primary diagnosis using the The&#xD;
             Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children- Computer&#xD;
             administered version (KSADS-COMP) based on all available information.&#xD;
&#xD;

             Intelligence® Second Edition (WASI®-II) (within 90% CI). To decrease participant&#xD;
             burden, the WASI®-II will only be conducted in cases of suspected intellectual&#xD;
             disability after meeting with the PI.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Contraindication to tDCS: history or epilepsy, metallic implants in the head and neck,&#xD;

             pacemakers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Active substance dependence (except for tobacco).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Pregnant or nursing females as the effects of tDCS on pregnancy are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
