      Six healthy adult male subjects will be enrolled and the trial will be carried out in two&#xD;
      steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: Two eligible male subjects are enrolled and admitted to the clinical study site after&#xD;
      passing verification against inclusion and exclusion criteria on Day -2. After being&#xD;
      admitted, the subjects are trained regarding drug administration and urine and stool&#xD;
      collection procedures to ensure that they are able to perform relevant operations according&#xD;
      to the protocol and SOP requirements. Subjects are deprived of food for at least 10 h and of&#xD;
      water for 1 h before drug administration. After oral administration of investigational&#xD;
      product in the morning of Day 1 under fasted condition, each subject will be deprived of food&#xD;
      for 4 h and of water for 1 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dense sampling is scheduled for all urine and stool samples excreted at specified time&#xD;
      intervals within 0-336 h post-dose as well as blood samples at specified time points within&#xD;
      0-336 h post-dose. Sample collection and corresponding safety monitoring will be completed in&#xD;
      the morning of Day 15 (the specific time will be decided by the investigator and sponsor&#xD;
      based on the phased test results, safety results, and the actual situation) before the&#xD;
      subjects leave the phase I clinical trial ward. Subjects will return to the ward on Days 19,&#xD;
      26, 33, and 40 to complete biological sample collection and vital sign monitoring according&#xD;
      to protocol requirements. Subjects will return to the ward on Day 47 to complete the last&#xD;
      biological sample collection (scheduled to be 1176 h after administration) and various&#xD;
      withdrawal examinations according to protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial employs phased testing to determine whether the dense sampling and sparse sampling&#xD;
      time points should be adjusted and whether collection of blood, urine, and stool samples can&#xD;
      be prematurely stopped or should be continued for an extended period based on the test&#xD;
      results. If biological sampling duration exceeds 1176 h in this study, then sampling will&#xD;
      continue at an interval of 7 days until the protocol-specified evaluation criteria for&#xD;
      sampling termination is satisfied. Safety monitoring will continue until the date of sampling&#xD;
      completion. The test results in step 1 will be used to determine whether the trial procedure&#xD;
      needs to be adjusted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: Four eligible male subjects will be enrolled and blood, urine, and stool samples will&#xD;
      be collected at specified time points/intervals. The procedures are the same as step 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for sampling termination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excretion: The radioactivity of biological samples (urine + stool) collected over two&#xD;
      consecutive time intervals from the subject is less than 1% of the dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radioactive blood samples: Plasma radioactivity concentrations at two consecutive time points&#xD;
      are &lt; 3 times background plasma concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target total radioactivity of biological samples (urine + stool) collected from each&#xD;
      subject is not lower than 80% of the dose. The investigator should finally determine whether&#xD;
      to stop sampling of a subject based on the comprehensive evaluation of radioactive test&#xD;
      results, safety results and the actual situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire trial is based on the complete test samples and data collected from 6 subjects.&#xD;
      All subjects must complete the trial procedures according to the protocol requirements during&#xD;
      admission in the clinical study site and they are not allowed to leave the clinical study&#xD;
      site without permission by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject may withdraw from the study upon confirmation by the investigator provided that no&#xD;
      clinically significant abnormality is observed in clinical observation after completion of&#xD;
      the trial. Should any clinically significant abnormality be found, the subject will continue&#xD;
      to stay at the study site for observation or leave the study site after comprehensive&#xD;
      assessment by the investigator and periodically (usually 7 days from the last test) return to&#xD;
      the hospital for retests and followed up until recovery to normal, the abnormality is not&#xD;
      clinically significant, or a level deemed acceptable by the investigator.&#xD;
