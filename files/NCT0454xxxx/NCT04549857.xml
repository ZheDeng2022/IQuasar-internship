      This study aims to explore the effects of aromatherapy on pain, sleep quality, and&#xD;
      psychological distress in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The following hypotheses are&#xD;
      tested: The experimental group received aromatherapy will report significant improvement on&#xD;
      pain, sleep quality, and psychological distress.The comfort group shows no significant&#xD;
      differences.&#xD;

      The purpose of the research was to explore the effects of aromatherapy on pain, sleep&#xD;
      quality, and psychological distress in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The subjects of&#xD;
      the study adopted the intentional sampling method, and the place of collection was patients&#xD;
      with rheumatoid arthritis in the outpatient department of the rheumatology and immunology&#xD;
      department of the hospital. The study was conducted with a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      design. It is estimated that 159 patients with rheumatoid arthritis will be admitted, and the&#xD;
      participants will be randomly allocated into the experimental group, the comfort group and&#xD;
      the control group with 53 participants. The experimental group received base oil and&#xD;
      essential oil massage, the comfort group only received base oil massage for 10 minutes each&#xD;
      time, three times a week for three weeks, and the control group did not receive any&#xD;
      intervention measures. Repeated measurements were used to collect data using structured&#xD;
      questionnaires. Pain was measured by the Numerical Rating Scale, and sleep quality was&#xD;
      measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Scale)&#xD;
      measurement and psychological distress were measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression&#xD;
      Scale. Data were collected at four time points before the intervention, the first week, the&#xD;
      second week, and the third week after the intervention. The data obtained are processed and&#xD;
      analyzed using SPSS version 22.00 computer software. Statistical analysis methods include&#xD;
      independent sample single-factor variance analysis to compare the differences in basic data&#xD;
      and pain levels between the experimental group, the comfort group and the control group;&#xD;
      repeated measurement of single-factor variation Analyze the comparison of intra-group&#xD;
      differences among the three groups at four time points; finally, compare the effects of the&#xD;
      three groups on pain and sleep quality after aromatherapy interventions using the generalized&#xD;
      estimation equation.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention measures were taught by the researchers to perform self-massage on both wrists and finger joints in the experimental group and the comfort group, using 5ml each time (2.5ml each for one hand), 10 minutes each time (5 minutes for each hand), three times a week, It lasts for three weeks. The massage steps refer to d≈çTERRA's Aroma Touch Hand Technique.
