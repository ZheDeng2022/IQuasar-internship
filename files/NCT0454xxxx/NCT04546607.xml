  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nuvastatic TM (C5OSEW5050ESA)is a special formulation derived from the standardized extract&#xD;
      of O. stamineus leaves developed by Natureceuticals Sdn. Bhd. The extract is prepared from&#xD;
      meticulous extraction using sophisticated phytochemical techniques, where the particular&#xD;
      phytopharmaceuticals (active ingredients) are being concentrated to achieve the desired&#xD;
      therapeutic efficacy. In the proposed human study, it is anticipated that administering&#xD;
      dietary supplement of standardized O. stamineus rosmarinic acid-enriched Nuvastatic TM&#xD;
      (C5OSEW5050ESA) 1000 mg (3 times a day), can ameliorate fatigue in cancer patients. This is&#xD;
      based on scientific studies that support its ability in reducing oxidative damage and restore&#xD;
      mitochondrial and other cellular functions involved in cellular energy production. It is&#xD;
      further hypothesized that the anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive anti-oxidant, and&#xD;
      neuroprotective properties of the active compound rosmarinic acid may also potentially assist&#xD;
      in pain control, sleep loss, lethargy and other symptoms strongly associated with&#xD;
      cancer-related fatigue.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All stage I-IV solid tumors patients are planned to receive or already receiving chemotherapy&#xD;
      or radiotherapy including palliative chemotherapy and radiotherapy meeting the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will be consented and pre-screened for fatigue using Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI).&#xD;
      Subjects will be administered a BFI questionnaire prior to the commencement of their&#xD;
      chemotherapy (preferably 1st chemotherapy cycle) or radiotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed again using the BFI questionnaire on day 1 of their next&#xD;
      chemotherapy cycle or the following week of radiotherapy. Patients will not be considered for&#xD;
      study enrolment if the fatigue severity does not increase by at least one score from the&#xD;
      previous assessment during the pre-screening. Those with newly developed fatigue or worsening&#xD;
      of their fatigue score (i.e. from moderate to severe, mild to moderate, or mild to severe)&#xD;
      will be consented for study enrolment. The subject who signed informed consent, pre-screened&#xD;
      and is subsequently eligible for study enrolment/randomization will be enrolled into either&#xD;
      Nuvastatic TM or Placebo group&#xD;

             deviations below the median of international reference population d. Fever related to&#xD;
             systemic infection (especially Gram-negative coliforms such as Escherichia coli and&#xD;
             Klebsiellapneumoniae), neutropenic sepsis e. Respiratory distress f. Heart failure g.&#xD;
             Electrolyte abnormalities (hypophosphataemia, hypokalemia/ hyperkaliemia,&#xD;
             hypoglycemia, etc.) h. Marked anorexia i. Profuse diarrhea j. Shock&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patient is female and is pregnant or fertile and is not practicing adequate&#xD;
             methods of contraception, is planning to become pregnant within 1 month of the study,&#xD;

             breastfeeding for the sole purpose of enrolling in the study. Females who choose to&#xD;
             defer breastfeeding until 5 days after the last dose of study drug to allow the&#xD;
             elimination of the drug from breast milk will be eligible.&#xD;
