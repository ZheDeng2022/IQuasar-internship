  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity has beneficial effects on the quality of walking for persons with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD). However, regular physical activity is still limited in most&#xD;
      patients' daily lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rhythm of music makes you want to move whether you are sick or not. In addition, it has&#xD;
      been found that in people with PD, it can also improve walking by helping the participant to&#xD;
      regain the regularity of alternating steps and a better walking dynamic (i.e. better&#xD;
      position, better arm swinging, etc.). Studies have shown that music allows persons with PD to&#xD;
      walk faster, with bigger steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, if the tempo of the music does not correspond to the participant's walking pace,&#xD;
      instead of helping him, it can disturb him. So it seems necessary for music to help people&#xD;
      with PD to walk better if the tempo of the music is set to match their steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BeatPark is a smartphone application which makes it possible to synchronize the tempo of the&#xD;
      music with the participant's walking rhythm detected thanks to feet insoles. Once&#xD;
      synchronized to the participant's walking pace, BeatPark imperceptibly accelerates the tempo&#xD;
      of the music to help the participant's acceleration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial proposes to study the effects of walking rehabilitation depending on the&#xD;
      use of music synchronized to the participant's step with BeatPark, music with random tempo or&#xD;
      without music.&#xD;

    <description>The main outcome measure is the difference in average speeds measured during walking with musical stimulation during the last 10 minutes of the last 3 self-rehabilitation sessions.&#xD;
These speeds will be measured by the &quot;Feetme(c)&quot; soles under the same conditions ecological.&#xD;
If the subject stops his program before having completed the 20 full sessions, the speed will be evaluated over the last 3 fully completed rehabilitation sessions. Statistical analysis will be done with intent to treat. This criterion will be applied in main judgment to compare groups with music adapted and music at random tempo.</description>
