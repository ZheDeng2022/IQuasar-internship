  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of permanent disorders affecting movement and postural&#xD;
      development that are caused by non-progressive disruptions of the brain, usually occurring&#xD;
      during fetal period or infancy. It is commonly accompanied with sensory disorders and&#xD;
      learning disability. In 2016, more than 17 million people are affected by CP with a&#xD;
      prevalence of 1.5 to 2.5 per 1,000 live births. CP remains to be the most common cause of&#xD;
      severe physical disability in children. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&#xD;
      estimated an economic cost of US$4.1 million per CP patient that comprises of medical&#xD;
      services, special education and productivity loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current management of spasticity involves physical manipulation such as passive stretching&#xD;
      and splinting, sometimes combined with oral pharmacologic treatment, intrathecal baclofen&#xD;
      therapy and botulinum toxin injection. At times, surgical procedures such as Surgical Dorsal&#xD;
      Rhizotomy (SDR) can also be considered. Botulinum toxin injection has been shown to reduce&#xD;
      spasticity for up to 6 months, however, the cost of the procedure remains to be an issue in&#xD;
      developing countries like Indonesia. Therefore, other modality such as a non-invasive therapy&#xD;
      should be considered as an alternative treatment for spasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radial Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy (rESWT) is a non-invasive treatment that has been&#xD;
      shown to effectively improve spasticity in patients with spastic motor type CP, despite&#xD;
      unclear underlying mechanism. According to International Society for Medical Shockwave&#xD;
      Treatment (ISMST), there has yet to be a recommended guideline for the treatment of&#xD;
      spasticity in children using rESWT. One crucial physical parameter needed to be determined is&#xD;
      the number of pulse required to efficiently reduce spasticity. The number of pulse directly&#xD;
      affects the duration of ESWT per session (the higher the number of pulse given, the longer&#xD;
      the therapy session). This may be a concern for spastic motor type CP due to accompanying&#xD;
      sensory and learning disability. Therefore, the objective of this study was to understand&#xD;
      whether the reduction in hamstring stiffness in children with spastic CP could be influenced&#xD;
      by the number of pulse in a single ESWT session.&#xD;

      This study was designed as a double-blinded and randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with spastic CP from the outpatient clinic of the Department of Physical Medicine&#xD;
      and Rehabilitation at Rumah Sakit Umum Pusat Nasional Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo (RSCM)&#xD;
      participated in the study. The patients were randomly allocated to four groups: 500 pulses,&#xD;
      1,000 pulses, 1,500 pulses, and 2,000 pulses. All groups undergo routine rehabilitation,&#xD;
      including physiotherapy. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethical Committee of Faculty&#xD;
      of Medicine, University of Indonesia - RSCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spasticity of hamstring was evaluated as the degree of resistance to passive movement using&#xD;
      ASAS (0: no spasticity to 4: severe spasticity). Evaluations were done at four time points:&#xD;
      1) pre-ESWT, 2) immediately post-ESWT, 3) 2 weeks post-ESWT, and 4) 4 weeks post-ESWT. All&#xD;
      patients were examined by the same physiatrist with the patient lying on supine position on&#xD;
      the stretcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BTL-6000 SWT Topline (BTL, Czech Republic) was used to apply rESWT on hamstring muscles, with&#xD;
      the subject lying on prone position. The energy flux density was constant at 0.1 mJ/mm2 and&#xD;
      the repetition frequency was at 4 Hz, with a pressure of 1.5 bars. For double-blinded&#xD;
      treatment, spastic hamstring muscles from CP patients were allocated into four groups - each&#xD;
      group receiving a varying total number of pulses (group I: 500 pulses, group II: 1,000&#xD;
      pulses, group III: 1.500 pulses, and group IV: 2,000 pulses). No anesthesia was given.&#xD;
      Adverse events were closely monitored during and after therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-group changes in ASAS were evaluated with Friedman analysis of variance from baseline&#xD;
      immediately post ESWT, 2 weeks post ESWT, and 4 weeks post ESWT; followed by post-hoc&#xD;
      Wilcoxon signed-ranked test. Inter-group differences in ASAS reduction were analyzed using&#xD;
      Kruskal Wallis test. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS ver. 23.0 (IBM&#xD;
      Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). The level of significance was set at &lt;0.05.&#xD;
