    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if acalabrutinib is effective in treating a type of&#xD;
      cancer call central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. Acalabrutinib has not been approved by the&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of CNS lymphoma. However, FDA has&#xD;
      approved its use for treatment of another type of lymphoma called mantle cell lymphoma.&#xD;
      Currently, there are no standard FDA approved treatments for treatment of CNS lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acalabrutinib acts similar to another cancer drug called ibrutinib. Ibrutinib was tested in&#xD;
      several research trials for management of CNS lymphomas, and the results were promising.&#xD;
      Acalabrutinib and ibrutinib attack a similar target found in CNC lymphoma. Research studies&#xD;
      show that acalabrutinib does a better job in attacking this target than ibrutinib, and this&#xD;
      might be beneficial for using this drug in treating CNS lymphoma. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is test whether giving acalabrutinib is safe and could help controlling with CNS lymphoma.&#xD;
      The study doctors will be looking to see if acalabrutinib can shrink the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, participants will be given acalabrutinib and isavuconazol, because it&#xD;
      helps in preventing fungal infections. Fungal infection is a common side effect of&#xD;
      acalabrutinib. Treatment with acalabrutinib and isavuconazole will continue unless the cancer&#xD;
      progresses or participants experience bad side effects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      LCCC 1841 is a multicenter open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study designed to investigate the&#xD;
      antitumor effects of acalabrutinib in subjects with relapsed primary central nervous system&#xD;
      lymphoma (PCNSL), and relapsed secondary CNS lymphoma (SCNSL) with no evidence of current&#xD;
      systemic disease. Subjects with the following histological subtypes of lymphoma will be&#xD;
      included in the study: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, all subtypes); mantle cell&#xD;
      lymphoma (MCL, all subtypes); plasmablastic lymphoma, and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Up to&#xD;
      32 subjects will receive acalabrutinib at the dose of 100 mg approximately every 12 hours. A&#xD;
      Simon two-stage design will be used to minimize the expected sample size if the regimen has&#xD;
      low activity. In the first stage, 15 evaluable subjects will be enrolled and treated. If =8&#xD;
      subjects have an overall response of stable disease or better as determined by the&#xD;
      International Primary CNS Lymphoma Collaborative Group Response Assessment Criteria , an&#xD;
      additional 13 subjects will be enrolled and treated in the second stage of the study for a&#xD;
      total of 28 evaluable subjects treated on the trial. The study will accrue up to 32 subjects&#xD;
      to ensure data from 28 evaluable subjects. If &lt;8 subjects have an overall response of stable&#xD;
      disease or better as determined by the International Primary CNS Lymphoma Collaborative Group&#xD;
      Response Assessment Criteria, the study will be closed to accrual and no additional subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled. If the study shows a positive effect of acalabrutinib in treating CNS&#xD;
      lymphomas, acalabrutinib could become the standard relapsed CNS lymphoma regimen, not only&#xD;
      for PCNSL, but also in certain subtypes of SCNSL. Any complete responses to acalabrutinib&#xD;
      treatment will be clinically notable as spontaneous remissions do not occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study, ibrutinib showed a CR rate of 45% and an ORR of 68% ; in another study&#xD;
      ], ibrutinib showed a CR rate of 17% and an ORR of 55%. Thus, in order to recommend further&#xD;
      investigation of acalabrutinib as a regimen for primary CNS lymphoma, acalabrutinib treatment&#xD;
      must show an overall response rate (ORR) of at least 70%, which would demonstrate that it is&#xD;
      not inferior to previously approved regimens.&#xD;
