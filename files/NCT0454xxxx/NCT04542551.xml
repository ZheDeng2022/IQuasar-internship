  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand the role of a technique called esophageal&#xD;
      dilation in patients who complain of trouble swallowing. In patients with esophageal&#xD;
      stricture we want to determine if the size of the esophageal dilator makes a difference in&#xD;
      symptoms and outcomes. In patients who do not have an obvious esophageal stricture we want to&#xD;
      determine if esophageal dilation is an effective therapy in these patients.&#xD;
