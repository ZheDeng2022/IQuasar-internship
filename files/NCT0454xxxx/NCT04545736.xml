      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABCA4 retinopathy is a genetic disease in which the ABCA4 protein is absent or faulty. It can&#xD;
      cause waste material to collect in the eye and may cause cells to die. The cell death can&#xD;
      lead to vision loss. Researchers want to see if an oral drug called metformin can help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if metformin is safe and possibly helps to slow the rate of ABCA4 retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People age 12 and older who have ABCA4 retinopathy and have problems with their vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under a separate protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a medical and family history. They will complete a questionnaire about&#xD;
      their vision and daily activities. They will have a physical exam. They may have blood drawn&#xD;
      through a needle in the arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an eye exam. Their pupils may be dilated with eye drops. Their retina&#xD;
      may be photographed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a visual field test. They will sit in front of a large dome and press&#xD;
      a button when they see a light within the dome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an electroretinogram. It examines the function of the retina. They&#xD;
      will sit in the dark for 30 minutes. Then their eyes will be numbed with eye drops. They will&#xD;
      wear contact lenses that can sense signals from the retinas. They will watch flashing lights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have optical coherence tomography. This non-invasive procedure makes&#xD;
      pictures of the retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have fundus autofluorescence. A bright blue light will be shone into their&#xD;
      eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take metformin by mouth for 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have study visits every 6 months. Participation will last for at least 36&#xD;
      months....&#xD;

      Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral Metformin for Treatment of ABCA4 Retinopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABCA4 retinopathy is an autosomal recessive progressive retinal dystrophy that leads to&#xD;
      retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor degeneration, with consequent central&#xD;
      visual loss. A treatment that either reduces the rate of lipofuscin accumulation or improves&#xD;
      the clearance of lipofuscin in the RPE could potentially slow the degeneration associated&#xD;
      with this disease. Metformin hydrochloride is a well-characterized, commonly-prescribed oral&#xD;
      anti-diabetic medication that acts by suppressing liver gluconeogenesis and increasing&#xD;
      peripheral insulin sensitivity. An additional effect of metformin is to increase&#xD;
      macroautophagy via the mTORC1/AMPK pathway; stimulation of this pathway would be predicted to&#xD;
      enable the RPE to more efficiently handle lipofuscin. This suggests an association between&#xD;
      metformin use and slowing of retinal degeneration. The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the safety and potential efficacy of oral metformin in slowing the rate of change&#xD;
      in photoreceptor degeneration in ABCA4 retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate the safety and potential efficacy of oral&#xD;
      metformin in slowing the rate of change in photoreceptor degeneration in ABCA4 retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: The difference in growth rate of square-root transformed area of EZ band&#xD;
      loss (square-root AreaEZloss) between the pre-treatment phase and 24 month metformin&#xD;
      treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints: Proportion of participants with a 30% reduction in growth rate of&#xD;
      square-root AreaEZloss during the treatment phase compared to the pre-treatment phase,&#xD;
      changes from baseline to Month 24 in BCVA total letters read, perimetry, and color fundus&#xD;
      photography measurements and the change in rate of area of atrophy enlargement between the&#xD;
      pre-treatment and 24 month metformin treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The targeted enrollment is 40 metformin-treated participants evaluated for the primary&#xD;
      endpoint. Up to 44 participants will be recruited in order to reach this target. Participants&#xD;
      will primarily be recruited from the population of participants with Stargardt disease&#xD;
      currently enrolled in the NEI ABCA4 Natural History study, 12-EI-0203, although participants&#xD;
      from outside this study will be considered if they have sufficient supporting data that meet&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria (e.g. Point 4: Inclusion Criteria). Patients outside the original&#xD;
      12-EI-0203 cohort who have been followed for at least 2 years and have met the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will be considered at the discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI) or Lead&#xD;
      Associate Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I/II&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be seen at the NIH Clinical Center (CC). In the event that a second site is&#xD;
      used in order to obtain sufficient power, we would enter into a collaboration only with sites&#xD;
      if they 1) had a similarly-followed cohort of patients and 2) had identical testing&#xD;
      equipment/conditions for our primary outcome variable and major secondary outcome variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Study Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, Phase I/II, prospective, open-label study to evaluate metformin as a&#xD;
      potential treatment to decrease the rate of photoreceptor degeneration in ABCA4 retinopathy.&#xD;
      After establishing a baseline, participants will receive a starting oral dose of 500 mg&#xD;
      metformin daily, increasing to the maximum tolerated dose, up to 2000 mg/day, over four&#xD;
      weeks. Participants will receive investigational product (IP) for a total of 24 months&#xD;
      (treatment phase). Participants will be followed for safety for another 12 months after&#xD;
      receiving the final dose of IP with visits every six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      36 months&#xD;

    <description>Metformin is commercially produced in immediate and extended release. Participants will receive an immediate release formulation of metformin of 500mg daily at study entry. This dose will be titrated up weekly in 500mg increments to reach a goal of 2000mg daily maximum. Once participants &gt;=17 years of age reach 2000mg metformin immediate release they will switch to an extended-release formulation (1000mg twice a day by mouth). Participants &gt;= 17 years of age that cannot tolerate 2000mg will be permitted to reduce their daily dose to a minimum of 1000mg/day. Because metformin extended release is not FDA-approved for children under the age of 17, participants under 17 will remain on the immediate release formulation. For these participants who remain on standard formulation, the maximum tolerated dose between 1000mg and 2000mg/day will be given.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible, the following inclusion criteria must be met, where applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant must be at least 12 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant (or legal guardian) must understand and sign the protocol's informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participant must have at least one definite mutation in ABCA4 and a typical clinical&#xD;
             presentation of Stargardt disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant must have at least two years of natural history data with a rate of growth&#xD;
             of square-root(Area(EZloss)) &gt; 0.025 mm/year based on calculation from at least four&#xD;
             data points.*&#xD;
&#xD;
             The four data points must be at least six months apart and the most recent data point&#xD;
             must be at least six months and no more than 16 months prior to the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participant must agree to adhere to Lifestyle Considerations throughout study&#xD;
             duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any female participant of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy&#xD;
             test at screening and be willing to undergo urine pregnancy tests throughout the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Any female participant of childbearing potential must have (or have a partner who has)&#xD;
             had a surgical sterilization (vasectomy, hysterectomy, or tubal ligation), be&#xD;
             completely abstinent from intercourse or must agree to practice two acceptable methods&#xD;
             of contraception throughout the course of the study and for at least one week after IP&#xD;
             discontinuation. Acceptable methods of contraception include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hormonal contraception (i.e., birth control pills, injected hormones, dermal&#xD;
                  patch or vaginal ring),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  intrauterine device,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  barrier methods (diaphragm, condom) with spermicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Metformin, like insulin, is considered a class B drug by the FDA (animal reproductive&#xD;
        studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus and there are no adequate and&#xD;
        well-controlled studies in pregnant women) and is frequently prescribed for gestational&#xD;
        diabetes. One meta-analysis showed outcomes with metformin were slightly superior to&#xD;
        insulin. Nonetheless, out of an abundance of caution, we will ask female, but not male,&#xD;
        participants in this trial to use these forms of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        *This will most likely be obtained through the existing NEI protocol 12-EI-0203, but&#xD;
        participants outside this study will be considered if they meet the requisite criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation&#xD;
        in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant is actively receiving study IP in another investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant has a condition that would preclude participation in the study (e.g.,&#xD;
             unstable medical status including blood pressure and glycemic control) by interfering&#xD;
             with the participant's ability to engage in the required protocol evaluation and&#xD;
             testing and/or comply with study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any female participant of childbearing potential that is pregnant, breast-feeding or&#xD;
             planning to become pregnant during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant's retinal degeneration has advanced beyond a point where reliable&#xD;
             measurement of the integrity of the IS-OS on OCT is not possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participant has definitive mutations in RDS/peripherin (PRPH2), PROM1, and/or ELOV4&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participant has a history of chronic renal impairment as measured in the acute care&#xD;
             panel (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)&lt;45ml/min/1.73m^2) or severe&#xD;
             hepatic, pulmonary, or cardiovascular disease (hypoxic state).&#xD;
