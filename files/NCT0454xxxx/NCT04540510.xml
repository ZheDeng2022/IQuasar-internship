      This is a randomized-controlled prospective study to be conducted at Danbury Hospital and&#xD;
      Norwalk Hospital to evaluate oscillatory positive expiratory pressure (OPEP) devices for&#xD;
      &quot;airway clearance&quot; (helping to clear out phlegm or mucous from your lungs and bronchial&#xD;
      tubes) in the treatment of patients admitted to the hospital with pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 200 subjects are expected to participate in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia is one of the most common health conditions leading to hospitalization today.&#xD;
      Approximately 1.3 million people in the US are admitted to the hospital with&#xD;
      community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) annually, with readmission rates within the first 30 days&#xD;
      as high as 20%. In a retrospective analysis of patients with culture-confirmed bacterial&#xD;
      pneumonia, 30-day readmission occurred in 19.3% of patients. At Norwalk Hospital, the 30-day&#xD;
      readmission rate for patients with pneumonia is 13.1%. CAP is the sixth most common cause of&#xD;
      death with a case-fatality rate of up to 16% for hospitalized CAP patients, and an overall&#xD;
      30-day mortality up to 23%. The economic burden of CAP is also high, l with a CAP cost burden&#xD;
      estimated to be at least $13 billion in 2008 within just the Medicare population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been several small studies done to analyze the utility of airway clearance and its&#xD;
      potential role in CAP. These studies have generally been small and have used a wide variety&#xD;
      of airway clearance devices and techniques, including external chest wall physiotherapy&#xD;
      devices and postural drainage, both now considered second line therapies for most patients.&#xD;
      These studies have been variable in their findings and overall have not shown that airway&#xD;
      clearance is either beneficial or harmful in CAP. The studies did show, however, that the&#xD;
      duration of fever and hospital length of stay were both significantly decreased, suggesting&#xD;
      the possibility of other clinically important benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective randomized controlled trial, investigators will test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      the use of OPEP devices, specifically the handheld Aerobika (Monaghan Medical) will result in&#xD;
      more rapid and durable recovery in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia as&#xD;
      measured by decreased hospital length of stay, reduced duration of fever, improvement in&#xD;
      dyspnea, decreased duration of antibiotics, increased rate of diagnosis of the etiologic&#xD;
      organism responsible for the pneumonia, and reduced readmission rates:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Reduction in hospital length of stay&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reduction in dyspnea by modified-Borg score&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduction in duration of antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reduction in duration of fever&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Reduction in need for oxygen at hospital discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Reduction in 30-, 60-, and 90-day readmission rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Diagnosis of organism by sputum&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU)&#xD;
