  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the management of non-small cell lung cancer of the adenocarcinoma type, different&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies can be proposed. These strategies are defined according to the results&#xD;
      of a biological analysis of blood and/or tissue samples from the lung tumor. Mutations in the&#xD;
      tumor DNA are sought. Thus, patients with sensitizing mutations can benefit from a treatment&#xD;
      with a 3rd generation tyroine kinase inhibitor (TKI) whose efficacy has been widely&#xD;
      demonstrated. Patients without tumor mutations will not benefit. However, resistance to TKIs&#xD;
      appears after a certain time, often linked to the appearance of new mutations in the tumor.&#xD;
      For this reason, blood biologic analyses are regularly performed to search for the emergence&#xD;
      of resistance mutations and to propose a therapeutic alternative as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These analyses are performed routinely in the laboratory. In the course of these analyses,&#xD;
      the investigators have identified conventional mutations but also new mutations not&#xD;
      previously described in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective is to list all the molecular abnormalities revealed during blood biological&#xD;
      analyses, to determine their frequency and to study whether certain abnormalities can be&#xD;
      linked to resistance to TKI.&#xD;

    <measure>Description of the molecular alterations detected in patients treated with 3rd TKI and assessment link with progression free survival and overall survival features.</measure>
    <time_frame>The analysis of the TKI effectiveness and the appearance of mutations will be performed over a period of 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This retrospective study will collate the molecular alterations detected during routine analysis. The elements extracted from the file will be age, sex, type of tumor and clinical-histological characteristics, dates of diagnosis and start of treatment. In addition, information on the dates of appearance of resistances (radiographic or clinical) will also be provided.&#xD;
No additional analysis will be performed since the study will consist of the analysis of data generated by the analyses performed in the context of patient management and biological monitoring.&#xD;
This research does not aim to modify your care. There will be no additional consultation or examination, nor will there be any changes in the treatment prescribed by your doctor.</description>

    <description>Description of the molecular alterations detected in blood samples of patients treated by osimertinib. This test is usualyy performed routinely to detect conventional mutations including EGFR T790M. We performed panel of genes screeining based on next generation sequencing. Thius, iIn some cases, new mutations can be detected by this assay.</description>
