  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The wide-awake local anesthesia no tourniquet (WALANT) has been widely used in the field of&#xD;
      hand surgery in recent years. This surgical method has progressed to open reduction and&#xD;
      internal fixation of distal radial fracture and radial or ulnar shaft fractures. However,&#xD;
      there are still many unclear points for clinicians, including the perioperative subjective&#xD;
      feedback from the patient and changes in postoperative pain. In this study, participants&#xD;
      having forearm fractures should undergo open reduction and internal fixation were randomized&#xD;
      to general anesthesia or WALANT. The investigators will compare the differences in&#xD;
      perioperative subjective and objective assessments of these participants during surgery, as&#xD;
      well as the prognosis and function after surgery.&#xD;

      1. Written informed consent must be obtained before any study-specific procedures are&#xD;
           undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The process of the experiment A. Include participants into this study, they will be&#xD;
           randomized into general anesthesia or WALANT group B. The maximum (toxic) dose of&#xD;
           lidocaine was 7 mg/kg. Make distal radius fracture for an example, the solution used in&#xD;
           the WALANT technique consisted of 20 ml of 2% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:50,000, which&#xD;
           were mixed with normal saline to give a total of 40 ml. A set of baseline parameters,&#xD;
           including pulse oximetry, respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory&#xD;
           rate, and oxygen saturation, was obtained during the entire surgery. At the same time,&#xD;
           preoperative intravenous antibiotics with 1 g cefazolin were given for each patient as&#xD;
           prophylaxis. The amount of blood loss was based upon the amount in a suction container&#xD;
           in the operation room. In addition, the investigators will measure the participant's&#xD;
           intraoperative subjective satisfaction and pain assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. After surgery, the participant needs to stay in the in-patient department for one day. The&#xD;
      investigators will provide routine prophylactic antibiotics and oral pain pillar.&#xD;
      Postoperative pain, sensory, and motor function assessment.&#xD;
