  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized trial will study the effect of a mobile app that facilitates patient&#xD;
      engagement (patients undergoing complex abdominal surgery will track metrics of interest to&#xD;
      the surgeon, submit reports on their symptoms/pain/physical function, and upload wound&#xD;
      images) on readmission to the hospital. This trial will also assess whether the app can&#xD;
      impact surgical complication severity, number of emergency department visits, and readmission&#xD;
      costs. 300 participants will be enrolled and can expect to be on study for 6 months.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hospital readmissions are estimated to cost $17.4 billion per year in the Medicare population&#xD;
      alone. Readmission rates may be as high as 30% for patients undergoing complex abdominal&#xD;
      surgery. In this study, investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to&#xD;
      assess the effect of a novel mobile technology platform, MobiMD, on hospital readmission in&#xD;
      complex abdominal surgery patients. Data from a 50-patient MobiMD pilot study supports the&#xD;
      RCT design and mobile platform's feasibility in this study population. Investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the MobiMD app can facilitate better information transfer between surgeons&#xD;
      and patients in the high-risk postoperative time period, thereby reducing hospital&#xD;
      readmissions, emergency department visits, complication severity, and overall resource&#xD;
      utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will conduct a parallel, single-blinded, 2-arm randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      investigating the effect of a novel mobile health app on hospital readmissions for adults&#xD;
      undergoing complex abdominal surgery. Three hundred participants (150 patients per arm) will&#xD;
      be randomized to compare standard postoperative care alone versus plus MobiMD app. This study&#xD;
      is powered to detect a clinically meaningful difference of 11% in readmissions. Participants&#xD;
      will be eligible if they undergo any of the following procedures: pancreaticoduodenectomy,&#xD;
      cytoreductive surgery/ hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), gastrectomy, distal&#xD;
      pancreatectomy, liver transplant, pancreas transplant, simultaneous kidney and pancreas&#xD;
      transplant, low anterior resection, and any bowel resection requiring an ostomy. The MobiMD&#xD;
      app collects important clinical data points and patient-reported outcomes with associated&#xD;
      push notifications sent directly to the patient's smart device. Clinical data collected via&#xD;
      the MobiMD app include vital signs, red flag symptoms, daily wound and surgical drain images,&#xD;
      ostomy output, drain output, medication compliance, and wound care compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the RCT will be 30-day hospital readmission. The secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will include 90-day readmission, emergency department and urgent care visits, complication&#xD;
      severity, and total readmission cost. Exploratory outcomes will include length of stay and&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes in patient satisfaction, pain, and physical function. All&#xD;
      participants will be followed for 6 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Proportion of participants readmitted within 30 days of surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The primary aim of the study is to determine if using MobiMD app changes the proportion of participants readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of surgery. Readmission will be counted as &quot;1&quot; event and no readmission will be counted as &quot;0&quot; event. In concordance with the standards of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services, multiple readmissions for the same participant within a 30-day period will be measured as one event.</description>

    <time_frame>30 days postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported outcomes in physical function will be collected at 30-days post-operatively. The outcome measure will be assessed by the NIH PROMIS short forms, which can be administered through the MobiMD app. The PROMIS Short Forms will be used and are publicly available from healthmeasures.net.&#xD;
The PROMIS short forms are self-report instruments used to measure aspects of quality of life. The functional performance tests assess physical abilities (strength, mobility) in ways that are relevant to daily living. The short form consists of questions which can be answered on a scale of 1-5, where 1-unable to do, 2-with much difficulty, 3-with some difficulty,4-with a little difficulty, 5- without any difficulty. A higher scores correlates to more physically active person.</description>
