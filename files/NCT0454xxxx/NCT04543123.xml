  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized, single-blinded clinical trial, 58 patients with major depressive disorder&#xD;
      were assigned to active and sham tDCS stimulation groups in a 1:1 ratio, and treatment&#xD;
      responses were evaluated biweekly over six weeks.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were randomized to receive either real or sham-tDCS as well as anti-depressant&#xD;
      drugs. tDCS was applied over the left (anode) and right (cathode) dorsolateral prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex (DLPFC). Patients visited the hospital to get tDCS administrations 5 days a week for 2&#xD;
      weeks. They were evaluated every 2 weeks.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Hamilton Depression Scale at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hamilton Depression Scale was deployed by a trained psychiatrist at every visit.With a total of 17 questions, the overall score is rated from 0 to 34, and higher total scores indicate more severe depression symptoms</description>

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6</time_frame>
    <description>The self-rated scale of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was completed by participants. With a total of 21 questions, the score is rated from 0 to 33, and higher total scores indicate more severe depression symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6</time_frame>
    <description>Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale was deployed by a trained psychiatrist at every visit. Higher MADRS score indicates more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. The overall score ranges from 0 to 60.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Anxiety Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6</time_frame>
    <description>Beck Anxiety Inventory was deployed by a trained psychiatrist at every visit. The BAI contains 21 questions, each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 (not at all) to 3 (severely). Higher total scores indicate more severe anxiety symptoms. The overall score ranges from 0 to 63.</description>
