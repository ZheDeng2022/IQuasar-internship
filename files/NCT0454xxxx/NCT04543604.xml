  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Communication strategies are encouraged to enhance patients´ understanding of potential&#xD;
      events related to implant therapy such as peri-implantitis. Moreover, it is key to provide&#xD;
      accurate information to patients receiving dental implants to reduce false expectations and&#xD;
      to minimize the alterations concerning satisfaction. Information leaflets based in the&#xD;
      &quot;health-belief model&quot; proved efficiency in improving health judgments, decisions and&#xD;
      behaviors, in particular when supplemented with visual aids. Hence, it was the purpose of the&#xD;
      present study to test the effectiveness of different communication strategies to enhance and&#xD;
      modulate the understanding and memorization of risk indicators associated to&#xD;
      peri-implantitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective randomized controlled three-arm study is being conducted in accordance with the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki on human studies. Three groups are defined to test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that visual aids improve the understanding, modulation and memorization of peri-implantitis&#xD;
      and related indicators as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test group1 - Leaflet with visual aid (L-VA): Information concerning etiology,&#xD;
           prevalence, risk indicators and preventive measures of peri-implantitis were included&#xD;
           (supplementary figure 1). Relevant scientific bibliography supported the statements.&#xD;
           Along, pictograms were supplemented to display the prevalence of disease with and&#xD;
           without the known indicator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test group2 - Leaflet with visual aid (L-NVA): Information concerning etiology,&#xD;
           prevalence, risk indicators and preventive measures of peri-implantitis were included&#xD;
           (supplementary figure 2). Relevant scientific bibliography supported the statements. No&#xD;
           pictograms were supplemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group - No leaflet (NL): Only verbal information was provided to the patient&#xD;
           during initial interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to the tests or control groups according to the last digit&#xD;
      of their chart number. As such, patients with records ending 1-4, 4-7 and 8-0 were included&#xD;
      in test group1, test group2 and control group, respectively. When reached the total sample&#xD;
      size of any of the groups, patients were only recruited for the remaining groups to complete&#xD;
      the total sample size. A questionnaire based on the &quot;health-belief model&quot; will be collected&#xD;
      from every eligible patient at baseline, 3- and 6-month follow-up&#xD;
