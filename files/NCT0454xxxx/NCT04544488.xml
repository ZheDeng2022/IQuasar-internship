  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe complications of childbirth are common. Many factors have been studied to assess their&#xD;
      imputability in the occurrence of perineal tears. While women subjectively have different&#xD;
      push profiles in terms of intensity, frequency and duration of each push effort, no study has&#xD;
      evaluated this variability in a relevant, simple and reproducible way. Through this work, it&#xD;
      is expected to establish a qualitative evaluation of the expulsive efforts during childbirth&#xD;
      in term nulliparous women by measuring the intra bladder pressure which testifies of the&#xD;
      pressure exerted on the perineal tissues due to maternal pushing efforts&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      Scientific context:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is clearly observed in clinical practice that there seems to be significant variability in&#xD;
      the characteristics of the expulsive phase from one woman to another without this being&#xD;
      clearly described to date. During the same expulsive phase, the number, intensity and&#xD;
      duration of each push can be very different from one woman to another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that during expulsive efforts, the fetal head exerts pressure on the perineal&#xD;
      tissues , the repetition of these compressions, moreover if they are prolonged or brought&#xD;
      closer together could generate muscular lesions by hyper extension of the fibers, by&#xD;
      microtrauma or by tissue hypoxia. These variations in the characteristics of expulsive&#xD;
      efforts could thus modify the perineal risk for women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than the expulsive efforts evaluated by the recording of intra uterine pressures which&#xD;
      has already been described, it is the evaluation of the mechanical stresses transmitted to&#xD;
      the perineum secondary to the pushing efforts that we would like to record by the&#xD;
      installation of a sensor pressure connected to the woman's bladder catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations During the second phase of labor, at 8 cm dilation, after information and&#xD;
      obtaining free and informed consent, women will be included by one of the MD investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 visits are planned in the protocol: The first visit will be at childbirth Evaluation of the&#xD;
      mechanical stresses transmitted to the perineum secondary to the pushing efforts by the&#xD;
      installation of a sensor pressure connected to the woman's bladder catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up A prospective study including nulliparous term pregnant women with 2 other visits&#xD;
      planned at 3 months (12 to 16 weeks) and 6 months (26 to 30 weeks) after delivery, to assess&#xD;
      secondary perineal complications&#xD;
