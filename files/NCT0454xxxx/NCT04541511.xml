      Evaluation of the equivalence of 6-minute walking test performed on a non-motorized treadmill&#xD;

      The Six-Minute Walk Test (6-WT) is a standardized test to assess a person's functional&#xD;
      ability to walk as far as they can in six minutes. It is widely used in the assessment of&#xD;
      functional disability in response to medical intervention in respiratory and cardiac&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This test requires a corridor measuring between 20 and 30 metres and does not require any&#xD;
      special technical equipment or training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the test appears simple to set up, factors such as the length or width of the corridor,&#xD;
      and external disruptive elements, may affect the results. Indeed, the configuration of the&#xD;
      test site plays a role in the test result. For example, the distance traveled in a 6-minute&#xD;
      walking test is greater on a continuous circuit than in a lane that requires people to walk&#xD;
      back and forth or when others are using the lane (zigzags, slowdowns). In a hospital setting,&#xD;
      while it is easy to find a corridor that is long enough, it is not always possible to&#xD;
      dedicate it exclusively to walking tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative would be to perform this test on a non-motorized treadmill to avoid these&#xD;
      biases. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the equivalence of a 6-minute walking&#xD;
      test performed on a non-motorized treadmill to the reference test in healthy subjects. In&#xD;
      addition, a small number of patients will be invited to perform a 6-minute CT scan on a&#xD;
      non-motorized treadmill in order to first evaluate the perception and acceptability of this&#xD;
      new method in this population (seniors, pathologies). If the results are conclusive, a&#xD;
      similar study with patients only will be performed.&#xD;
