    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information from the investigation of a&#xD;
      non-pharmacological (non-drug) treatment known as low frequency pulsed electromagnetic field&#xD;
      (PEMF). The study team will be distributing the PEMF therapy to female subjects with&#xD;
      Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS) to measure its ability to decrease&#xD;
      pelvic pain. The results, from multiple questionnaires and voiding diaries, will be compared&#xD;
      when participants are enrolled for treatment, at 4 weeks after using PEMF therapy, and 12&#xD;
      weeks post-enrollment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a clinical diagnosis based primarily&#xD;
      on chronic symptoms of pain perceived by the patient to emanate from the bladder and/or&#xD;
      pelvis associated with urinary urgency or frequency in the absence of another identified&#xD;
      cause for the symptoms. Although it is not a life-threatening disease, the chronicity and&#xD;
      severity of pain, along with urinary symptoms, causes great impairment in a patient's quality&#xD;
      of life. IC/BPS poses as a significant clinical challenge for many reasons. For one, the&#xD;
      pathophysiology described in the literature is incompletely determined and likely&#xD;
      multi-factorial, including factors such as inflammation, neurovascular dysfunction, ion&#xD;
      imbalance, and impaired urothelial cell integrity. Consequently, there are many options for&#xD;
      IC/BPS therapy, many of which are driven primarily by patient-reported symptoms. In this&#xD;
      regard, IC/BPS patients with moderate to severe pain typically require multi-modal therapy,&#xD;
      often resulting in incomplete or no resolution of symptoms. Another clinical challenge is the&#xD;
      heterogeneity of the symptoms. While pelvic pain is the distinguishing characteristic,&#xD;
      patients with IC/BPS also routinely present with additional urological and non-urological&#xD;
      medical symptoms and syndromes. This has led to the description of two specific&#xD;
      sub-phenotypes in IC/BPS based on anesthetized bladder capacity (BC), in which patients with&#xD;
      BC &lt; 400 cc are more likely to experience severe pain, urgency and frequency (bladder centric&#xD;
      sub-phenotype), and patients with BC &gt; 400 cc (non-bladder centric sub-phenotype) have a&#xD;
      higher prevalence of non-urological associated syndromes (NUAS) such as fibromyalgia, chronic&#xD;
      fatigue symptoms, irritable bowel syndrome, endometriosis and sicca syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) therapy may present a promising alternative therapy for&#xD;
      IC/BPS. PEMF is a safe, non-invasive, and effective therapy currently used for wound healing,&#xD;
      bone-related diseases (osteoarthritis, RA), and chronic pain states (chronic lower back pain,&#xD;
      fibromyalgia), the latter of which is frequently associated with IC/BPS as NUAS. Based on&#xD;
      Faraday's law, electromagnetic interactions (e.g. PEMF) with biological processes and&#xD;
      conditions (e.g. IC/BPS) will theoretically address many of the proposed pathophysiological&#xD;
      causes of the condition. While the mechanism(s) of action are not fully understood, PEMF&#xD;
      therapy has been shown in several studies (randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trials) to decrease the output of pro-inflammatory proteins, improve oxygenation of blood and&#xD;
      tissue, stabilize transmembrane action potential and ion channels, and stimulate tissue&#xD;
      regeneration. Thus, PEMF may provide a safe, non-invasive therapeutic option that would be&#xD;
      complementary to, or serve as an alternative for, the treatments that are currently being&#xD;
      administered in IC/BPS for pain reduction. Of note, PEMF has demonstrated an excellent safety&#xD;
      profile with no associated systemic risks reported to date. Additionally, the application of&#xD;
      exogenous PEMF to stimulate the pelvic floor muscle has recently been introduced for treating&#xD;
      urge and/or stress urinary incontinence and overactive bladder. Furthermore, if patient&#xD;
      safety and efficacy for pain reduction are demonstrated, these feasibility studies will&#xD;
      provide the foundation for larger multi-site trials to determine additional parameters&#xD;
      regarding the appropriate number of treatments as well as the duration of benefit (pain&#xD;
      relief) following treatments.The purpose of this study will be to determine if PEMF therapy&#xD;
      in patients with IC/BPS is an effective treatment in reducing pelvic pain.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a single center clinical series evaluating symptom relief following a 4-week trial of PEMF therapy. From our registry of IC/BPS patients at Wake Forest Baptist Health Urology we will recruit women, ages 18-80, who have met all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Upon enrollment, each participant will be taught how to administer home treatment with the Bio Electro Magnetic Energy Regulation (BEMER) PEMF devices which consist of a total body mat (B.Body) plus a targeted pelvic mat (B.Pad) and control unit. Following the brief in-clinic training, participants will be sent home with the PEMF devices (preset to deliver the same level of energy every time) and self-administer therapy sessions, twice daily (once in the morning, once in the evening) for 8 minutes at a time. Participants will complete questionnaires as well as keep a 3-day voiding diary to record any changes in IC/BPS symptoms/pain at enrollment, 4 weeks after using PEMF therapy, and 12 weeks post-enrollment.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The ICSI (score range: 0-19 points) and ICPI (score range: 0-16 points) contain four questions related to urinary and pain symptoms. For the symptoms index, 3 of the 4 questions utilize a range of 0-5 with 0 indicated the symptom is never experienced and 5 indicating the symptom is almost always experienced. The fourth question utilizes a range of 0-4 with 0 indicating the symptom is never experienced and 4 indicating the symptom is almost always experienced. For the problem index, all four questions utilize a range of 0-4 with 0 indicating it is no problem and 4 indicating it is a big problem.</description>

    <description>The GRA asks participants to list any in-office treatments, home treatments, medications, or procedures they have had in the past year for IC/BPS. Then, they are asked to score those treatments based on a seven point scale (-3 to +3) with -3 indicating their symptoms became markedly worse and +3 indicating their symptoms were markedly improved after treatment.</description>

    <description>Participants will be instructed on how to complete 3-day voiding diary prior to initial office visit and following assessments. The participant will use a new diary sheet for every 24-hour period with sections identifying time of day (with wake time and bed time indicated by participant), fluid intake (type of fluid ingested and amount in oz), urination (amount in oz voided into urinary hat or urinal), amount of urine drained via catheter if applicable, leaks (any time participant experienced involuntary urine loss indicated by a check mark in the corresponding time column) if applicable, and pad changes (every time pad was dry indicated by a D in the corresponding time column or with a &quot;S&quot; &quot;M&quot; or &quot;L&quot; if the pad was wet with urine indicating a small, moderate, or large amount in the corresponding time column) if applicable.</description>

    <description>Treatment will be provided via self-administration of pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy using the B. Body (whole body mat), B. Pad (targeted pelvic mat), and Control Unit. The participant will lay the B. Body mat on any flat surface (i.e. floor, bed, reclining chair, etc.) and lie down on the mat with the smaller B. Pad placed directly over their pelvic area. Then, the participant will turn the PEMF device on using the attached control unit, which has been pre-programmed to deliver the same level of energy every time. Participants will be instructed to administer this home treatment twice a day (morning and evening) for 8-minute sessions over a four-week period. As this is a single-group assignment, all participants will be given the PEMF device.</description>
