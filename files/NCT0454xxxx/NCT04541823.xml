      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of desflurane on postoperative cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is a common complication during postoperative&#xD;
      period，especially in elderly patients. It is characterized by cognitive decline, inattention&#xD;
      and abnormal mental status following surgery. The presence of postoperative cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction is independently associated with poor recovery, increased hospital length of stay&#xD;
      and increased mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Desflurane is a widely used volatile anesthetic, associated with shorter emergence times than&#xD;
      other volatile anesthetics. This study aims to access the effect of desflurane in preventing&#xD;
      postoperative cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
