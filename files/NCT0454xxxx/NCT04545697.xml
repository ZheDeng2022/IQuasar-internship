  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients surviving with advanced prostate cancer frequently encounter time points in their&#xD;
      disease course that require choosing among multiple options regarding systemic therapy.&#xD;
      Interventions to improve shared decision-making through patient support measures such as&#xD;
      question listing, and audio recording and summarizing of consultations have been shown to&#xD;
      improve patient-reported measures of decision making quality, e.g. decreased decisional&#xD;
      conflict and regret. However, the feasibility of consultation recording and summarizing with&#xD;
      mobile health (mHealth) technology on patient-owned smartphones is unknown. The investigators&#xD;
      will conduct a single-arm trial to determine feasibility and acceptability of a&#xD;
      clinician-prompted, patient administered smartphone audio recording application and a service&#xD;
      to summarize the recordings (Patient Support Corps or PSC), in improving decision-making&#xD;
      quality among patients with chemotherapy-naive, progressive, metastatic castration-resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer (mCRPC). This trial will inform the design and conduct of a larger trial&#xD;
      evaluating broader scale implementation of this intervention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention (provision of instructions on how to install/use the app and how to share&#xD;
      the recording with the PSC) will take place 7-60 days before the upcoming oncology&#xD;
      consultation. PSC will provide a summary within a week of the consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the percentage of enrolled participants who use a clinician-prompted,&#xD;
      patient-administered smartphone application to create an audio recording of an outpatient&#xD;
      oncology visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the percentage of enrolled participants who listen to the audio recording&#xD;
           within 1 week after the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the percentage of enrolled participants who request and receive a written&#xD;
           summary of the consultation from the Patient Support Corps within 1 week after the&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether audio recording and summarization change decision-making quality&#xD;
           measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine whether audio recording and summarization change provider-reported workload&#xD;
           and other outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine whether audio recording and summarization change the frequency of follow-up&#xD;
           communication between participant and clinic staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed via electronic medical record review for 2 weeks after&#xD;
      consultation&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean participant-reported CollaboRATE scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 weeks after the appointment</time_frame>
    <description>The CollaboRATE is a 3-item questionnaire developed to measure shared decision making in reference to the most recent appointment the participant may have had with the oncologist.&#xD;
The questions are as follows: (i) How much effort was made to help you understand your health issues? (ii) How much effort was made to listen to what matters most to you about your health is-sues? (iii) How much effort was made to include what matters most to you in choosing what to do next? Each response ranges from a score of 0-9, with a response of 0 = &quot;No effort was made&quot; and 9=&quot;Every effort was made&quot;. Higher total scores represent more shared decision making.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean score of participant reported Decision Regret Scale (DRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 weeks after the appointment</time_frame>
    <description>The DRS is a 5-item questionnaire where participants are asked to reflect on a past decision, and then asked to indicated the extent to which they agree or disagree with the statement in the regret scale by indication a number from 1 (Strongly) to 5 (Strongly Disagree) that best indicated their level of agreement. Scores are converted to a 0-100 scale with a lower scores indicating less regret.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in scores on the Informed subscale of the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 2 weeks after the appointment</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;Informed&quot; subscale of the DCS consists of 3 items which measure the degree that the participant feel informed, with scores that range from 0 (strongly agree) to 4 (Strongly disagree). Scores are summed and then converted to a scale of 0-100, with lower indicating a greater degree of feeling informed. For analyzing changes in DCS information subscale, a two-tailed paired sample t-test will be used to determine whether the mean difference between pre- and post-consultation survey scores is 0 or not.</description>

There are 5 possible responses: &quot;Decreased work&quot;, &quot;No Change&quot;, &quot;A little more work&quot;, &quot;Some more work&quot;, and &quot;A lot more work&quot;.</description>
