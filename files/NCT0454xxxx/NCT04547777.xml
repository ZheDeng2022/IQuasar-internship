  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study of an anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (2141-V11) in combination with&#xD;
      D2C7-IT for patients with recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grade III or IV malignant&#xD;
      glioma at the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center (PRTBTC) at Duke.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within this study, a maximum of 30 patients with recurrent WHO grade III and IV malignant&#xD;
      glioma will receive D2C7-IT and 2141-V11 to determine the impact of the combination of&#xD;
      D2C7-IT and 2141-V11 on safety. D2C7-IT and 2141-V11 will be delivered sequentially directly&#xD;
      into the tumor by Convection Enhanced Delivery (CED) using an intracerebral catheter placed&#xD;
      within the enhancing portion of the tumor. Based on phase 1 studies of D2C7-IT alone and&#xD;
      D2C7-IT in combination with atezolizumab in adult patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM),&#xD;
      the amount of D2C7-IT to be delivered will be 4613.2 ng/mL (36 mL). 2141-V11 will be dose&#xD;
      escalated during the study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) when used in&#xD;
      combination with D2C7-IT.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histopathologically confirmed recurrent supratentorial WHO grade III or IV malignant&#xD;
             glioma (high grade glioma with molecular features of glioblastoma will be eligible&#xD;
             under WHO grade IV malignant glioma)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient or partner(s) meets one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Non-childbearing potential (i.e. not sexually active, physiologically incapable&#xD;
                  of becoming pregnant, including any female who is post-menopausal or surgically&#xD;
                  sterile, or any male who has had a vasectomy). Surgically sterile females are&#xD;
                  defined as those with a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or&#xD;
                  tubal ligation. Postmenopausal for purposes of this study is defined as 1 year&#xD;
                  without menses.; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Childbearing potential and agrees to use one of the following methods of birth&#xD;
                  control: approved hormonal contraceptives (e.g. birth control pills, patches,&#xD;
                  implants, or infusions), an intrauterine device, or a barrier method of&#xD;
                  contraception (e.g. a condom or diaphragm) used with spermicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years of age at the time of entry into the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) ≥ 70%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dl prior to biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/µl unsupported is necessary for eligibility on the study;&#xD;
             however, because of risks of intracranial hemorrhage with catheter placement, platelet&#xD;
             count ≥ 125,000/µl is required for the patient to undergo biopsy and catheter&#xD;
             insertion, which can be attained with the help of platelet transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neutrophil count ≥ 1000 prior to biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x normal range prior to biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) prior to biopsy (Exception:&#xD;
             Participant has known or suspected Gilbert's Syndrome for which additional lab testing&#xD;
             of direct and/or indirect bilirubin supports this diagnosis. In these instances, a&#xD;
             total bilirubin of ≤ 3.0 x ULN is acceptable)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prothrombin and Partial Thromboplastin Times ≤ 1.2 x normal prior to biopsy. Patients&#xD;
             with prior history of thrombosis/embolism are allowed to be on anticoagulation,&#xD;
             understanding that anticoagulation will be held in the perioperative period per the&#xD;
             neurosurgical team's recommendations. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is&#xD;
             preferred. If a patient is on warfarin, the international normalized ratio (INR) is to&#xD;
             be obtained and value should be below 2.0 prior to biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the time of biopsy, prior to administration of D2C7-IT, the presence of recurrent&#xD;
             tumor must be confirmed by histopathological analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
