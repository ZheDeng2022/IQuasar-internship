    <textblock>
      Medtronic is sponsoring this Mechanical Circulatory Support (MCS) Korea Post-Market&#xD;
      Surveillance (PMS) to evaluate the safety and performance of the HeartWare Ventricular Assist&#xD;
      Device System (HVAD® System) when used in routine clinical care practice in Korea. The MCS&#xD;
      Korea PMS is conducted within Medtronic's Product Surveillance Platform (PSR).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MCS Korea PMS is an observational study conducted at two sites. This MCS Korea PMS is&#xD;
      required by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) as a condition of product approval&#xD;
      according to Regulation on Medical Device Re-examination. The designated re-examination&#xD;
      period is seven years after the approval date (06 Dec 2013 ~ 05 Dec 2020). All patients who&#xD;
      require treatment of a commercially available HVAD System for approved indications between&#xD;
      the designated re-examination period at a participating PSR site are eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
      All enrolled patients will be followed until patient death, transplant, explant (where&#xD;
      applicable), or the end of the study, on 05 Dec 2020.&#xD;

    <description>Patients who require treatment with HVAD for use as bridge to cardiac transplantation (BTT) or destination therapy (DT) within the re-examination period are eligible for enrollment into the MCS Korea PMS. Patient consent may be obtained prior to HVAD implant or after receiving HVAD implant. Waiver of consent may be allowed if allowed by site's Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC).</description>

    <description>The Medtronic HVAD® System is comprised of three major components: the HVAD Pump with inflow and outflow conduits, a Controller and power sources. In addition to these components, the system includes a Monitor, Battery Charger, AC and DC power adapters, and a Carrying Case. The HVAD® System is indicated for hemodynamic support in patients with advanced, refractory left ventricular heart failure; either as a bridge to cardiac transplantation (BTT), myocardial recovery, or as destination therapy (DT) in patients for whom subsequent transplantation is not planned.</description>
