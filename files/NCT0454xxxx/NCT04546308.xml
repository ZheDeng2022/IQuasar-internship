  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resistance exercise training is one of the popular exercise modes that has been drawn the&#xD;
      public's attention. However, existing evidence showed high-intensity resistance exercise&#xD;
      training-induced negative adaptation on vascular function and blood pressure responses.&#xD;
      Upper-body resistance exercise training is more likely to induced arterial stiffening, which&#xD;
      has been shown to be gender-dependent. It is still unknown whether age also plays a role. We&#xD;
      like to test the hypothesis that high-intensity upper body resistance exercise may lead to a&#xD;
      higher increase of arterial stiffness, central blood pressure, and hemodynamic parameters in&#xD;
      younger adults than older adults. We also hypothesize high intensity resistance training&#xD;
      could contribute to greater central hemodynamic responses and muscle stiffness than the&#xD;
      control; the change of muscle stiffness correlates with the change of hemodynamic parameters.&#xD;
      Collectively, study 1 in this project is aimed to recruit 40 apparently healthy young&#xD;
      (20-35yrs) and middle-aged to older adults (50-75yrs) into this study followed by upper-body&#xD;
      or lower-body high-intensity exercise (80% 1 repetition maximum, 10 reps, 4 sets) by a&#xD;
      randomized order. Blood draw, central blood pressure, hemodynamics will be performed and&#xD;
      obtained at pre-, immediately-post, 20min, 40mins, and 60 mins post-exercise. Study 2 is&#xD;
      aimed to investigate the effects of 8-week whole-body resistance exercise training followed&#xD;
      by a 4-week detraining on above-measured variables in order to determine the long-term&#xD;
      effects on resistance training. We will employee state-of-art ultrafast ultrasound to obtain&#xD;
      muscle stiffness and carotid local pulse wave velocity. Endothelin-1 and catecholamines will&#xD;
      also be measured to discover its underlying mechanisms on such stiffening effects induced by&#xD;
      high-intensity resistance exercise.&#xD;
