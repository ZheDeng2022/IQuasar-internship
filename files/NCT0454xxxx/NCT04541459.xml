      Project Summary Cell phones have become indispensable devices in the investigator's daily&#xD;
      life. These phones operate between 400 and 2000 MHz frequency bands and emit radiofrequency&#xD;
      electromagnetic waves (EMW). Radio-frequency electro-magnetic field exposure from cell phones&#xD;
      or other sources of microwaves have deleterious effects on sperm parameters (like sperm&#xD;
      count, morphology, motility). Further, EMW radiation emitted by mobile phones affects cells&#xD;
      and organelles, and results in disorientation of charged molecules within the cytosol and a&#xD;
      distortion of electron flow along the internal membranes of the cells. These cellular changes&#xD;
      results in the generation of ROS leading to oxidative stress, which in turn results in&#xD;
      radiation-induced sperm DNA fragmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation shield can help provide protection from high levels of EMW radiations deflecting,&#xD;
      diverting, and absorbing the radiation between the user and the source. A new EMW radiation&#xD;
      shield, Qi-Shield device developed by Waveguard GmbH (Bautzen, Germany) provides protection&#xD;
      against the radiations emitted by the smartphone and laptop devices. Qi-Shield utilizes&#xD;
      conductive fluids in a particular geometric arrangement intended to ameliorate the negative&#xD;
      effects of EMW radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the changes in the semen parameters from the use of Qi-Shield device in sham&#xD;
      (control) and user groups To determine the molecular changes pertaining to sperm proteins&#xD;
      from the use of Qi-Shield device in sham (control) and user groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance The negative health consequences of EMWs have been documented across a wide&#xD;
      range of device types, exposure frequencies and doses (Giuliani, 2010), at field strengths&#xD;
      substantially below the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection&#xD;
      (ICNIRP) guidelines for permissible exposures. In the absence of a revision in the ICNIRP&#xD;
      guidelines, near-term public exposures to EMWs will most certainly continue to increase,&#xD;
      despite the scientific evidence suggesting more careful review and recommendations to limit&#xD;
      exposure to electromagnetic fields as much as possible. At present, there is no veritable&#xD;
      means for counteracting the negative health consequences of human-made EMWs, revealing an&#xD;
      unmet need for a means of protecting from or ameliorating the negative effects of EMWs, and&#xD;
      the need for devising strategies for creating safer living and working environments in a time&#xD;
      of increasing EMW exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive results in this study would demonstrate a means of counteracting negative effects on&#xD;
      human sperm due to EMWs. Documentation of protection due to the Qi-Shield devices would show&#xD;
      proof of principle that a low-cost passive device, portable and without battery or mains&#xD;
      power, can provide improvements in human sperm parameters, with promise for a means of&#xD;
      counteracting EMW-reduced fertility in large numbers of people. Confirmation of changes on&#xD;
      protein expression would provide data needed to identify specific pathways of action, insight&#xD;
      that is necessary for a more detailed understanding of the mechanisms of action of the EMW&#xD;
      protection effect. Taken together, these results would suggest further lines of study in EMW&#xD;
      protection, and provide clinical support for the adoption of EMW-protecting devices in the&#xD;
      home and workplace.&#xD;

      Normal healthy men enrolled in the study will be asked to provide semen specimens prior to&#xD;
      the use of device. Samples will be produced with a minimum of 48-72 hours of abstinence.&#xD;
      Further, the subjects will be blindly assigned with either sham Qi-Shield or Qi-Shield device&#xD;
      and will be instructed to use the device for a duration of 8 weeks .Semen samples will be&#xD;
      provided by the subjects at 0, 4 and 8 weeks interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 study subjects will be provided with sham Qi-Shield device, whereas Group 2 study&#xD;
      subjects with be provided with actual Qi-Shield device. Each user will be provided with a&#xD;
      small carrier bag to accommodate the device during their travel. The participants are advised&#xD;
      to keep the device within 3 meters of range as per the manufacturer instructions for a&#xD;
      duration of 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semen analysis All specimens will be collected by masturbation at the Andrology Laboratory&#xD;
      after 48-72 hours of sexual abstinence. Samples will be allowed to liquefy completely for&#xD;
      15-20 minutes at 37C before further processing. After complete liquefaction, semen analysis&#xD;
      will be carried out using automated LensHooke™X1 PRO semen quality analyzer (Bonraybio Co.,&#xD;
      Ltd) to determine sperm concentration and motility, progressive motility (Agarwal et al.,&#xD;
      2019). Viability will be determined by Eosin-Nigrosin stain if motility is &lt;25%. Smears of&#xD;
      the raw semen will be stained with a Diff-Quik kit (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Inc.,&#xD;
      McGaw Park, IL) for assessment of sperm morphology according to strict criteria as described&#xD;
      in the WHO, 5th edition guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      White blood cell measurement When the round cell concentration in the ejaculate is &gt;1 X&#xD;
      million/mL or &gt;5 round cells per high power field, the sample will be tested for&#xD;
      leukocytospermia, i.e. &gt;1 X million white blood cells/mL. This will be confirmed by the&#xD;
      peroxidase or the Endtz test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of Oxidation Reduction Potential ORP measures the transfer of electrons from a&#xD;
      reductant (or antioxidant) to an oxidant. ORP is measured in millivolts (mV). In the current&#xD;
      study, ORP will be measured using novel galvanostat-based technology-the MiOXSYS System (Aytu&#xD;
      Bioscience, Englewood, CO). Briefly, 30µL of liquefied semen will be loaded on the MiOXSYS&#xD;
      sensor. The sensor will be inserted into the MiOXSYS analyzer. Static ORP (sORP), measured in&#xD;
      mV, is the integrated measure of the existing balance between total oxidants and reductants&#xD;
      in a biological system. Data will be normalized with sperm concentration. ORP will be&#xD;
      expressed as mV/ million sperm/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA fragmentation DNA fragmentation will be assessed via Terminal deoxynucleotidyl&#xD;
      transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling assay (TUNEL assay). Briefly, 2 million&#xD;
      spermatozoa will be washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in 3.7%&#xD;
      paraformaldehyde. A total of 2 aliquots (A and B) will be used for each donor, one for ORP&#xD;
      measurement and other for measurement of sperm DNA fragmentation. These will be placed on ice&#xD;
      for 30-60 minutes at 4C. Thereafter, the spermatozoa will again be washed to remove the&#xD;
      paraformaldehyde and then re-suspended in 70% ice-cold ethanol, stored at -20C until the time&#xD;
      of analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sperm DNA fragmentation will be evaluated using a TUNEL assay with an Apo-DirectTM kit&#xD;
      (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Positive and negative kit controls provided by the manufacturer&#xD;
      and positive test prepared by treating with hydrogen peroxide controls will be included for&#xD;
      each run. Following a second wash in PBS to remove ethanol, the sperm pellets are&#xD;
      re-suspended in 50 µL of freshly prepared staining solution for 60 minutes at 37C. The&#xD;
      staining solution contains terminal deoxytransferase (TdT) enzyme, TdT reaction buffer,&#xD;
      fluorescein isothiocynate tagged deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotides (FITC-dUTP) and&#xD;
      distilled water. All specimens are further washed in rinse buffer and re-suspended in 0.5 mL&#xD;
      of propidium Iodide/RNase solution, and incubated for 30 minutes followed by flow cytometric&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BD C6 Acuri cytometry analysis: All fluorescence signals of labelled spermatozoa will be&#xD;
      analyzed by the flow cytometer BD Accuri Flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA).&#xD;
      About 10,000 spermatozoa will be examined for each assay at a slow flow rate of &lt;100&#xD;
      cells/sec. The laser excitation is provided at 2 wavelengths of 488 nm supplied by a solid&#xD;
      blue state laser at 20mW and 640 nm powered by 14.7mW diode red laser. Green fluorescence&#xD;
      (480-530 nm) is measured in the FL-1 channel and red fluorescence (640 nm) in the FL-2&#xD;
      channel. The percentage of positive cells (TUNEL-positive) will be calculated using the flow&#xD;
      cytometer software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proteomic analysis Individual samples collected from each group will be subjected to 65%&#xD;
      percoll gradient to specifically remove the white blood cells. Semen samples will be washed&#xD;
      with PBS three times. Once the supernatant is removed, spermatozoa will be solubilized in&#xD;
      radio-immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer containing the proteinase inhibitor&#xD;
      cocktail. After complete lysis of the spermatozoa, protein concentration will be determined&#xD;
      using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) kit and equal amounts of proteins will be fractionated using&#xD;
      SDS-Page 1D gel electrophoresis. Separated bands will be cut from a single Coomassie blue&#xD;
      stained 1D gel and analyzed. The bands will be washed, reduced, alkylated, and digested with&#xD;
      trypsin. The digests will be separated by capillary column LC-tandem MS and the CID spectra&#xD;
      searched against the human reference sequence database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional annotation and enrichment analysis will be performed using publicly available&#xD;
      bioinformatics annotation tools and databases such as GO Term Finder, GO Term Mapper,&#xD;
      UniProt, Software Tools for Researching Annotations of Proteins (STRAP), Database for&#xD;
      Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (http://david.niaid.nih.gov), and&#xD;
      proprietary software package such as IPA (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) from Ingenuity®&#xD;
      Systems, used to obtain consensus-based, comprehensive functional context for the large list&#xD;
      of proteins derived from proteomic study. The data will be subjected to STRING (Search Tool&#xD;
      for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins), a biological database and web resource of&#xD;
      known and predicted protein-protein interactions. This will help in identifying critical&#xD;
      proteins involved in reproductive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis All the data will be analyzed using the using the MedCalc Software (V. 17.8;&#xD;
      MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium). Paired t-test will be used if the distribution is normal.&#xD;
      Whereas, Wilcoxon signed rank tests will be used for parameters that do not follow normal&#xD;
      distribution. For paired T-test comparisons based on 20 samples for each experiment, the&#xD;
      power should be least 90% for parameters where a coefficient of variation is no more than&#xD;
      20%.&#xD;
