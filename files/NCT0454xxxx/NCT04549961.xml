  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to increase knowledge and awareness about nutrition of ICU&#xD;
      patients among the staff by evaluating nutrition care on an international level. In order to&#xD;
      be able to facilitate bench-marking of ICU's with a national and international standard and&#xD;
      actual best practice, we intend to provide a multi-lingual data acquisition tool to determine&#xD;
      actual nutrition care in an ICU's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      nutritionDay in Worldwide ICUs is a one day international cross-sectional audit.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One day international cross-sectional audit in all types of intensive care units. Data are&#xD;
      collected with the help of questionnaires. Anonymised data entry into the audit database is&#xD;
      done with individual and anonymous center and unit-codes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 4 questionnaires to be completed on nutritionDay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Unit Sheet: asks for nutrition related organisational and structural information on the&#xD;
           ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient Medical Information Admission Day: asks for patients status&#xD;
           (gender/age/weight/height etc.), date of ICU admission and laboratory parameters on&#xD;
           admission day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient Medical Information Actual Day: includes questions about treatment (insulin&#xD;
           therapy/antibiotic treatment, etc.) and laboratory parameters on actual day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient Nutrition: comprises questions about enteral and parenteral nutrition. Number of&#xD;
           days of parenteral/enteral feeding, planned amount of calories per day and the patients&#xD;
           well being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Evaluation: re-assesses the patient's outcome 60 days after nutritionDay (discharged,&#xD;
      still in hospital, transferred, death...).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation rules:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A user needs to register to nutritionDay as a member to the nutritionDay network. Each may&#xD;
      choose a personal user name. Each user needs to provide a valid email address. After&#xD;
      responding to a validation email the user is registered with the chosen user name. User&#xD;
      details are stored on a system that is not connected to the nutritionDay registry at any&#xD;
      time. One user may serve as contact for several units and centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A user may order codes for participation for one or several centers and units. Access to the&#xD;
      registry is only possible with a center code and unit code. These codes are selected from a&#xD;
      list of random numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Audit/registry recruitment plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation to the registry is voluntary. There is actually no participation fee. All&#xD;
      necessary information can be obtained from a dedicated website (www.nutritionday.org).&#xD;
      Participation can be promoted via international and national scientific societies,&#xD;
      universities, health care organisations or governmental agencies as well as via advertisement&#xD;
      at international and national congresses. The target would be intensive care units within&#xD;
      hospitals of different sizes and level of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk and benefit assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit for each patient is that awareness and knowledge about nutrition related factors&#xD;
      and treatment options in the treating unit is increased. There is no individual risk since&#xD;
      the audit is purely observational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit for the individual unit is to receive an extensive benchmarking report displaying&#xD;
      the unit data in comparison with all units from the same specialty from the previous 3 years&#xD;
      immediately after the end of data entry and a validation step. Units or groups of units may&#xD;
      request specific reports that can be obtained only after a case by case agreement and&#xD;
      financial coverage. All data used as a reference for benchmarking purpose are from units&#xD;
      where a minimum of 60% of actually present patients have been recruited and the outcome at&#xD;
      day 60 is available in more than 80% of these patients. There is no risk for the unit since&#xD;
      anonymity of unit is structurally strictly maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit for the registry up-to-date data enabling benchmarking in pace with medical and&#xD;
      care evolution. Moreover the registry data are used for research of the scientific community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data security:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the datasheets the unit and the hospital/center are identified by a numeric code delivered&#xD;
      after application to the nutritionDay coordinating center by an automatic system. The only&#xD;
      requirement is a valid email address for direct communication with the unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are usually identified on the locally used questionnaires by initials and age, but&#xD;
      use of initials is not mandatory. Consecutive numbering is also possible. Only the&#xD;
      participating unit has to trace patients identifier to be able to collect hospital outcome at&#xD;
      day 60 after nutritionDay and to answer automatic requests for data clarification during the&#xD;
      data quality feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During data entry into the electronic registry only anonymous codes for center, unit and&#xD;
      patients are possible. Thus the data handling centre cannot trace data back to an individual&#xD;
      patient. The access to data entry is protected by anonymous center-code and unit-code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typically all data are collected via a dedicated website accessed via www.nutritionday.org .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protected data server is run by the Center for Medical Statistics Informatics and&#xD;
      Intelligent Systems (CEMSIS) of the Medical University Vienna. The data server is mirrored&#xD;
      and backed up. The data server is protected within the University Firewall against external&#xD;
      access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data feedback and individual unit report&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participating units are entitled to receive a bench-marking report from the registry. The&#xD;
      report generator is started by the participating unit, when data entry has been completed. As&#xD;
      a first step each unit receives a data feedback sheet that is based on an electronic data&#xD;
      plausibility and missing data analysis. After stating that all data are correctly entered the&#xD;
      final report can be generated. This final report offers complete descriptive statistics of&#xD;
      the unit data compared to the reference data from the previous 4 years of the corresponding&#xD;
      specialty. Only data from units fulfilling a high data quality standard are used for the&#xD;
      reference. More than 60% of the patients present in the unit need to participate and 80% of&#xD;
      these patients need to have their outcome recorded. Optionally the period used for comparison&#xD;
      can be extended until 2007. All descriptive statistics represent prevalent data and are not&#xD;
      corrected for cross-sectional sampling to allow direct data control and interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All downloaded reports of a unit are consecutively numbered and stored for documentation&#xD;
      purpose.&#xD;
