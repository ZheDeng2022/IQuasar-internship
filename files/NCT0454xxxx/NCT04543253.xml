  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cushing syndrome (CS) is an endocrine disorder caused by chronic exposure to glucocorticoid&#xD;
      (GC) excess. Endogenous CS has an estimated incidence of 0.2 to 5.0 cases per million per&#xD;
      year and prevalence of 39 to 79 cases per million in various populations. CS usually affects&#xD;
      young women, with a median age at diagnosis of 41.4 with a female-to-male ratio of 3:1.&#xD;
      Following a curative surgery for CS, patients develop adrenal insufficiency and require GC&#xD;
      replacement postoperatively until the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis recovery&#xD;
      occurs. Factors, such as age, gender, BMI, subtypes of CS, duration of symptoms, clinical and&#xD;
      biochemical severity and postoperative GC dose have been reported to affect the HPA recovery&#xD;
      in small retrospective studies. Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome (GWS) is a withdrawal&#xD;
      reaction due to decrease in supraphysiological GC concentrations, which occurs after a&#xD;
      successful surgery of CS. Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome (GWS) is under-recognized entity&#xD;
      in patients undergoing curative surgery for endogenous Cushing syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we aim to determine pre- and post-surgical predictors of the duration and&#xD;
      severity of glucocorticoid withdrawal in patients undergoing a curative surgery for cortisol&#xD;
      excess and assess the effect of MUSE intervention on GWS severity in patients undergoing&#xD;
      curative surgery for CS as compared to standard of care.&#xD;

      Specific Aim 1: To determine pre- and post-surgical predictors of the duration and severity&#xD;
      of glucocorticoid withdrawal in patients undergoing a curative surgery for cortisol excess&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To characterize the timing and recovery of hypercortisolism-induced signs and&#xD;
      symptoms, proximal myopathy and tissue accumulation of Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs)&#xD;
      in patients after a curative surgery Specific Aim 3: To assess the effect of MUSE&#xD;
      intervention on GWS severity in patients undergoing curative surgery for CS as compared to&#xD;
      standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Selection of study subjects and medical records review. We will prospectively recruit&#xD;
           adult patients with CS of any three subtypes (pituitary, adrenal or ectopic CS) and MACS&#xD;
           undergoing a curative surgery, from the pituitary clinic. Investigator will discuss&#xD;
           participation in the study and obtain an informed consent. We will review data for any&#xD;
           potential risk factors through clinical interview and review of medical record. Data&#xD;
           will include demographics, behavioral factors (smoking and alcohol consumption), past&#xD;
           medical history (history of AI, psychiatric disorder and recent GC usage), GWS related&#xD;
           symptoms and signs (anorexia, nausea, emesis, lethargy, somnolence, arthralgia, myalgia,&#xD;
           fever, hypotension), and lab tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects: We will enroll 100 consecutive subjects in this study who will participate in&#xD;
           this study for up to 2 years. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are as below. We plan to&#xD;
           have 50 subjects participate in the intervention arm with MUSE in one year, without&#xD;
           modifying other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Step-by-Step methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will be identified by their clinician. Permission will be obtained from&#xD;
                the patient in order for one of the investigators to explain the study and obtain&#xD;
                informed written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Baseline history, physical examination, and the necessary baseline tests will be&#xD;
                performed based on standard of care and as considered necessary by the treating&#xD;
                physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical record will be reviewed for demographic information, comorbidities, medical&#xD;
                therapy, imaging information and biochemical testing results&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  We will use a scoring system to quantify biochemical severity, and to classify&#xD;
                clinical abnormalities as mild, moderate and severe ( based on existent laboratory&#xD;
                and clinical parameters).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At baseline, all patients will be asked to complete the Cushing QoL questionnaire,&#xD;
                SF36 and AddiQol questionnaires (forms are attached in Document). Patients will&#xD;
                discuss the intervention with MUSE with the study investigator. If they agree to&#xD;
                participate in the intervention arm, they will be instructed on its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At follow up, patients will complete AddQoL survey (weekly in the first 3 months,&#xD;
                every 4 weeks in the next 6 months, every 3 months in the next 12 months, and then&#xD;
                every 6 months until the end of the study) and SF36 survey (every 3 months) until&#xD;
                the end of the study. (In-person, through a paper survey or electronically using&#xD;
                external REDCap server (user name and password protected)).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For patients in the intervention group, in addition to the above, at the time of&#xD;
                enrollment, the study coordinator will help set up the MUSE application on to iPad&#xD;
                or iPhone or Android phone (we will use generic login name and password without&#xD;
                protected health information included). The coordinator will also go over a few&#xD;
                helpful hints and discuss the homework log, which will need to be completed&#xD;
                throughout the course of the study. After the surgery, patients are asked to&#xD;
                complete the 3 minute 'focusing' exercise daily until 12 weeks after the surgery.&#xD;
                During this time frame we will download the data from our end on a weekly basis.&#xD;
                After 12 weeks, the frequency of the usage will be at the participant's discretion&#xD;
                although ongoing usage is encouraged and data download should continue. In&#xD;
                addition, we ask that patients bring iPad, iPhone or Android phone to each of the&#xD;
                clinical visit for an app interrogation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient will participate in the study until one of the following: 1) 2 years of&#xD;
                follow up completed, 2) patient withdraws consent, 3) HPA axis recovery is achieved&#xD;
                and patient weans off GC, 4) completion of the study by the principal investigator.&#xD;
