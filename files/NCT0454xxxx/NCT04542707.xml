      This study is designed to evaluate the if there is a predictable patterns in brainwave&#xD;
      activity and to see how this changes with external physical therapy interventions such as&#xD;
      manipulation, soft tissue massage, and exercise.&#xD;

      This study is designed to evaluate the how the brain responds to external stimulation.&#xD;
      Patients with chronic pain can benefit from physical therapy treatments, such as&#xD;
      manipulation, soft tissue massage, and exercise. This study is made up of three different&#xD;
      phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first phase to objective is to identify if there is a typical resting brain wave&#xD;
      activity (measured with EEG) in asymptomatic subjects. In the second phase of the project the&#xD;
      subjects will undergo physical therapy interventions and the brain wave response will be&#xD;
      measured. The interventions are chosen based on the fact that they have been demonstrated in&#xD;
      the literature to decrease pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Joint manipulation is a manual therapy intervention used with patients that experience pain&#xD;
      and decreased range of motion. When undergoing a manipulation, audible sounds often occurring&#xD;
      with the manipulation and sometimes this does not occur. In the current literature there is a&#xD;
      difference between the effects of spinal manipulation and manipulation of the joints in the&#xD;
      extremities. For that reason, this study will evaluate the response in both. It is not clear&#xD;
      in the current literature if the audible sound has a true therapeutic effect. It is possible&#xD;
      that patient perception of this sound will create a specific brainwave response pattern. This&#xD;
      might support the clinician's pursuit of the audible sound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise has been shown to decrease pain, stiffness and increase ROM. Overall exercise&#xD;
      contributes to wellbeing. There are different types of exercise such as strength exercise,&#xD;
      aerobic exercise (aiming at increasing your heart rate) and body/ mind exercises (Yoga). In&#xD;
      this phase of the study brainwave response on each of these types of exercises will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soft tissue massage is a modality that has been shown to increase blood flow and decrease&#xD;
      pain. This change in pain perception should lead to an altered brain wave activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the phase the brain wave response on joint manipulation, exercise, and soft tissue&#xD;
      massage on asymptomatic subjects will be measured and compared to each other. The hypothesis&#xD;
      is that there will be a predictable pattern of brain response in each intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third phase of this study is to repeat the measures and intervention in subjects that&#xD;
      experience pain. The hypothesis is that there is an altered brainwave response compared to&#xD;
      the asymptomatic group. Additionally, in this phase the investigators will measure the&#xD;
      brainwave response of FGCU college athletes who sprained their ankle within three days of the&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
