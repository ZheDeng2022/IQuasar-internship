      The aim of this research is to determine the Effects of Sub-Occipital Muscles Inhibition&#xD;
      Technique and Cranio Cervical Flexion Exercise for Mechanical Neck Pain. A randomized control&#xD;
      trail will conduct at Railway general hospital(IIMCT). The sample size will be 68.&#xD;
      TheParticipants will bedividing into two groups,34 participants in Group A (receive the&#xD;
      Sub-Occipital Muscles Inhibition Technique) and 34 in Group B (receive Cranio Cervical&#xD;
      Flexion Exercise). The study duration will 6 months. Purposive non probability sampling&#xD;
      technique will be applied. Both male and female participants with mechanical neck pain will&#xD;
      be include. Tools use in this study areNumerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), Neck Disability&#xD;
      Index (NDI),Goniometer, Pressure Biofeedback unit, Digital Camera. Data analyzed through SPSS&#xD;
      version 21.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical neck pain (MNP) is generalized neck or shoulder pain with mechanical&#xD;
      characteristics (including symptoms provoked by neck postures, neck movement, or palpation of&#xD;
      the cervical musculature). It has become an increasing problem causing functional disability&#xD;
      in large populations. It is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders in the neck&#xD;
      region. Neck pain of mechanical origin constitutes approximately 45% - 50% of all neck pain.&#xD;
      The variation in the prevalence ranges from 43.0% of the Swedish population, 34.4% of&#xD;
      Norwegian adult population and In North America (Saskatchewan, Canada) lifetime prevalence of&#xD;
      neck pain is 66.7%. The reason for this may lie in the increasing time spent on office and&#xD;
      computer work. Also, a significant proportion of mechanical neck disorders consist of&#xD;
      whiplash associated disorders (WAD), with a higher prevalence in women (22%) than in men&#xD;
      (16%). Strong evidence suggests biomechanical factors, including prolonged computer use, and&#xD;
      posture and repetitive movements are associated with the development of neck pain. Cervical&#xD;
      joint dysfunction is the main cause of mechanical neck pain. One of the predominant&#xD;
      mechanical events causing neck pain, is impaired stability of the cervical spine, which is&#xD;
      often attributed to disturbances in motor control over the cervical spine. The stability of&#xD;
      the cervical spine is dependent on the deep neck flexor and neck extensor muscles. The&#xD;
      longuscolli and capitis are principal deep neck flexor muscles. In contrast, the suboccipital&#xD;
      muscles are principal neck extensors of the upper cervical spine and are composed of the&#xD;
      rectus capitis posterior major (RCPM), rectus capitis posterior minor (RCPm), obliquuscapitis&#xD;
      superior (OCS), and obliquuscapitis inferior (OCI). There are varieties of physiotherapy&#xD;
      interventions for the management of Mechanical neck pain such as spinal joint manipulation,&#xD;
      mobilization techniques, massage techniques, suboccipital muscle inhibition technique,&#xD;
      craniocervical flexion exercise, soft tissue techniques and trigger point [TrP] treatment ,&#xD;
      needling, active release techniques, stretches (static and isometric ), traction and various&#xD;
      electro modalities.A very limited evidence found on comparison on effectiveness of sub&#xD;
      occipital muscle release and Cranio-cervical flexion exercise. Previous studies only find out&#xD;
      immediate effect (one session) on Cervical ROM and CVA. To fill the gap, this study is&#xD;
      formulated to determine the effects of sub occipital muscle release and Cranio-cervical&#xD;
      flexion exercise on ROM in the cervical spine and Cranio-vertebral angle (CVA) in mechanical&#xD;
      neck pain. Study will find out most effective treatment for management of mechanical neck&#xD;
      pain and would contribute to educate and treat the patient with most simple and effective&#xD;
      treatment approach.&#xD;

    <description>Changes from base line Northwick disability index was developed first in Northwick Park hospital, England. It was designed to measure the neck pain and disability over time. It consists of 10, five parts sections. At the end, score is calculated by dividing the obtained score by total (50) multiplied by 100.</description>
