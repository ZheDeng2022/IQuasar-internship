  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this evaluation, 4 different versions of letters are being sent with mailers promoting&#xD;
      colorectal cancer screening with an at-home test. The researchers hypothesize that the use of&#xD;
      behavioral nudges in the message should lead to increased colorectal cancer screening (either&#xD;
      with the at-home test or a colonoscopy).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer diagnosed in the US. Mailing fecal&#xD;
      immunochemical (FIT) kits to at-risk patients is an effective way of increasing CRC testing&#xD;
      uptake, as this test can be done at home and is less intrusive compared to colonoscopies. As&#xD;
      part of an existing program, the health system mails FIT kits to eligible patients each year.&#xD;
      Although this test needs to be conducted annually, not everyone who receives the test kit&#xD;
      returns the kits for processing. In this study, the researchers aim to test different letters&#xD;
      with the goal of encouraging the use of FIT kits or scheduling a colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this study, the kits are mailed with everything the patient will need to conduct&#xD;
      the test at home and mail a sample back to the hospital. It also includes an introductory&#xD;
      letter informing the patient about the program and inviting them to use the kit. The&#xD;
      researchers are comparing a standard version of the introductory letter against 3 versions&#xD;
      that include different combinations of behavioral nudges, specifically framing effects (loss,&#xD;
      default, decoy) and fear appeals.&#xD;

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Letter with Risks</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The standard letter is enhanced with language that further emphasizes the risks but also clearly describes how early detection with a test can reduce those risks; it also explains why test kits are being sent to disarm skepticism about the program.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Letter with Risks and Options</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In addition to the enhancements added by the letter with risks, the letter also includes a table comparing FIT kit and colonoscopy. Presenting different screening options allows recipients to make the choice that best suits them. In addition, presenting multiple options increases the chance that recipients get screened in one way or another.</description>

    <description>The letter is enhanced with language that frames the situation in terms of losses. It also uses fear appeals by showing the risks of colorectal cancer, while also showing that screening is an achievable means to address those risks.</description>

    <intervention_name>Default Effect and Presentation of Alternatives</intervention_name>
    <description>The pros and cons for screening with FIT kits and colonoscopy are presented. By showing an additional option, the table frames the FIT kit as the default option (since they are included in the mailer). In this situation, inaction is no longer the default option. Changing the default option increases the chance that the FIT kit is used. In addition, another viable alternative is provided (colonoscopy), which still contributes to the goal of the project (getting screened).</description>

    <intervention_name>Enhanced Fear Appeals and Decoy Effect</intervention_name>
    <description>Comparisons of the mortality rates between screening with FIT kits, colonoscopy, and inaction (waiting for symptoms to appear) are displayed. Inaction is presented as a decoy, which has worse outcomes than either of the screening options. Due to this contrast, the inclusion of the decoy increases the appeal of the other screening options.</description>
