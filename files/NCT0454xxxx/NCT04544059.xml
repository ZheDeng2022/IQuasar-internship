    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 2 trial to explore the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      combination of lenalidomide and R-CHOP for preventing the CNS relapse in the high-risk&#xD;
      diffuse large B cell lymphoma.&#xD;

    <description>Lenalidomide orally 25 mg per day was administered on days 1 through 10 of each cycle and delivered concomitantly with standard dose R-CHOP-21 regimen (rituximab 375 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 or Liposome doxorubicin 30mg/m2, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 [capped at 2.0 mg], all on day 1; prednisone 100 mg per day on days 1 through 5). All patients received aspirin 100mg per day prophylaxis throughout, unless they were on therapeutic dose warfarin or low molecular weight heparin for intercurrent conditions. The treatment continued for a maximum of six to eight cycles or until disease progression. Tumor lysis prophylaxis, antiemetics, and supportive care were standard of care.</description>
