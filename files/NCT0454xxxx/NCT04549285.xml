      The purpose of this multi-site, pilot study is to test whether infusions of human cord tissue&#xD;
      mesenchymal stromal cells (hCT-MSC) are safe in children with multi system inflammatory&#xD;
      syndrome (MIS-C). We will also describe the symptom course and duration of this&#xD;
      hyper-inflammatory syndrome in these patients. Six patients less than 21 years old with MIS-C&#xD;
      that is refractory to intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) and/or steroids will be given&#xD;
      intravenous infusions of hCT-MSCs. Doses of 2x10^6 cells/kg (up to a maximum dose of 100x10^6&#xD;
      cells) will be given on days 1, 2, 3, +/-7 (day 7 is optional). Participants will be followed&#xD;
      up to 90 days after administration for severe adverse events and survival. Safety will be&#xD;
      evaluated through adverse event monitoring, clinical evaluations (i.e., vital signs, physical&#xD;
      examinations), laboratory tests (i.e., hematology, serum chemistries, and urinalysis), and&#xD;
      cardiac function (i.e., echocardiogram, ECG) from the signing of informed consent and&#xD;
      throughout the patient's participation in this treatment protocol.&#xD;

      This phase I, multisite, pilot study will test whether infusions of human cord tissue derived&#xD;
      MSCs (hCT-MSC) are safe in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of six patients 18 to &lt;21 years old with a life expectancy&#xD;
      ≥ 72 hours and COVID-19 related MIS-C that is refractory to treatment with intravenous immune&#xD;
      globulin (IVIG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a newly recognized, serious,&#xD;
      hyper-inflammatory syndrome that is occurring in small numbers of children, many of whom are&#xD;
      within a month or so of recovering from a COVID-19 infection. While the clinical presentation&#xD;
      varies, affected patients are typically previously healthy individuals who are less than 21&#xD;
      years of age. The diagnostic criteria include fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation, and&#xD;
      multisystem involvement requiring hospitalization. Up to 75% of patients present with an&#xD;
      element of cardiogenic shock requiring inotropic support, with some also requiring intubation&#xD;
      with mechanical ventilation. Reported supportive treatments have included intravenous immune&#xD;
      globulin (IVIG), tocilizumab, methylprednisolone, and aspirin. In the limited cases reported,&#xD;
      up to 50% of children with MIS-C have antibodies to COVID-19 in their blood and may or may&#xD;
      not be PCR positive on a nasal swab or throat culture. The disease is incompletely understood&#xD;
      but currently believed, at least in part, to be a hyper-immune response to a recent COVID-19&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In laboratory experiments, MSCs have been shown to inhibit T-cell proliferation and decrease&#xD;
      production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In animal models, up to 70% of infused cells are&#xD;
      engulfed by lung macrophages, leading to secretion of anti-inflammatory molecules by these&#xD;
      macrophages. These observations have led to the hypothesis that MSCs may work through both&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, immune-modulatory, and regenerative mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past several months, MSCs have been tested in small cohorts of adult patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome to determine if the cytokine storm hypothesized&#xD;
      to cause this complication could be suppressed by MSCs. Early results are encouraging, and&#xD;
      formal clinical trials are underway. Extending this work into the pediatric population, the&#xD;
      hypothesis of this study is that infusion of hCT-MSC can reverse the pro-inflammatory state&#xD;
      in children with MIS-C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 6 patient, multisite, pilot study to test whether infusions of hCT-MSC are safe in&#xD;
      pediatric patients with MIS-C. Information will also be gathered about the duration and&#xD;
      severity of the participant's multisystem inflammatory syndrome. hCT-MSCs will be&#xD;
      manufactured at Duke University Medical Center in the Robertson GMP Cell Manufacturing&#xD;
      Laboratory and shipped frozen to the treatment site, where they will remain stored in the&#xD;
      vapor phase of liquid nitrogen until the day of dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline evaluation will include vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature,&#xD;
      respiratory rate), echocardiogram, ECG or telemetry strip, HLA typing, Panel Reactive&#xD;
      Antibody (anti-HLA antibody), inflammatory markers, blood counts, blood chemistry,&#xD;
      coagulation, and COVID-19 PCR and antibody tests.Patients will be dosed with 2x10^6&#xD;
      hCT-MSCs/kg. Doses will be given on days 1, 2, 3, and a fourth, optional dose may be given on&#xD;
      day 7 at the discretion of the investigator and the treating physician. Prior to the&#xD;
      infusion, premedications (Benadryl, Hydrocortisone, 0.5mg/kg each) will be administered. The&#xD;
      hCT-MSCs will be administered intravenously over 30-60 minutes via a syringe pump. Pulse&#xD;
      oximetry will be monitored continuously throughout the infusion and IV fluids will be managed&#xD;
      by the care team. Afterwards, the participant will continue to be monitored in their care&#xD;
      setting per institutional standards. Participants will be evaluated by study staff the day&#xD;
      after the infusion to assess for any infusion-related adverse reactions or complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be monitored by study staff to assess for any infusion related adverse&#xD;
      reactions or complications until discharge. Additional follow-up will occur on days 14, 28,&#xD;
      and 90. Follow up testing will include assessment for adverse events as well as the tests&#xD;
      done at baseline (with the exception of HLA typing and COVID PCR.&#xD;
