  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the combination of a poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase&#xD;
      (PARP) inhibitor, niraparib, with the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor,&#xD;
      dostarlimab in the pediatric population. This study will be conducted to determine the&#xD;
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and efficacy&#xD;
      of niraparib in combination with dostarlimab in pediatric participants with recurrent or&#xD;
      refractory solid tumors.&#xD;

             participants rolling over from Part 1 of the study: these participants are allowed to&#xD;
