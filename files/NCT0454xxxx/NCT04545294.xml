  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized double-blind trial, we investigated whether externally induced&#xD;
      left-hemispheric frontoparietal theta synchronization by multi-electrode online theta (6Hz)&#xD;
      transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) would enhance the influence of a working&#xD;
      memory training on negative symptoms of schizophrenia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Negative symptoms have a negative impact on the prognosis of schizophrenia, but effective&#xD;
      treatment for this symptom dimension is still under investigation. Identifying a treatment&#xD;
      target that has a close link to negative symptoms or highly impacts negative symptoms may&#xD;
      help to develop an effective therapy to counteract negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Recent&#xD;
      theoretical and empirical work linking negative symptoms and cognitive impairment in&#xD;
      schizophrenia has identified a potential treatment target: cognitive deficits. Evidence has&#xD;
      indicated that cognitive remediation (CR) has a positive effect on improving negative&#xD;
      symptoms of schizophrenia, in particular behavioural negative symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it is still debated which active components of CR contribute to the improvements in&#xD;
      negative symptoms. The framework proposed by Gold and colleagues may be a candidate to&#xD;
      explain how CR improves negative symptoms (i.e., possible through improving working memory).&#xD;
      Anhedonia (i.e., the diminished ability to experience pleasure and reduced reactivity to&#xD;
      pleasurable stimuli) represents a challenging negative symptom in schizophrenia.The&#xD;
      impairment in hedonic processing has been associated with reduced motivation to engage in&#xD;
      potentially rewarding events. Working memory (WM) plays an important role in the formation,&#xD;
      maintenance, and retrieval of affective and value representations, all of which are essential&#xD;
      for anticipatory pleasure. Individuals represent events and forecast pleasure by using WM in&#xD;
      order to recruit motivational resources. It has been suggested that there is a hedonic&#xD;
      detector system within the WM model and that WM serves as a potential underlying cognitive&#xD;
      mechanism for anticipatory pleasure and goal-related behaviours. Problems in WM may reduce&#xD;
      the ability to retrieve and manipulate information to motivate and guide future behaviour,&#xD;
      thereby contributing to diminished motivation and the pleasure experience. It is known that&#xD;
      the recruitment of the prefrontal-striatal system (including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,&#xD;
      cingulate cortex, insula, and ventral striatum) implicates in hedonic processing. It is also&#xD;
      known that the same brain regions can be viewed as core brain regions of the WM network&#xD;
      because they are activated during WM load. The overlap in activation of the&#xD;
      prefrontal-striatal system during hedonic processing and WM provides robust evidence&#xD;
      supporting the relationship between hedonic capacity and WM. Evidence indicated a correlation&#xD;
      between the activity in WM brain networks and the improvement in negative symptoms following&#xD;
      antipsychotic treatment, suggesting a mediating effect of WM on negative symptoms improvement&#xD;
      in the context of a pharmacological intervention. More recently, studies indicated that 20&#xD;
      sessions of WM training (dual n-back task training) showed neural transfer effect to enhance&#xD;
      hedonic processing in individuals with high social anhedonia and ameliorate hedonic&#xD;
      dysfunction in schizophrenia patients with prominent negative symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to WM training, non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is also a&#xD;
      non-pharmacological method to improve brain neural plasticity. For example, repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can change the activity of cortical nerve&#xD;
      temporarily or continuously and enhance neural plasticity. However, the ability of rTMS alone&#xD;
      to improve cognitive function in schizophrenia is frequently limited to some extent,&#xD;
      necessitating a combination with WM training to boost cognitive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), a safe NIBS technique that applies&#xD;
      low-intensity alternating current, is also a potential therapeutic option in treating the&#xD;
      cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. The stimulation frequency of tACS is usually set to&#xD;
      coincide with the targeted brain endogenous rhythms. It would synchronize the neural&#xD;
      oscillations in the stimulated cortical regions to the applied stimulation frequency.&#xD;
      Different tACS current intensity (0.5 to 4 mA), stimulation frequency (0.1 to 80 Hz),&#xD;
      electrode montages, phase difference across the stimulation site, with/without DC offset, and&#xD;
      the states (e.g., at rest or concurrently under the tasks) during stimulation contribute to&#xD;
      its different effects. If both the target electrode and the reference electrode are in the&#xD;
      same phase of the cycle of the current at any given time, the phase difference will be 0&#xD;
      degree (i.e., in-phase). The phase difference will be 180 degrees (i.e., anti-phase) if the&#xD;
      electrodes are in the opposite phase. In-phase and anti-phase tACS over brain regions elicits&#xD;
      synchronization and desynchronization of neuronal activity across the brain regions,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The state-dependent tACS effects indicate that the effects of tACS are enhanced when the&#xD;
      state of the targeted brain regions is active. Specifically, synchronization of&#xD;
      frontoparietal regions at theta frequencies dominates during an executive task. tACS at the&#xD;
      frequency close to the theta oscillation activated by an executive task would elicit more&#xD;
      resonance and may, in turn, help to enhance executive function. tACS applied when an&#xD;
      individual is concurrently engaged in a specific cognitive task is defined as online tACS. In&#xD;
      healthy subjects, online theta (6Hz) in-phase tACS facilitated frontoparietal phase coupling&#xD;
      (synchronization) resulting in improved WM performance, whereas online theta (6Hz) anti-phase&#xD;
      tACS disrupted theta phase-coupling (desynchonization) resulting in impaired WM performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prolonged after-effects of tACS may be related to a phenomenon called&#xD;
      spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), a process that modifies the connection strengths&#xD;
      based on the relative timing of the input and output spikes (or action potentials) of a&#xD;
      neuron. STDP means that synapse will be strengthened if input action potentials occur&#xD;
      immediately before the output action potentials, and synapse will be made weaker if an input&#xD;
      action potentials occur immediately after an output action potentials. The STDP process is&#xD;
      known to explain in part long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) of&#xD;
      nervous systems. To sum up, tACS at a frequency close to that of resonance frequency during&#xD;
      tACS may intensify the synapses across the stimulated regions through the mechanism of STDP.&#xD;
      Repetitive (multiple-session) tACS during specific time intervals may consolidate the&#xD;
      neuroplasticity effects, and may, in turn, elicit a long-lasting effect for further clinical&#xD;
      application in treating neuropsychiatric disorders. In schizophrenia patients, a few case&#xD;
      reports indicated 1-5 sessions of online theta in-phase tACS over left frontoparietal regions&#xD;
      improved the performance of WM and several other cognitive domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, there is no relevant research report exploring whether and how the joint intervention&#xD;
      (i.e., online theta (6Hz) in-phase tACS over the left frontoparietal regions plus WM&#xD;
      training) will have a combined effect on improving the performance of WM and other cognitive&#xD;
      domains in schizophrenic patients. Neither is any research investigating whether online theta&#xD;
      (6Hz) in-phase tACS over the left frontoparietal regions can potentiate the effects of WM&#xD;
      training on improving negative symptoms of schizophrenia. To sum up, we hypothesize that the&#xD;
      combination training mode of active online theta tACS plus WM training would have a greater&#xD;
      ability to reduce negative symptoms of schizophrenia compared to the training mode of sham&#xD;
      online theta tACS plus WM training. The study aims to test the efficacy of &quot;active online&#xD;
      theta tACS plus WM&quot; versus &quot;sham online theta tACS plus WM training&quot; in improving negative&#xD;
      symptoms, WM performance, and other cognitive domains performance of schizophrenia using a&#xD;
      double-blinded, randomized sham-controlled trial design. In order to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      the interventions, we will use behavioral outcomes (e.g., negative symptoms assessment and&#xD;
      neurocognitive assessment) and neurophysiological outcomes (e.g., EEG and heart rate&#xD;
      variability).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual N back training&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a dual n-back task for WM training. In this task, squares at 8 different&#xD;
      locations will show up sequentially (stimulus length, 500 ms; inter-stimulus interval, 2,500&#xD;
      ms) on a computer screen every 3 seconds. Simultaneously with the presentation of the&#xD;
      squares, one of eight consonants will show up sequentially through a speaker. Participants&#xD;
      will have to judge whether the location of a square and the consonant they heard matches the&#xD;
      one n-back before (the same n value for both visual and auditory targets). Each training&#xD;
      session has 20 blocks consisting of 20 + n trials and takes around 25 min. Each block&#xD;
      includes six auditory and six visual targets (four appearing in only one modality, and two&#xD;
      appearing in both modalities simultaneously) whose locations are random. Participants will&#xD;
      have to make responses manually by pressing the mouse left-click button for visual targets&#xD;
      and the right-click button for auditory targets. No responses were required for non-targets.&#xD;
      If a target is correctly detected, a green flash will be given, which constitutes a positive&#xD;
      feedback. If a target is falsely detected, a blue flash will be given, which constitutes a&#xD;
      negative feedback. The dual N back training is designed to continuously vary its difficulty&#xD;
      by modifying the WM load (i.e., the level of n) and thereby track the participants'&#xD;
      performance. Each training session begins at n = 1. Participants' performance will be&#xD;
      analyzed after each block and the level of n for the next block will be adapted according to&#xD;
      the following principle. The level of n increases by 1 in the next block if the mistakes per&#xD;
      modality made by the participant are&lt;3. Conversely, n would decrease by 1 if the mistakes per&#xD;
      modality made by the participant are&gt;5. In all other cases, the n is kept unchanged.&#xD;
      Participants will come to the laboratory and take part in the WM training sessions twice&#xD;
      daily for 5 weekdays (total 10 sessions), with each session lasting for approximately 25&#xD;
      minutes. The time interval between twice-daily sessions will be &gt;3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Online left-hemispheric frontoparietal theta (6Hz) in-phase tACS&#xD;
&#xD;
      θ tACS will be administered during the dual n-back task, starting at the beginning of each&#xD;
      task and lasting for 20 min. In the active θ tACS condition, sinusoidal tACS will be&#xD;
      delivered by two battery-operated devices connected with two 4 × 1 wire adaptors (Equalizer&#xD;
      Box, NeuroConn, Ilmenau, Germany). The electrode montages used for θ tACS will be positioned&#xD;
      at left frontoparietal locations. The stimulation electrodes of the 1st stimulator will be&#xD;
      placed at the International 10-10 electrode position F1, F5, AF3, and FC3 (stimulation&#xD;
      electrodes) and CPz (return electrode) to cover the left frontal cortex. For the 2nd&#xD;
      stimulator, the stimulation electrodes will be placed at P1, P5, CP3, and PO3 (stimulation&#xD;
      electrodes) and FCz (return electrode) to cover the left parietal cortex. A NeuroConn digital&#xD;
      to analog converter (DAQ) will control the two stimulators and create an in-phase&#xD;
      (synchronous) setup (0° relative phase difference between the output signals of the two&#xD;
      tACS-stimulators).&#xD;

The study coordinator had continuous access to the randomization list and unblinded the study after the final visit of the last participant.

The ECG signals were acquired, stored, pre-processed according to the recommended procedures and processed by an HRV analyser (LR8Z11, Yangyin Corp., Taipei, Taiwan). The time domain of HRV is obtained: Standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN). Power spectrum of HRV is quantified into the standard frequency-domain measurements including low-frequency power (LF, 0.04-0.15 Hz), high-frequency power (HF, 0.15-0.40 Hz).</description>

    <description>In a recliner in a dimly lit, electrically shielded room, patients' EEGs were recorded at 4 timepoints (baseline, after 10-session tACS, at 1-week and 1-month follow-ups) by using the Neuro Prax® TMS/tDCS full-band DC-EEG system with 32 EEG Ag/AgCl electrodes in the standard 10-20 International placement. EEG will be collected during resting, eye-opened (5min) and during a dual 2-back task (5min). Signals will be amplified in the dynamic input range of ± 140 mV at a resolution of 0.5 μV by using EEG amplifiers and stored for offline analyses. Eye or muscle artifacts were automatically detected and removed using NeuroPrax's built-in software.</description>

    <description>θ tACS will be administered during the dual n-back task, starting at the beginning of each task and lasting for 20 min. In the active θ tACS condition, sinusoidal tACS will be delivered by two battery-operated devices (Eldith DC stimulator Plus, neuroConn, Ilmenau, Germany) connected with two 4 × 1 wire adaptors (Equalizer Box, NeuroConn, Ilmenau, Germany), via 10 carbon rubber electrodes (1 cm radius, high-definition 4 × 1 rings configuration with a gel layer of 2.0 mm), at 6 Hz frequency, 2 mA current intensity without DC offset, with 100 cycles ramp-up/ramp-down and a 0° relative phase, for 20 min, twice-daily on 5 consecutive weekdays.</description>
