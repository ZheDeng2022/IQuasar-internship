    <textblock>
      The purpose of this MAP Cohort Treatment Plan is to allow access to siponimod for eligible&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis with active disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's Treating Physician should follow the suggested treatment guidelines and comply&#xD;
      with all local health authority regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The requesting Treating Physician should submit a request for access to the drug (often&#xD;
      referred to as Compassionate Use) to Novartis which will be reviewed and assessed by the&#xD;
      medical team experienced with the drug and indication.&#xD;

             diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients with an active or stable but treated chronic disease of the immune&#xD;
