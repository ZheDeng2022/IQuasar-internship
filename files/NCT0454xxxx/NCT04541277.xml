  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well tislelizumab combined with DNA hypomethylation agent +/-&#xD;
      CAG regimen (cytarabine, idarubicin / Aclarithromycin, rhG-CSF/ PEG-rhG-CSF) work in treating&#xD;
      patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or AML patients older than 60 years of&#xD;
      age who are unfit for standard-dose chemotherapy. The expressions of PD-1 and PD-L1 are&#xD;
      increased in AML cells. However, blocking the immune checkpoint alone has limited efficacy as&#xD;
      a single agent in highly proliferative leukemia cells. During the recovery period after&#xD;
      cytotoxic chemotherapy, the activation of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway may be increased and DNA&#xD;
      hypomethylation agents can also up-regulate PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 in AML patients. The&#xD;
      up-regulation and activation of above immune checkpoint molecules are related to chemotherapy&#xD;
      resistance. Therefore, adding chemotherapy and epigenetic regulation agents to Immune&#xD;
      checkpoint blockade therapy may work better through overcoming drug resistance in AML&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
