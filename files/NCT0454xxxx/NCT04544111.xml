        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort A Only: Confirmation in a CLIA certified laboratory that one of the patient's&#xD;
             thyroid tumors (primary tumor, recurrent tumor, or metastases) does not possess a&#xD;
             BRAFV600- mutation (non-V600- BRAF mutations, including BRAF translocations, may be&#xD;
             included in this cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort A Only: Evidence of progressive disease (e.g. presence of new or growing&#xD;
             lesion(s) on radiologic imaging and/or new or worsening tumor-related symptoms) within&#xD;
             14 months of study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort B Only: Confirmation in a CLIA certified laboratory that one of the patient's&#xD;
             thyroid tumors (primary tumor, recurrent tumor, or metastases) possesses a BRAFV600-&#xD;
             mutation (e.g. V600E, V600K, V600D).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort B Only: Patients must have documented progression (evidence of tumor growth or&#xD;
             appearance of new tumor) on prior BRAF directed therapy (e.g. (but not limited to)&#xD;
             vemurafenib, dabrafenib) and must have tolerated this therapy without &gt; Grade 3&#xD;
             toxicity on their most recent evaluation (excluding Grade 4 asymptomatic laboratory&#xD;
             abnormalities).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have pathologically or cytologically confirmed differentiated thyroid&#xD;
             cancer of follicular origin (including papillary thyroid carcinoma, follicular thyroid&#xD;
             carcinoma, hurthle cell carcinomas, poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma and their&#xD;
             respective variants).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have RECIST v1.1 measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recurrent or metastatic disease not amenable to curative surgery or&#xD;
             radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have no recent treatment for thyroid cancer as defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No prior RAI therapy is allowed &lt;6 months prior to initiation of therapy on this&#xD;
                  protocol. A diagnostic study using &lt;10 mCi of RAI is not considered RAI therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No external beam radiation therapy &lt;4weeks prior to initiation of therapy on this&#xD;
                  protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No chemotherapy or targeted therapy (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitor) is allowed&#xD;
                  &lt;4 weeks prior to the initiation of therapy on this protocol (an exception to&#xD;
                  this are patients on dabrafenib who will be enrolling into Cohort B). Dabrafenib&#xD;
                  may be continued prior to and through trial enrollment into the start of the&#xD;
                  study therapy when PDR001 will be added to dabrafenib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  RAI-refractory disease on structural imaging, defined as one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total lifetime dose of radioiodine &gt; 600 mCi&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A tumor that is not radioiodine-avid on a diagnostic radioiodine scan performed&#xD;
                  prior to enrollment in the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A radioiodine-avid metastatic lesion which remained stable in size or progressed&#xD;
                  despite radioiodine treatment 6 months or more prior to study entry in the study.&#xD;
                  There are no size limitations for the index lesions used to satisfy this entry&#xD;
                  criterion&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The presence of at least one fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avid lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to swallow and retain orally-administered pills without any&#xD;
             clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption, such&#xD;
             as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have tissue from the primary tumor or metastases available for&#xD;
             correlative studies. Either a paraffin block or at least 20 unstained slides are&#xD;
             acceptable (30 unstained slides would be ideal). (If less than twenty unstained slides&#xD;
             are available and a paraffin bloc is not available, the patient may be able to&#xD;
             participate at the discretion of the investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must agree to undergo two research biopsies of (a) malignant lesion(s). Tumor&#xD;
             tissue obtained prior to study consent or treatment as part of standard of care can&#xD;
             also be submitted in lieu of performance of the first pre-treatment biopsy if the&#xD;
             Principal Investigator deems it to be of sufficient quantity/quality/timeliness.&#xD;
             Patients may be exempt from biopsy if 1) the investigator or person performing the&#xD;
             biopsy judges that no tumor is accessible for biopsy, 2) the investigator or person&#xD;
             performing the biopsy feels that the biopsy poses too great of a risk to the patient,&#xD;
             or 3) the patient cannot be safely removed from anti-coagulation therapy (if the&#xD;
             anti-coagulation therapy needs to be temporarily held for the biopsy procedure). If&#xD;
             the only tumor accessible for biopsy is also the only lesion that can be used for&#xD;
             RECIST v1.1 response evaluation, then the patient may be exempt from biopsy. If the&#xD;
             investigator deems a second research biopsy to be high risk after a patient has&#xD;
             completed the first research biopsy, the patient may be exempt from the second biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening laboratory values must meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  WBC ≥ 2000/µl&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 40 mL/min (if using&#xD;
                  the Cockcroft-Gault formula below):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female CrCl = (140 - age in years) x weight in kg x 0.85/72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male CrCl = (140 - age in years) x weight in kg x 1.00/72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ institutional lower limit of normal by&#xD;

             highly effective methods of contraception during dosing and for 150-days after&#xD;
             stopping treatment with PDR001. Highly effective contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the patient). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before&#xD;
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). The vasectomized male&#xD;
                  partner should be the sole partner for that patient&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement&#xD;
                  of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of&#xD;
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for&#xD;
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception. NOTE: In case&#xD;
                  of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a&#xD;
                  minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they&#xD;
                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate&#xD;
                  clinical profile (i.e. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have&#xD;
                  had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total&#xD;
                  hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of&#xD;
                  oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been&#xD;
                  confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child&#xD;
                  bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while on treatment&#xD;
             and for 150 days after stopping treatment with PDR001 and should not father a child in&#xD;
             this period. A condom is required to be used by vasectomized men as well during&#xD;
             intercourse to prevent delivery of the drug via semen.&#xD;
