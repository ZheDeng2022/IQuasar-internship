  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the management of acute myocardial infarction treated with primary angioplasty, despite&#xD;
      effective epicardial clearance obtained in 95% of cases, microvascular obstruction (MVO) in&#xD;
      the damaged territory concerns 50% of patients. The Index of Microvascular Resistance (IMR)&#xD;
      allows early assessment of the microcirculatory state during the angioplasty procedure. A&#xD;
      value of IMR&gt;40 indicates MVO and is correlated with morbi-mortality. A new method for&#xD;
      immediate evaluation of MVO using thermodilution with a new Rayflow® microcatheter has been&#xD;
      described: it no longer allows the estimation but the measurements of absolute coronary&#xD;
      resistance and coronary flow. We hypothesize that these measurements allows a better&#xD;
      evaluation of the microcirculatory state after primary angioplasty, comparing to IMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to study the diagnostic performance of Rayflow® to predict MVO - no&#xD;
      reflow (NR) - in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) patients in order to determine an&#xD;
      absolute coronary resistance threshold by thermodilution for early diagnosis of MVO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main secondary objectives will be to compare the different microcirculatory assessment&#xD;
      parameters with each other, not indexed and indexed to the myocardial mass at risk (coronary&#xD;
      resistance, IMR, CFR, Resistance Reserve Ratio) and to establish a link between high&#xD;
      resistance or IMR and the occurrence of rhythm disorders at D1, D2 and D3.&#xD;

      All patients presenting for STEMI by occlusion of a proximal coronary artery, vascularizing a&#xD;
      large volume of myocardium corresponding to an APPROACH score&gt; 21, in the first 12 hours&#xD;
      following the onset of chest pain, will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data relating to medical history, lifestyle (sedentary lifestyle, smoking, drug use),&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of acute coronary syndrome will be carried out in accordance with the European&#xD;
      Society of Cardiology guidelines of 2015. An emergency coronary angiography will be used to&#xD;
      revascularise the patient as indicated. Thromboaspiration, stenting, antithrombotic agents&#xD;
      and other treatments will be administered according to angiographic and clinical criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FFR guide (PressureWire® Certus® from St Jude Medical Abbott) will be used to make&#xD;
      pressure and temperature measurements. It has been used in daily practice since the FAME&#xD;
      study in 2011 to guide the therapeutic decision in patients with an intermediate lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An injected cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be performed between 48 hours and 7&#xD;
      days following the infarction in accordance with current practices.The initial trans-thoracic&#xD;
      ultrasonography as well as the various blood samplings will be performed according to&#xD;
      standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Rayflow® microcatheter will be used to allow the optimal delivery of physiological saline&#xD;
      solution into the studied artery. It will be mounted on the FFR guide already in place as&#xD;
      part of the angioplasty procedure. Bayer's Medrad® Mark 7 Arterion® infuser will be used to&#xD;
      deliver saline continuously at a flow rate of 15-20 mL/min through the Rayflow® microcatheter&#xD;
