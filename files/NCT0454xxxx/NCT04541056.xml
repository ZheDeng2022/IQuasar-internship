  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at risk for developing&#xD;
      neurocognitive sequelae. Multiple meta-analyses demonstrate significant deficits in overall&#xD;
      intellectual abilities, academic functioning and specific cognitive skills among children&#xD;
      with ALL treated with intrathecal chemotherapy only and/or cranial irradiation. Preventing&#xD;
      neurocognitive deficits is therefore of great importance. Unfortunately, intervention studies&#xD;
      for this group of survivors are scarce. The main aim of this randomized controlled trial is&#xD;
      to determine the efficacy of Goal Management Training (GMT) as a group-based treatment&#xD;
      program for 80 adult survivors of childhood ALL, diagnosed between 1980 and 2015 at an age of&#xD;
      17 years and below, with attention and executive function deficits, employing one treatment&#xD;
      group (GMT), and one waitlist condition followed by one active control intervention, the&#xD;
      &quot;Brain health workshop&quot; (BHW), which has a psycho-educative approach. The follow-up time from&#xD;
      diagnosis will be ≥5 years and the age at survey 18-40 years. The study will expand the&#xD;
      knowledge base on treatment factors important in improving cognitive function. An additional&#xD;
      aim is to investigate comorbidities and the natural trajectories of the symptoms in&#xD;
      participants with or without specific cognitive difficulties at five years follow-up. Results&#xD;
      from this study can be implemented in rehabilitation for the young adult survivors of ALL,&#xD;
      which will be of importance for their future educational and work-related functioning.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effect of the GMT/waitlist conditions will be assessed through self-reported and objective&#xD;
      measures of neuropsychological function, quality of life and mental health. To avoid extra&#xD;
      training effects of neuropsychological testing on participants allocated to waitlist/BHW,&#xD;
      assessment following BHW (approximately one-year post T1) will consist of self-report&#xD;
      measures only. Patients in all groups will be reassessed within 14 days post intervention&#xD;
      (T2), and at 6 months post intervention (T3) and further five years after the preassessment&#xD;
      (T4). The participants at T1 not showing the specific cognitive difficulties will also be&#xD;
      included at T4.&#xD;

    <measure>The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Adult (BRIEF-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BRIEF-A self-report questionnaire consists of 75 items on which the patient's symptoms are rated on a 3-point Likert scale. The questionnaire provides a Global Executive Composite (GEC) score (range 75-225) and two index scores: the Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI) (range 30-90) and the Metacognitive Index (MI) (range 40-120). Nine subscales are also provided: Inhibit (range 8-24), Shift (range 6-18), Emotional control (range 10-30), Self-monitor (range 6-18), Initiate (range 8-24), Working memory (range 8-24), Plan/organize (range 10-30), Task monitor (range 6-18) and Organization of materials (range 8-24). Higher scores indicate more executive difficulties. Raw scores are transformed into t scores (M=50, SD=10).</description>

    <description>The CPT 3 is a measure of inattention, impulsivity, sustained attention and vigilance. The test is computer based and lasts approximately 14 minutes. The participant is instructed to press the space bar/computer mouse when letters appear, but not when Xs appear on the screen. Higher scores reflect worse performance, and raw scores are converted to T-scores (M=50, SD=10). However, scores will be recoded so that higher scores equal better performance/lower scores equal worse performance.</description>

The General Perceived Self-Efficacy Scale (GPSS) is a 10-item psychometric scale assessing the strength of an individual's beliefs in his/her ability to respond to controlled environmental demands and challenges. Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale (1=not at all true to 4=exactly true). There is no cut-off score on this scale. However, the weighted variance equaled 25.91. Thus, a raw score of 24 is 1 SD below the weighted mean using T-norms from the German version.</description>

The higher the score on RSA scale, the more protective factors an individual is assumed to have, e.g., better psychological health, and thus, the individual seems to cope better with adverse life events. RSA consists of six factors divided into 1) intrapersonal resources (&quot;Perception of self&quot;, &quot;Planned future&quot;, &quot;Social competence&quot; and &quot;Structured style&quot;), and 2) interpersonal resources (&quot;Family cohesion&quot; and &quot;Social resources&quot;).</description>

    <description>The ISI is a 7-item questionnaire is assessing the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia over the past month. A 5-point Likert scale (0 = none; 4 = very severe) is used to rate each item, with total scores ranging from 0-28 (Total score categories; 0-7; No clinical significant insomnia, 8-14: Subthreshold insomnia, 15-21: Clinical insomnia (moderate severity), 22-28 = Clinical insomnia (severe). We will use the ISI total score ≥15 as a clinical cut-off.</description>

    <measure>PROMIS Pain Interference (PPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PPI is part of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and includes 8 items. Pain interference refers to the degree to which pain limits or interferes with the persons physical, mental, and social activities. Items range from 1 &quot;not at all&quot; to 5 &quot;very much&quot;. An additional item asks the participant to rate average pain intensity for the last 7 days on another scale ranging from 1 &quot;no pain&quot; to 10 &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI consists of questions related to pain intensity and pain interference on function. Responses for each item ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine). Pain severity score (sum score of intensity items 1 to 4) and interference score (sum score of interference items 5 to 10) are reported. In addition, one item measure the localization of the most intense pain.</description>

    <measure>Semi-structured interview</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The interview includes 32 items. Participants are asked about basic demographic information (e.g. years of education, occupation, living situation), medical conditions/ injuries (e.g. Have you ever been diagnosed with ADHD?), treatment/rehabilitation (e.g. Have you received cognitive rehabilitation?) and adverse life events (e.g. Have you lost a close family-member within the last 12 months?). In addition, participants are asked to describe challenges in their everyday life (e.g. Please tell me about challenges in your everyday life when it comes to achieving your goals, Do you easily get distracted from what you are doing?).</description>

    <description>GMT will be administrated in a group-based format over 6 sessions (minimum two weeks between each session). Homework assignments between sessions are included. Following the fourth session, text messages reading &quot;Stop!&quot; (a key instruction in GMT) will be sent to all GMT participants every day to maximize adherence to training (28 per participant). Homework assignment will also include the logging of automatic thoughts and an examination of the relationship between situations, thoughts, and accompanying emotions.</description>

    <description>The manual comprises an introduction to GMT for the survivors of ALL, and a detailed session structure incorporating cognitive and behavioral tasks. The GMT program involves teaching the participants about goals, attention slips and how to manage these, how to review and prioritize goals (e.g., Stop, Think, Organize, Plan), and how to keep goals in mind (e.g., using analogies such as the mental blackboard). Each session will follow the same general format; namely, facility-delivered presentations, flipchart discussions, group activities and homework.</description>

    <description>BHW is a psycho-educative control condition, and is typically part of psycho-educative Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) rehabilitation programs, but adjusted for the ALL group of participants. The psycho-educative control condition BHW will be matched GMT for amount of training and therapist contact. Homework assignment and in-session tasks included readings, brain games, puzzles, and practical exercises such as logging sleep.</description>
