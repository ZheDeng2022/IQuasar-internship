  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at risk for developing&#xD;
      neurocognitive sequelae. Multiple meta-analyses demonstrate significant deficits in overall&#xD;
      intellectual abilities, academic functioning and specific cognitive skills among children&#xD;
      with ALL treated with intrathecal chemotherapy only and/or cranial irradiation. Preventing&#xD;
      neurocognitive deficits is therefore of great importance. Unfortunately, intervention studies&#xD;
      for this group of survivors are scarce. The main aim of this randomized controlled trial is&#xD;
      to determine the efficacy of Goal Management Training (GMT) as a group-based treatment&#xD;
      program for 80 adult survivors of childhood ALL, diagnosed between 1980 and 2015 at an age of&#xD;
      17 years and below, with attention and executive function deficits, employing one treatment&#xD;
      group (GMT), and one waitlist condition followed by one active control intervention, the&#xD;
      &quot;Brain health workshop&quot; (BHW), which has a psycho-educative approach. The follow-up time from&#xD;
      diagnosis will be â‰¥5 years and the age at survey 18-40 years. The study will expand the&#xD;
      knowledge base on treatment factors important in improving cognitive function. An additional&#xD;
      aim is to investigate comorbidities and the natural trajectories of the symptoms in&#xD;
      participants with or without specific cognitive difficulties at five years follow-up. Results&#xD;
      from this study can be implemented in rehabilitation for the young adult survivors of ALL,&#xD;
      which will be of importance for their future educational and work-related functioning.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effect of the GMT/waitlist conditions will be assessed through self-reported and objective&#xD;
      measures of neuropsychological function, quality of life and mental health. To avoid extra&#xD;
      training effects of neuropsychological testing on participants allocated to waitlist/BHW,&#xD;
      assessment following BHW (approximately one-year post T1) will consist of self-report&#xD;
      measures only. Patients in all groups will be reassessed within 14 days post intervention&#xD;
      (T2), and at 6 months post intervention (T3) and further five years after the preassessment&#xD;
      (T4). The participants at T1 not showing the specific cognitive difficulties will also be&#xD;
      included at T4.&#xD;

    <description>The ISI is a 7-item questionnaire is assessing the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia over the past month. A 5-point Likert scale (0 = none; 4 = very severe) is used to rate each item, with total scores ranging from 0-28 (Total score categories; 0-7; No clinical significant insomnia, 8-14: Subthreshold insomnia, 15-21: Clinical insomnia (moderate severity), 22-28 = Clinical insomnia (severe). We will use the ISI total score â‰¥15 as a clinical cut-off.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PPI is part of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and includes 8 items. Pain interference refers to the degree to which pain limits or interferes with the persons physical, mental, and social activities. Items range from 1 &quot;not at all&quot; to 5 &quot;very much&quot;. An additional item asks the participant to rate average pain intensity for the last 7 days on another scale ranging from 1 &quot;no pain&quot; to 10 &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;.</description>
