    <textblock>
      To determine amongst spouses of colorectal cancer patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening rates for Colorectal Cancer (CRC) amongst spouses of patients with CRC&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Barriers to screening based on the Health Belief Model (HBM)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mediators to behaviour change using the transtheoretical model of behavioural change&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If tailored interventions addressing education, convenience and cost would improve&#xD;
           screening rates amongst the spouses&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Stage 1: Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, the spouse would be asked to fill in the baseline&#xD;
      demographic form. After that, they will be asked if they have undergone any prior screening&#xD;
      as recommended by the MOH screening guidelines as stipulated earlier. Following that, a&#xD;
      quantitative questionnaire utilizing the validated Health Belief Model would be administered&#xD;
      to study the potential barriers to screening which may be faced by the spouses. This&#xD;
      questionnaire is based on the 5 domains of the Health Belief Model which include perceived&#xD;
      susceptibility to acquiring CRC, perceived severity of the disease, perceived benefit of&#xD;
      going for screening, perceived barriers to action and cues to action. The response options&#xD;
      for questions on these domains are categorized into &quot;disagree&quot;, &quot;agree&quot; and &quot;unsure&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second questionnaire based on the transtheoretical model would then be implemented next. We&#xD;
      would determine their stage in the transtheoretical model based on their responses. The basic&#xD;
      questionnaire was based on previous published data. This questionnaire will take&#xD;
      approximately 5 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Faecal Occult Blood Test or Colonoscopy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Never heard: Has not heard of FOBT or colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precontemplation: Never had an FOBT or last FOBT was more than a year ago or last colonoscopy&#xD;
      was more than 10 years ago and not thinking about having an FOBT or colonoscopy in the next 2&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contemplation: Never had an FOBT or last FOBT was more than a year ago or last colonoscopy&#xD;
      was more than 10 years ago but thinking about having an FOBT or colonoscopy in the next 2&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Action: FOBT was within the last year or colonoscopy was within the last year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance: Has undergone two or more FOBTs in the past 2 years or has undergone at least&#xD;
      two or more colonoscopies and would continue to do so in concordance with the schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same questionnaire would be repeated in 3 months and 6-12 months following the initial&#xD;
      interview, with at least 3 months between each follow-up. This is in sync with the&#xD;
      appointments that the patients themselves would be attending as part of their surveillance&#xD;
      for their CRC. This is to document the changes in their responses to the various domains as&#xD;
      the impact of the patients' cancers is less felt with time. The responses would guide the&#xD;
      research team to determine if the peri-operative period remains the best time to advise the&#xD;
      spouses to undergo screening or if we should delay it to a more appropriate and hence&#xD;
      receptive period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: Randomization into Intervention versus Control&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have underwent previous FIT test would be excluded from this part of the&#xD;
      study and will proceed directly to stage 3 after completing the two questionnaires (stage 1).&#xD;
      This goes the same for patient who opt out from stage 2 RCT will also proceed directly to&#xD;
      stage 3. The eligible participants will be randomized into either &quot;Intervention&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;Control&quot;. A randomisation list is generated using a computer procedure using block&#xD;
      randomization. Based on the randomisation list, the assigned group for each study&#xD;
      participants ID are written in a sealed opaque envelope. The envelope will be open at the&#xD;
      point of randomisation to find out which group participant is randomised to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Intervention&quot; arm is aimed at specifically addressing gaps in terms of knowledge of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer and the importance of screening, as well as targeting cost as well as&#xD;
      convenience issues. Spouses who have been randomized into this arm will undergo a session&#xD;
      with a trained research assistant who will highlight the following points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is colorectal cancer and what are its risk factors?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the spouse possibly at risk of developing colorectal cancer?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How screening can help to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What are the screening modalities for CRC?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. What are FIT kits?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. How to use FIT kits?&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Where to return the FIT kits once they have been used?&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants who have undergone the counseling session will then be given 2 x FIT kits&#xD;
      (as recommended in the guidelines) free of charge, and also advised to mail the FIT kits back&#xD;
      to the colorectal clinic in a pre-paid envelope once it has been used. By performing the&#xD;
      above targeted interventions, we would have tackled issues relating to education, cost and&#xD;
      convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Control&quot; arm is the current practice in the community where these participants would be&#xD;
      informed that the FIT kits can be obtained from the Singapore Cancer Society (SCS) free of&#xD;
      charge if they fulfil the screening criteria as stipulated in the MOH guidelines. The&#xD;
      participants will be advised on the various locations to collect these FIT kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endpoint for the &quot;intervention&quot; and the &quot;control&quot; arms is whether the spouses returned&#xD;
      the FIT kits within 3 months from date of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3: Colonoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be offered colonoscopy. Regardless of whether they have returned the&#xD;
      FIT kits after 3 months, we would ask the spouses if they would be keen to undergo the&#xD;
      colonoscopy if it is to be arranged by the research team to be conducted at their convenience&#xD;
      and to have the cost of the colonoscopy covered. If not, the underlying barriers would be&#xD;
      uncovered. Colonoscopy cost for all study participants from this study will be covered by a&#xD;
      research grant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the spouses agree to undergo the colonoscopy, the research team would proceed with the&#xD;
      arrangement to get the colonoscopy arranged. Spouses will attend a consult visit with&#xD;
      specialist doctor prior to colonoscopy where they receive details about the procedure, risk&#xD;
      and benefits, bowel preparation, undergo financial counselling for colonoscopy etc. as per&#xD;
      standard clinical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings of the colonoscopy would be documented. In those who did not have their FOBT&#xD;
      done earlier and now willing to undergo colonoscopy, we will also get them to undergo the 2&#xD;
      FIT kits before the colonoscopy. This is to compare the findings of the FOBT to the&#xD;
      colonoscopy subsequently.&#xD;
