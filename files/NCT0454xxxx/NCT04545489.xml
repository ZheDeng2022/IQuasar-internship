  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The VA is the largest single provider of HIV care in the US and Veterans with HIV use&#xD;
      significantly more healthcare services and have a 1.5-2x higher risk of atherosclerotic&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) compared to uninfected Veterans. The goal is to improve BP&#xD;
      treatment for Veterans with HIV to reduce ASCVD risk. Within a RCT, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the VA adapted nurse-led intervention will result in a clinically&#xD;
      significant 6mmHg reduction in SBP over 12 months compared to those receiving enhanced&#xD;
      education only. The study is innovative because of the use of stakeholder-engaged design&#xD;
      process, multi-component nurse-led intervention, and VA Video Connect (VVC) to monitor CVD&#xD;
      risk factors. The project meets VA strategic priorities including: 1) greater choice for&#xD;
      Veterans; 2) improve timeliness of services; 3) focus more resources more efficiently&#xD;
      (strengthen foundational services in VA). If shown to be effective, this intervention will&#xD;
      have substantial impact among high-risk Veterans, potentially reducing ASCVD events by more&#xD;
      than a quarter.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: The VA is the largest provider of HIV care in the United States. The ~31,000&#xD;
      Veterans with HIV use significantly more healthcare and have up to 2x higher risk of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) compared to uninfected Veterans. The HIV&#xD;
      treatment cascade model includes care steps; once people obtain remission, providers should&#xD;
      focus on preventing ASCVD. The investigators will extend the HIV treatment cascade and focus&#xD;
      on reducing ASCVD risk among people with HIV. Veterans with HIV have low perceived risk for&#xD;
      ASCVD and uptake of guideline-based treatment for BP is low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance/Impact: The proposed intervention has the potential to reduce ASCVD events in&#xD;
      this population by more than a quarter and meet VA strategic priorities of: 1) improve&#xD;
      timeliness of services; 2) focus resources more efficiently as well as address HSR&amp;D research&#xD;
      priorities: 1) patient centered care, care management, and health promotion; 2) healthcare&#xD;
      access; 3) aging; 4) virtual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation: The study is innovative: Cascade Model. By leveraging the HIV treatment cascade&#xD;
      model, the investigators will create a pathway for ASCVD risk reduction to be added into&#xD;
      widespread quality improvement initiatives. Stakeholder-engaged design process. The&#xD;
      investigators will employ stakeholder-engaged research methods to ensure the intervention&#xD;
      meets the needs of patients and healthcare providers. Multi-component nurse-led intervention.&#xD;
      While each of the components of the intervention have an evidence base, they have not been&#xD;
      tested together in an HIV context. Telehealth. The investigators will use VA Video Connect&#xD;
      (VVC) to monitor CVD risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: Aim 1a: Conduct qualitative interviews with Veterans and healthcare providers&#xD;
      to ascertain perceptions regarding HIV and CVD risk reductions to inform intervention&#xD;
      adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1b: Adapt the intervention to the VA HIV clinic context with key stakeholder input.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate the 12-month efficacy of a nurse intervention to improve systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure in Veterans with HIV. Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that the&#xD;
      intervention will result in a clinically significant 6mmHg reduction in SBP over 12 months&#xD;
      compared to those receiving [enhanced education + usual care] only. Aim 3: Conduct an&#xD;
      evaluation of the prevention nurse intervention. Exploratory aim: If effective, [the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a budget impact analysis] and simulate 10-year cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      of the nurse intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The investigators will conduct qualitative interviews with care team and&#xD;
      Veterans to adapt the intervention in an iterative design process. The investigators will&#xD;
      then conduct a RCT to evaluate an intervention to reduce ASCVD risk. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in 3 clinics among HIV+ Veterans (n=300) on suppressive ART with confirmed SBP &gt;140&#xD;
      mmHg, stratified by clinic site and randomized 1:1 to intervention vs. education control. The&#xD;
      intervention will involve 4 evidence-based components based on the investigators' prior&#xD;
      studies and adapted to Veterans with HIV: (1) nurse-led care coordination, (2) nurse-managed&#xD;
      medication and adherence support (3) home BP monitoring, and (4) administered VA Video&#xD;
      Connect (VVC). The education control will receive enhanced education and usual care. Primary&#xD;
      outcome: difference in 12-month systolic BP in the intervention arm vs control. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome: 12-month difference in non-HDL cholesterol. The investigators will use a&#xD;
      mixed-methods design to evaluate fidelity, dose delivered/received, reach, recruitment, and&#xD;
      context of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation/Next Steps: The investigators designed the intervention with downstream&#xD;
      implementation in view. This includes: a fully remote delivery of the intervention to&#xD;
      facilitate access and widespread implementation, and guidance for selection of nurses with&#xD;
      education / experience levels that match those of health coaches delivering interventions&#xD;
      within the VA. The investigators will work with operational partners from the Office of&#xD;
      Connected Care and Office of HIV/AIDS care regarding implementation plans. The investigators&#xD;
      will disseminate a clinical program, including scripts, and description of all intervention&#xD;
      processes, to facilitate implementation within the VA.&#xD;
