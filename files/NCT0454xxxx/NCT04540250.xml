      This study included rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving Methotrexate as monotherapy. All&#xD;
      eligible patients were subjected to thorough clinical examination and full history to&#xD;
      identify oral events. Drug history, current dose and duration of MTX were recorded.&#xD;

      The current study was conducted in the Clinics of Oral Medicine, Faculty of Dentistry and&#xD;
      Rheumatology, Faculty of Medicine - Cairo University from 2017 to 2019. This study followed&#xD;
      the principles of the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the Research ethics committee&#xD;
      of Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RA patients receiving MTX as monotherapy were included in the study. Patients suffering from&#xD;
      systemic disease known to cause oral manifestations; salivary gland diseases and malignancies&#xD;
      were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients were subjected to thorough clinical examination for the whole oral&#xD;
      cavity. Medical history and history of any oral manifestation were recorded. Drug history,&#xD;
      dose, and duration of MTX were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical data was presented as frequencies and percentages. Continuous data was described&#xD;
      as means and standard deviations. Means were compared by one-way ANNOVA and Student-t-test.&#xD;
      The significance level was set at P ≤0.05. Statistical analysis was performed with IBM® SPSS®&#xD;
      Statistics Version 25 for Windows.&#xD;
