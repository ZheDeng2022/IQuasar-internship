      The purpose of this study is to attempt to eliminate the necessity of immunosuppressive&#xD;
      therapy for HLA-identical sibling Kidney Transplants, examine cellular chimerism of donor&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell (DHSC) lineages for pairs to demonstrate immunologic&#xD;
      unresponsiveness, and to investigate the safety and efficacy of the treatment regimen&#xD;
      including withdrawal of immunosuppression after one year post-transplant for those recipients&#xD;
      having received DHSC infusions.&#xD;

      Primary Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To remove all immunosuppressive therapy from recipients of HLA-identical sibling renal&#xD;
           transplants within 24 months of transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To detect and follow cellular (macro) chimerism of donor hematopoietic stem cell (DHSC)&#xD;
           lineages and the generation of T-regulatory cells using specialized immunomonitoring&#xD;
           assays for these donor/recipient pairs to demonstrate specific immunologic&#xD;
           unresponsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate the safety and efficacy of a treatment regimen consisting of induction&#xD;
           therapy with Campath-1H and steroid-free low dose maintenance immunosuppression,&#xD;
           consisting of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and tacrolimus converted to sirolimus. This is&#xD;
           to be followed by complete withdrawal of immunosuppression beginning at one year, at a&#xD;
           minimum, post transplant, in recipients who have also been given four infusions of&#xD;
           purified donor hematopoietic Cluster of Differentiation (CD)34+ stem cells (DHSC).&#xD;
