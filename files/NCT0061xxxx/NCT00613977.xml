      The investigators wish to compare the difference in both cost and time to result for&#xD;
      determining fetal lung maturity for the Lamellar Body Count method and the Fetal Lung&#xD;
      Maturity II. Our hypothesis is that the time to result will be significantly less using the&#xD;
      Lamellar Body Count method, and the cost associated with this method over the traditional FLM&#xD;
      II will be favorable.&#xD;

      Rationale/Background: This pilot study is a prospective cohort analysis of two methods&#xD;
      currently available at our institution for the determination of fetal lung maturity (FLM)&#xD;
      using amniotic fluid. The investigators wish to explore a cost and time savings potential&#xD;
      between these two available tests. The test most utilized for the determination of FLM is the&#xD;
      evaluation of phospholipids from the amniotic fluid. In our particular institution, the&#xD;
      relationship of surfactant to albumin (S/A ratio) is analyzed using a measured fluorescent&#xD;
      polarization called the FLM II procedure performed on the TDx or TDxFLx chemical analyzer&#xD;
      which is commercially available from Abbott Labs. This test is time-consuming and not&#xD;
      available at all institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lamellar bodies are lamellated phospholipids that represent a storage form of surfactant (1).&#xD;
      Because lamellar body diameter (range, 1-5 Âµm) is similar to that of small platelets,&#xD;
      lamellar body counts (LBCs) can be obtained rapidly with use of the platelet channel of a&#xD;
      hematology analyzer. The investigators wish to compare the difference in both cost and time&#xD;
      to result for determining FLM for the LBC method and the FLM II. Our hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      time to result will be significantly less using the LBC method, and the cost associated with&#xD;
      this method over the traditional FLM II will be favorable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extensive research has shown the efficacy of analyzing fetal lung maturity using lamellar&#xD;
      bodies (2-11). Since the efficacy of this method has been established, the adequacy of the&#xD;
      lamellar body count in comparison to the FLM II is not in question in this study. While other&#xD;
      studies have speculated that a cost and time savings would exist, no literature was found to&#xD;
      answer this precise question. The authors feel this information could benefit the medical&#xD;
      community from an economic standpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amniotic fluid collected at the time of amniotomy on term cesarean sections will be sent to&#xD;
      OSUMC laboratory for FLM analysis using both a LBC and the FLM II. Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      both the time to result and cost using the LBC method will be substantially less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Mechanism of Testing At present, FLM testing at Oklahoma State University Medical&#xD;
      Center (OSUMC) is performed by TDx-FLM chemical analyzer manufactured by Abbott Labs. Most&#xD;
      laboratories using the Abbott FLM-II assay for assessing fetal lung maturity follow the&#xD;
      manufacturer's recommendations for interpreting the surfactant to albumin ratio. Thus, values&#xD;
      greater than 55 mg/g are considered mature and values less than 40 mg/g immature. McElrath et&#xD;
      al., reported a probability of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) of 15% or less can be&#xD;
      achieved with a S/A ratio cutoff of 60 mg or more at 28 weeks of gestation, 50 or more at 30&#xD;
      weeks, 40 or more at 33 weeks, 30 or more at 35 weeks, and 20 or more at 37 weeks (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lamellar bodies have been tested on many hospital instruments that are used for the&#xD;
      hematology testing at their institutions. The ADVIA 2120 (Siemens Medical Solutions&#xD;
      Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY), which is a flow cytometry system that functions to identify and&#xD;
      count specific cells in body fluid, is used in the OSUMC laboratory for hematology and other&#xD;
      body fluids. Although it has not been used for LBC in our institution, it certainly has that&#xD;
      capability according to the manufacturer (13). Neerhof et. al, recently described a change in&#xD;
      the threshold at their particular institution. The level of maturity was increased from&#xD;
      30,000 to 50,000 LB/ul. This resulted in significantly fewer neonatal intensive care unit&#xD;
      admissions for RDS (14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An algorithm to FLM testing first utilizing the LBC has been published by Ventolini et al.&#xD;
      This algorithm is pictured in Figure 1 (15). We will incorporate this algorithm into our cost&#xD;
      analysis as indeterminate LBC values would have required the FLM II procedure, thus elevating&#xD;
      the cost for that patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amniotic fluid will be obtained by the operating surgeon or assistant once amniotomy is made.&#xD;
      At least 2 ml of amniotic fluid is required for both tests. The fluid will them be handed off&#xD;
      to waiting nursing personnel. Once the amniotic fluid is obtained, LBC and S/A ratios will be&#xD;
      sent to the laboratory as a stat order. Laboratory personnel will record the time that the&#xD;
      specimen is checked into lab and the time the result is available, which is their standard&#xD;
      protocol. These times will be used to calculate the time differences between LBC and S/A&#xD;
      ratios. The patient will be identified by their assigned medical record number in the&#xD;
      hospital. Details of the LBC protocol using the ADVIA 2120 can be found in Table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will record results of both studies. When an indeterminate level is obtained using the&#xD;
      lamellar body count, a cost for performing the FLM II procedure will be added to the lamellar&#xD;
      body count cost for that particular patient. The amount that would have been charged to the&#xD;
      patient will be used to calculate the cost savings in our sample size. We will then compare&#xD;
      the cost of the LBC, LBC and TDxFLM (if required by our algorithm), and the TDxFLM alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include ten term gestations scheduled for either repeat cesarean&#xD;
      section (C/S) or primary C/S for malpresentation. Term will be defined as 37 completed weeks&#xD;
      based on a sure last menstrual period or first trimester ultrasound crown rump length&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent will be obtained either in the resident clinic or on the morning of the scheduled&#xD;
      procedure. The resident investigator or one of the obstetrical residents at OSUMC will&#xD;
      consent the patient.. The residents participating in consenting will be given instructions&#xD;
      regarding the consent process as well as inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cost for both laboratory tests will be approximately $45 per patient. The sample size&#xD;
      will be limited by a research grant of $500.00 provided by the Osteopathic Founders&#xD;
      Foundation. Other funding is in application and expansion of this project will be likely in&#xD;
      the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Term intrauterine gestations beyond 37 completed weeks with dating calculated by their&#xD;
           sure last menstrual period (LMP) using Negel's rule or utilizing a first trimester crown&#xD;
           rump length ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women with a previous C/S scheduled for repeat C/S.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are undergoing a scheduled C-Section for malpresentation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of gross blood in amniotic sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hematocrit count greater than 1% on ADVIA 2120&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of meconium in sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with oligohydramnios defined as an amniotic fluid index of less than 5 cm or&#xD;
           polyhydramnios defined as an amniotic fluid index of more than 24 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early Termination Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If for any reason the investigators or the obstetrician performing the C/S believe the&#xD;
      patient or fetus may be harmed by the extra time required for amniotic fluid collection&#xD;
      (albeit short), the patient may be removed from the study without her consent. The volunteer&#xD;
      would also have the right to terminate her participation in the study and to terminate the&#xD;
      investigators' rights to use the collected fluid or analyzed result at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection Sheet Appendix C &quot;Lamellar Body Data Collection Sheet&quot; will be used for the&#xD;
      collection and storage of data. All information will be de-identified for the collection,&#xD;
      storage and retrieval of information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Only the principle investigator(s) will have access to the patients' data&#xD;
      collection sheet. Individual physicians involved in the care of a specific patient will have&#xD;
      access to that patient's information. All individuals will be in compliance with HIPPA&#xD;
      guidelines as set forth by the university and the medical center. Treatment decisions will&#xD;
      not be based on the results of data collected for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be obtained from the patients chart for entry on the data&#xD;
      collection sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Maternal age&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gravity/Parity&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Estimated Gestational Age and how that was figured&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Maternal complications - diabetes, hypertension, PIH, coronary vascular disease, thyroid&#xD;
           disease, thrombophilia,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Date collected&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Time collected&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Time received&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Time reported - FLM, LB&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Difference in total times&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. FLM result - mature, intermediate or immature&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. LB result - mature, intermediate or immature&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Cost for FLM&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Cost for LB No other data will be collected from any patient charts. The resident&#xD;
           investigator will assist in the collection of data and will have qualifications for&#xD;
           basic human research and HIPPA training as they fall under the OSU - CHS community of&#xD;
           individuals with this privilege. Further, physicians and residents which have direct&#xD;
           access to current patients chart in their medical management will determine needs for&#xD;
           fluid collections and assist in patient consents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: An algebraic expression will be used to determine which procedure is the most time&#xD;
      and cost effective. Let P be the proportion of LBC's that have conclusive results. Let X&#xD;
      denote an attribute of LBC (say cost or time) and let Y denote the same attribute for FLM II.&#xD;
      The following equation asks the question &quot;when are the costs associated with just performing&#xD;
      FLM II greater than the costs associated with LBC with the FLM II backup?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost (or time) of LBC with FLM II back up &lt; Cost (or time) of FLM II&#xD;
&#xD;
      when&#xD;
&#xD;
      X &lt; P*Y&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other words: Using LBC is beneficial when the proportion of conclusive results is greater&#xD;
      than the proportion of cost of LBC over FLM II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality: All records and lab results will be maintained at Oklahoma State University&#xD;
      Medical Center, department of medical records and laboratory storage on the hospital's&#xD;
      Meditech system. Research analysis data collection sheets will be de-identified and will be&#xD;
      maintained by the Department of Ob/Gyn in a secured location at 717 South Houston Ave, Tulsa&#xD;
      OK 74127.&#xD;
