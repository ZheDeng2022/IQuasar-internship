      Purpose: The associations between pain, stress, bloating, and their short interval temporal&#xD;
      relationships to defecation in IBS D, C &amp; M are of great interest to the field of functional&#xD;
      GI disorders, but have not been adequately studied. Broad recall based assessments (i.e.,over&#xD;
      past week or month) of pain and bloating have been key features of the diagnosis of IBS,&#xD;
      however such long term retrospective recall of symptom experience has been shown to be&#xD;
      unreliable and influenced by outside factors (heuristics, recall bias, etc.). Short interval&#xD;
      assessment may provide a more accurate picture of patient symptom experience Participants:&#xD;
      Patients with IBS in general and IBS subtypes (IBS-C, D, M) Procedures (methods): Study&#xD;
      participants could be asked to record data at randomly assigned points throughout the day, as&#xD;
      well as during the course of a diarrheal or constipated stool (i.e., prior to and right after&#xD;
      a bowel movement).&#xD;

        80 male and female subjects will be recruited: 20 with IBS D; 20 with IBS C; 20 with IBS M;&#xD;
        20 control (no bowel symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will target patients who have maintained a diagnosis of IBS with Diarrhea (IBS-D), IBS&#xD;
        with Constipation (IBS-C, IBS with Mixed Stool pattern (IBS-M), using Rome III Criteria as&#xD;
        well as control subjects without bowel symptoms. Subject participation will be limited to&#xD;
        patients who maintain mild or moderate symptom severity score on the functional bowel&#xD;
        disorders severity index (FBDSI.) providing they have at least 3 symptom episodes of pain&#xD;
        or discomfort in a given week, to assure adequate data collection.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject signs and dates a written informed consent form (ICF) prior to any&#xD;
             study-related activities, including discontinuation of any prohibited medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject has been diagnosed with either IBS-C, IBS-D, IBS-M, or has no history of&#xD;
             gastrointestinal symptoms (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject has at least 3 pain episodes a week and does not have constant,&#xD;
             unremitting abdominal pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject is at least 18 years of age and less than 75 years of age at the time of&#xD;
             the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject is fluent in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject is an ambulatory outpatient. Ambulatory is defined as not depending&#xD;
             exclusively on a wheelchair for mobility. Nursing home subjects may be enrolled&#xD;
             provided they are ambulatory. Subjects with spinal cord injuries resulting in&#xD;
             paraplegia may not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject exhibits evidence of a biochemical or structural abnormality of the&#xD;
             digestive tract. These conditions include (but are not limited to) the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  GI surgery (with the exceptions of appendectomy; cholecystectomy; benign&#xD;
                  polypectomy; fundoplication without gas bloat syndrome, 6 months post-surgery;&#xD;
                  herniorrhaphy without bowel resection, 1 month post-surgery; hemorrhoidectomy, at&#xD;
                  least 2 months post-surgery; and hiatal hernia repair),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  GI malignancy, GI obstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. In the opinion of the investigator the subject has a concurrent illness or disability&#xD;
             (excluding IBS) that may affect the interpretation of clinical efficacy and/or safety&#xD;
             data or otherwise contraindicates participation in this clinical study (e.g., an&#xD;
             unstable cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, endocrine, metabolic, GI,&#xD;
             hematological, or neurological condition).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject has been diagnosed with a major psychiatric disorder within the past 2&#xD;
             years that required hospitalization and/or involved an attempted suicide (e.g., major&#xD;
             depression or psychoses). Subjects diagnosed with a major psychiatric disorder that&#xD;
             did not require hospitalization or involve an attempted suicide must have remained on&#xD;
             a stable dose of medication for at least 6 months prior to the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject has a history of alcohol or substance abuse within the past 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject has any evidence or treatment of malignancy (other than localized basal&#xD;
             cell, squamous cell skin cancer or cancer in situ that has been resected) within the&#xD;
             previous 5 years.&#xD;
