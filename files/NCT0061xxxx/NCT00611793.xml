  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PTK787/ZK222584 is an orally active inhibitor of VEGF-R tyrosine kinases. Bevacizumab is an&#xD;
      intravenous humanized monoclonal antibody directed against vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor. By binding to VEGF, bevacizumab blocks VEGF-A receptor binding. Due to the different&#xD;
      mechanisms of action and the non-overlapping toxicity profiles of the two agents, it is hoped&#xD;
      that a combination regimen incorporating both compounds will produce increased activity&#xD;
      without enhanced toxicity.&#xD;

    <description>PTK787/ZK222584 will be administered as a single agent orally on days 1-14 of cycle 1. The day 14 dose of PTK787/ZK222584 will be administered in the outpatient clinic and PK samples will be obtained. On Day 15 the patient will receive the initial dose of IV bevacizumab and PTK787/ZK222584. Bevacizumab will be repeated at 2 week intervals in patients with stable disease or better for four cycles of treatment (16 weeks). After four treatment cycles, only patients with a PR or CR will continue treatment with PTK787/ZK222584 and bevacizumab. Patients with stable disease may continue single agent PTK787/ZK22258 from cycle 5 onward. Protocol treatment will continue until disease progression or intolerable toxicity warrants drug discontinuation.</description>
