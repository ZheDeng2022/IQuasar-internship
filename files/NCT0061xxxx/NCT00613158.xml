  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD), including heart disease, heart attack, high blood pressure, and&#xD;
      stroke, is most commonly caused by atherosclerosis, or a hardening of the arteries.&#xD;
      Traditional risk factors for CVD include age, high blood pressure, high cholesterol,&#xD;
      diabetes, and smoking. Although these established risk factors can be helpful in determining&#xD;
      people at risk for developing CVD, the addition of novel gene markers for subclinical, or&#xD;
      suspected, atherosclerosis (SA) may enhance CVD risk prediction and understanding of disease&#xD;
      mechanisms. This study will compare specific genes of white blood cells in people with&#xD;
      significant SA versus people without SA to improve identification of those at risk for&#xD;
      developing CVD and to better understand the biological basis of SA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CVD is the leading cause of death worldwide and accounts for almost 40% of deaths each year&#xD;
      in the United States. In a person with CVD, oxygenated blood is not adequately distributed&#xD;
      throughout the body because of impaired function in the heart and blood vessels. This&#xD;
      restricted blood flow can eventually lead to organ damage, heart attack, and stroke. Risk&#xD;
      prediction for CVD, which is largely associated with SA, relies on the use of certain&#xD;
      traditional risk factors. The widely used Framingham risk score (FRS) has provided excellent&#xD;
      risk discrimination and reliable estimates of 10-year risk for CVD, but it does not account&#xD;
      for the genetics behind SA. Although numerous studies have investigated novel genetic&#xD;
      biomarkers to attempt to add predictive value to the FRS, no single biomarker to date has&#xD;
      been able to improve risk prediction in a meaningful way. A multi-marker approach that&#xD;
      identifies several novel markers unrelated to traditional risk factors may be more effective&#xD;
      in improving the identification of those at risk for CVD. This study will first construct a&#xD;
      multi-marker approach that is based on patterns of gene expression in peripheral blood&#xD;
      leukocytes (PBLs) and that can serve to identify people with substantial SA. The study will&#xD;
      then use this approach to determine whether gene expression patterns of PBLs in people with&#xD;
      SA are distinct from those in people without SA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use previously collected data and specimens, including blood samples and SA&#xD;
      imaging, from participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) trial and from&#xD;
      healthy female participants from Northwestern University. Blood samples will be used for&#xD;
      analysis of patterns of gene expression in PBLs. There will be no new study visits for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
