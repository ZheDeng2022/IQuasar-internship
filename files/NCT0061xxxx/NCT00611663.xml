      The aim of this study is to compare the immunological efficacy of two pneumococcal&#xD;
      vaccination strategies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) treated with&#xD;
      corticosteroids associated or not with other immunosuppressive drugs : 1) a prime-boost&#xD;
      strategy using vaccination with conjugate vaccine (Prevenar®) at week 0 and Poly Saccharidic&#xD;
      vaccine (Pneumo23®) after 6 months (W24)2) compared to the standard vaccination with Poly&#xD;
      Saccharidic vaccine (Pneumo23®) at W24 after placebo at W0&#xD;

      Infections are more frequent and potentially more serious in patients with SLE compared to&#xD;
      healthy subjects. This risk increases when patients are treated with corticosteroids and/or&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs.Among serious infections which can happen in this context,&#xD;
      respiratory infections are among the most frequent and Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the&#xD;
      most often responsible germs.Although there are no specific study in SLE, these findings&#xD;
      indicate that patients with SLE could benefit from a preventive vaccination against&#xD;
      pneumococcal infections.Two pneumococcal vaccines are available: Pneumo23®, a Poly&#xD;
      Saccharidic vaccine indicated for adults and children &gt; 2 years at risk of pneumococcal&#xD;
      infections; and Prevenar®, a conjugate vaccine, indicated for children &lt; 2 years.Pneumo23®&#xD;
      has been found to be safe in SLE but less immunogenic than in general population.Prevenar®&#xD;
      has already been studied in immunocompromised patients (HIV-infected patients, patients after&#xD;
      renal transplantation). It has been shown that immunological efficacy is better when&#xD;
      Prevenar® is administrated prior to Pneumo23®, compared to Pneumo23® administrated alone.To&#xD;
      our knowledge, this prime-boost strategy has not been assessed in patients with SLEThe&#xD;
      primary objective of the study is to compare immunological efficacy of two pneumococcal&#xD;
      vaccination strategies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) treated with&#xD;
      corticosteroids associated or not with other immunosuppressive drugs : 1) Vaccination with&#xD;
      conjugate vaccine (Prevenar®) at week 0 and Poly Saccharidic vaccine (Pneumo23®) after 6&#xD;
      months (W24)2) Vaccination with placebo at W0 and Poly Saccharidic vaccine (Pneumo23®) at&#xD;
      W24Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the clinical and biological tolerance of the two vaccinal strategies·&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the durability of sero protection at 6 and 24 months after vaccination by&#xD;
           Pneumo23®&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To search predictive factors determinant of the pneumococcal vaccine response&#xD;
