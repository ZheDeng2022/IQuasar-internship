    <textblock>
      The investigators at Rockefeller University are doing this research to study how the immune&#xD;
      system responds to viruses and other infectious agents by using the yellow fever 17D vaccine&#xD;
      as a model. The YFV-17D vaccine is one of the safest and most effective vaccines known and&#xD;
      has been used to vaccinate humans against yellow fever virus (YFV) infection since the 1930s.&#xD;
      By studying how the human immune system responds to the YFV vaccine we hope to learn more&#xD;
      about the normal functioning of the immune system so that it might be possible to design new,&#xD;
      more effective types of vaccines to prevent important infectious diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason for doing this research is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is very little information about which factors determine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the initial (primary) immune response to a foreign substance (antigen), such as a virus, that&#xD;
      person may be exposed to. There is also very little known about what determines how&#xD;
      effectively and for how long a person's immune system can react to the same antigen to&#xD;
      prevent another infection. Studies in animals have given us important information about how&#xD;
      the immune systems of other animals behave upon initial or repeated exposure to antigens,but&#xD;
      these topics have not been studied in detail in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following hypotheses will be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The magnitude of the initial expansion of T lymphocytes (the &quot;clonal burst&quot;) specific&#xD;
           for the infecting virus determines the level at which memory T cell responses are&#xD;
           generated against the specific viral antigen and the duration of the memory T cell&#xD;
           response generated in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The majority of CD8 T cells generated after immunization are yellow fever specific and&#xD;
           not &quot;bystander activation&quot; of non-specific cells.&#xD;
