  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single tablet regimen (STR) of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate&#xD;
      (tenofovir DF) is the first complete HAART that is offered as one tablet once a day. The&#xD;
      individual components of this HAART regimen have demonstrated efficacy and safety in HIV&#xD;
      treatment-naive patients and offer simplification that in turn may increase adherence and&#xD;
      improve clinical outcomes. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness (efficacy, safety&#xD;
      and tolerability) of a STR simplification strategy in patients on HAART who have achieved&#xD;
      viral suppression in a real world clinical setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study to evaluate pure virological response rates in&#xD;
      antiretroviral-experienced HIV infected subjects initiating therapy with Atripla. Subjects&#xD;
      will be switching to Atripla having already been established on the individual components of&#xD;
      efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the Chelsea and Westminster hospital approximately 540 subjects have been identified&#xD;
      who are currently receiving the individual components of Atripla and who would eventually&#xD;
      switch to Atripla. The Royal Sussex County Hospital will be included to ensure that&#xD;
      recruitment timelines are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 150 subjects will be switched within the first 6 months allowing initial 24 week&#xD;
      data for these subjects to be available approximately 12 months post launch.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Evidence of alcohol and/or drug or substance abuse that in the judgment of the&#xD;

             conditions of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of psychological illness or conditions that in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator might interfere with the patient's ability to understand the requirements&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with&#xD;
             the dosing requirements and cause the patient to be unable to complete the study&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
