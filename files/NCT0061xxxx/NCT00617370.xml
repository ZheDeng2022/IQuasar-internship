  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to give a drug regimen that is hoped to be effective in&#xD;
      preventing cancer from coming back. Since it is an aggressive breast cancer, there is a&#xD;
      moderate to high chance that the cancer may come back. The standard treatment for this tumor&#xD;
      type includes a chemotherapy regimen with drugs named epirubicin (E) and cyclophosphamide (C)&#xD;
      in a vein every 2 weeks for 4 treatments, followed by a drug named paclitaxel, every 2 weeks&#xD;
      in your vein for 4 treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an experimental study in which you will be given 6 cycles of EC followed by 6&#xD;
      cycles of paclitaxel. The purpose of getting 2 more cycles of EC and 2 more cycles of&#xD;
      paclitaxel than what is normally given is to study a regimen that may be more effective than&#xD;
      the current standard treatment in preventing the recurrence of this cancer. Specifically, in&#xD;
      this study we are looking for side-effects and risks of these drugs as more cycles are given.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast confirmed at&#xD;
             MSKCC or MSKCC satellites. Patients with breast cancer, regardless of tumor size or&#xD;
             nodal status, are eligible for the study. Pathology will be assessed in the standard&#xD;
             fashion (ie: HER-2/neu, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor status). Results&#xD;
             of HER-2/neu, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor are not required for study&#xD;
             entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be ≥18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an ECOG PS of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If patients are offered chemotherapy postoperatively, then they must be within 84 days&#xD;
             from the final surgical procedure required to treat the primary tumor(s). If patients&#xD;
             are offered chemotherapy preoperatively, then they can receive treatment at anytime&#xD;
             per MD's discretion. Patients may have bilateral synchronous breast tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received hormonal therapy for the purpose of chemoprevention but&#xD;
             must be willing to discontinue prior to enrollment and while participating in this&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If patients have peripheral neuropathy, it must be &lt; than or equal grade 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be willing to discontinue sex hormonal therapy e.g., birth control&#xD;
             pills, ovarian hormonal replacement therapy, etc., prior to enrollment. Women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective contraception&#xD;
             while on treatment and for a reasonable period thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1000/µL and platelet count ≥100,000/µL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total Bilirubin must be within normal limits. Transaminases (SGOT and/or SGPT) may be&#xD;
             up to 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) if alkaline phosphatase is &lt;&#xD;
             than or equal to ULN, or alkaline phosphatase may be up to 4 x ULN if transaminases&#xD;
             are &lt; than or equal to ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative HCG pregnancy test for premenopausal women of reproductive capacity and for&#xD;
             women less than 12 months after the menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  LVEF (by multi-gated radionuclide angiography or MUGA scan or by echocardiography)at&#xD;
             or above institutional lower limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must give written, informed consent indicating their understanding of and&#xD;
             willingness to participate in the study.&#xD;

             malignancies must have been disease-free for at least five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known allergy/hypersensitivity to doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
             paclitaxel (or other drugs formulated in Cremophor EL) or E. coli-derived proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with unstable angina, congestive heart failure, current use of digitalis,&#xD;
             betablockers, or calcium blockers for therapy of congestive heart failure, arrhythmia&#xD;
