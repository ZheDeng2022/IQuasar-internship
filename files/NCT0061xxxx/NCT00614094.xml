      The purpose of this retrospective pilot study is to assess the association of maternal&#xD;
      hypoglycemia during the one hour glucose tolerance test with decreased placental weight and&#xD;
      identifiable placental pathology. We hypothesize that a decreased one hour glucose tolerance&#xD;
      test is a risk factor for decreased placental weight, an increased fetal to placental weight&#xD;
      ratio, and other identifiable placental pathology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There have been several studies linking hyperglycemia during pregnancy to adverse perinatal&#xD;
      outcomes such as macrosomia, fetal cardiac defects, and shoulder dystocia. However, there&#xD;
      have only been a few studies addressing the effects of hypoglycemia on perinatal outcomes.&#xD;
      Several of these studies have shown an increased risk of intrauterine growth restriction&#xD;
      (IUGR) with maternal hypoglycemia particularly during the glucose tolerance test (GTT).3-6&#xD;
      However, many of these studies have not taken into account comorbid factors or have&#xD;
      conflicting findings.3-6 IUGR is defined as infant birth weights below the tenth percentile&#xD;
      when the baby is otherwise genetically normal. The purpose of this retrospective pilot study&#xD;
      is to assess the association of maternal hypoglycemia during the one hour glucose tolerance&#xD;
      test with decreased placental weight and identifiable placental pathology. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that a decreased one hour glucose tolerance test is a risk factor for decreased placental&#xD;
      weight, an increased fetal to placental weight ratio, and other identifiable placental&#xD;
      pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abell et al. found that maternal hypoglycemia during the one hour GTT was associated with&#xD;
      decreased birth weights and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). However, this study made&#xD;
      no comment on the effect of confounding factors such as tobacco use, history of gestational&#xD;
      diabetes, or maternal BMI. Both Sokol et al and Langer et al revealed a link between&#xD;
      decreased maternal response during the third trimester GTT and IUGR, although in the Sokol&#xD;
      study, each pregnancy had one known risk factor for gestational diabetes. Conversely, several&#xD;
      more recent papers have reported that maternal hypoglycemia is not predictive of IUGR or poor&#xD;
      perinatal outcomes. -8 Consequently, the effect maternal hypoglycemia during the oral GTT is&#xD;
      unclear. The placenta is viewed as a reflection of the intrauterine environment during&#xD;
      pregnancy. Therefore, we wish to examine hypoglycemia during the oral one hour GTT as a risk&#xD;
      factor for decreased placental weight, increased fetal weight to placental weight ratio, and&#xD;
      an increased incidence of abnormal placental pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A normal term placenta weighs approximately 450 grams, which is on average, one sixth of the&#xD;
      fetal weight.9 Increased maternal substrate availability of vital fetal nutrients, such as&#xD;
      glucose, has been known to result in large for gestational age infants, such as occurs with&#xD;
      gestational diabetics.10 This may also be reflected in the increased placental weights linked&#xD;
      with large for gestational age infants.11 Conversely, IUGR and small for gestational age&#xD;
      infants may have decreased placental weights, possibly due to decreased substrate&#xD;
      availability secondary to maternal hypoglycemia. 12 Increased fetal to placental weight&#xD;
      ratios of 1.5 or greater above the average value for a particular gestational age are also&#xD;
      indicative of an IUGR infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying a possible indicator for an increased risk of decreased placental weight, which&#xD;
      may in turn indicate an increased risk for IUGR, is vitally important when considering the&#xD;
      outcomes of IUGR infants. These infants are at great risk for hypoglycemia, sepsis, seizure,&#xD;
      stillbirth, respiratory distress, and meconium aspiration. Long term outcomes include poor&#xD;
      school performance, hyperactivity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.2 Study&#xD;
      Population Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Our study population will consist of women younger&#xD;
      than 35, who delivered a term infant either by vaginal delivery or cesarean section at Tulsa&#xD;
      Regional Medical Center between July 1, 2005 and July 31, 2007. This time range was selected&#xD;
      in order to have an adequate number of recent charts to review. (Women 35 and older are&#xD;
      considered &quot;advanced maternal age&quot; and may be at increased risk of placental pathology for&#xD;
      that reason, so they are excluded.) We expect to collect approximately 350 usable charts,&#xD;
      with perhaps only 35 of those from patients with blood sugars in the &quot;low&quot; or experimental&#xD;
      category. A power analysis using these assumptions is provided at the end of this protocol.&#xD;
      All placentas are sent to pathology on a routine basis. A term infant is defined as delivery&#xD;
      at 37 weeks or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of a typical resident clinic patient population from the&#xD;
      OSU OB-Gyn clinic. The ethnicities of the study population include African-American,&#xD;
      Caucasian, Hispanic, American Indian, and Asian women. The population included in the study&#xD;
      must have a one hour glucose tolerance test result equal to or less than 88 mg/dl. These&#xD;
      results are equal to a range in the fifth percentile or less.3 We used 50 grams of oral&#xD;
      glucola at 24 weeks or greater for our glucose tolerance test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will exclude women with the following comorbid conditions, due to the fact that such&#xD;
      conditions manifest placental pathology and may affect placental weight: insufficient&#xD;
      gestational dates, multiple gestation, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, heart disease,&#xD;
      tobacco use, drug use, history of or current gestational diabetes, history of IUGR,&#xD;
      chromosomal abnormalities, congenital malformations, preexisting diabetes, any autoimmune&#xD;
      disease, hypertensive disorders, abnormal maternal screen, pulmonary disease, previous&#xD;
      gastric bypass, any disease process that results in decreased gastrointestinal absorption,&#xD;
      HIV, intrauterine amniotic infection, history of placental abruption, thrombophilia, body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI) greater than 40 or BMI less than 19.8.13&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early Termination Criteria N/A&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Procedures Diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of maternal hypoglycemia after a one hour glucola screen will be defined as a&#xD;
      one hour plasma glucose measurement of equal to or less than 88 mg/dl. The glucose screen&#xD;
      will be performed at 24 weeks gestation or greater, as calculated by last menstrual period&#xD;
      and ultrasound. The one hour GTT results will be obtained from the patient's chart. A&#xD;
      decreased placental weight will be defined as a weight equal to or below one standard&#xD;
      deviation of the mean placental weight according to gestational age (Table 1). The control&#xD;
      group of this population will have a one hour GTT result greater than 88mg/dl. In this study,&#xD;
      we will assess placental weight, birth weight, the placenta to birth weight ratio, and&#xD;
      placental pathology as described in Table 2. All placental findings were assessed by a single&#xD;
      pathologist blinded to the patient's one hour GTT results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection The collaborating investigators and research assistants will collect age,&#xD;
      height, weight at initial visit, date of delivery, infant birth weight, one hour GTT result,&#xD;
      smoking and drug use status, placental weight and pathology results, and any of the above&#xD;
      mentioned exclusion criteria only from any patient chart. (Height and weight are needed to&#xD;
      calculate BMI.) Research assistants will be utilized to aid in the collection of this data&#xD;
      from clinic and hospital records. These assistants will be OSU medical students employed by&#xD;
      the work study program and will have basic human research and HIPAA training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis The two populations will be compared for various response variables. Whenever the&#xD;
      response variable is meaningfully numeric and continuous in nature, two population t-tests&#xD;
      will be used to compare the means of the two groups. When the response is categorical in&#xD;
      nature, contingency tables will be created and Chi Squares tests utilized to compare the&#xD;
      proportion of responses for the two groups. All analyses will be conducted with the use of PC&#xD;
      SAS Version 9 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality The records reviewed will be kept in the Houston Park medical records&#xD;
      department or Tulsa Regional Medical Center health information management department. Both&#xD;
      these facilities are locked or under security supervision at all times. All study records&#xD;
      will be de-identified by conversion to numbers before review, analysis, or interpretation. J.&#xD;
      Martin Beal, D.O., Sarah McCoy, Ph.D., and Elsa Vadakekut, D.O. will have access to these&#xD;
      numbers which will be kept locked in the OSU Ob/Gyn office, which is separate from both&#xD;
      medical records departments. All documents linking patient names to charts will be destroyed&#xD;
      after the data collection is complete.&#xD;
