      This study will use positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to measure a receptor in the&#xD;
      brain that is involved in inflammation. Certain neurological disorders, possibly including&#xD;
      frontotemporal dementia (FTD), are associated with increased inflammation in the brain. This&#xD;
      study may help elucidate the relationship between FTD and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with FTD and healthy volunteers who are 35 years of age or older may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whole body PET scan: PET uses small amounts of a radioactive chemical called a tracer&#xD;
           that labels active areas of the brain so the activity can be seen with a special camera.&#xD;
           The tracer used in this study is [11C]PBR28. Before starting the scan, a catheter&#xD;
           (plastic tube) is placed in a vein in the arm to inject the tracer. Pictures are taken&#xD;
           for 1 hour. This short scan is done to determine if [11C]PBR28 binds to the subject s&#xD;
           receptors, since a number of people do not have binding. Subjects who have binding&#xD;
           continue with brain PET and MRI scans, described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain PET imaging: Before starting the scan, a catheter is placed in a vein in the arm&#xD;
           to inject the tracer,&lt;TAB&gt; and another catheter is placed in an artery in the wrist to&#xD;
           obtain blood samples during the scan. The subject lies on the scanner bed. A special&#xD;
           mask is fitted to the head and attached to the bed to help keep the person s head still&#xD;
           during the scan so the images will be clear. An 8-minute transmission scan is done just&#xD;
           before the tracer is injected to provide measures of the brain that are helpful in&#xD;
           calculating information from subsequent scans. After the tracer is injected, pictures&#xD;
           are taken for about 2.5 hours, while the subject lies still on the scanner bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests are done the day of and the day following each PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): An MRI scan is done within 1 year (before or after) of&#xD;
           the PET scan. This procedure uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of&#xD;
           the brain. The subject lies on a table that is moved into the scanner (a tube-like&#xD;
           device), wearing earplugs to muffle the noise of the machine during the scanning&#xD;
           process. The test takes about 1 hour....&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abnormal immune responses and inflammatory mechanisms have been implicated in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of certain neurodegenerative diseases. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a&#xD;
      neurodegenerative disease characterized by focal atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes.&#xD;
      Evidence supports the presence of inflammation in FTD; however, the relationship between&#xD;
      inflammation and FTD pathogenesis is poorly understood. In addition, there is evidence of&#xD;
      inflammation in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), a condition characterized by seizures&#xD;
      originating from the mesial temporal lobe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response to brain inflammation, microglia are activated and over-express the peripheral&#xD;
      benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). In normal conditions, PBR is expressed in low numbers.&#xD;
      Measuring PBR density can identify areas of brain inflammation, because activated microglial&#xD;
      cells in these areas express more PBR than microglial cells in resting conditions. Positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) imaging can quantify PBR density in vivo using radioligands that&#xD;
      bind to PBR sites. One PBR-specific radioligand,&#xD;
      [11C]1-(2-chlorophenyl-N-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide (PK11195), has been used to&#xD;
      identify areas of brain inflammation in patients with FTD. Unfortunately, [11C]PK11195 has&#xD;
      several limitations, such as low brain uptake and low specific signal. A recently developed&#xD;
      radioligand, [11C]N-acetyl-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxy-5-pyridinamine (PBR28), has higher&#xD;
      affinity than [11C]PK11195 for PBR. [11C]PBR28 has never been used to study inflammation in&#xD;
      FTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further study brain inflammation in dementia and TLE, we wish to include patients with&#xD;
      Alzheimer disease (AD) and TLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, we wish to evaluate 20 patients with FTD, 50 100 patients with AD, 20&#xD;
      patients with TLE, and 30 55 healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo a dedicated brain PET with [11C]PBR28, as well as a brain MRI. In AD&#xD;
      patients and controls, 11C PBR28 PET and MRI will then be repeated after an interval of one&#xD;
      year but no more than 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures will be the amount of 11C PBR28 binding in the brain in FTD patients, AD&#xD;
      patients, TLE patients and in healthy controls. We will quantify the radioligand s brain&#xD;
      uptake, washout, plasma clearance, and distribution volume using compartmental modeling.&#xD;
      Distribution volume is proportional to the density of receptors and is equal to the ratio at&#xD;
      equilibrium of uptake in brain to the concentration of parent radiotracer in plasma. 11C&#xD;
      PBR28 binding will also be compared between baseline and follow-up scans to determine the&#xD;
      change in binding related to evolution of AD pathology and that related to normal aging.&#xD;
