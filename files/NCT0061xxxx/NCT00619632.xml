  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, single-center, single-blind, 2x2 factorial design trial of&#xD;
      routine provider, primary care-based interventions to increase breastfeeding intensity up to&#xD;
      6 months in low-income multiethnic women, with stratification for maternal country of birth.&#xD;
      The Best Infant Nutrition for Good Outcomes (BINGO) trial will randomize women into one of&#xD;
      four treatment groups: (a) Prenatal Care Provider (PNC); (b) Lactation Consultant (LC); (c)&#xD;
      PNC + LC, or; (d) Control. Thus, the separate and synergistic effects of the interventions&#xD;
      will be tested, compared to a Control standard of care. The intervention and design build&#xD;
      upon our prior trial of an LC intervention alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PNCs- certified nurse midwives and ob/gyns-- will use a brief, electronically prompted&#xD;
      protocol with women in the PNC, and PNC + LC groups throughout pregnancy. An LC will arrange&#xD;
      pre-natal one-on-one meetings, daily hospital, and home visits with women in the LC and&#xD;
      PNC+LC groups. Descriptive data on infant health visits, and participant/provider experiences&#xD;
      will be collected as secondary outcomes. Interviews at 1,3 and 6 months post-partum will&#xD;
      collect infant feeding, and health visit data outside the medical center. Medical center&#xD;
      visit data will be obtained from MIS data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes (Hypotheses): Breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Breastfeeding Intensity at 1,3, and 6 Months&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exclusive Breastfeeding at 1,3, and 6 Months&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Outcomes (Descriptive): Infant Health, and Participant/Provider Experience&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To describe the frequency and timing of infant health visits for &quot;breast-feeding&#xD;
           sensitive&quot; illnesses&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To describe participant and provider (LC and PNC) experience of the interventions.&#xD;

      Primary Outcomes (Hypotheses): Breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Breastfeeding Intensity at 1,3, and 6 Months- There will be significant differences in&#xD;
           breastfeeding intensity among the 4 treatment groups. We expect that intensity will be&#xD;
           greatest in the PNC+LC group, followed by the LC, then the PNC, and Control groups,&#xD;
           respectively. Intensity will be assessed via 7 day recall of the frequency of breastmilk&#xD;
           feedings vs. other liquids and solids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exclusive Breastfeeding at 1,3, and 6 Months- There will be significant differences in&#xD;
           the rate of exclusive breastfeeding among the 4 treatment groups. We expect that rates&#xD;
           of exclusive breastfeeding will be greatest in the PNC+LC group, followed by the LC,&#xD;
           then the PNC, and Control groups, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Outcomes (Descriptive): Infant Health, and Participant/Provider Experience&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To describe the frequency and timing of infant health visits for &quot;breast-feeding&#xD;
           sensitive&quot; illnesses (i.e., otitis media, gastrointestinal, and respiratory infections)&#xD;
           by treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To describe the frequency and timing of infant health visits for &quot;breast-feeding&#xD;
           sensitive&quot; illnesses by intensity of breastfeeding regardless of group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To describe participant and provider (LC and PNC) experience of the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BINGO is the first RCT in the US of routine provider, primary-care based interventions to&#xD;
      increase breastfeeding (BF). Government task forces in the US3 and Canada specifically call&#xD;
      for such trials, as well as trials to assess independent effects of combined interventions.&#xD;
      BINGO is the first trial to apply strategies derived from the current National Breastfeeding&#xD;
      Awareness Campaign (NBAC). BINGO will employ the NBAC message-- that exclusive BF for 6&#xD;
      months reduces infant ear infections, diarrhea, respiratory illness, and perhaps childhood&#xD;
      obesity. We expect this message will yield greater BF intensity, and thus progress toward&#xD;
      pending Healthy People 2010 goals for exclusive BF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BINGO uses evidence-based strategies in practice, consistent with the NIH roadmap. Its&#xD;
      interventions are logistically and economically sustainable in clinical practice. They&#xD;
      support women pre- and post-natally, across multiple care settings (clinic, hospital, home).&#xD;
      Both Certified Nurse Midwives and Ob/Gyns, deliver the PNC intervention, thus increasing&#xD;
      generalizability. BINGO now has the enthusiastic support of perinatal nursing, physician, and&#xD;
      lactation specialist groups. This support, at the outset, provides the foundation for&#xD;
      effective BINGO interventions to be translated into practice.&#xD;
