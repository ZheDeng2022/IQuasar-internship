      This study will compare the effectiveness of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      versus standard care in treating children with post-traumatic stress disorder.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year approximately 5 million children in the United States are exposed to some form of&#xD;
      traumatic event, and nearly 40% of these children will go on to develop post-traumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder (PTSD). There are a number of traumatic events that have been shown to cause PTSD in&#xD;
      children, including natural disaster, physical or sexual abuse, loss of a loved one, and&#xD;
      witnessing an act of violence. Children with PTSD may experience persistent generalized fear&#xD;
      and anxiety, recurrent nightmares, mood swings, withdrawal, and depression. If left&#xD;
      untreated, PTSD can cause serious distress for those affected, resulting in emotional,&#xD;
      academic, and social problems. Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), a form&#xD;
      of psychotherapy that focuses on trauma, may be the most effective means of improving PTSD&#xD;
      screening and treatment in community-based mental health services. Although TF-CBT has shown&#xD;
      success in treating children with PTSD in the research setting, its use in community clinics&#xD;
      remains limited. This study will compare the effectiveness of TF-CBT versus treatment as&#xD;
      usual (TAU) in treating children with PTSD in community clinics. The study will also develop&#xD;
      a community collaboration between a community mental health agency and an academic&#xD;
      institution, both in New York City, to address childhood trauma and PTSD and to enhance&#xD;
      research in community clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last about 3 months. Potential parent and child participants&#xD;
      will first undergo initial assessments, which will include interviews and questionnaires&#xD;
      concerning symptoms of PTSD. Eligible participants will then be assigned randomly to receive&#xD;
      TF-CBT or TAU. Participants in both groups will attend 12 sessions over 3 months. TF-CBT&#xD;
      sessions will include trauma-focused treatment and will teach participants behavioral&#xD;
      management and coping skills to overcome their PTSD. TAU sessions will include routine&#xD;
      community clinic care and will not involve a trauma-focused treatment component. Upon&#xD;
      completion of treatment, participants will complete repeat interviews and questionnaires.&#xD;
