  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of surgical resection in the subset of patients with resectable hepatic metastases&#xD;
      converted from initially non-resectable liver metastasis was still not clearly established.&#xD;
      To further explore the oncologic results of surgical versus non-surgical methods for the&#xD;
      treatment of this subset of patients, we designed and conducted the present randomized&#xD;
      prospective study beginning in 2002. The present study was based on the following arguments&#xD;
      against the predominant survival benefits of surgical resection in previous reported series:&#xD;
      (1) The initially non-resectable liver metastasis was basically a disseminated disease, even&#xD;
      though some metastases were highly responsive to chemotherapy and become resectable; (2)&#xD;
      Since the evaluation of resectability was based on the imaging studies, it was difficult to&#xD;
      consider the surgical resection as &quot;curative&quot; for the resectable hepatic metastases converted&#xD;
      from non-resectable ones, given the limitation of the current imaging stools of&#xD;
      high-technology; (3) The resectable hepatic metastases after neoadjuvant chemotherapy might&#xD;
      represent a subset of hepatic metastases biologically highly responsive to chemotherapy and&#xD;
      the time-to-progression for these metastases might be fairly long after a response.&#xD;
      Additionally, these metastases might be also biologically responsive to other cytotoxic or&#xD;
      targeted therapies that justified the patients' continuous adoption of non-surgical&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      In 2000, de Gramont et al. and Giacchetti et al. reported that combination chemotherapy&#xD;
      including modulated infusional 5-Fu plus irinotecan and oxaliplatin could achieve a response&#xD;
      rate of approximately 50% and a median survival of in excess of 20 months. These encouraging&#xD;
      results implied that chemotherapy is likely to play an increasingly important role in&#xD;
      decreasing the size of metastasis to allow for liver resection. Interestingly, Adam and&#xD;
      Bismuth et al. reported that the 5-year overall survival of 50% (95% confidence interval&#xD;
      33-68%), observed in patients with resection following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, was&#xD;
      comparable to patients with primarily resectable hepatic metastasis as reported by Scheele et&#xD;
      al. (39%, 469 patients), Fong et al. (37%, 1001 patients), Nordlinger et al.(28%, 1568&#xD;
      patients), and Fiqueras et al. (36%, 235 patients). Recently, Zelek et al. reported that&#xD;
      intravenous and hepatic artery infusion of irinotecan/ 5-fluorouracil/ leucovorin could&#xD;
      facilitate complete resection of initially non-resectable hepatic metastases. Pozzo et al.&#xD;
      indicated that neoadjuvant treatment of unresectable liver disease with irinotecan/&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil/ leucovorin enabled a significant portion of patients to undergo surgical&#xD;
      resection. Alberts et al. showed that FOLFOX-4 therapy allowed for successful resection of&#xD;
      disease in a portion of patients initially not judged to be optimally resectable but with a&#xD;
      high recurrence rate after surgery. Masi et al. reported that neoadjuvant approach with&#xD;
      irinotecan plus FOLFOX-4 had significant antitumor activity and provided a radical surgical&#xD;
      resection of initially unresctable hepatic colorectal metastases with promising median&#xD;
      survival of patients. However, most studies published till now are retrospective analyses&#xD;
      without a control group or case series with limited patient number and/or short time of&#xD;
      follow-up. Therefore, the role of surgical resection in the subset of patients with&#xD;
      resectable hepatic metastases converted from initially non-resectable liver metastasis was&#xD;
      still not clearly established. To further explore the oncologic results of surgical versus&#xD;
      non-surgical methods for the treatment of this subset of patients, we designed and conducted&#xD;
      the present randomized prospective study beginning in 2002. The present study was based on&#xD;
      the following arguments against the predominant survival benefits of surgical resection in&#xD;
      previous reported series: (1) The initially non-resectable liver metastasis was basically a&#xD;
      disseminated disease, even though some metastases were highly responsive to chemotherapy and&#xD;
      become resectable; (2) Since the evaluation of resectability was based on the imaging&#xD;
      studies, it was difficult to consider the surgical resection as &quot;curative&quot; for the resectable&#xD;
      hepatic metastases converted from non-resectable ones, given the limitation of the current&#xD;
      imaging stools of high-technology; (3) The resectable hepatic metastases after neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy might represent a subset of hepatic metastases biologically highly responsive to&#xD;
      chemotherapy and the time-to-progression for these metastases might be fairly long after a&#xD;
      response. Additionally, these metastases might be also biologically responsive to other&#xD;
      cytotoxic or targeted therapies that justified the patients' continuous adoption of&#xD;
      non-surgical treatment.&#xD;
