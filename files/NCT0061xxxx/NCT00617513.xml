    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine which dose of prucalopride is safe and effective in&#xD;
      patients with chronic idiopathic constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prucalopride 1 and 2 mg are safe and effective for the treatment of chronic idiopathic&#xD;
      constipation whereas 0,5 mg is a suboptimal dose.&#xD;

      This is a phase II trial with a parallel-group design, consisting of a drug-free run-in phase&#xD;
      (phase 1), followed by a placebo controlled double-blind phase (phase 2). Patients will&#xD;
      receive either R093877 0.5 mg o.d., 1 mg o.d. or 2 mg o.d. or placebo for a period of 4&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 is a run-in period of 4 weeks duration, during which the bowel habit is documented&#xD;
      and the existence of constipation confirmed. At the start of this period all existing&#xD;
      laxative medication is withdrawn but patients will be instructed not to change their dietary&#xD;
      habits, in particular their fibre intake during the trial. Patients will enter the&#xD;
      double-blind phase if constipation has been shown to be present during the run-in period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the definition of constipation was not met during the 4 weeks of the run-in period,&#xD;
      double-blind treatment will not be started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase, in which patients will be&#xD;
      treated for 4 weeks with either 0.5 mg, 1 mg or 2 mg of R093877 or placebo given once daily&#xD;
      (one capsule is taken before breakfast).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted to the double blind treatment period will be randomly allocated to one of&#xD;
      the 4 treatment arms.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age between 18-70 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of constipation i.e., the patient reported the occurrence of TWO OR MORE of&#xD;
             the following criteria for at least 6 months before the selection visit :&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. two or fewer spontaneous* bowel movements in a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. lumpy (scyballae) and/or hard stools at least a quarter of the stools.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. sensation of incomplete evacuation following at least a quarter of the stools.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. straining at defaecation at least a quarter of the time. *A bowel movement was&#xD;
                  considered spontaneous if it was not preceded by the intake of a laxative agent&#xD;
                  within a period of 12 hours. An amendment was made changing this period to 24&#xD;
                  hours. Moreover, the amendment stated: &quot;Patients who never opened their bowels&#xD;
                  spontaneously would be considered constipated and eligible to enter the&#xD;
                  double-blind phase of the trial, whether or not the above mentioned criteria were&#xD;
                  met for laxativa/enemas induced stools&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Constipation causing disability; the patient's occupational, social and recreational&#xD;

             examination performed within the last 12 months were needed. If complaints of&#xD;
             constipation had been present for more than one year, results of an endoscopic&#xD;
             examination performed within the past three years were acceptable&quot;.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected organic disorders of the large bowel, i.e., obstruction, carcinoma&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormalities of blood chemistry, haematology or urinalysis at&#xD;
