    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn how often magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) of the breast locates additional areas of cancer in the breast of patients with lobular&#xD;
      cancer as well as in the breasts of young breast cancer patients (less than age 40 years).&#xD;
      Researchers also hope to learn how often the results of the MRI changes the type of surgical&#xD;
      treatment that is recommended and understand the costs associated with using MRI in the&#xD;
      diagnostic process. Researchers also want to use a different way of looking at the MRI scans&#xD;
      to learn if they can more easily learn the difference between a cyst and a tumor.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      At MD Anderson, patients with breast cancer routinely have mammograms and ultrasounds to&#xD;
      measure the size and extent of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI of the breast is a technology that is better than mammograms and ultrasounds at locating&#xD;
      cancer. Although MRI may locate more areas of cancer, it can sometimes falsely identify&#xD;
      normal areas of the breast as cancerous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike ductal cancer of the breast (the most common type of breast cancer), lobular cancer is&#xD;
      more difficult to see on mammograms and ultrasounds. Therefore, patients with lobular cancer&#xD;
      of the breast may be best suited for MRI of the breast in order to more accurately determine&#xD;
      the extent of the cancer. In addition, in young women, because the breast tissue is very&#xD;
      dense, all types of breast tumors are harder to detect with mammogram and ultrasound and may&#xD;
      be better seen with MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A correct measurement of the size and extent of the cancer is important because this affects&#xD;
      the recommendation for the type of surgery a patient may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will have an MRI of both breasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the MRI, part or all of the body will be passed into a long, narrow tube scanner, which&#xD;
      is open at both ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI images will be compared with the images from your standard of care mammogram and&#xD;
      ultrasound images. If the MRI shows abnormalities not seen on the mammogram or ultrasound and&#xD;
      your doctor thinks it is necessary, you may have additional testing and/or a tumor biopsy.&#xD;
      This is part of your standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this additional MRI testing will be used by your surgeon to guide his/her&#xD;
      recommendations for your surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information like your age, diagnosis, and results of your testing will be collected as part&#xD;
      of the data analysis for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No identifying information will be sent outside of MD Anderson. Your information will be&#xD;
      stored on a password-protected computer. Information may be kept for up to 5 years after the&#xD;
      study ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The investigational part of this study is the comparison of&#xD;
      the outcome of MRI images to mammogram and ultrasound images in determining appropriate&#xD;
      surgical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 170 patients will be take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with pure invasive lobular carcinoma or mixed invasive ductal-lobular&#xD;
             carcinoma with the ductal component not greater that 25% OR patients under the age of&#xD;
             40 at diagnosis, irrespective of tumor histology&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. For women with invasive lobular carcinoma, if the pathology report from the diagnostic&#xD;
