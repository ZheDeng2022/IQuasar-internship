      This study is an 8 day, randomised, double blind, 2-way crossover trial of repeat doses of&#xD;
      intranasal GSK256066 and azelastine hydrochloride in the Vienna Challenge Chamber in subjects&#xD;
      with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). Laboratory safety assessments, 12-lead&#xD;
      electrocardiograph (ECG), vital signs and adverse event enquiries will be made throughout the&#xD;
      study. Nasal examination, symptom scores, and allergen challenge assessments will also be&#xD;
      performed at various time points throughout the study.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is healthy. Healthy subjects are defined as individuals who are free from&#xD;
             clinically significant illness or disease as determined by their medical history&#xD;
             (including family), physical examination, laboratory studies, and other tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 50 years inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented&#xD;
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of&#xD;
                  spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous&#xD;
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140&#xD;
                  pmol/L) is confirmatory].&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed&#xD;
                  in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product&#xD;
                  label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the&#xD;
                  risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception&#xD;
                  until the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index less than 29.0 kg/m² with weight range of 55.0kg (females 50kg) to&#xD;
             95.0kg inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject exhibits a moderate response to 1500 grass pollen grains/m3 after 2 hours&#xD;
             in the Vienna Challenge Chamber, defined as a nasal symptom score of at least 6.&#xD;
             (Nasal symptom score is the sum of obstruction, rhinorrhoea, itch and sneeze, each of&#xD;
             which have been scored on a scale from 0 to 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a positive skin prick test (wheal ³ 4mm) for grass pollen at or within&#xD;
             the 12 months preceding the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a positive RAST (³ class 2) for grass pollen at or within the 12&#xD;
             months preceding the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is a current non-smoker who has not used any tobacco products in the 6&#xD;
             months preceding the screening visit with a pack history of £ 10 pack years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must have a baseline FEV1&gt;80% predicted and a baseline FEV1(maximum&#xD;
             recorded value)/FVC(maximum recorded value)&gt;70% predicted (using the Standardized Lung&#xD;
             Function Testing guidelines produced by European Community for Coal and Steel)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There are no conditions or factors which would make the subject unlikely to be able to&#xD;
             stay in the chamber for 4 hours.&#xD;

             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is available to complete all study measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing females&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use an appropriate&#xD;
             method of contraception, as listed in Section 8.1, from at least two weeks prior to&#xD;
             the first dose of study medication; and to continue until the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On examination the subject is found to have any structural nasal abnormalities or&#xD;
             nasal polyposis, a history of frequent nosebleeds, recent nasal surgery or recent&#xD;
             (within 3 weeks) or ongoing upper respiratory tract infection which in the Responsible&#xD;
             Physician's opinion renders the subject unsuitable for participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any respiratory disease other than mild stable asthma that is controlled with&#xD;
             occasional use of as-needed short-acting beta-agonists and associated with normal lung&#xD;
             function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is likely to be unable to abstain from salbutamol use for 8 hours before a&#xD;
             challenge&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             physician responsible, contraindicates their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is concurrently participating in another clinical study or has&#xD;
             participated in a study with an investigational product (new chemical entity) during&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The subject has a screening QTc(B) value &gt;450msec, PQ interval outside the range 120&#xD;
             to 240msec or an ECG that is not suitable for QT measurements (e.g. poorly defined&#xD;
             termination of the T-wave). In addition subjects will be excluded if they have a&#xD;
             history of atrial and ventricular arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A supine blood pressure that is persistently higher than 140/90 millimetres of mercury&#xD;
             (mmHg) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A supine mean heart rate outside the range 40-90 beats per minute (bpm) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has donated a unit of blood (450mL) within the previous 3 months or&#xD;
             intends to donate within 3 months of completing the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is currently taking regular (or a course of) medication whether prescribed&#xD;
             or not, including steroids, vitamins, macrolides, anti-fungal agents and herbal&#xD;
             remedies (e.g. St. John's Wort). Paracetamol (£2g/day) and occasional as needed use of&#xD;
             short-acting beta agonists is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has used prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins,&#xD;
             herbal and dietary supplements (including St. John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days&#xD;
             if the drug is a potent enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (which ever is longer) prior&#xD;
             to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and&#xD;
             Sponsor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise&#xD;
             subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has used oral, injectable or dermal steroids within 5 weeks or intranasal&#xD;
             and/or inhaled steroids within 1 week of the screening visit.&#xD;

             malignancy, hepatic disease, renal disease*, haematological disease, neurological&#xD;
             disease, endocrine disease or pulmonary disease (including but not confined to chronic&#xD;
             bronchitis, emphysema, bronchiectasis or pulmonary fibrosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
             *subjects will require normal serum creatinine clearance values at screening&#xD;
             [calculated from serum creatinine by a predicting equation using Cockcroft-Gualt&#xD;
             formula]. If the creatinine clearance value is greater than the upper limit of normal&#xD;
             as determined by the local laboratory reference range, the Investigator will determine&#xD;
             whether this is a clinically significant finding that would preclude participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject regularly drinks more than 28 units of alcohol in a week if male, or 21&#xD;
             units per week if female. One unit of alcohol is defined as a medium (125 ml) glass of&#xD;
             wine, half a pint (250 ml) of beer or one measure (24 ml) of spirits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is at risk of non-compliance with the study procedures/restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is infected with the Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or HIV virus.&#xD;
