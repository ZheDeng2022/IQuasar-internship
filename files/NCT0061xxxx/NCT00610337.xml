  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase IIb study to be&#xD;
      conducted in North America and Europe and will include male and female subjects with acute&#xD;
      cervical SCI, 18 to 62 years of age, who receive clinical trial material (CTM) within 72&#xD;
      hours of injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being undertaken to evaluate and confirm the safety and efficacy of CETHRIN®.&#xD;
      This adaptive study has been designed to efficiently identify the safest and most effective&#xD;
      dose in Phase IIb which will be evaluated in a future Phase III study. Given the current lack&#xD;
      of effective treatments for SCI, an improvement in motor ability or activities of daily&#xD;
      living in these subjects would be a great advancement in the treatment of SCI.&#xD;
