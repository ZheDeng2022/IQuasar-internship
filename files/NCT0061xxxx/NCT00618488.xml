  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if probiotics bacteria, specifically&#xD;
      bifidobacterium lactis (BB12) improve gastrointestinal symptoms in subjects with functional&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e., non-patients IBS/functional bowel disorders).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The apparent success of the use of probiotics in several gut disorders (e.g., IBD and&#xD;
      rotavirus diarrhea) together with the greater understanding of the role of inflammation and&#xD;
      intestinal microflora in the pathophysiology of functional bowel disorders has led to&#xD;
      increased interest in use of probiotics in patients with these symptoms. The data on the use&#xD;
      of probiotic in certain functional GI disorders (e.g., IBS, bloating, diarrhea) is limited&#xD;
      but several reported studies show encouraging results and suggest some symptomatic response&#xD;
      and parallel improvement in quality of life. Functional Bowel Disorders (FBD) - According to&#xD;
      the Rome II criteria FBD refer to symptoms attributed to the mid or lower GI tract. FBD&#xD;
      include several clinical subgroups including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional&#xD;
      diarrhea, functional constipation, functional abdominal bloating, and an unspecified group.&#xD;
      This study will examine 'Non-Patients IBS,' these are people who have functional&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms but do not sought out medical care for their GI symptoms and&#xD;
      therefore they are referred to as 'Non-patients'. This study will investigate the overall&#xD;
      effect of probiotic bacteria (BB12) on GI symptoms in non-patients subjects with functional&#xD;
      bowel symptoms (FBS).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is 18 - 70 y/o.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has any functional GI symptoms that are related to IBS, functional&#xD;
             diarrhea, functional constipation, or functional bloating according to the Rome II&#xD;
             criteria for functional GI disorders. The subject has the above symptoms for at least&#xD;
             two weeks (i.e., active symptoms on enrollment). The subject has not been seen by a&#xD;
             medical care provider for these symptoms in the 10 months and is not taking prescribed&#xD;
             medications for these symptoms. Over the counter (OTC) medications are allowed as long&#xD;
             as the subject is still symptomatic despite current OTC therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For diarrhea we will use the definition of a mean of &gt;2 bowel movements per day, or a&#xD;
             mean score of &gt; 4 on the Bristol Stool Form Scale per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For constipation we will use the definition of a mean of &lt;3 bowel movements per week&#xD;
             or a need for significant straining for a bowel movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject's symptoms are mild to moderate in severity. Symptoms severity will be&#xD;
             assessed at baseline and at the end of the 2-weeks screening period to determine&#xD;
             eligibility prior randomization. Severity of bowel symptoms will be determined using&#xD;
             the Francis Whorwell IBS severity scale: Mild &lt;175, Moderate 175-300, Severe &gt;300&#xD;
