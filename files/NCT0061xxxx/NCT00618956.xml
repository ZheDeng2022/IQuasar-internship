  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to accurately assess any changes in blood pressure and pulse at 100 and&#xD;
      200 mg daily dose of milnacipran in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is double blind (neither you nor the physician will know if you are receiving&#xD;
      active study drug or placebo, an inactive compound such as a sugar pill) and it is being&#xD;
      conducted at various research centers in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study staff determines that you are eligible and you decide to participate, there will&#xD;
      be approximately 11 study visits in about 3 months. During these visits, you will undergo&#xD;
      routine health exams and complete different kinds of questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study requires that you wear a blood pressure cuff continuously for 24 hours on three&#xD;
      separate occasions. You will also be required to make multiple same-day visits to the study&#xD;
      site on three separate occasions for blood draws.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To be eligible to participate in the study, patients must meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients may be male or female between the ages of 18 and 70 years, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients must have been diagnosed of primary fibromyalgia, as defined by the 1990&#xD;
                  ACR Criteria for the Classification of Fibromyalgia&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Females must be either postmenopausal (no menses for at least 1 year),&#xD;
                  posthysterectomy, postoophorectomy (bilateral), or, if of childbearing potential,&#xD;
                  must have a negative urine pregnancy test prior to randomization and be using a&#xD;
                  medically acceptable form of contraception (eg, hormonal birth control, IUD,&#xD;
                  double-barrier method [eg, simultaneous use of two of the following: male condom,&#xD;
                  female condom, diaphragm], or a barrier method plus a spermicidal agent&#xD;
                  [contraceptive foam, jelly, or cream])&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Patients must have the ability to give written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Patients may have hypertension untreated or treated with a maximum of two&#xD;
                  antihypertensive medications. (Note: medications contributing to a combination&#xD;
                  product(s) will each be considered as a separate medication.) If untreated, the&#xD;
                  patient should be stable, with no expectation of initiating treatment during the&#xD;
                  study. If treated, the patient must have been on stable doses of antihypertensive&#xD;
                  medications for at least 2 months, with the expectation that dose adjustments&#xD;
                  will not be necessary for the duration of the study. A patient will be classified&#xD;
                  as hypertensive if the patient is taking antihypertensive medication, has a SBP&#xD;
                  equal to or greater than 130 mm Hg, or has a DBP equal to or greater than 85 mm&#xD;
                  Hg. A patient will be classified as normotensive if he/she is not on&#xD;
                  antihypertensive medication and has a SBP less than 130 mm Hg and DBP less than&#xD;
                  85 mm Hg&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Patients must have a mean of two sitting SBP measurements of less than 160 mm Hg&#xD;
                  and sitting DBP less than 100 mm Hg at Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 2&#xD;
                  (Baseline/Randomization) using an automatic office blood pressure monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Patients must have normal physical examination findings, clinical laboratory&#xD;
                  results, and electrocardiogram (ECG) results from Visit 1 (Screening) or abnormal&#xD;
                  findings judged not clinically significant by the Investigator and documented as&#xD;
                  such in the eCRF&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Patients must be willing to withdraw from CNS-active therapies marketed as&#xD;
                  antidepressants, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclics,&#xD;
                  tetracyclics, selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), noradrenaline&#xD;
                  reuptake inhibitors (NARIs), noradrenaline-serotonin reuptake inhibitors (NSRI),&#xD;
                  serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and St. John's Wort&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. Patients must be willing to withdraw from pregabalin (Lyrica) or gabapentin&#xD;
                  (Neurontin).&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. Patients must be willing to withdraw from stimulant medications such as those&#xD;
                  used to treat attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&#xD;
                  (eg, amphetamine/dextroamphetamine [Adderall], methylphenidate,&#xD;
                  dextroamphetamine) or the fatigue associated with sleep apnea or shift work (eg,&#xD;
                  modafinil)&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. Patients must be willing to withdraw from anorectic agents such as diethylpropion&#xD;
                  , sibutramine (Meridia), and phentermine (Adipex)&#xD;
&#xD;
              12. Patients must be willing to withhold certain medications for the 24 hours before,&#xD;
                  as well as during, any ABPM assessment. These medications include&#xD;
                  phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (eg, Viagra, Levitra, Cialis, Edex, Muse),&#xD;
                  decongestants (eg, pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine), and antimigraine therapies&#xD;
                  (eg, triptans such as Imitrex and Maxalt, ergotamines such as Cafergot and&#xD;
                  Midrin). If, for any reason, the patient takes any of these medications, the ABPM&#xD;
                  visit should be rescheduled so that at least 24 hours have transpired since the&#xD;
                  patient's last use&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who meet any of the following criteria will not be eligible to participate in&#xD;
