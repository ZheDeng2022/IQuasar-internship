      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of Avastin&#xD;
      (bevacizumab) and Torisel (temsirolimus) that can be given, in combination, to patients with&#xD;
      advanced cancer that has spread or is unable to be surgically removed. The safety of this&#xD;
      drug combination will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking the&#xD;
      growth of blood vessels that supply nutrients necessary for tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temsirolimus is designed to block the growth of cancer cells, which may cause cancer cells to&#xD;
      die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of bevacizumab and temsirolimus combined, based on when you joined this study. Up to 13&#xD;
      dose levels of the study drug combination will be tested. Three (3) participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose&#xD;
      level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable&#xD;
      side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of the study drug&#xD;
      combination is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you choose to enroll in the expansion group of patients being treated at the highest&#xD;
      tolerable dose of the study drug combination found, you will be required to undergo added&#xD;
      testing, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have additional blood drawn (about 2 teaspoons each time) during Cycle 1. This&#xD;
           blood will be drawn before you begin taking the study drugs; on Day 1 at about 1, 4, 8,&#xD;
           and 24 hours after the start of your first infusion; at Day 8 of Cycle 1; at Day 15 of&#xD;
           Cycle 1; and at the end of Cycle 1. The blood will be used to see how the study drug&#xD;
           combination acts in the body and to learn its effect on cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have 2 tumor biopsies performed. These samples will be used to see how the&#xD;
           study drug combination acts in the body and to learn its effect on cancer cells. These&#xD;
           tumor biopsies will be performed during the screening visit and at the end of Cycle 1.&#xD;
           To perform a tumor biopsy, the affected area is numbed with anesthetic and some or all&#xD;
           of the tumor tissue is removed with a small knife.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have extra imaging scans performed and used to see how the study drug&#xD;
           combination may be affecting blood vessels that supply nutrients and oxygen to cancer. A&#xD;
           DCE-MRI scan will be performed during the screening visit, at 24-48 hours after the&#xD;
           start of Cycle 1, and at the end of Cycle 1. Like a regular MRI scan, the DCE-MRI scan&#xD;
           involves passing part or all of the body into a long, narrow tube scanner that is open&#xD;
           at both ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab and temsirolimus will be given in &quot;cycles.&quot; Cycles will be about 21 days long or&#xD;
      longer, depending on any side effects you may experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is given by vein on Day 1 of each cycle. On Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will receive it&#xD;
      over 90 minutes. If you tolerate it well in Cycle 1, you will receive it over 60 minutes in&#xD;
      Cycle 2. If you tolerate it well in Cycle 2, you will receive it over 30 minutes in Cycle 3.&#xD;
      It will continue to be given over 30 minutes in Cycle 4 and further cycles, as long as you&#xD;
      still tolerate it well. Also, if the first dose is well tolerated, you may be given the&#xD;
      remaining doses of Bevacizumab in the doctor's office in or near your hometown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temsirolimus is given by vein on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle. During Day 1 of Cycle 1,&#xD;
      you will receive it over 60 minutes. If you tolerate it well on Day 1 of Cycle 1, it will be&#xD;
      given over 30 minutes on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 and over 30 minutes in further cycles, as&#xD;
      long you still tolerate it well. Also, if the first dose is well tolerated, you may be given&#xD;
      the remaining doses of Temsirolimus in the doctor's office in or near your hometown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a physical exam and blood drawn (about 1 tablespoon each time) for routine&#xD;
      tests once between Days 7 and 14 during Cycle 1. During the rest of the cycles, you will have&#xD;
      a physical exam and blood drawn (about 1 tablespoon each time) for routine tests once every 3&#xD;
      weeks. The status of the disease will be checked by a CT or MRI scan after every 2 cycles,&#xD;
      starting after Cycle 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue to receive additional cycles of the study drugs, unless the cancer gets&#xD;
      worse or intolerable side effects occur. In that case, you will be taken off study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once your participation is over in this study, you will receive standard-of-care follow-up&#xD;
      for the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Bevacizumab and temsirolimus are commercially available.&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is FDA approved for the treatment of colorectal cancer and a type of lung cancer.&#xD;
      Temsirolimus is FDA approved for the treatment of kidney cancer that has spread. The&#xD;
      combination of bevacizumab and temsirolimus is not FDA approved. At this time, it is being&#xD;
      used in research only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 183 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
