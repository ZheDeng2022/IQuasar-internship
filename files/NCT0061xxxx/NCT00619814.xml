  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research protocol aim is to compare diagnostic tools for the proper evaluation of patient&#xD;
      with fecal occult blood test positive (FOBT +), a routine screening test for colorecatl&#xD;
      carcinoma. The purpose of this study is to determine if Double Contrast Barium Enema (DCBE),&#xD;
      a specialized radiographic exam of the colon, is a reasonable alternative for the evaluation&#xD;
      of patients with positive fecal occult blood as compared to colonoscopy, which is considered&#xD;
      the best evaluation method. Colonoscopy involves the direct visualization of the colon using&#xD;
      a flexible instrument. This permits the removal of polyps and to obtain biopsies. It involves&#xD;
      additional risks, discomfort and costs. In fact the DCBE is the experimental procedure in&#xD;
      this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional aims of this study are: to determine the localization, number, size and pathologic&#xD;
      characteristics, if applicable, of findings in colonoscopy and/or DCBE and to determine the&#xD;
      patient preference between both studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is limited to those patients 50 years or older who are at average risk for colon&#xD;
      cancer and who had a positive fecal occult blood screening test.&#xD;

    <description>This is a blinded cohort study comparing double contrast barium enema (DCBE) and colonoscopy in detecting polyps and/or cancer in patients with positive FOBT. Initial evaluation consisted of complete clinical history and physical examination. A DCBE and a colonoscopy were performed in all patients. All polyps identified during colonoscopy were removed and classified by histology. Sensitivity and specificity of DCBE for polyp and/or cancer detection was determined. Tolerability and grade of satisfaction with study procedures was assessed.</description>
