      reducing gambling behaviors in pathological gamblers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pathological gambling is a chronic disorder in which a person is unable to control the urge&#xD;
      to gamble. People who are pathological gamblers constantly think about gambling, and they may&#xD;
      feel restless when not able to gamble. A pathological gambler's addiction to the thrill of&#xD;
      gambling may lead to serious relationship, career, and debt problems. The number of&#xD;
      pathological gamblers in the United States is steadily growing, leading to significant&#xD;
      financial, psychological, and public health consequences. However, studies examining the&#xD;
      effectiveness of treatments for pathological gamblers are limited. Forms of psychotherapy,&#xD;
      such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and addiction support groups comprise some of the&#xD;
      commonly used treatments for pathological gamblers. This study will compare the effectiveness&#xD;
      of three different treatment strategies, including psychoeducation therapy plus case&#xD;
      management, CBT, and CBT plus contingency management (CM), in reducing gambling behaviors and&#xD;
      other problems related to pathological gambling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last 2 years. All potential participants will undergo an&#xD;
      initial screening that will include questions about gambling behaviors and related problems&#xD;
      and psychiatric, medical, social, legal, and substance abuse history. Eligible participants&#xD;
      will be referred to Gambler's Anonymous (GA) and will be randomly assigned to one of three&#xD;
      treatment groups. All participants will attend a 50-minute session of their assigned&#xD;
      treatment each week for 8 weeks. They will also be encouraged to attend GA meetings during&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 participants will receive psychoeducation therapy plus case management. Therapy&#xD;
           sessions will include education about gambling and related problems. The case management&#xD;
           component of treatment will offer help with obtaining additional services from the&#xD;
           community as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 participants will attend CBT sessions, which will include learning about the&#xD;
           triggers that lead to gambling, developing alternatives to gambling, and avoiding&#xD;
           relapse after stopping gambling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3 participants will receive CM in addition to CBT, as described above. The CM&#xD;
           component of treatment will encourage participants to partake in activities unrelated to&#xD;
           gambling by awarding vouchers, such as a gift certificate to a store or restaurant, to&#xD;
           participants for completing the alternative activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gambling, substance use, and psychosocial problems will be assessed at pretreatment and&#xD;
      Months 2, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 follow-up evaluations. Participants will also be asked to&#xD;
      identify at least one person who is aware of their gambling problem and whom they regularly&#xD;
      contact. Researchers will interview the contact person by phone at pretreatment and Months 2,&#xD;
      6, 12, and 24. The interview will include questions about the participant's gambling&#xD;
      behaviors, personal relationships, legal status, use of health care and mental health&#xD;
      services, and any possible change of contact information.&#xD;
