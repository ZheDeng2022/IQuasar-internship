      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of variable definitions of exercise and disparate results, emphasize the need of proper&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials examining the relationship between physical activity and weight&#xD;
      development during pregnancy. So far, only few intervention studies aiming at weight&#xD;
      management during pregnancy have been performed (Gray-Donald et al., 2000,Olson et al.,&#xD;
      2004,Polley et al., 2002,Kinnunen et al., 2007). Moreover, most of these interventions have&#xD;
      focused on how gestational weight gain may be altered through individual counselling&#xD;
      combining diet and exercise habits, rather than supervised training. Search on PubMed&#xD;
      revealed no randomized controlled trial where the main outcome was to investigate how the&#xD;
      effect of supervised structured exercise may reduce the proportion of women gaining more&#xD;
      weight than optimal. The aim of the present study is to assess whether a 12-week aerobic&#xD;
      exercise program during pregnancy can prevent excessive gestational weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single blind randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of a structured,&#xD;
      supervised aerobic exercise program on weight gain stabilization in primiparous pregnant&#xD;
      women. The aim is to include 100 women. Interested women eligible for the present study will&#xD;
      be invited to a pre-test including interview and assessments at the university. The women are&#xD;
      examined three times during the study period. The first visit is between 12 and 24 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation, the second at week 36-38 and the last 8-12 week after delivery. The exercise&#xD;
      program consists of supervised exercise for 60 minutes, performed at least 2 times per week,&#xD;
      for 12-16 weeks. Compliance with the training protocol is controlled by the instructors and&#xD;
      registrations in the womens personal training diary&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from population-based surveys and longitudinal observational studies generally support&#xD;
      that inactive men and women have higher body weight and BMI than physically active adults (US&#xD;
      Departmentof Health and Human Services, 1996,Williamson et al., 1993,Sherwood et al.,&#xD;
      2000,Anderssen et al., 2007). Studies examining the impact of exercise on maternal weight&#xD;
      gain are varied and limited. Two different meta- analysis's found no difference in maternal&#xD;
      weight gain between exercisers and non-exercisers (Kramer, 2002,Lokey et al., 1991). In a&#xD;
      review from 2004 it is suggested that women who exercise before pregnancy and continue to do&#xD;
      so during pregnancy tend to weigh less and gain less weight that controls (Siega-Riz et al.,&#xD;
      2004). A recent study of Haakstad et al (Haakstad et al., 2007) found that women who&#xD;
      continued to exercise regularly in the 3rd trimester had significantly lower total weight&#xD;
      gain. In addition, women reporting high exercise frequency in the 3rd trimester ( ≥ 4 times&#xD;
      per week), the proportion exceeding IOM's weight gain recommendations was significantly lower&#xD;
      compared to women exercising less frequently (1-3 times per week)(Haakstad et al., 2007).&#xD;
      These results indicate that there may be a dose-respons relationship, with higher levels of&#xD;
      exercising being more effective than moderate and low levels for the prevention of high&#xD;
      maternal weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, only few intervention studies aiming at weight management during pregnancy have been&#xD;
      performed (Gray-Donald et al., 2000,Olson et al., 2004,Polley et al., 2002,Kinnunen et al.,&#xD;
      2007). Moreover, most of these interventions have focused on how gestational weight gain may&#xD;
      be altered through individual counselling combining diet and exercise habits, rather than&#xD;
      supervised training. Search on PubMed revealed no randomized controlled trial where the main&#xD;
      outcome was to investigate how the effect of supervised structured exercise may reduce the&#xD;
      proportion of women gaining more weight than optimal. The aim of the present study is to&#xD;
      assess whether a 12-week aerobic exercise program during pregnancy can prevent excessive&#xD;
      gestational weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants This is a single blind randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of a&#xD;
      structured, supervised aerobic exercise program on weight gain stabilization in primiparous&#xD;
      pregnant women. Participants will be recruited via health practitioners (physicians,&#xD;
      midwifes), articles and advertisement in the newspapers, official websites for pregnant&#xD;
      women, through flyers and word of mouth. The aim is to include 100 women. With power = 0.85&#xD;
      and alfa = 5%, the present study is designed to detect a standardized difference in total&#xD;
      weight gain of 0.6. Assuming that the standard deviation of weight gain is 5 kilos, then the&#xD;
      actual weight gain has to be ∆= 3 kilos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/exclusion At first contact by phone, the aim and implications of the study are&#xD;
      explained and the eligibility criteria are checked. Primiparous women who have not&#xD;
      participated in a structured exercise program, including significant amounts of walking for&#xD;
      the past six months is eligible for the trial. Other inclusion criteria are ability to read,&#xD;
      write and speak Norwegian, and to be within their first 24 weeks of pregnancy. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria is severe heart disease, pregnancy induced hypertension, history of more than two&#xD;
      miscarriages, persistent bleeding after week 12 of gestation, poorly controlled thyroid&#xD;
      disease, poorly controlled pre-eclampsia and other diseases that could interfere with&#xD;
      participation (Artal and O'Toole, 2003). In addition, all women who live to far from the&#xD;
      university to be able to attend weekly training groups will be ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure and outcome measures Interested women eligible for the present study will be&#xD;
      invited to a pre-test including interview and assessments at the university. All visits are&#xD;
      accomplished during daytime and at normal working hours. The women are examined three times&#xD;
      during the study period. The first visit is between 12 and 24 weeks of gestation, the second&#xD;
      at week 36-38 and the last 8-12 week after delivery. Each visit lasts about 60-75 minutes.&#xD;
      There is no induction to the exercise program before gestation week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first appointment, the principal investigator (LH) completes an initial interview and&#xD;
      health screening with all participants. The requirements of the study are explained and&#xD;
      possible contraindications for exercise are identified again. Data from the Pregnancy Health&#xD;
      Card is registered. The baseline questionnaire covers demographic information (e.g. age,&#xD;
      pregnancy week, smoking habits, education, occupation), assessment of daily life physical&#xD;
      activity and sedentary behaviour (at work, in transportation and household). In addition,&#xD;
      there is registration of pregnancy complications (e.g. pelvic girdle and low back pain,&#xD;
      urinary incontinence, high blood pressure, pre-eclampsia, vomiting, fatigue). The second&#xD;
      questionnaire is self administrated and includes questions about perceived quality of life&#xD;
      and health status the last four weeks. Finally, the women's pre-pregnancy weight is&#xD;
      registered and hight and weight is measured using a digital beam scale. Anthropometric&#xD;
      estimation of maternal body composition is assessed by Holtain caliper, measuring left side&#xD;
      skinfold thickness of the triceps, abdomen and thigh. Each measurement is done twice and held&#xD;
      for 5-10 seconds. A mean value of the two is computed. If the two skinfold assessments differ&#xD;
      more than 2mm, the skinfold is measured a third time and the mean of the three values are&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same assessments described above are obtained at the second visit (week 36-38 of&#xD;
      gestation). At the third and last visit (8-12 week postpartum), the women will also report&#xD;
      infant birth weight and complications during delivery. The women are asked to bring health&#xD;
      the journal from the hospital and the Infant Health Card&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will complete two sub maximal step treadmill tests. One test immediately after&#xD;
      randomization and the second test at week 36-38 of gestation. The main sub maximal functional&#xD;
      outcome is oxygen uptake and lactate measurements. After adjustments to the treadmill, nose&#xD;
      clip and mouthpiece, all participants start walking on an initial speed of 4.5 km/h. The&#xD;
      inclination will elevate each fourth minutes with exactly 4%. Blood pressure, heart rate and&#xD;
      rating of perceived exertion (6-20 scale) (Borg, 1970) are measured during the last two&#xD;
      minutes of every step after steady state is reached based on stable oxygen uptake&#xD;
      measurements. Capillary blood sample for measuring blood lactate is assessed in the 30 second&#xD;
      pause after each step. The test is determined after 12-20 minutes when the subjects blood&#xD;
      lactate concentration rise about 1.5 mMol∙L-1 above resting level or perceive physical&#xD;
      exertion between 15-17 (Borg scale) and/or a heart rate &lt; 85% of expected maximal heart rate.&#xD;
      The same exercise physiologist will perform both tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants gave written consent to participate, and the procedures to be followed are&#xD;
      in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible regional committee on human&#xD;
      experimentation and adhered to the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. The&#xD;
      project was received and approved by The Committee for Medical Research Ethics, Southern&#xD;
      Norway, Oslo, Norway, on 20 February 2006 (reference number S-05208). Additionally, the&#xD;
      Norwegian Social Sciences Data Services (NNT) provided licence to store and register&#xD;
      individual health information (reference number 17804/2/KH). All data will be stored and&#xD;
      locked in a fireproof cabinet and are in accordance with requisitions from NNT. The inclusion&#xD;
      of women to the trial started in Sept 2007 and will continue till 100 participants are&#xD;
      randomly allocated to the exercise and control groups. All follow-up procedures are expected&#xD;
      to finish within Mars 2009. There is no financial compensation to the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization procedure The randomization procedure will take place after determination of&#xD;
      eligibility, completed baseline examination and measurement of primary outcome variables.&#xD;
      Based on a statistical randomization computer program, an independent person is assigning the&#xD;
      participants to the two groups. The participants will be informed not to reveal any&#xD;
      information about which group they are assigned for to the principal investigator (LH). The&#xD;
      principal investigator is not involved in the training of the women and is blinded to group&#xD;
      allocation while making the outcome measures and plotting all data. It has not been&#xD;
      considered ethically incorrect to use a control group not receiving treatment in present&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise program The exercise program consists of supervised exercise for 60 minutes,&#xD;
      performed at least 2 times per week, for 12-16 weeks. Since most participants are working&#xD;
      full time, the exercise groups are arranged in the evening. Each session starts with ca 5&#xD;
      minutes warm up, followed by 30 minutes of aerobic activity, including cool down. This is&#xD;
      followed by 15 minutes of strength training of the upper and lower limbs, and special focus&#xD;
      on the deep abdominal stabilization muscles (the transversus abdominus muscle, pelvic floor&#xD;
      and back muscles). The last 5 minutes contains stretching, relaxation and body awareness&#xD;
      exercises. Aerobic exercises include only low impact exercise (no jumping or running). Step&#xD;
      length and body rotations are reduced to a minimum, and crossings of legs and sharp and&#xD;
      sudden changes of position are avoided. The exercise-program follows the ACOG exercise&#xD;
      prescription, and all aerobic activities will be performed at moderate intensity (60-70% of&#xD;
      maximal heart rate), measured by ratings of perceived exertion at 11-14 (somewhat hard) on&#xD;
      the 6-20 Borg's rating scale. The exercise program is choreographed and led by certified&#xD;
      aerobic instructors, and each session includes maximum 25 participants. In addition to&#xD;
      joining the scheduled aerobic classes, all women are motivated to include 30 minutes of&#xD;
      moderate self-imposed physical activity on the rest of the week-days. They will also be&#xD;
      advised to incorporate short bouts of activity into their daily schedules. For example,&#xD;
      participants are encouraged to walk instead of drive short distances and to use stairs&#xD;
      instead of elevators. The participants are asked to keep daily records of their minutes of&#xD;
      physical activity. Compliance with the training protocol is controlled by the instructors and&#xD;
      registrations in the womens personal training diary. Control-participants are neither&#xD;
      encouraged nor discouraged from exercising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Analysis will be completed to assess the effects of the intervention on&#xD;
      two primary and five secondary outcomes: Primary outcomes are overall weight gain during&#xD;
      pregnancy and proportion of participants exceeding weight gain above IOM recommendations.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are pregnancy complications, relationship between oxygen consumption,&#xD;
      heart rate and blood lactate concentration at submaximal work loads, infant birth weight,&#xD;
      length of labour and complications during delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal analysis will be done on an intention to treat basis. Missing values are&#xD;
      carried forward by their baseline values. The primary dependant variables are total weight&#xD;
      gain and the proportion of women who exceed the IOM recommendations. Average total weight&#xD;
      gain is compared between the two groups and the possible difference is tested using two-sided&#xD;
      independent sample t-test. The group differences in the proportion of participants who gained&#xD;
      weight above the IOM guidelines are tested by using two-sided X2-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes; self-report of complications during pregnancy and delivery, as well&#xD;
      as number of high birth weight infants (≥4200 g) (Skjaerven et al., 2000,Orskou et al., 2003)&#xD;
      will be compared between the intervention and control group and tested using X2-test or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test. The two-sided independent sample t-test is used to test the difference&#xD;
      in submaximal cardiorespiratory capacity, gestation weeks at delivery, infant's birth weight&#xD;
      and duration of labour. In all statistical analysis, level of statistical significance is set&#xD;
      at p&lt;0.05. Professor of biostatistics, Ingar Holme, Norwegian Scholl of Sport Science, is&#xD;
      advising the present study.&#xD;
