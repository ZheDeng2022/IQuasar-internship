  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to see if pulmonary rehabilitation can improve&#xD;
      patients' lung function, which would increase their chances of becoming eligible for surgery.&#xD;
      The health of pulmonary rehabilitation participants after surgery will also be examined.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary rehabilitation is a process that is designed to improve patients' lung function,&#xD;
      muscular conditioning, exercise performance, and overall quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study activities include exercise training, patient and family education, and psychosocial&#xD;
      and behavioral counseling provided by a healthcare team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehabilitation plans will vary patient by patient based on the results of the following&#xD;
      tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (1-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG -- a test that measures the electrical activity&#xD;
           of the heart).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an X-ray of your chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a Pulmonary Function Test. For this test, you will be asked to breathe in&#xD;
           several different ways while you have a mouthpiece in your mouth to test your lung&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you choose to take part in this study, you will have 3-4 weeks of pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation. During the 3-4 week period, you will have 9-12 study visits that will last&#xD;
      about 90 minutes each. The following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      6-Minute Walk Test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform the 6-minute walk test, you will walk as far as possible around cones on a flat&#xD;
      indoor course that is about 40 yards long. You will walk at your own pace and can take breaks&#xD;
      at any time. After 6 minutes, the study staff will check the total distance you have walked.&#xD;
      Your vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate) will be&#xD;
      measured before and after the walk. Your oxygen saturation levels will be monitored&#xD;
      throughout the test. You will wear a small clip on your finger that will send the oxygen&#xD;
      saturation data to a small computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxygen Consumption Test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An oxygen consumption study will help the doctor determine how well your heart and lungs work&#xD;
      while you exercise. You will be asked to pedal on a bicycle that does not move, while wearing&#xD;
      a mouthpiece to measure the amount of oxygen you take in. Wires will be placed on your chest&#xD;
      to monitor your heart activity, and a blood pressure cuff will be placed on your arm to&#xD;
      monitor your blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of exercise you can do will be measured by increasing the resistance you pedal&#xD;
      against. You should continue pedaling until you become short of breath or too tired to keep&#xD;
      going. You may stop exercising at any time if you become very uncomfortable or experience&#xD;
      dizziness, chest pains, and/or shortness of breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During or after the oxygen consumption test, blood (about 2 teaspoons) may be drawn to&#xD;
      measure the amount of oxygen in your blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you live outside of the Houston area, you will be referred to a pulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
      program in your local area. Any records from the outside pulmonary rehabilitation facility&#xD;
      will be given to the study staff after the study is completed. You will have your follow-up&#xD;
      visits (described below) at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your health status will be checked at 1 and 3 months after your last study visit if you do&#xD;
      not have surgery, or 1 and 3 months after your surgery. At these follow-up visits, the&#xD;
      following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a 6-minute walk test, a Pulmonary Function Test, and an Oxygen Consumption&#xD;
           Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked to fill out a quality-of-life questionnaire that should take about 30&#xD;
           minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked how well you are able to perform the normal activities of daily living&#xD;
           (performance status evaluation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An echocardiogram will be done on a patient-by patient basis. An echocardiogram uses&#xD;
           sound waves to make pictures of your heart, which helps show how well your heart pumps&#xD;
           blood. You will be asked to lie on your left side while a technician places a probe with&#xD;
           gel on your chest to create images of your heart to determine the function and size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research staff may contact you by phone regarding your health status. Patients who have&#xD;
      lung surgery may be contacted by phone or have their medical records reviewed during the&#xD;
      course of 30 days after surgery or during hospitalization for surgery (hospitalization may&#xD;
      last more than 30 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Using pulmonary rehabilitation to try to improve patients'&#xD;
      lung function is considered experimental. At this time, it is being done in research only. Up&#xD;
      to 75 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
