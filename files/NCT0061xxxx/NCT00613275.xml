  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Boston University Medical Center, funded by the National Cancer Institutes will train&#xD;
      health workers at six of its affiliated Community Health Centers to guide patients through&#xD;
      the cancer care system. The project will help to teach patients how to communicate more&#xD;
      effectively with their health care team in order to understand the treatment options&#xD;
      available to them. Although not widely available, it is believed patient navigation programs&#xD;
      are beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study will evaluate how well this tool works, especially among those who&#xD;
      experience disparities in health care. The goal is to determine if having a trained navigator&#xD;
      shortens the time between an abnormal test result and a definitive diagnosis and between a&#xD;
      definitive diagnosis and completion of treatment for breast and Cervical cancer patients. The&#xD;
      project also will evaluate whether navigation improves the ability to communicate with the&#xD;
      doctor, satisfaction with patient's care and quality of life.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Racial and ethnic minority groups and low-income persons experience significantly higher&#xD;
      cancer mortality rates than other Americans. These disparities are due to at least two&#xD;
      factors: (1) delays in follow-up of abnormal cancer screening results and (2) suboptimal&#xD;
      management of diagnosed cancer. Patient navigation represents a promising means for&#xD;
      addressing disparities by improving cancer related management for minority and other&#xD;
      underserved populations. However, patient navigation for cancer has yet to be evaluated&#xD;
      through a well-designed randomized controlled trial. Furthermore, patient navigation is&#xD;
      likely to prove most effective and sustainable when it is integrated into primary care and&#xD;
      helps patients be more active in their care. This combination of patient empowerment and&#xD;
      engagement is referred to as &quot;activation.&quot; The aim of this project is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness and costs of such a program in a rigorous manner so that the results can be&#xD;
      generalized and the program can be widely disseminated and implemented. We will develop,&#xD;
      implement, and evaluate a primary care-based, patient navigation-activation program using&#xD;
      specially-trained patient Navigators who work within one of the six affiliated Community&#xD;
      Health Centers. We propose to investigate the effect of this intervention on timing and&#xD;
      quality of cancer-related care. Secondary aims examine the impact of navigation on&#xD;
      disparities in care, improvement in patient activation, and total costs. Project findings&#xD;
      will inform national policy regarding patient navigation for cancer.&#xD;
