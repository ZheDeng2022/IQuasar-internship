    <textblock>
      Delirium is rather common among patients in Intensive Care Units (ICU), while little is known&#xD;
      about its incidence in ventilator-dependent patients transferred to a Weaning Center (WC),&#xD;
      once in a phase of clinical stability. We will prospectively evaluate for the presence of&#xD;
      delirium all the ventilator-dependent patients admitted to our WC over a period of two years.&#xD;
      They will be monitored using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC),&#xD;
      previously validated in the ICU setting. This evaluation is based on a score based on 8 items&#xD;
      obtained with a simple examination by the attending physician. The final sum generates a&#xD;
      score considered normal (0-1), borderline (2-3) and pathologic (&gt;4). All the patients, except&#xD;
      those with normal score, will also be evaluated by a psychiatrist, using the Diagnostic&#xD;
      Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), considered the gold standard. The score will be assessed&#xD;
      at patient's admission, at mid-hospital stay and at discharge.&#xD;

      Delirium has been defined, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental&#xD;
      Disorders (DSM IV), as a disturbance of consciousness characterized by an acute onset and&#xD;
      fluctuating course. This impairment of cognitive functions, not being accounted for by a&#xD;
      pre-existing dementia, reduces the patient's ability to receive, process and recall&#xD;
      informations and its main features are inattention, disorganized thinking and reduced clarity&#xD;
      of awareness of the environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients transferred from an intensive care unit to our respiratory weaning centre (RWC)&#xD;
      will be screened for the occurrence of delirium. Our RWC is a 7-bed unit located within the&#xD;
      respiratory department of a rehabilitation hospital and is fully equipped for invasive and&#xD;
      non-invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) and for invasive and noninvasive cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      monitoring. Patients are generally transferred to our unit from a general or surgical ICU for&#xD;
      weaning from MV or, in case of patients already weaned, for rehabilitation, monitoring and&#xD;
      intensive nursing care. All patients or their next of kin will give written informed consent&#xD;
      to participate to the study and the study protocol has been approved by the local ethics&#xD;
      committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the assessment of delirium we use the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist&#xD;
      (ICDSC),a diagnostic tool already validated in the intensive care setting even in&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated patients. It is based on the assessment of 8 different items dealing&#xD;
      with the patient's mental status: each one is scored 0 or 1 in case of, respectively, absence&#xD;
      or presence of the item itself and the final score is the resultant of the sum of the&#xD;
      different items (see the appendix 1 for further details). The evaluation is performed on a&#xD;
      daily basis by the physician in charge and the ICDSC score is ranked in the following way: 0&#xD;
      to 1 is considered normal, 2 to 3 is considered borderline, (i.e. indicative of a&#xD;
      subsyndromal delirious state) and 4 or greater is considered diagnostic for delirium (13). In&#xD;
      presence of a score greater than 1 the psychiatrist is called for consultation and diagnostic&#xD;
      confirmation. Upon discharge of the patient from our RWC a score trend is drawn for every&#xD;
      patient using the three highest scores sampled during the phases of admission, of mid stay&#xD;
      and of discharge. Cases of overt delirium (only patients with ICDSC score ≥4) are categorized&#xD;
      as hyperactive or hypoactive, according to a currently accepted classification. Treatment of&#xD;
      delirium, when properly diagnosed, is instituted according to the psychiatist's&#xD;
      prescriptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's data collection include demographic data (age, gender), severity score (SAPS II),&#xD;
      reason for admission (i.e. need for mechanical ventilation (MV) or not (NMV)) and previous&#xD;
      episodes of delirium (hyperactive forms) occurring during ICU stay not linked to a&#xD;
      pre-existing mental disease or to an acquired brain failure of vascular, metabolic or&#xD;
      infectious origin. The Kelly scale is used for the assessment of the level of consciousness:&#xD;
      the patient is considered comatose in presence of a persistent (&gt;24 hours) Kelly score of ≥4.&#xD;
      As far as the use of sedatives and analgesics in our RWC is concerned, our policy is based on&#xD;
      the avoidance of continuous infusions regimens and on the limitation to the use of those&#xD;
      drugs with a known or suspected capability to induce delirium; each drug is prescribed when&#xD;
      strictly needed according to the judgement of the physician on duty and is targeted to the&#xD;
      treatment of the specific symptom: pain, anxiety, insomnia etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of variance for repeated measures (MANOVA) is employed for statistical analysis, and&#xD;
      a p value lower than 0.05 is considered the threshold value for statistical significance.&#xD;
