  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a way to accurately treat brain tumors. SRS involves the&#xD;
      use of a special head frame to keep the head from moving during treatment. The head frame&#xD;
      makes very accurate treatment possible. The frame must be attached to the skull with special&#xD;
      pins. It feels very tight and can hurt. A special immobilization device can be used to keep&#xD;
      the head from moving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This device does not need any pins and does not hurt. We would like to see if the new way of&#xD;
      holding the head still can be used for SRS. This is the purpose of the study. New X-Ray&#xD;
      machines can be used to find if the head has moved in the mask. We hope that we can use these&#xD;
      new tools to treat brain tumors just as accurately without using a head frame. It will make&#xD;
      treatment more comfortable for the patient. This is why we are asking patients to join the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <description>This is a feasibility study to evaluate the accuracy of an alternative, non-invasive immobilization system in combination with image guided patient setup for SRS treatments. The aim is to determine whether or not the non-invasive system can provide comparable accuracy as the conventional invasive head ring system. If successful, patient discomfort can be significantly reduced for such treatments.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed malignancy with the presence of intraparenchymal brain&#xD;
             metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnostic contrast enhanced MRI demonstrating the presence of brain metastases&#xD;
             performed within two weeks prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be scheduled or planning to be scheduled for SRS treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥60.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must sign a study-specific informed consent form. If the patient's mental&#xD;
             status precludes his/her giving informed consent, written informed consent may be&#xD;
             given by the patient's legal representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major medical illness including poor cardiac or pulmonary status which would result in&#xD;
             inability of the patient to lie down for the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to obtain histologic proof of malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Younger than 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 1.3 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status of ≤50.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy to either CT or MR contrast dyes.&#xD;
