  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bacterial meningitis remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children,&#xD;
      especially in countries with limited resources. Efforts to improve the grim outcome have&#xD;
      included altering the first line antibiotic therapy, controlling seizures and managing fluids&#xD;
      more carefully. Adjuvant therapy of steroids has been used with limited success in children&#xD;
      in the West and with no proven value in Malawi and other resource constrained settings.&#xD;
      Glycerol has been used to reduce brain oedema in neurosurgery and it has recently been shown&#xD;
      to reduce morbidity in childhood meningitis in South America. Paracetamol in a high dosage&#xD;
      has been shown to reduce inflammation and cytokine levels in septicaemia with improved&#xD;
      outcomes in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Malawi the investigators have tried adjuvant steroids with no improvement in outcome of&#xD;
      childhood meningitis. They have recently concluded a study of ceftriaxone which has shown no&#xD;
      improvement in mortality though there is less hearing loss than with chloramphenicol and&#xD;
      benzyl penicillin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the encouraging results of the Childhood South American Study it is important to&#xD;
      assess the use of adjuvant glycerol in children in the investigators' setting. Paracetamol is&#xD;
      routinely used in meningitis because of the accompanying fever and headache. This is an&#xD;
      opportunity to study its place as adjuvant therapy more carefully than has previously been&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a prospective, randomized, double blind 2 by 2 factorial designed&#xD;
      study to assess the advantage of ceftriaxone (antibiotic) given with paracetamol and glycerol&#xD;
      in combination, singly or with neither adjuvant therapy in childhood bacterial meningitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bacterial meningitis (BM) is a major cause of morbidity and death in the developing world.&#xD;
      Hib and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have the potential to prevent meningitis but neither&#xD;
      vaccine is available in many countries with limited resources. New (and expensive)&#xD;
      antimicrobials have done little to improve the prognosis. A background of HIV infection in&#xD;
      many parts of the world adds to the grim prognosis of childhood BM. Adjuvant dexamethasone&#xD;
      has gained much attention, because of its effects in damping the host's inflammatory response&#xD;
      in childhood BM. However, little or no clinical benefit has been observed in several studies.&#xD;
      Most importantly, the first sufficiently powered study in Malawi found no benefit at all.&#xD;
      Another sufficiently powered (N=654) study on childhood BM, recently completed in Latin&#xD;
      America, showed little benefit of dexamethasone even in Hib meningitis but did show benefit&#xD;
      from adjuvant oral glycerol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not known how glycerol works, and there is probably more than one mechanism. One-third&#xD;
      of children with bacterial meningitis suffer from significantly reduced cerebral blood flow&#xD;
      caused by intracranial oedema. Glycerol slightly increases serum osmolality, and this small&#xD;
      change may improve rheology and enhance cerebral circulation, perhaps by increasing perfusion&#xD;
      pressure. Thus, extravascularization of water and hidden hypovolemia is improved. Osmotic&#xD;
      diuresis is of less importance, because urinary output does not increase with these doses (6&#xD;
      ml/kg/day) of glycerol. A gradient between the body compartments would require an intact or&#xD;
      nearly intact blood brain barrier (BBB), and that is not the case in BM. Glycerol is also a&#xD;
      scavenger of free oxygen radicals. This activity may alleviate the inflammation&#xD;
      characteristic of BM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paracetamol is used widely as an antipyretic, analgesic, and anti inflammatory agent. It is&#xD;
      effective, safe, inexpensive, and available as a syrup, tablet, suppository and injection; it&#xD;
      suits all ages. The effect is dose-dependent. There are very few contraindications, eg&#xD;
      allergy. The mechanisms are not well understood, but NSAIDs dampen inflammatory reactions&#xD;
      other than those mediated by inhibition of arachidonic acid metabolism. There are differences&#xD;
      between paracetamol and other NSAIDs: paracetamol inhibits the centrally located COX 3 and&#xD;
      NMDA receptors, other NSAIDs inhibit COX 2 receptors in periphery. These mechanisms may&#xD;
      partly explain the different results in patient outcome. In a retrospective analysis of 809&#xD;
      adult patients with bacteremia in Finland, those who received paracetamol had a better&#xD;
      survival rate than those treated with other NSAIDs or salicylate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective clinical trial on childhood BM in which the value of glycerol is reviewed, and&#xD;
      the potential of paracetamol is examined is warranted. Both adjuvants aim to improve the poor&#xD;
      prognosis of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Prospective, Randomized, and Double-Blind Clinical Study Using a Two-by-Two Factorial&#xD;
      Design to answer two questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can the prognosis of childhood BM be improved by giving adjuvant oral glycerol?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Can the outcome be further improved by large doses of rectal paracetamol?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end points are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. death,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. severe neurological sequelae on discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. post meningitis, severe, sensorineural hearing loss on hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various patient characteristics are taken into account as covariates, eg severity of illness,&#xD;
      age, aetiological agent, haemoglobin level, HIV status and presence of malaria co-infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary end points are&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. audiological or neurological sequelae (according to the Denver-II developmental screening&#xD;
      test).&#xD;
