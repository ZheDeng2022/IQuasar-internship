      Objective: Although there is a high comorbidity of depressive and/or anxiety disorders with&#xD;
      fibromyalgia, information on the clinical implications of this comorbidity is limited. We&#xD;
      investigated whether a history of depressive and/or anxiety disorders was associated with&#xD;
      response to treatment in a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial of paroxetine&#xD;
      controlled release (CR) in fibromyalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: One hundred and sixteen fibromyalgia subjects were randomized to receive paroxetine&#xD;
      CR (dose 12.5-62.5 mg/day) or placebo for 12 weeks. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      Interview (M.I.N.I-plus) was used to ascertain current or past diagnoses of depressive and&#xD;
      anxiety disorders. Patients with current depressive or anxiety disorders were excluded, but&#xD;
      those with past diagnoses were enrolled in the trial. Subjective depression and anxiety were&#xD;
      assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI);&#xD;
      subjects were excluded if they scored greater than 23 on the BDI. Health Status was&#xD;
      determined using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Sheehan Disability Scale&#xD;
      (SDS), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The&#xD;
      primary outcome was treatment response defined as â‰¥ 25% reduction in the Fibromyalgia Impact&#xD;
      Questionnaire (FIQ) score. Secondary outcomes included changes in scores on the Clinical&#xD;
      Global Impression-Severity and Improvement (CGI-S and CGI-I respectively), the Visual&#xD;
      Analogue Scale for Pain (VAS) scores and number of tender points.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the skepticism of some physicians over the very existence of a condition called&#xD;
      Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), most agree that this is a common condition seen in pain clinics.&#xD;
      The syndrome is characterized by widespread pain (1) persistent fatigue (2), and non&#xD;
      restorative sleep (3), and generalized morning stiffness (4). Other syndromes are also&#xD;
      frequently seen and include headaches, TMJ, irritable bowel syndrome, depression, anxiety,&#xD;
      paresthesias and memory loss. FMS may be primary or secondary to other disease states.&#xD;
      Conditions like hypothyroidism may mimic FMS. The prevalence of depression is about 30-35%&#xD;
      (1). FMS affects more women than men (20:1) and the prevalence increases with age so that&#xD;
      about 7% of women over 70 years of age are affected compared to the prevalence rate of about&#xD;
      2% in the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis is based on patients complaints of pain and a clinical examination of multiple&#xD;
      tender points (11/18) as defined by the ACR criteria for FMS (8) or (11 or less) per&#xD;
      Copenhagen declaration. There is no specific laboratory test for FMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The causes are unknown, but many investigators believe that FMS encompasses a spectrum of&#xD;
      diseases with a common pathogenic pathway. Links between FMS and non-restorative deep sleep&#xD;
      has been reported (2). Other changes frequently seen in FMS patients include elevated&#xD;
      interleukin-2 (3), low levels of serum serotonin and its precursor tryptophan (4) and&#xD;
      elevated substance -P levels (5). There has been increasing interest in the effect of&#xD;
      serotonin on pain in recent years. Serum serotonin levels have been shown to be significantly&#xD;
      lower in fibromyalgia patients than in those without fibromyalgia (6). Evidence is available&#xD;
      to suggest that administration of the serotonin precursor tryptophan improves pain symptoms&#xD;
      in a variety of patient cohorts. (7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment is generally multidisciplinary with an emphasis on active patient participation,&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy, physical modalities and medications. (9). A review of the&#xD;
      literature reveals that there is no consensus for the pharmacological treatment for FMS. A&#xD;
      rational polypharmacy is advocated with medications used to improve pain, sleep, fatigue and&#xD;
      other associated symptoms. (10) Oral agents utilized for symptomatic relief include&#xD;
      acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and steroids. Each is associated&#xD;
      with potentially serious medical sequelae with chronic use, and results have been&#xD;
      disappointing. Cyclobenzaprine (flexeril) has shown efficacy for FMS though common side&#xD;
      effects, such as dry mouth and drowsiness, can limit its use. (11) Benzodiazepines and&#xD;
      opiates, which are also utilized for FMS are potentially addictive. Modafinil (Provigil) has&#xD;
      been used to treat the fatigue associated with FMS (12). Case reports have indicated the&#xD;
      usefulness of atypical antipsychotics like olanzapine for the treatment of FMS symptoms (13).&#xD;
      No one medication has been found to control all the symptoms of FMS and the goal of therapy&#xD;
      is to improve pain, function and quality of life by combining the least amount of&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been 21 controlled trials involving antidepressants, most involving tricyclic&#xD;
      antidepressants. A recent meta analysis revealed that compared to placebo, the effect sizes&#xD;
      for tricyclic antidepressants were substantially larger than zero for all measurements (14).&#xD;
      Two randomized placebo controlled trials have examined the SSRI fluoxetine (20 mg per day for&#xD;
      6 weeks) (15,16) and two have examined the SSRI citalopram (20-40 mg per day for 8 weeks)&#xD;
      (17, 18) in the treatment of FMS. These studies had equivocal results; but the trials were&#xD;
      limited by a high dropout rate in the placebo group, a brief trial duration and small sample&#xD;
      sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a more recent study, Wetherhold et al, examined 82 women with fibromyalgia, randomized to&#xD;
      receive either paroxetine (20 mg/day), nabumetone (2000 mg/day) or a combination of&#xD;
      paroxetine (20 mg/day) and nabumetone (2000 mg/day). Patient received each treatment regimen&#xD;
      for a period of 8 weeks. The study demonstrated that the combination regimen was superior to&#xD;
      nabumetone alone, but not to paroxetine alone, in improving the signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      fibromyalgia - suggesting that paroxetine was responsible for the improvement in the combined&#xD;
      regimen (19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, a non-addictive oral agent, with dual action (NE and 5 HT reuptake blockade) and a&#xD;
      relatively benign side effect profile such as paroxetine (Paxil), has the potential to be a&#xD;
      significant addition to the treatment of FMS. Moreover, paroxetine's side effect profile is&#xD;
      favorable to tricyclic antidepressants and therefore would likely be a preferable treatment&#xD;
      option if effective. A recent extended release preparation of paroxetine (Paxil CR) is&#xD;
      prudentially absorbed in the intestine rather than the stomach and is reported to have a more&#xD;
      favorable GI side effect profile and may be particularly suitable for the study. The agent&#xD;
      could be used alone or adjunctively to decrease the patient's requirement for other analgesic&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to study Paxil CR, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, to treat FMS&#xD;
      with particular emphasis on its effect on the full constellation of symptoms associated with&#xD;
      this disorder and quality of life improvement in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our experience physicians from multiple specialties (family&#xD;
      medicine/neurology/physiatry/rheumatology/pain medicine/psychiatry) are increasingly&#xD;
      discussing anecdotal reports of the efficacy of SSRIs in treating FMS symptoms. This study&#xD;
      protocol is intended to evaluate the efficacy of this practice. It is our hypothesis that&#xD;
      paroxetine will be shown to be an effective addition to the treatment as defined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, double blind, parallel group, flexible dose, placebo controlled 12-week study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject number: One hundred and twenty five.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Schedule: (see attached schedule of evaluations)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened for eligibility based on a confirmed diagnosis of FMS (per report&#xD;
      of rheumatologist or treating specialist). Only those meeting eligibility criteria&#xD;
      (inclusion/exclusion criteria) will be permitted to give informed consent to enter the study.&#xD;
      Psychological assessments will be performed using standardized questionnaires at screening,&#xD;
      baseline and defined time points in the study as described in the schedule of evaluations.&#xD;
      After a blood draw for routine labs to exclude other potential treatable conditions, and&#xD;
      pregnancy test (for women), urine testing for illicit drugs and EKG, the participants will&#xD;
      enter a one- week placebo lead-in period; those that show a less than 25% reduction on FIQ&#xD;
      will enter the randomization phase. The routine labs will include the CBC with differential,&#xD;
      SMA-7, liver function tests, thyroid panel, Anti Nuclear antibody (ANA), Rheumatoid factor&#xD;
      (Rh factor), Anti Polymerase Antibody (APA), C-Reactive protein and Erythrocyte Sedimentation&#xD;
      Rate (ESR). Patients will be instructed to swallow the tablets whole and not to crush or chew&#xD;
      them via labels on the medication bottles. Eligible study participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      either paroxetine or placebo (60 patients in each arm). Those in the active treatment group&#xD;
      will receive doses of Paxil CR in the following manner: week 1: 12.5 mg per day, week 2: 25&#xD;
      mg per day, week 3: 37.5 mg per day, wk 4: 50 mg per day and week 5: 62.5 mg per day.&#xD;
      Patients who do not tolerate higher doses will be maintained on the minimum tolerated dose.&#xD;
      The placebo arm will be treated identically except for the content of the capsules. The total&#xD;
      duration of active treatment will be 12 weeks. Patients will be seen weekly for the first 4&#xD;
      weeks and biweekly thereafter. After the final visit, the study medication will be tapered&#xD;
      over 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unblinding procedures in case of emergency:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A list of patient randomization numbers and corresponding treatments will be available with&#xD;
      local Pharmacy. In case of emergency local pharmacy can be called (24 hours) to reveal the&#xD;
      study assignment of the patients. Once blind is broken, the patient will be immediately&#xD;
      discontinued from the study but will be evaluated and treated as warranted by their clinical&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
