  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Successful control of the HIV epidemic will require a safe and effective vaccine to be&#xD;
      developed. A successful vaccine will need to stimulate a widespread immune response. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine the safety of and immune response to an adenovirus&#xD;
      serotype HIV vaccine in HIV uninfected adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV infection continues to spread at pandemic levels throughout the world. Control of this&#xD;
      pandemic can only be achieved with the development of a safe and effective preventive HIV&#xD;
      vaccine. A vaccine that will prevent HIV infection will elicit a strong immune response from&#xD;
      both CD4 and CD8 cells. Recombinant adenovirus serotype vectors have been shown to elicit&#xD;
      just such a response. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and immunogenicity&#xD;
      of the recombinant adenovirus serotype 26 preventive HIV-1 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last 12 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four arms&#xD;
      that will receive different doses of the vaccine or placebo administered via intermuscular&#xD;
      injection. Participants in Arms 1, 2, and 3 will all receive 3 injections. Each injection&#xD;
      will contain the same dose of vaccine. Arm 4 will receive 2 injections of a dose of vaccine&#xD;
      that will be determined by the safety data from Arms 1, 2, and 3. Participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled sequentially, from lowest to highest dose of vaccine, into Arms 1, 2, and 3. Arms&#xD;
      will begin enrollment only following review of safety data from the previous group. After the&#xD;
      Day 42 safety data from Arms 1, 2, and 3 have been reviewed, the dose for Arm 4 will be&#xD;
      determined, and enrollment into that arm will begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 10 study visits in this study, occurring at baseline and after 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2,&#xD;
      6, 6.5, 7, and 12 months. Participants in Arms 1, 2, and 3 will receive injections on Days 0,&#xD;
      28, and 168. Participants in Arm 4 will receive injections on Days 0 and 168. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to record their temperature and other side effects in a symptom log for 7 days&#xD;
      after each injection. Risk reduction/pregnancy prevention counseling will occur at visits 1&#xD;
      through 9, and physical exams and assessments of illness or adverse events will occur at all&#xD;
      visits. At most visits, blood, urine, and oral swab collection will occur. At some visits,&#xD;
      HIV testing and pregnancy testing will occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a year for 5 years following study entry, participants will attend a study visit or will&#xD;
      be contacted by study staff by telephone or e-mail for follow-up safety and health&#xD;
      monitoring. Some participants will also undergo a blood collection at these visits.&#xD;
