      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral pain due to mucosal lesion is quite frequent in oncology, geriatric as well as&#xD;
      palliative care settings. The oncology patient is mainly suffering from radio- and/or&#xD;
      chemotherapy induced oral mucositis. The incidence of oral mucositis in oncology patients&#xD;
      ranges from 15-40% in those receiving stomatotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The degree&#xD;
      of mucositis is variable, but the associated pain is frequent and well documented. Nowadays,&#xD;
      basic oral care protocols are the mainstay of preventing or reducing mucositis pain. Pain is&#xD;
      mainly managed by systemically administered analgesia. The only pioneer work in the field of&#xD;
      radio-or chemotherapy induced mucositis treatment with topical opioids has been done by&#xD;
      Cerchietti in two pilot studies: one compared &quot;magic&quot; mouthwash (lidocaine, diphenhydramine,&#xD;
      magnesium aluminium hydroxide) with morphine mouthwash in a randomized trial; the other&#xD;
      compared 1%o and 2% morphine solutions in an open trial. The results showed a significant&#xD;
      decrease in the duration of pain, the intensity as well as a decrease the need for systemic&#xD;
      analgesia in the group with morphine mouthwash. No systemic clinically relevant adverse&#xD;
      effects were noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mouthwashes with a morphine containing solution decrease oral pain substantially, while not&#xD;
      causing the side effects seen in systemic administration of narcotic analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised double-blind cross-over study to evaluate the effect of topical oral application&#xD;
      of a 0.2% morphine solution in patients suffering from radio- and/or chemotherapy induced&#xD;
      oral mucositis. 60 patients will be included. Randomly assigned to either the morphine&#xD;
      solution or a placebo mouthwash, they receive the first three days one of the solutions and&#xD;
      then are switched over to the other treatment for three more days. General basic oral care is&#xD;
      offered to all of the patients. Efficacy of treatment will be measured with a self-assessment&#xD;
      pain scale. Doses of systemic opioids and other symptoms (appetite, dysphagia) will also be&#xD;
      measured. If patient's don't receive systemic opioids, serum concentrations of morphine will&#xD;
      be measured.&#xD;
