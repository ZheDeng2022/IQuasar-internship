  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to examine the benefits of early combination of CellCept® with&#xD;
      Rebif® in long-term management of patients with multiple sclerosis. Quantitation of mRNA for&#xD;
      MxA gene from ex-vivo lymphocytes obtained from patients receiving both drugs or interferon&#xD;
      alone will be used to gauge the usefulness of this combination therapy. In addition we will&#xD;
      examine the safety of combination of mycophenolate mofetil and interferon beta 1a in&#xD;
      treatment of multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study to examine if the combination of CellCept® with Rebif® will prove to be&#xD;
      useful in the early treatment of patients with MS. Up-regulation of the MxA gene following&#xD;
      the administration of Rebif® will be used as a surrogate marker of interferon bioactivity.&#xD;
      This in turn could serve as a surrogate marker of interferon efficacy in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis is that there will not be any difference in the proportion of patients&#xD;
      that produce MxA gene transcripts in the Rebif® group as compared to the group that received&#xD;
      Rebif® with CellCept® at the end of this study (1 year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The alternate hypothesis is that the combination of CellCept® with Rebif® will prove to be&#xD;
      useful in prolonging the efficacy of interferon. In other words, the combination will result&#xD;
      in a significant proportion of patients in the treatment group continuing to produce MxA as&#xD;
      compared to the proportion of patients producing MxA in the Rebif® arm.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 30 patients will be studied, fifteen in each arm. Proportional analysis for sample&#xD;
      size estimation could not be done since the proportion of MxA positive patients at 1 year in&#xD;
      the Rebif® treatment arm is unknown. Nevertheless, a sample size of 15 patients per arm will&#xD;
      allow the detection of a suitable difference between the treatment groups as outlined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For purposes of this study an MxA non-producer will be designated as a &quot;treatment failure&quot;&#xD;
      irrespective of the clinical status. The definition of an MxA non-producer is a patient who&#xD;
      is producing 1 year into treatment; MxA transcripts at a level 2 SD below his/her mean&#xD;
      baseline value at entry. Accordingly, patients will be compared to their own initial response&#xD;
      to Rebif® at entry into the study. In the following examples the proportion of MxA&#xD;
      non-producers in each group will be used for comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of 1 year, the incidence of neutralizing antibodies in patients receiving Rebif®&#xD;
      44 micrograms SC tiw is approximately 20%. For purposes of calculation of sample size, a&#xD;
      proportion of 40% (0.4) was chosen for the MxA non-producers in the Rebif® arm, since the&#xD;
      proportion of patients that fail to produce MxA at 1 year is higher than the proportion that&#xD;
      show neutralizing antibodies. In other words, mechanisms other than neutralizing antibodies&#xD;
      are the basis of interferon unresponsiveness in most patients, an important phenomenon that&#xD;
      is lost to detection if the sole focus is restricted to neutralizing antibodies. Assuming&#xD;
      that the combination will be effective in maintaining biological activity of interferon at 1&#xD;
      year in most or all of the patients, the following scenarios can be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to either receive Rebif with or without CellCept. The&#xD;
      randomization process will utilize a computer program designed specifically for randomizing&#xD;
      patients. Patients will have an equal chance of being randomized to receive Rebif with or&#xD;
      without CellCept therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject must meet the following eligibility criteria (i.e., all of the Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and not of the Exclusion criteria) before enrollment in to the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Male and female subjects clinically eligible for interferon therapy, including a&#xD;
           diagnosis of relapsing multiple sclerosis (according to the MacDonald criteria, revised&#xD;
           2005), or patients diagnosed with clinically isolated syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be between the ages of 18 to 65, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects must have adequate cognitive function to understand and sign the IRB-approved&#xD;
           consent prior to the performance of any study-specific procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and females of childbearing potential (i.e.&#xD;
           not surgically sterile or at least two years postmenopausal) who engage in active&#xD;
           heterosexual relations, and have not had a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, and&#xD;
           are not using one of the following birth control methods: tubal ligation, implantable&#xD;
           contraceptive device, oral, patch or injectable contraceptive, barrier method, or sexual&#xD;
           activity restricted to vasectomized partner will be excluded from this study due to the&#xD;
           potential risk to the unborn fetus and/or nursing infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject has clinically significant abnormal laboratory values. An abnormal value is&#xD;
           defined as CTCAE Version 3.0, Grade 2 or worse lab value determined to be clinically&#xD;
           significant by the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject has received corticosteroids within 30 days prior to the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject has received cyclophosphamide or mitoxantrone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject has received Imuran or methotrexate in the last 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject has any medical condition, or history of a medical condition, that would&#xD;
           interfere with the interpretation of the study results or the conduct of the study as&#xD;
           determined by the investigator. This may include other autoimmune disease, history of&#xD;
           cancer, uncontrolled hypertension, myelodysplastic syndromes and any other uncontrolled&#xD;
           cardiac, hepatic, renal or pulmonary history as determined by the investigator to be&#xD;
           clinically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject is participating or has participated in another clinical trial or received&#xD;
           another investigational therapy in the last 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary measures of efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of the proportion of patients who are MxA producers in the group receiving&#xD;
           Rebif® with CellCept®, as compared to the proportion of patients on Rebif® alone who are&#xD;
           MxA producers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of the mean MxA levels in the Rebif® with CellCept® group to that of Rebif®&#xD;
           alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis is that there will not be any difference between the two treatment arms&#xD;
      regarding the levels of mRNA for MxA. The alternate hypothesis is that the treatment arm will&#xD;
      have a sustained high level of mRNA as compared to the Rebif® alone treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary measures of efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical status, including number and severity of clinical exacerbations, severity of&#xD;
           exacerbations, time to first and second exacerbations, disability as measured by&#xD;
           Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite&#xD;
           (MSFC) and use of corticosteroids during the 1 year study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tolerance to interferon and clinical burden of disease as measured by the Multiple&#xD;
           Sclerosis Quality of Life Index (MSQLI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Break-through disease as detected by gadolinium enhancement of lesions in MRI at the&#xD;
           conclusion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total burden of T2 FLAIR disease in the combination arm as compared to Rebif® alone at&#xD;
           the conclusion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring MxA&#xD;
&#xD;
      MxA levels in patients will be determined by measuring relative amounts of MxA mRNA in&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from their blood. Blood will be collected&#xD;
      in preservative free heparin tubes and the PBMCs isolated by Ficoll-Histopaque gradient&#xD;
      centrifugation. The PBMCs will be harvested, washed, and the total cell counts established.&#xD;
      Total RNA will be isolated from these cells. RNA will then be converted to cDNA in a reverse&#xD;
      transcription reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) will be performed to establish levels of gene&#xD;
      activation of MxA. As in standard PCR, oligonucleotide primers and temperature cycling are&#xD;
      used to amplify the target sequence from the template DNA. With real-time PCR, an&#xD;
      oligonucleotide &quot;probe&quot; is added to the mix. This probe has a high-energy &quot;reporter&quot; dye at&#xD;
      the 5' end and a low-energy &quot;quencher&quot; dye at the 3' end. The probe is designed to anneal to&#xD;
      a specific portion of the target DNA sequence. When the probe is intact, the proximity of the&#xD;
      quencher dye to the reporter dye suppresses its natural fluorescence. As DNA polymerase makes&#xD;
      copies of the template DNA molecules in the mix, the attached probe is cleaved, and the&#xD;
      distance between the reporter and quencher dyes increases, causing fluorescent emission by&#xD;
      the reporter to also increase. Fluorescence is measured throughout the temperature cycles of&#xD;
      the PCR reaction. Calculations are made based on the detected fluorescence to determine the&#xD;
      amount of initial template DNA that was present in the sample. Because it is impossible to&#xD;
      determine the exact number of MxA mRNA molecules that each sample started with, real-time PCR&#xD;
      is done to detect levels of GAPDH, a standard housekeeping gene, in each sample so that a&#xD;
      comparison between GAPDH and MxA can be made, and relative quantities can be determined&#xD;
      between different samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring T2 FLAIR Total burden of T2 FLAIR is measured by a semi-automated computer program&#xD;
      used within the radiology department. The software will outline all lesions within the&#xD;
      scanned area. Once mapped out, the MRIs will be reviewed by Dr. Eric Bourekas for measurement&#xD;
      and quantification of total disease burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Schedule Eligible patients will be randomized to receive treatment with or without&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil 2,000 mg per day for 6 months. After 4 weeks of therapy both groups&#xD;
      will receive Rebif® at the standard dose of 44 micrograms SC TIW, after a standard titration&#xD;
      dosing regimen. Patients will be evaluated every 3 months for one year. The patient's total&#xD;
      time on study will be one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will occur at the Day 0 visit and will utilize a computer program specifically&#xD;
      created for this purpose. Patients will have a 50% chance of receiving CellCept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient develops any medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would&#xD;
      make it unsafe for them to continue on the study, the patient will be removed from study and&#xD;
      followed off study for safety, resolution of any event. Patient removal from study will be&#xD;
      evaluated on a case by case basis at the investigators discretion and will be carried out to&#xD;
      ensure the patients safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient experiences greater than 2 exacerbations requiring corticosteroid therapy&#xD;
      (moderate to severe) in any 12 month period, or have confirmed progression in Expanded&#xD;
      Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of &gt; 2 points with or without exacerbations they would be&#xD;
      considered treatment failures for the appropriate treatment arm and would be removed from the&#xD;
      study to pursue other treatment options.&#xD;
