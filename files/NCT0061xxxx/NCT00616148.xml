  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of a single oral dose of YKP3089 to abolish&#xD;
      or clearly reduce the IPS-induced photo-paroxysmal EEG response in photosensitive epilepsy&#xD;
      patients, and to measure the onset and duration of the effect. Several cohorts will be used,&#xD;
      to sequentially investigate different doses.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Male or female age 18-60 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis and history of epilepsy for which patients are on 0-2 concomitant&#xD;
             antiepileptic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the patient is taking two concomitant medications, the second drug must be&#xD;
             levetiracetam, gabapentin or pregabalin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A reproducible IPS-induced photo-paroxysmal response (PPR) on EEG of at least 3 points&#xD;
             on a frequency assessment scale (See Section 6.16) in at least one eye condition and&#xD;
             no change of more than 3 frequencies in 2 repeated measurements recorded over the 2&#xD;
             months prior to study entry in at least one eye condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in otherwise good health (with the exception of epilepsy), as determined by&#xD;
             the PI via the medical history, a physical examination and screening laboratory&#xD;
             investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 35.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to provide written informed consent to participate in the study in&#xD;
             accordance with the ICH, GCP guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of non epileptic seizures (e.g. metabolic, structural or pseudo-seizures).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of reproductive potential who do not agree to use effective birth-control&#xD;
             methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking medications that are known substrates of CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 including&#xD;
             but not limited to phenytoin, Phenobarbital, omeprazole, fluvoxamine and efavirenz.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically significant laboratory abnormality which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, will exclude the patient from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An active CNS infection, demyelinating disease, degenerative neurological disease or&#xD;
             any CNS disease deemed to be progressive during the course of the study that may&#xD;
             confound the interpretation of the study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically significant psychiatric illness, psychological or behavioral problems&#xD;
             which, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the patient's ability&#xD;
             to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are suffering from clinically significant active liver disease, porphyria&#xD;
             or with a family history of severe hepatic dysfunction indicated by abnormal liver&#xD;
             function tests greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (AST and ALT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of alcoholism, drug abuse, or drug addiction (within the past 12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who would normally be contraindicated for YKP3089 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have participated in any other trials involving an investigational&#xD;
             product or device within 30 days of screening or longer as required by local&#xD;
             regulations.&#xD;
