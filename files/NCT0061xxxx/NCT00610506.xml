      Aims of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are 1) to examine the clinical utility of escitalopram in patients&#xD;
      with major depression with atypical features; 2) to evaluate the tolerability of escitalopram&#xD;
      in major depression with atypical features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis and objectives. This study is proposed as an open-label study to gather&#xD;
      pilot data to examine whether escitalopram has clinical utility in the treatment of major&#xD;
      depression with atypical features. Because of the exploratory nature of the design, no&#xD;
      specific study hypotheses can be generated regarding efficacy of the drug. Our primary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the effect size of escitalopram in atypical depression will be similar to&#xD;
      the effect size of escitalopram in major depression, its FDA approved indication.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Based on treatment outcome, longitudinal course, biologic and physiologic data, and family&#xD;
      histories (Rabkin et al., 1996), the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) added&#xD;
      atypical features as a parenthetical modifier of major depression and dysthymia. Several&#xD;
      recent reports suggest that DSM-IV criteria for depression with atypical features identify a&#xD;
      group distinguishable by a cluster of symptoms, age of onset and course of illness. The&#xD;
      symptom constellation consists of depressed mood, along with hyperphagia, weight gain,&#xD;
      increased fatigue and rejection sensitivity. Some authors have distinguished two subtypes of&#xD;
      atypical depression. One subtype has an early onset (i.e., before age 20 years) and a chronic&#xD;
      course (i.e., no spontaneous well-being since onset greater than 2 months) (early/chronic&#xD;
      atypical) are no more likely to benefit from tricyclic antidepressant than from placebo&#xD;
      (Stewart et al., 2002), but do respond to a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, and do not have&#xD;
      increased left hemisphere perceptual processing (Stewart et al., 2003). In contrast, the&#xD;
      other subtype reports either later onset or a less chronic course of illness (late/nonchronic&#xD;
      atypical) respond robustly to tricyclic antidepressant (Stewart et al., 2002), and show&#xD;
      evidence of increased left hemispheric processing (Stewart et al., 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of the newer medications in the treatment of depressed patients with atypical&#xD;
      features remains to be elucidated. One study compared outcome between phenelzine and&#xD;
      fluoxetine, reporting no difference, but risk of a type II error was large (Pande et al.&#xD;
      1996). A second study limited to depressed patients with atypical features compared&#xD;
      fluoxetine, imipramine, and placebo, finding both drugs effective for about half the patients&#xD;
      and both superior to placebo, but not different from each other (McGrath et al. 2000). A&#xD;
      12-week study comparing moclobemide and sertraline in the treatment of outpatients with&#xD;
      atypical depression found both drugs to produce comparable improvement (Sogaard et al, 1999).&#xD;
      Falkai (1999) asserts the efficacy of mirtazapine for depression with atypical features&#xD;
      without any data, and Rye et al. (1998) reported on a single case of apparently late onset&#xD;
      atypical depression responding to bupropion. A placebo controlled study failed to show any&#xD;
      benefit for mianserin for atypical depression (McGrath et al, 1985). Finally, an unmarketed&#xD;
      drug, gepirone, has been demonstrated to be effective for depression with atypical features&#xD;
      but no comparison was made with other antidepressant medications (McGrath et al., 1994).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Escitalopram has been approved for the treatment of major depression and Generalized Anxiety&#xD;
      Disorder. However whether escitalopram improved atypical depressive symptoms has not been&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are 1) to examine the clinical utility of escitalopram in patients&#xD;
      with major depression with atypical features; 2) to evaluate the tolerability of escitalopram&#xD;
      in major depression with atypical features.&#xD;

      specific study hypotheses can be generated regarding efficacy of the drug. Our primary&#xD;
