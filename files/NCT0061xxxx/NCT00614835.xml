  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of adjuvant therapy for patients with leiomyosarcoma of the uterus that&#xD;
      has been completely removed by surgery. &quot;Adjuvant&quot; therapy means that the tumor (the&#xD;
      leiomyosarcoma) has been completely removed by surgery; thus, giving further treatment now is&#xD;
      done in hopes of decreasing the chance that the tumor will come back (relapse or recur). The&#xD;
      main goal of this study is to show that this series of treatments is safe for patients with&#xD;
      your type of tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial you will be getting drugs that have been approved for use in some types of&#xD;
      cancer. In this study we wish to see whether the combination of two chemotherapy drugs,&#xD;
      docetaxel and gemcitabine can decrease the chance of your tumor, leiomyosarcoma of the&#xD;
      uterus, from coming back (relapsing). We will also be looking at the short-term side effects&#xD;
      and risks of the drugs given in this combination to patients with leiomyosarcoma that has&#xD;
      been completely resected (removed by surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel has been shown to be safe, and it has been shown&#xD;
      to decrease the size of leiomyosarcoma tumors in patients with leiomyosarcoma of the uterus&#xD;
      that has relapsed, or has continued to grow despite treatment with other chemotherapy drugs.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathologically confirmed leiomyosarcoma of the uterus, completely resected, stage I,&#xD;
             II, III or IV within 8 weeks of surgery to remove the tumor(s). Patients with stage I&#xD;
             tumors should have LMS that is considered high-grade by histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior chemotherapy for LMS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior treatment with gemcitabine or docetaxel Age &gt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &gt; or equal to 80%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-treatment absolute neutrophil count &gt; or equal to 1500/ul, hemoglobin greater than&#xD;
             or equal to 8.0 gm/dl, and platelets &gt; than or equal to 100,000/ul.&#xD;
