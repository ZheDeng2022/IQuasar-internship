  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II clinical trial aimed at treating a subgroup of patients with cutaneous&#xD;
      T-cell lymphoma. The drug consists of a toxin, called diphtheria toxin, which is attached to&#xD;
      an antibody that can specifically target cancerous T-cells. Our primary objectives are,&#xD;
      therefore, to determine the patient subgroup with respect to disease burden who best responds&#xD;
      to this experimental drug in treating CD3 positive T cell malignancies. We will be&#xD;
      determining how the patient and their disease respond to this research agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Clinical Response Data analysis from October 2014 done at the completion of the Phase I&#xD;
      portion of A-dmT390-bisFv(UCHT1) fusion protein clinical trial showed that there were 25&#xD;
      evaluable patients who received all 8 doses varying between 2.5 and 11.25 µg/kg per dose.&#xD;
      There were responses at all the lower dose levels up to 7.5 µg/kg per dose. The overall&#xD;
      response rate was 36% and the complete response rate was 16% (when followed for 6 months). We&#xD;
      have identified a subgroup of CTCL patients that have a very high response rate. If we&#xD;
      exclude patients whose mSWAT scores never exceeded 50 (50% of skin surface area times a&#xD;
      multiplier) and who never had lymph node involvement or stage III disease we are left with 9&#xD;
      patients. This subgroup has an overall response rate of 89% and a complete response rate of&#xD;
      50% (when followed for 6 months). Of these 4 patients currently in complete remission, three&#xD;
      are long-term responders. Two are over 6 years in duration and one over 5 years duration.&#xD;
      These may represent cures. The long time periods in the transition from partial response to&#xD;
      complete response without treatment, 6 months to two years, suggests that the study drug in&#xD;
      addition to exerting a direct killing effect on tumor also functions as an immunomodulator.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to further evaluate the clinical responses including response&#xD;
      rate and duration and correlate with patient disease stage, tumor burden, anti-DT titer and&#xD;
      degree of T cell depletion induced by A-dmDT390-bisFv(UCHT1) fusion protein for patients with&#xD;
      surface CD3+ malignant diseases. The secondary objective is to further explore the toxicity&#xD;
      profile of A-dmDT390-bisFv(UCHT1) fusion protein for a high-response subgroup of patients&#xD;
      with CTCL whose disease stage has not progressed beyond stage IB/IIB with mSWAT &lt; 50%.&#xD;
      Patients will receive full supportive care including transfusions of irradiated washed blood&#xD;
      and blood products, antibiotics, antiemetics, etc, when appropriate. However, other&#xD;
      anti-neoplastic drugs or hematopoietic growth factors (e.g., erythropoietin, interleukin-11,&#xD;
      G-CSF and GM-CSF) are not allowed. Treatment will consist of one 4 day cycle consisting of 2&#xD;
      daily infusions for a total of 8 treatments given on an outpatient basis. Patients will be&#xD;
      monitored until day 14 for signs of late drug toxicity by a daily phone call from their&#xD;
      health care provider. Subjects will be instructed on how to monitor their own blood pressure&#xD;
      at home and encouraged to measure and chart their daily weights that they can report to their&#xD;
      health care provider. Off-treatment follow-up will be based upon response. Patients who&#xD;
      experience a partial or complete remission who later relapse can receive radiation treatment&#xD;
      of new lesions and remain on study as this course is typical of responses to an&#xD;
      immunomodulating drug. Patients will have a follow-up visit and testing on day 37. Patients&#xD;
      with partial or complete remissions will have another follow-up visit on day 60, then every&#xD;
      three months for 1 year, followed by annual visits to assess duration of the response. To&#xD;
      accommodate patients, we are offering a travel reimbursement program. Due to the 4 days of&#xD;
      consecutive infusions, we will reimburse the expense the patient would incur to travel to the&#xD;
      participating institution for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the overall clinical responses including response rate and duration in a larger&#xD;
           group of CTCL high-response patients to see if is higher than current therapies (&gt;49%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the complete response rate and duration of response of A-dmDT390-bisFv(UCHT1)&#xD;
           fusion protein in a larger group of CTCL high-response patients to see if is higher than&#xD;
           current therapies (&gt;20%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Further define toxicities of A-dmDT390-bisFv(UCHT1) regimen in patients with CTCL who&#xD;
           have been selected to be free from preexisting cardiac disease and never treated with&#xD;
           Campath.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine if correlations exist between disease stage, tumor burden, anti-DT titer and&#xD;
           degree of T cell depletion and response rate and response duration.&#xD;
