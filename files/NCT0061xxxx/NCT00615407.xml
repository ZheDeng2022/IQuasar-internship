  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 1980, the number of people in the United States diagnosed with asthma has increased&#xD;
      dramatically. Studying what causes and triggers asthma is an important part of understanding&#xD;
      and subsequently managing this disease. Although some have suggested that alcohol consumption&#xD;
      may affect asthma, little is known about how consistent alcohol use affects the amount of&#xD;
      inflammation present in the lungs and whether consistent alcohol use makes the airways more&#xD;
      narrow and stiff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study involves 2 visits in order to complete questionnaires, various&#xD;
      pulmonary function tests, as well as the collection of blood, urine, and exhaled breath&#xD;
      condensate specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes optional genetic and bronchoscopy substudies.&#xD;
