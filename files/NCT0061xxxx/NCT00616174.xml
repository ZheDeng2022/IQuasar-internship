      The purpose of this study to investigate whether using a special warming blanket during&#xD;
      Cesarean delivery helps maintain a normal body temperature in the baby when compared to&#xD;
      mothers that are not warmed (standard care at BC Women's Hospital). Doctors observed that&#xD;
      some babies have low body temperatures when they are born by Cesarean delivery. Since baby&#xD;
      temperatures are dependant on the temperatures of their mothers, we believe that keeping the&#xD;
      mother warm during surgery with the use of a special warming blanket that is filled with warm&#xD;
      air will result in the baby being warmer at birth.&#xD;

      Maternal hypothermia during Cesarean delivery is predominately caused by a combination of&#xD;
      neuraxial anesthesia and exposure of abdominal contents and skin to the low temperatures of&#xD;
      the operating room (OR). Since maternal temperature and fetal temperature are intimately&#xD;
      related, neonates experience hypothermia at birth due to maternal hypothermia. Neonatal&#xD;
      hypothermia on admission to the Intensive Care Unit is an important determinant of morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality, particularly in preterm neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At BC Women's Hospital the majority of Cesarean deliveries are done under neuraxial&#xD;
      anesthesia and the pediatricians have observed that some babies had suboptimal body&#xD;
      temperatures at the time of Cesarean delivery. The pediatricians wanted to reverse this trend&#xD;
      in neonatal hypothermia and requested that the OR temperature be increased to 25oC, more in&#xD;
      line with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for delivery rooms. However, raising OR&#xD;
      temperatures is usually not a comfortable option to the majority of staff working in this&#xD;
      environment, therefore WHO recommendations are not followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forced air warming is a common technique used during surgical procedures to maintain&#xD;
      normothermia in anesthetized patients. A bi-layered blanket with multiple air channels is&#xD;
      connected to a warming device that forces warm air between the layers of the blanket and&#xD;
      ultimately around the patient. This device is effective in warming hypothermic patients or&#xD;
      maintaining temperature in normothermic patients in a cool OR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studies on maternal warming at Cesarean delivery that have been published to date have&#xD;
      shown inconsistent findings thus the subject warrants further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We postulate that actively warming mothers will prevent or decrease the risk of neonatal&#xD;
      hypothermia at birth. In addition, we will examine whether active warming has a larger effect&#xD;
      in the premature neonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonatal axillary temperature at delivery will be our primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Important variables measured include: neonatal umbilical vein pH, Apgar scores, maternal&#xD;
      temperature throughout surgery (uterine incision -delivery time), presence of maternal&#xD;
      shivering and maternal thermal comfort score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a non-blinded, randomized controlled trial involving two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control group: Standard care i.e. cupboard warmed cotton blanket and cupboard warmed IV&#xD;
           fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention group: Standard care as in control group plus a Bair Hugger full access&#xD;
           underbody blanket model 635 (Health Canada Licence # 12692) warmed by Bair Hugger&#xD;
           temperature management unit model 750. Patient will lie on the underbody blanket and it&#xD;
           will be turned on once patient is supine on operating table following the insertion of&#xD;
           anesthetic. The warming device will be set to the medium temperature setting (380C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will receive a forced air warming blanket throughout surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in the operating room at the BC Women's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population is consenting, pregnant women undergoing either elective or urgent (no&#xD;
      immediate threat to maternal or neonatal life but requiring delivery) Cesarean delivery under&#xD;
      spinal or combined spinal-epidural anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion factors include: emergency Cesarean deliveries or Cesarean deliveries under general&#xD;
      anesthesia, mothers in active labor, mothers under 19 years old, those who cannot understand&#xD;
      English, and lack of consent. Mothers with a suspected infection, Type I Diabetes Mellitus, a&#xD;
      history of malignant hyperthermia and any disease/disorder that is known to affect&#xD;
      temperature regulation will also be excluded.&#xD;
