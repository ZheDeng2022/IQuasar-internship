      The purpose of this research study is to learn about the use of a combination of two&#xD;
      medications, baclofen and naltrexone, for the treatment of alcohol dependence in men and&#xD;
      women ages 25-60 years old. Naltrexone is an FDA approved medication for treatment of alcohol&#xD;
      dependence. The most widely accepted idea for naltrexone's effect is that it reduces the&#xD;
      alcohol &quot;high&quot;, which decreases a desire to consume alcohol. As a result, alcoholic patients&#xD;
      treated with naltrexone are less likely to relapse to heavy drinking. Furthermore, naltrexone&#xD;
      treated patients drink fewer days and are more likely to maintain abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, naltrexone does not have any effect on other symptoms that may contribute to relapse&#xD;
      such as anxiety, sleep problems and irritability. Baclofen, an FDA approved medication for&#xD;
      muscle spasms, may improve some of these symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of the current study is to gather information on whether adding&#xD;
      baclofen to naltrexone is feasible and well tolerated.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Baclofen has been studied for alcoholism in Italy in 45 individuals in two studies. In the&#xD;
      two Italian studies, baclofen significantly reduced alcohol withdrawal symptoms and craving&#xD;
      for alcohol, as well as the use of alcohol. These data have been supported by the results of&#xD;
      our own pilot study conducted here at UNC in 12 subjects with alcohol dependence. That study&#xD;
      showed that baclofen was generally well tolerated, and some individuals had significant&#xD;
      improvements in their drinking. Furthermore, we have recently completed enrolling 80 alcohol&#xD;
      dependent patients into a placebo-controlled study of baclofen and are currently analyzing&#xD;
      the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of the current study is to gather information on whether adding&#xD;
      baclofen to naltrexone is feasible and well tolerated.&#xD;
