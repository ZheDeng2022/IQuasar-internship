    <textblock>
      The goal of this psychosocial research study is to learn whether a website program called&#xD;
      &quot;Tendrils: Sexual Renewal for Women after Cancer &quot; may help female cancer survivors improve&#xD;
      their sex lives when used either as a self-help tool or in combination with brief sexual&#xD;
      counseling by a health care professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sexual dysfunction is the most common long-term consequence of cancer treatment, affecting&#xD;
      half of survivors of breast and gynecological cancer and many women treated for other&#xD;
      cancers. Yet, few women get the help they need for sexual problems. Our primary objective is&#xD;
      to develop and evaluate a multimedia intervention program for women with cancer-related&#xD;
      sexual dysfunction. Tendrils: A Sexual Renewal Program for Women Surviving Cancer will: 1)&#xD;
      explain the causes of cancer-related sexual dysfunction; 2) offer self-help strategies to&#xD;
      prevent or overcome problems; 3) advise women on seeking appropriate medical help; and 4)&#xD;
      possibly serve as the core of a counseling program, along with a therapist manual. Tendrils&#xD;
      is aimed at a wide audience, from newly diagnosed to long-term survivors, across cancer&#xD;
      sites. Material will be presented with sensitivity to religious and cultural attitudes about&#xD;
      sexuality. Animations will illustrate anatomy and physiology. The software will let women use&#xD;
      Tendrils in a variety of formats: over the internet, on a CD-Rom, printed out, or as&#xD;
      downloaded digital video or audio on a handheld computer or media player. Video vignettes&#xD;
      will illustrate problems and strategies. Five female cancer survivors will host the program,&#xD;
      sharing their experiences.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Tendrils website is designed to give women information about sexual problems related to&#xD;
      cancer and its treatment, and the website suggests ways to overcome those problems. The&#xD;
      website can be viewed on a computer, or parts of it may be printed out or downloaded to&#xD;
      portable media players (such as mp3 players). The program includes videos describing women's&#xD;
      personal experiences with sexual problems after cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you appear to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be mailed an informed&#xD;
      consent form to review and sign and a 19-item questionnaire about your sexual function that&#xD;
      may take 5 to 10 minutes to complete. If the questionnaire results also show you are eligible&#xD;
      for the study, and you have completed the informed consent form, you will be given a user&#xD;
      name and password to view the Tendrils web site. On the web site you will fill out a set of&#xD;
      questionnaires. The questionnaires ask about your background (such as age, education,&#xD;
      relationships), your cancer diagnosis and treatment, and the quality of your life in terms of&#xD;
      your health, your general emotions, and your sexual function (such as your desire for sex,&#xD;
      ability to enjoy sex, and/or any problems with painful sex). In total, the questionnaires&#xD;
      will take about 30-35 minutes to complete. If your questionnaires suggest that you are very&#xD;
      depressed or upset, a psychologist on the research team will request an in-person interview&#xD;
      with you to discuss your feelings. The psychologist will decide whether taking part in the&#xD;
      study would be too stressful for you. If this is the case, you will be taken off study. You&#xD;
      will also be given a list of referrals for mental health care in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to one of 2 groups. There will be an&#xD;
      equal chance of being assigned to either group. If you are assigned to Group 1, you will work&#xD;
      with the Tendrils program for 12 weeks on your own. If you are assigned to Group 2, in&#xD;
      addition to working with the Tendrils program on your own, you will attend 3 sexual&#xD;
      counseling sessions at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you have submitted your questionnaires, you will view the Tendrils website over the&#xD;
      internet at home over the course of 12 weeks. If you do not log onto the Tendrils website&#xD;
      within 2 weeks after receiving your user name and password, you will be called on the&#xD;
      telephone as a reminder. If you do not log on within 4 weeks, you will be taken off study and&#xD;
      your password will expire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To use the Tendrils website, you will read the information, listen to audio interviews of&#xD;
      women discussing their sexual problems after cancer (or view videotaped interviews), and&#xD;
      practice &quot;homework&quot; that is designed to help to improve your sexual life. The women in the&#xD;
      videos discuss, for example, the types of sexual problems they had (such as losing the desire&#xD;
      for sex or experiencing pain during sex), how their sexual problems affected their&#xD;
      self-esteem or relationships, and what the women did to solve the sexual problems. The videos&#xD;
      do not show real people having sexual activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The homework may involve writing or dictating comments in a section called &quot;My Journey&quot; about&#xD;
      how cancer affected your sex life or fertility. This is just for your own private use, unless&#xD;
      you choose to share your writing with your counselor. Writing the comments may take about&#xD;
      15-20 minutes each time. The homework may also involve trying what is called &quot;relaxing touch&quot;&#xD;
      with your partner, learning to tense and relax muscles around your vaginal entrance, or&#xD;
      trying to change negative thoughts about sex. You will be able to use the website on your own&#xD;
      schedule, but it is estimated that you may spend 30-60 minutes per week on the website, plus&#xD;
      another 30 minutes per week of homework time. The homework may be practiced alone or with&#xD;
      your sexual partner. Your partner will be given a separate user name and password to view&#xD;
      Tendrils during the 12 weeks. Your partner will not be able to view your comments in &quot;My&#xD;
      Journey,&quot; or your questionnaires, however.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When you use the Tendrils website, the system will record how many times you visit the&#xD;
      website, how much time you spend on each visit, and which web pages you view. Any time you&#xD;
      leave the Tendrils website, the recording stops. The recording only happens on the Tendrils&#xD;
      website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants assigned to Group 2 will attend 3 sexual counseling sessions at M. D. Anderson&#xD;
      during the 12-week study. Each counseling session will last about an hour. The counselor will&#xD;
      be a trained health care professional who will try to help you get the most out of the&#xD;
      Tendrils program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a week during the 12 weeks, participants in both Group 1 and Group 2 will be asked to&#xD;
      log onto the Tendrils website and answer 3 questions about the website. This is called a&#xD;
      diary entry. The questions ask how much time you spent reading printouts from the website,&#xD;
      listening to audio or viewing video portions of the website on a portable media player, or&#xD;
      doing homework recommended on the website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be able to access the website after the 12 weeks, as long as the research study is&#xD;
      in progress. However, your password will become inactive if you do not complete&#xD;
      questionnaires at the end of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 12 weeks, and then 3 months and 6 months later, you will be asked to&#xD;
      complete the same questionnaires that you completed at the beginning of the study. You will&#xD;
      not need to answer the medical questions or questions about your background. If the sexual&#xD;
      relationship ends during the course of the study, you will still be asked to complete these&#xD;
      follow-up questionnaires. You will be able to access the website during the 6-month follow-up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you receive a loaner laptop, you will be asked to return it at the end of the 12 weeks.&#xD;
      However, you will still be able to access the website using any computer that has an internet&#xD;
      connection, for example at the home of a friend or at a public library. You will also have&#xD;
      the option of coming to M. D. Anderson to complete follow-up questionnaires online and we&#xD;
      will compensate you for parking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Tendrils website is hosted on a secure server, which means that the information you give&#xD;
      online is protected by a special firewall. Your user name and password will be different than&#xD;
      your real name. No identifying information, such as your real name or address, will be&#xD;
      entered in the Tendrils website. Only the study chair and 1 or 2 members of the research team&#xD;
      will be able to see the list that links your user name and password to your real name. The&#xD;
      list of passwords and names will be destroyed at the end of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After returning the last questionnaire at the 6-month follow-up time, your participation in&#xD;
      the research study will be finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. If you do not have a computer, researchers will try to loan&#xD;
      you a laptop during the study. (If a loaner laptop is not available, it is possible that you&#xD;
      may have to be on a waiting list to start the study until someone else finishes using the&#xD;
      laptop.) Postage-paid return envelopes for the questionnaires will be provided, if needed.&#xD;
      Loaner printers are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 240 women will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
