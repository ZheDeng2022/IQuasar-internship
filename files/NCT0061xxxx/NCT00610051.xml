  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel group study&#xD;
      that compares Alprostadil given in a low, fixed-dose continuous infusion and placebo. The&#xD;
      difference between the two groups for the primary endpoints will be compared after 24 weeks&#xD;
      (Outpatient Double-Blind Treatment Phase). Thereafter, patients will continue on blinded&#xD;
      treatment and observation to all continued assessment of survival and cardiac-specific&#xD;
      mortality (Follow-Up Phase). It is planned that approximately 550 patients with advanced&#xD;
      heart failure be randomized (see Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the Screening Phase, informed consent will be obtained and information to establish&#xD;
      eligibility for transplant and all other inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed.&#xD;
      The screening activities may be performed on an outpatient basis in stable patients or as an&#xD;
      inpatient in unstable patients who are already hospitalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study, patients will be maintained medically in accordance with the national&#xD;
      Guidelines for heart failure, which are mostly based on the European Guidelines for Heart&#xD;
      Failure (2005) and the American Guidelines for Heart Failure, The primary assessment of&#xD;
      efficacy is based on the number of days that the patient is hospitalized or is deceased&#xD;
      during the 24 weeks following the day of randomization, As elective transplantation is biased&#xD;
      by donor availability, observation period in those cases will be counted until ELECTIVE heart&#xD;
      transplantation. Additional surrogate measures of efficacy will include monthly assessments&#xD;
      of Nt-proBNP, patient assessment of dyspnoea, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure&#xD;
      Questionnaire, NYHA classification, and use of beta1-blocker therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population It is planned that a sufficient number of patients will be screened to&#xD;
      enroll 500 patients (250 patients per treatment group). Compliance with the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria outlined below must be established prior to randomization to double-blind&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
