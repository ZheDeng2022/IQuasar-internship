    <textblock>
      Severe skin damage caused by chronic venous disorders (CVDs) results in relentless pain and&#xD;
      poor quality of life for millions of adults in the U.S. each year. DVDs are under-recognized&#xD;
      and under-treated disorders shat harm the veins of the legs and at worst, cause skin&#xD;
      inflammation and venous leg ulcers. A new way to ease the pain and inflammation is proposed&#xD;
      in this study of cryotherapy (cool gel wraps) applied to damaged skin of the lower legs of&#xD;
      CVD-affected individuals. The study hypothesis predicts that this novel cryotherapy model and&#xD;
      method will significantly improve the health and quality of life for those with CVDs and that&#xD;
      the intervention will become a standard of care for CVDs. In addition, the method will, over&#xD;
      time, reduce health care costs associated with treating poor CVD outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic venous disorders (CVDs) often cause long-term disability for those who experience the&#xD;
      worst manifestations of CVDs: disabling pain and non-healing leg ulcers. Such disabilities&#xD;
      have significant socioeconomic implications in terms of lost work days and wages, decreased&#xD;
      productivity,and ultimately increased health care costs that deteriorate the well-being and&#xD;
      quality of life for those who have CVD-induced illnesses. Because no reliable preventive&#xD;
      mechanisms exists for CVDs, this study proposes a preventive, self-management cryotherapy&#xD;
      intervention that targets inflamed skin of populations with CVDs at highest risk of&#xD;
      developing chronic leg ulcers. The proposed cryotherapy intervention will utilize a&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial to develop a method to reduce clinical symptoms by&#xD;
      improving existing therapy - it is not a treatment for CVDs itself. In the proposed pilot&#xD;
      feasibility study, subjects will be randomized to two groups; the cryotherapy intervention&#xD;
      group (n=30) who will receive a four-week, cryotherapy gel wrap applied daily to the affected&#xD;
      skin of the lower legs in addition to the standard of care (usual care). The control group&#xD;
      (n=30) will receive the usual care of compression wraps or stockings applied to the lower&#xD;
      legs and daily leg elevation. With this method, improvement of skin microcirculation, reduced&#xD;
      leg pain, and improvement in quality of life will be observed. The following aims will test&#xD;
      the hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Evaluate the feasibility of the novel intervention including treatment fidelity,&#xD;
      subject training, safety, and side effects associated with equipment and recruitment efforts&#xD;
      and further refine the intervention protocol, including questionnaires used in our previous&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Estimate variability of outcome measurements and effect sizes needed to calculate&#xD;
      sample size for a subsequent larger, adequately powered, randomized clinical trial of the&#xD;
      efficacy of the novel cryotherapy intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Investigate the presence of a preliminary &quot;signal&quot; of clinical efficacy of the&#xD;
      experimental treatment by evaluating trends toward statistical significance for the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the experimental group will experience greater reduction in skin temperature&#xD;
      and blood flow, greater improvement in pain, and greater improvement in quality of life.&#xD;
