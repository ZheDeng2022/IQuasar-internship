  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the efficacy and safety of STI571 for the treatment of fibrosis in&#xD;
      participants with systemic sclerosis. Other purposes of the study were to investigate whether&#xD;
      STI571 is effective in improving lung functions and other test results called biomarkers.&#xD;
      Whether STI571 is well-absorbed in systemic sclerosis participants' gut was also investigated&#xD;
      by testing the drug level in the blood (pharmacokinetics).&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Modified Rodnan Skin Score (MRSS) at Each Time Point of Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and Week 48/End of Study (EOS)</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of oral STI571 in participants with systemic sclerosis is defined by an improvement in MRSS. Skin thickness was assessed clinically in each of 17 body areas and scored using a 0-3 scale, where 0= normal, 1= mild thickness, 2= moderate thickness, and 3= severe thickness (maximum score 51). A higher score indicates greater severity of the disease.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE's) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE's)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 48/EOS</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition occurring after starting the study drug even if the event is not considered to be related to the study drug. An SAE is defined as an event that is fatal or life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, is medically significant, i.e., defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>

    <description>The following MRSS categories were calculated for up to Week 48: Non-response: a reduction in MRSS &lt;25%, Partial response: a reduction in MRSS between 25-&lt;50%, Complete response: a reduction in MRSS between 50-&lt;80%, Remission: a reduction in MRSS ≥80%.</description>

An SAE is defined as an event that is fatal or life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, is medically significant, i.e., defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>
