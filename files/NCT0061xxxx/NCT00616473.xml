      The purpose of this study is to examine key organizational structures and processes&#xD;
      (leadership, teamwork, communication, palliative care) and their impact on the quality of&#xD;
      end-of-life care for dying residents and their family members.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the American population ages, nursing homes are rapidly becoming a dominant site for&#xD;
      death. Currently, 25% of all deaths occur in nursing homes and 35% of all elders over the age&#xD;
      of 85 die in nursing homes. By 2020, 40% of those over 65 will die in nursing homes. Nursing&#xD;
      home residents die in pain with undue psychosocial suffering. For all permanently placed&#xD;
      residents, death is inevitable. Nonetheless, how residents die, is not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been long standing concerns about the quality of care and quality of life in&#xD;
      nursing homes. Although there is some evidence that the quality of care for nursing home&#xD;
      residents has improved, serious problems continue in areas that potentially affect&#xD;
      end-of-life such as dehydration, pressure ulcers, and pain. Efforts to improve care have&#xD;
      rarely considered the dynamic nature of nursing home structure and process factors, such as&#xD;
      staffing levels, leadership of the director of nursing, or communication and teamwork among&#xD;
      staff that facilitate or impede the organization's ability to improve care processes.&#xD;
      Findings from our preliminary studies in nursing homes indicate that organizational structure&#xD;
      and process factors make a difference in end-of-life care for residents and their family&#xD;
      members. More specifically, staff education, staffing levels, leadership of the DON and&#xD;
      administrator, teamwork and communication among direct care staff, and incorporating&#xD;
      palliative care clinical practices into day-to-day care had a profound impact on outcomes&#xD;
      such as the honoring of end-of-life preferences, symptom management, and satisfaction with&#xD;
      care. A more generalizable understanding of key structure and process factors and their&#xD;
      relationship to resident care and outcomes at the end-of-life will provide a foundation for&#xD;
      future intervention studies aimed at improving care.&#xD;
