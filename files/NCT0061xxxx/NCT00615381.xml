  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that in patients undergoing surgical treatment of unruptured intracranial&#xD;
      aneurysms, the increase in blood sugar as a result of surgical stress is detrimental to&#xD;
      outcome, as measured by blood levels of proteins associated with systemic inflammation and 7&#xD;
      day, 90 day, and 1 year postoperative neurologic and neuropsychiatric outcomes. Because&#xD;
      insulin itself is an anti-inflammatory agent, we anticipate that normalizing blood sugar&#xD;
      levels with insulin doses higher than normally produced by the body (i.e., &quot;supraphysiologic&quot;&#xD;
      insulin doses) will have a greater benefit on these outcomes than equally normalizing blood&#xD;
      sugar levels using normal insulin doses. Based on the results of this study, we will be able&#xD;
      to determine if a more laborious strategy to normalize blood sugar levels (i.e.,&#xD;
      &quot;supraphysiologic&quot; insulin therapy) offers any additional benefits to normal insulin dosing&#xD;
      strategies. In addition, we will obtain a robust assessment of postoperative neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      and neurologic outcomes of surgically repaired unruptured intracranial aneurysms that will&#xD;
      serve as the basis for future studies to decrease morbidity of these patients&#xD;

      PREOPERATIVE NEUROPSYCHIATRIC &amp; NEUROLOGIC TESTING Up to thirty days before the scheduled&#xD;
      elective surgical repair of his or her intracranial aneurysm, each patient will undergo&#xD;
      neuropsychological examination by a neuropsychologist or psychometrician and assessment of&#xD;
      neurologic status by a research nurse or the neurosurgical attending from the Department of&#xD;
      Neurological Surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The battery of neuropsychological tests will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Benton Visual Retention Test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Controlled Oral Word Association&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Copy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grooved Pegboard&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trial Making Test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hopkins Verbal Learning Test&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of neurologic status and the time to administer each assessment is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glasgow Outcome Scale (2 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modified Rankin Disability Scale (5 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NIH Stroke Scale (2 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANESTHETIC MANAGEMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the possible effects of various anesthetic agents on immune function (in vitro and&#xD;
      in vivo), all patients will undergo a standardized anesthetic:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Premedication with 0- 0.03 mg/kg midazolam&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Induction of anesthesia with 0.05-0.5 mcg/kg/min remifentanil, 1-2 mg/kg propofol, and&#xD;
           0.6-1.2 mg/kg rocuronium&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Maintenance with 0.5-0.7 MAC desflurane and 0.05-1.0 mcg/kg/min remifentanil with&#xD;
           rocuronium 0.1-0.2 mg/kg to maintain adequate neuromuscular blockade. FIO2 = 1.0±0.1&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Maintenance of core temperature 36.0±0.5°C&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Propofol 50-200 mcg/kg/min to produce an EEG burst suppression ratio of 0.7-0.8&#xD;
           immediately before temporary occlusion of the feeding artery proximal to the&#xD;
           intracranial aneurysm (to increase the length of time that focal ischemia is tolerated)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 2 mcg/kg fentanyl upon placement of the last dural stitch&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. discontinuation of desflurane and remifentanil upon removal of the head from the&#xD;
           Mayfield head fixation&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Postoperative analgesia with 0.2 mg dilaudid every 15 minutes, PRN&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Antiemetic rescue with 4 mg odansetron (no standard prophylaxis)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional standard care &amp; standardized therapeutics/medications are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dexamethasone 10 mg after tracheal intubation followed by 4 mg every 4 hours for 48&#xD;
           hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mannitol 0.5-1 g/kg after completion of positioning, if requested by surgeon&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Maintenance intravenous fluids (&quot;4-2-1&quot; rule) with 0.9% NaCl up to 20 mL/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Replacement of blood loss with 6% Hetastarch (1 mL : 1 mL) up to 1000 mL followed by 5%&#xD;
           Albumin (1 mL : 1mL) up to 2500 mL&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Nicardipine (5-15 mg/hr) ± Labetolol (5-50 mg) to keep systolic blood pressure ≤ 140&#xD;
           mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Phenylephrine (10-100 mcg/min) titrated to keep systolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Glycopyrollate (0.2 mg every 5 minutes) titrated to keep heart rate &gt; 50 beats per&#xD;
           minute&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION On the day of surgery, after confirming entry into the study (i.e.,&#xD;
      confirmation of research consent and confirmation of completion of preoperative&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric and neurologic testing), each patient will be randomly assigned to a&#xD;
      specific protocol-Supraphysiologic Insulin vs. Normal Insulin (Appendix 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed in blocks of 10 using a computer generated random number&#xD;
      assignment (odd numbers = Supraphysiologic Insulin and even numbers = Normal Insulin)&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE OF EUGLYCEMIA Intraoperative blood glucose levels will be maintained in the&#xD;
      target range of 80-110 mg/dL (euglycemia) using the randomly assigned protocol, as outline in&#xD;
      Appendix 1. Blood glucose levels, insulin boluses and infusion rates, and dextrose infusion&#xD;
      rates will be recorded on the Intraoperative Insulin &amp; Glucose data sheet (Appendix 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative blood glucose levels will be maintained in the target range (80-110 mg/dL)&#xD;
      using the standard intensive care unit protocol (Appendix 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERIOPERATIVE SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for serum protein analysis will be taken from the patient at the following&#xD;
      times:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. With the placement of the arterial line (baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Every 4 hours after the surgical incision for 12 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 24 and 48 hours after surgical incision&#xD;
&#xD;
      When possible, the blood samples will be taken from an arterial line that is placed routinely&#xD;
      for perioperative care. One-half (approximately 1/2) tablespoon (7 mL) of blood will be taken&#xD;
      for plasma protein analysis at each sampling time-a total of 6 samples (approximately 3&#xD;
      tablespoons or 42 mL of blood) will be collected during the first 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POSTOPERATIVE NEUROPSYCHIATRIC &amp; NEUROLOGIC TESTING Seven days (or on discharge from the&#xD;
      hospital) and ninety days (± 14 days) after surgery, all patients will undergo the same&#xD;
      battery of neuropsychiatric and neurologic tests that were administered preoperatively. In&#xD;
      addition, the SF-36 questionnaire will be administered at these times to assess the patients'&#xD;
      sense of functional ability. Twelve months (± 30 days) after surgery, patients will be&#xD;
      interviewed in the neurosurgeon's office or telephoned to assess neurologic recovery (using&#xD;
      the same battery of neurologic tests administered preoperatively and the SF-36).&#xD;
