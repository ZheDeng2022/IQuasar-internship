      In this study the investigators hypothesize that High Definition White Light colonoscopy and&#xD;
      narrow band imaging (NBI) will detect a higher number of adenomas compared to standard&#xD;
      definition white light colonoscopy. NBI will have a higher accuracy in predicting polyp&#xD;
      histology compared to high definition colonoscopy and standard colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 - To compare the prevalence of adenomas detected by standard colonoscopy,&#xD;
      high-definition white light colonoscopy and NBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 - To compare the number of adenoma detected per subject by standard&#xD;
      colonoscopy, high-definition white light colonoscopy and NBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3 - To compare the accuracy of predicting polyp histology between standard&#xD;
      colonoscopy, high-definition white light colonoscopy and NBI by evaluating the surface&#xD;
      mucosal and vascular patterns during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4 - To determine the inter-observer agreement between investigators for the&#xD;
      recognition of various polyp patterns&#xD;

      This study is a multi-center randomized controlled trial that will be conducted at the Kansas&#xD;
      City VA Medical Center, Kansas City, MO and The Barnes Jewish Hospital, St Louis, MO.&#xD;
      Patients referred for screening and surveillance colonoscopy will be enrolled. They will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of the following three groups: standard white light colonoscopy,&#xD;
      high-definition white light colonoscopy or NBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All colonoscopies will be performed at the Kansas City VA Medical Center and The Barnes&#xD;
      Jewish Hospital, St Louis, MO. Moderate sedation will be administered for the procedure with&#xD;
      intravenous midazolam, demerol or fentanyl and Propofol. In patients randomized to the NBI&#xD;
      arm, the colonoscope will be inserted to the cecum under white light and will switch to NBI&#xD;
      mode at the time of withdrawal. After cecal intubation, the colonic mucosa will be carefully&#xD;
      visualized during withdrawal of the scope with one of the three imaging modalities to which&#xD;
      the patient has been randomized. No effort will be made to look for polyps during the&#xD;
      insertion of the colonoscope. All polyps detected will be documented for their size,&#xD;
      morphology (Polypoid: sessile, pedunculated or Non polypoid: superficially elevated,&#xD;
      completely flat, depressed), and location. The surface of the polyp will be assessed during&#xD;
      the procedure and the histology will be predicted real time by evaluating the surface mucosal&#xD;
      and vascular patterns. The patterns would be classified into one of the four patterns&#xD;
      described in our pilot study (tubular and gyrus patterns will be combined to tubulogyrus&#xD;
      pattern). Any other patterns detected would be described and kept in the miscellaneous&#xD;
      category. If a pattern is not identified on a polyp with either white light or NBI, it will&#xD;
      be recorded as such and no attempts will be made to predict histology. Photo documentation of&#xD;
      the surface patterns of the polyps will be performed. Polyps will then be removed either with&#xD;
      a biopsy forcep or snare and sent for histopathological evaluation. Each polyp removed will&#xD;
      have one or more corresponding picture of its surface patterns and these will be labeled&#xD;
      accordingly. The total time spent in inspecting the colonic mucosa (excluding the time spent&#xD;
      in removal of polyps or clearing the colon of liquid and solid debris) will be measured with&#xD;
      a stop watch. Representative images of the various polyp patterns will be reviewed, discussed&#xD;
      and standardized amongst all the investigators at both sites. In addition, images of all the&#xD;
      polyp patterns will be printed and posted in the endoscopy suites at both hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bowel preparation will be evaluated and graded as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excellent (score=1) - &gt;90% mucosa seen, mostly liquid colonic contents, minimal suctioning&#xD;
      needed for adequate visualization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Good (score=2) - &gt;90% of mucosa seen, mostly liquid colonic contents, significant suctioning&#xD;
      needed for adequate visualization Fair (score=3) - &gt; 90% mucosa seen, mixture of liquid and&#xD;
      semisolid colonic contents, could be suctioned and/or washed Inadequate (score=4) - &lt;90%&#xD;
      mucosa seen, mixture of semisolid ands solid colonic contents, which could not be suctioned&#xD;
      or washed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with &quot;Inadequate&quot; (score = 4) bowel prep will be excluded.&#xD;
