  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research project is designed to determine which combination of tests will enable&#xD;
      physicians to predict whether a patient with symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)&#xD;
      will improve with a shunt.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a potentially reversible progressive neurological&#xD;
      condition disproportionately affecting the elderly population. Given current controversies&#xD;
      regarding its exact definition, accurate incidence and prevalence figures are elusive. NPH&#xD;
      was first described forty years ago as a triad of symptoms consisting of gait difficulties,&#xD;
      urinary incontinence, and memory problems in patients with enlarged ventricles in the absence&#xD;
      of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The cause of primary, or idiopathic NPH (INPH)&#xD;
      remains elusive, while secondary NPH results from intracranial insults such as head trauma,&#xD;
      meningitis, or intracranial hemorrhage. NPH can be successfully treated with cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid (CSF) shunting. However, the accurate diagnosis and treatment of patients with NPH&#xD;
      remains problematic, despite significant advances in brain imaging and ICP physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives - The primary aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to confirm the ability of external lumbar drainage to increase the success rate of&#xD;
           selectively shunting patients with NPH compared to historical controls&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to refine the diagnosis of NPH by determining whether the factors that change before and&#xD;
           after lumbar drainage will predict failure to improve after shunting. A related aim is&#xD;
           to assess the complications attributable to lumbar drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to perform a preliminary evaluation of programmable shunt valves for NPH compared to&#xD;
           historical controls using fixed-pressure valves. A related aim is to determine whether&#xD;
           post-op objective analysis of gait, cognitive function and urinary symptoms will help&#xD;
           refine the programmable shunt setting on an individual basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study aims include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigating the pathophysiology of NPH by: 1) correlating cortical vein compliance measured&#xD;
      by MRI flow quantification studies with CSF pressure waveform analysis; 2)assessing&#xD;
      funduscopic changes before and during ELD; 3) performing and cross correlating CSF chemical&#xD;
      analysis on screening positive and negative patients as well as screening-positive patients&#xD;
      who are shunt responsive versus unresponsive.&#xD;

Patient will be brought to operating room suite where general anesthesia is induced. Patient will be placed with a small roll on shoulder, supine, on the operating room table. Patient's head will be turned with the parietal area uppermost in the field. Patient will be prepared and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Site prep includes parietooccipital area, side of neck, chest, and entire abdomen. Ventricular catheter placed and then attached to shunt valve. Catheter is then fitted over grooved blue burr hole guide. Excess catheter pulled down to pull valve into pocket on the skull. Sterile dressings applied.</description>
