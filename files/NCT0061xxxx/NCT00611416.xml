      The aim of this study is to elucidate the role of specific catechins, a mixture of catechins&#xD;
      and caffeine in relation to weight control with particular emphasis on energy metabolism and&#xD;
      fat oxidation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is the result of an imbalance between energy intake (EI) and energy expenditure (EE).&#xD;
      Thus, two ways to treat obesity are to reduce EI or increase EE. Bioactive food ingredients&#xD;
      affecting energy metabolism, e.g. EE, fat oxidation, satiety and EI may help people to&#xD;
      successfully control or manage their weight. Green tea, one of the most widely consumed&#xD;
      beverages in the world, may possess beneficial effects on the treatment of obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Green tea is made from the leaves of Camellia sinensis species of the Theaceae family. Green&#xD;
      tea is the non- fermented/oxidised products, in contrast to black tea that is fully&#xD;
      fermented/oxidised. Green teas contain high quantities of catechins and caffeine which are&#xD;
      believed to be the active components affecting energy metabolism. EGCG is the most abundant&#xD;
      catechin and has received the most attention (Yang et al., 2000). Caffeine represents&#xD;
      approximately 3 to 5 % of the dry weight of green tea (Dufresne et al., 2001, Yang et al.,&#xD;
      2000). It is general accepted that caffeine consumption is related to an increase in EE&#xD;
      (Astrup et al., 1990), whereas the relation between catechins and energy metabolism is&#xD;
      recently discovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study by Dulloo et al (1999), ten healthy men were assigned to 3 treatments: 1) green&#xD;
      tea extract containing 150 mg/day caffeine and 270 mg/day of EGCG, 2) caffeine (150 mg/day)&#xD;
      or 3) placebo. Ingestion of green tea extract (taken with each meal) increased 24-h EE by 4 %&#xD;
      (328 kJ), reflecting its stimulatory effect on thermogenesis. This study also found a&#xD;
      reduction in the respiratory quotient (RQ) during the green tea extract treatment, suggesting&#xD;
      an increase in fat oxidation. However, Kovacs et al. (2004) did not report any changes in&#xD;
      24-h EE or RQ after same supplementation with green tea capsules, which may be explained by&#xD;
      different background caffeine consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, two medium term studies have reported of increased fat oxidation after 8 and 12&#xD;
      weeks, respectively, supplementation with tea catechin containing beverage (Ota et al., 2005,&#xD;
      Harada et al., 2005). In addition, Nagao et al. (2005) have shown that a daily consumption of&#xD;
      tea beverage containing 690 mg/day catechins for 12 weeks reduced body fat area by 8%&#xD;
      compared to the control group. Thus, catechins may not only promote EE, but also mildly&#xD;
      reduce body fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several potential mechanisms responsible for the altered energy and fat metabolism have been&#xD;
      proposed. Dulloo et al. (1999) have suggested a synergistic interaction between catechins and&#xD;
      caffeine due to sympathetically released noradrenaline (NA). Since catechins are known to be&#xD;
      capable of inhibiting catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) (the enzyme that degrades NA)&#xD;
      (Borchardt &amp; Huber, 1975), and caffeine to inhibit trancellular phosphodiesterases (enzymes&#xD;
      that break down NA-induced cAMP), it is proposed that the green tea extract, via its&#xD;
      catechins polyphenols and caffeine, is effective in stimulating thermogenesis by relieving&#xD;
      inhibition at different control points along the NA-cAMP axis. Taken together, both caffeine&#xD;
      and tea catechins would be expected to increase and/or prolong the stimulatory effects of&#xD;
      norepinephrine on energy and lipid metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several animal studies have been conducted to elucidate the anti-obese mechanisms of green&#xD;
      tea extracts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased hepatic Î²-oxidation of fatty acids in mice after 4 weeks high fat diet with&#xD;
           supplementation with tea catechins (74% EGCg, 18% ECg, 6% GCg, 2% others) (Murase et&#xD;
           al., 2002 and 4 weeks high fat diet with supplementation with EGCg (Klaus et al., 2005).&#xD;
           On the other hand, fatty acid synthase (FAS) was not altered by tea catechins, which may&#xD;
           indicate that the simulation of fatty acid oxidation, rather than suppression of&#xD;
           lipogenesis, is the predominant contribution (Murase et al., 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modulated appetite and reduces food intake through the leptin receptor-independent&#xD;
           pathway (Kao et al., 2000)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intraperitoneal administration of EGCg may reduce the diet digestibility resulting in&#xD;
           increased faecal excretion of lipids (Klaus et al., 2005)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Green tea extract (8% caffeine and 25% catechins (~70% EGCg)) stimulates brown adipose&#xD;
           tissue thermogenesis and energy expenditure, which may be due to the prolonged effect of&#xD;
           noradrenalin (Dulloo et al., 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Large variations in catechin content and chemical structures occur during preparation and&#xD;
      manufacturing of green tea products and therefore also among the studies. EGCg is the most&#xD;
      intensely studied catechin. However, the plasma bioavailability of EGCg is lower than of EGC&#xD;
      and EG (Henning et al., 2004), suggesting that non-galloylated catechins are better absorbed&#xD;
      than the galloylated (Manach et al., 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, it is not known whether epimerization of catechins alters the effect on energy&#xD;
      and fat metabolism (Harada et al., 2005, Ota et al., 2005, Xu et al., 2004). Therefore, it is&#xD;
      not clear whether the reported effects are due to the total quantity of catechins, the&#xD;
      chemical structure of specific catechins (e.g. epimerization and galloylation), and/or the&#xD;
      caffeine content or other components of in the mix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a 5-way crossover double blind placebo controlled design. At each test day,&#xD;
      energy expenditure and fat oxidation are measured via indirect calorimetry for 13 hours in&#xD;
      one of two whole body respiratory chambers.&#xD;
