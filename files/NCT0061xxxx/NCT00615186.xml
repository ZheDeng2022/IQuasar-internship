      The current study will investigate whether the addition of Neuradiab to surgery, radiation&#xD;
      and adjuvant chemotherapy (temozolomide) will improve the survival of patients with&#xD;
      glioblastoma and whether the drug regimen is safe.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In all cases where surgery is a possibility, tumor removal is usually indicated as the first&#xD;
      step of therapy for glioblastomas. The goals of such surgery include removal of as much tumor&#xD;
      mass as possible and preparation of the tumor bed for adjuvant therapy. Except for deaths&#xD;
      arising from adverse surgical events (about 1-2% of surgeries), tumor removal enhances&#xD;
      survival times. Unfortunately, without additional therapies, most GBM will recur at or near&#xD;
      the original tumor site within several months. Addition of radiotherapy to surgery as part of&#xD;
      the treatment regimen enhances survival in most patients compared to surgery alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use and benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy for GBM is controversial. Some studies suggest&#xD;
      an enhancement of survival from the use of agents such as carmustine (BCNU) and cisplatin,&#xD;
      but generally only about 10-20% of the patient population shows such responses (Stewart&#xD;
      2002). The blood-brain barrier presents a major obstacle to traditional uses of chemotherapy&#xD;
      in GBM, and, therefore, some clinical trials are focused on delivery of such agents directly&#xD;
      to the brain/tumor mass via catheters with pressure-driven infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, only two pharmacologic therapies are approved for the treatment of GBM, Gliadel®&#xD;
      and Temodar®. Implantation of BCNU-impregnated wafers (Gliadel Wafer, Guilford&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1996) after&#xD;
      surgery and radiotherapy was the first pharmacologic-chemotherapeutic therapy for GBM. It has&#xD;
      shown very modest enhancements in overall survival (11.6 vs. 13.9 months) when added to a&#xD;
      regimen of surgery and radiotherapy (Westphal et al. 2006). In this patient population, these&#xD;
      agents demonstrate the typical side effects associated with antineoplastic chemotherapies,&#xD;
      and are, therefore, often contraindicated. Nevertheless, despite FDA approval and&#xD;
      availability of Gliadel for nearly a decade, its utility remains controversial and it is not&#xD;
      routinely used in daily clinical practice. In 2005, the FDA approved the use of temozolomide&#xD;
      (Temodar ®, Schering-Plough) given concurrently during and subsequent to radiotherapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of newly diagnosed GBM. In a multicenter Phase III trial of 573 GBM patients,&#xD;
      radiation alone gave a median survival rate of 12.1 months; the addition of temozolomide led&#xD;
      to a median survival of 14.6 months (Stupp et al. NEJM 2005). More importantly, the 2-year&#xD;
      survival rate increased from 10% with initial radiation alone to 27% with combined chemo- and&#xD;
      radiotherapy. This regimen is considered the standard of care for all patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed glioblastoma. Ongoing clinical trials are exploring alternative temozolomide&#xD;
      administration schedules or combination of this regimen with novel chemotherapy or targeted&#xD;
      anti-tumor agents assessing the efficacy of temozolomide alone or in various chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      combinations are underway (Herrlinger et al. 2006, Mirimanoff et al. 2006, Stupp et al. 2006,&#xD;
      Hau et. al. 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will investigate whether the addition of Neuradiab to surgery, radiation&#xD;
      and adjuvant chemotherapy (temozolomide) will improve the survival of patients with&#xD;
      glioblastoma and whether the drug regimen is safe. Earlier trials have demonstrated that&#xD;
      patient-specific dosimetry yields the best combination of safety and efficacy and will be&#xD;
      employed in the current trial. The anti-tenascin monoclonal antibody will bind to tenascin&#xD;
      glycoprotein associated with residual neuroblastoma cells, causing the associated radioactive&#xD;
      iodine to be fixed in close proximity to the tumor delivering cytocidal local radiotherapy.&#xD;
      In this way, it is anticipated that residual tumor cells, which represent the primary reason&#xD;
      for treatment failure using conventional therapy, will be destroyed, thus prolonging patient&#xD;
      survival. The surgery, radiotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy will be administered to the&#xD;
      patients in the control arm and represents appropriate therapy for this disorder. In&#xD;
      addition, tumor samples will be analyzed for methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT)&#xD;
      activity to see whether the previously observed and reported correlation with outcome is once&#xD;
      again observed (Hegi et. al. 2005).&#xD;
