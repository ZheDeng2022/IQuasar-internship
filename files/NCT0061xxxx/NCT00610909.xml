  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is an extremely common disorder in the U.S population,&#xD;
      affecting somewhere between 9-22% based on community based studies. IBS has a chronic&#xD;
      relapsing course and overlaps with other functional gastrointestinal disorders. It accounts&#xD;
      for high direct medical expenses and indirect costs including a significant degree of&#xD;
      absenteeism. Most studies have suggested that there is a slight predominance among women,&#xD;
      especially those that have suffered some form of physical or sexual trauma. It has been&#xD;
      estimated that up to 25-40% of patients seen by gastroenterologists' are affected by IBS, and&#xD;
      that 70-90% of these patients may have a psychiatric comorbidity, most commonly major&#xD;
      depression and panic disorder, but also including schizophrenia, double depression, dysthymia&#xD;
      and alcohol abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abdominal pain and disturbance of bowel habits characterize the symptoms of IBS in the&#xD;
      absence of demonstrable structural pathology. The diagnosis of IBS relies upon clinical&#xD;
      criteria alone, as there is no &quot;gold standard&quot; in laboratory findings. The diagnosis is&#xD;
      dependent upon identifying characteristic symptoms, and then differentiating IBS from other&#xD;
      structural bowel disorders. Previously, the diagnosis of IBS was based upon a consortium&#xD;
      recommendation that examined and defined diagnostic criteria for over 100 functional&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorders. These criteria became the most definitive in the area of&#xD;
      functional disorders and are referred to as the Rome Criteria. During the time since this&#xD;
      consensus, these criteria have been modified, and in 1999 became the foundation for the&#xD;
      second set of diagnostic criteria by consensus, now referred to as the Rome II criteria. The&#xD;
      revised Rome II criteria include only the first part of the original criteria, but now&#xD;
      require the presence of two out of three symptoms relating abdominal pain to bowel symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We designed our study and a Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, flexible-dose,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled 12-week study.&#xD;

      Primary and Secondary Efficacy Measures Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change from baseline in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Mean composite pain scores (on IVRS) Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change from baseline in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Associated symptoms of IBS (diarrhea, constipation, incomplete emptying, etc.) scores&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IBS Quality of Life scores&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical Global Impression scores of 1 or 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beck Depression Inventory II&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beck Anxiety Inventory&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability will be assessed through:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recording of spontaneous adverse events throughout the screening, run-in, and treatment&#xD;
           phases of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conducting the DOTES at defined points during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects withdrawn from the study will be followed until complete resolution of adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Schedule This is a placebo-controlled, double-blinded prospective 12-week study&#xD;
      examining the efficacy of paroxetine extended release form in patients with IBS. Patients&#xD;
      meeting the Rome II criteria for IBS will be recruited from the Duke University Medical&#xD;
      Center Division of Gastroenterology and from the community. Patients found to satisfy these&#xD;
      criteria will be referred for enrollment into this study. The study will be explained and&#xD;
      informed consent obtained. A detailed history about the gastrointestinal symptoms and a&#xD;
      physical exam will be performed. Laboratory evaluations (CBC, chemistry, fecal occult blood,&#xD;
      urinalysis and EKG) will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo a MINI at baseline to diagnose any comorbid Axis I psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders, and a physical and sexual abuse history will be elicited. The patients will then&#xD;
      have 1 week of symptom charting using the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) to measure&#xD;
      baseline severity of IBS symptoms. Following that, patients will receive a single-blind&#xD;
      placebo for a 1 week period. Those patients having a &gt;25% improvement in composite pain&#xD;
      scores at the end of the placebo week or a CGI of 1 or 2 will be terminated from the study.&#xD;
      Following the 1 week single-blind placebo lead-in, non-responders will be randomized to&#xD;
      active drug or placebo for an additional period of 12 weeks. The patients will continue to&#xD;
      fill out a daily symptom diary using the IVRS and, in addition, will have weekly visits&#xD;
      (biweekly after week 4) to assess symptoms, side-effects, and improvement over the entire&#xD;
      12-week double-blind period. Those in the active treatment group will receive doses of Paxil&#xD;
      CR in increments of 12.5 mg daily for the first week and increased at 12.5 mg increments at&#xD;
      visit weeks to a maximum of 50 mg daily, as determined by the investigator. The investigator&#xD;
      will adjust dosage based on clinical response. Following the completion of the double-blind&#xD;
      phase, patients on placebo and non-responders to the study drug will be tapered off the study&#xD;
      drug back to 0 over 2 weeks, and they will be referred to their Primary Care Physician,&#xD;
      Internist or Gastroenterologist to be prescribed treatment for Irritable Bowel Syndrome.&#xD;
      Patients on active drug (Paroxetine CR) who were successful responders during the&#xD;
      double-blind phase will be eligible to continue on open label Paxil CR for an additional&#xD;
      period of 6 months plus 2 weeks and will be followed on a monthly basis. They will complete&#xD;
      the IVRS symptom diary for a week during each follow-up month for an additional 6 months.&#xD;
      Those who completed the double-blind phase during the 1st half of the month (days 1-14) will&#xD;
      complete the IVRS symptom diary for the first week beginning the 1st of the next month; those&#xD;
      who completed the double-blind phase during the second half of the month (days 15-31) will&#xD;
      complete the IVRS symptom diary for the first week beginning the 1st of the month following&#xD;
      the next month. At the end of the 6-month period, study medication for these patients will be&#xD;
      tapered back to 0 over 2 weeks, and they will be referred to their Primary Care Physician,&#xD;
      Internist or Gastroenterologist to be prescribed treatment for the Irritable Bowel Syndrome.&#xD;
      Placebo responders in the double-blind phase will not be eligible to enter the 6-month open&#xD;
      label maintenance phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical response will be measured in several ways. Abdominal pain severity will be measured&#xD;
      with an ordinal scale rated from 1-9 (1=mild pain/discomfort, 9=very severe pain/discomfort).&#xD;
      Abdominal pain frequency will be measured on a four-point scale (1=pain or discomfort present&#xD;
      only occasionally, 2=pain or discomfort present less than half the day, 3= pain or discomfort&#xD;
      present more than half the day, 4=pain or discomfort almost all day). The same ordinal scale&#xD;
      will be used to quantify the distress or discomfort caused by feeling of incomplete&#xD;
      evacuation, bloating or abdominal discomfort, and general level of stress or tension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Computation and Power Analysis Power considerations The calculations that follow&#xD;
      are computed for the current design with an anticipated difference in pre-and post-treatment&#xD;
      on the mean composite pain scores (on IVRS) of 25% (i.e. a reduction of score from 100 to&#xD;
      75). The means and standard deviations for this computation rely on our previous open-label&#xD;
      studies of paroxetine and citalopram in IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a strong effect size (0.5) of the primary variable (mean composite pain scores) and&#xD;
      alpha set at 0.05, a projected sample size of 50 can detect the main effects with a power of&#xD;
      greater than 0.95. If a lower effect size is assumed (0.4), a projected sample size of 55 can&#xD;
      detect main effects with a power of approximately 0.94. Note that power may be reduced by&#xD;
      attrition of the sample (i.e. dropouts) and also may be limited in testing secondary&#xD;
      hypotheses where a further stratification of sample may be necessary (i.e. if the data is&#xD;
      examined separately in men and women)&#xD;
&#xD;
      It may be more appropriate to have a sample size of 60 which allows for a 20% attrition rate&#xD;
      and can still detect an effect size of 0.4 for the primary variable in the&#xD;
      treatment-completer group with a power greater than 90.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses The study's main hypothesis is that paroxetine (Paxil CR) treatment will&#xD;
      be more effective than placebo in reducing symptoms of IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical tests will be two sided at the 0.05 level of significance. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics will be used to provide a profile of demographic and outcome measures. Pearson&#xD;
      product moment correlational analyses will be conducted to examine the relationships among&#xD;
      variables. Baseline assessments between the two groups will be compared using chi square for&#xD;
      categorical variables and independent t tests (two tailed) for continuous variables. Between&#xD;
      group (medication/placebo) comparisons for primary and secondary variables will employ&#xD;
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures. Assessments will be taken at baseline&#xD;
      and end of week 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. Within group analyses (pre and&#xD;
      end-of-treatment) will employ two tailed t tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To control for the possibility that current psychopathology might affect subject responding&#xD;
      on interview and self-report instruments and otherwise modulate the treatment effects, the&#xD;
      distribution of BDI-II and BAI scores and life time Axis I diagnoses in the placebo and&#xD;
      control groups will be examined. The potential influence of any unequally distributed&#xD;
      variables will be controlled via analyses-of covariance (ANCOVA) using the unequally&#xD;
      distributed variables as covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the primary analysis other exploratory analyses will be conducted to test potential&#xD;
      hypotheses for further studies.&#xD;

                  severe enough to warrant psychiatric hospital treatment, as an in-patient within&#xD;
                  12 months of entry to the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with current psychotic disorders, bipolar disorders, alcohol or drug&#xD;

             following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  All antidepressant medication (including selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors&#xD;
                  (SSRIs). Where antidepressant medication has been previously prescribed, the&#xD;
                  following timelines should be adhered to: a 42-day wash out period from Prozac™&#xD;
                  (fluoxetine) before randomization into the study; a 2 week wash-out for other&#xD;
                  antidepressants.&#xD;

                  been taking a stable dose for at lease 3 months prior to entering the study and&#xD;
                  that this dose does not change during the study. Patients taking bulking agents&#xD;
                  on an &quot;as needed&quot; basis must refrain from taking these medications during the&#xD;
                  study.&#xD;
