      gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBS, functional diarrhea, or functional bloating.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Functional Bowel disorders (FBD) including Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) are characterized&#xD;
      by a variable combination of chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms not explained by&#xD;
      structural or biochemical abnormalities. IBS is the most common functional gastrointestinal&#xD;
      disorder, affecting 8% to 23% of adults in the western world and accounts for 12% of primary&#xD;
      care and 28% of gastroenterological practice visits yearly. The pathophysiology of IBS is not&#xD;
      completely understood and currently available drug treatments for IBS are very limited (1-2).&#xD;
      The apparent success of the use of probiotics in several gut disorders (e.g., IBD) together&#xD;
      with the greater understanding of the role of inflammation and intestinal microflora in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of IBS has led to increased interest in use of probiotics in patients with&#xD;
      IBS (3). The data on the use of probiotic in IBS is limited. However, few reported studies&#xD;
      show encouraging results and suggests some symptomatic response and parallel improvement in&#xD;
      quality of life (3-4). A controlled, double-blind study, randomized 20 patients with IBS to&#xD;
      L. plantarum 299v or placebo for 4 weeks concluded that L. plantarum decreased abdominal pain&#xD;
      and tended to normalize stool frequency in constipated patients (5). On the other hand,&#xD;
      Lactobacillus casei GG, was found to improve stool consistency in patients with IBS and&#xD;
      diarrhea (6). A recent randomized controlled trial using the probiotic formulation VSL#3&#xD;
      improved abdominal bloating in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS. However, no&#xD;
      differences in gastrointestinal transit measurement, bowel function scores or satisfactory&#xD;
      global symptom relief were shown (7). The inconsistent findings of these clinical studies may&#xD;
      be accounted to the differences in probiotics composition and the heterogeneous and&#xD;
      multifactorial nature of the disorder. However, these studies indicate a potential&#xD;
      relationship between probiotics therapy and functional abdominal symptoms and suggesting that&#xD;
      the possible role of probiotics in the treatment of IBS deserves further study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is 18 to 75 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is an ambulatory outpatient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has IBS, or functional diarrhea, or functional bloating according to the&#xD;
             Rome II criteria for functional GI disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has the above symptoms for at least two weeks, despite current therapy.&#xD;
             For diarrhea, we will use the definition of a mean of &gt;2 bowel movements per day, or a&#xD;
             mean score of &gt; 4 on the Bristol Stool Form Scale per week. For bloating we will use&#xD;
             the Rome II definition &quot;a feeling of abdominal fullness or bloating&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must have had a colonoscopy if age &gt; 50y/o.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject's symptoms are mild to moderate symptoms in severity. Symptoms severity&#xD;
             will be assessed at baseline and at the end of the 2-weeks screening period to&#xD;
             determine eligibility prior randomization. Severity of bowel symptoms will be&#xD;
             determined using the Francis Whorwell IBS severity scale: Mild &lt;175, Moderate 175-300,&#xD;
             Severe &gt;300&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The subject has been treated for a malignancy within the last 5 years (except BCC or&#xD;
             SCC skin cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has been diagnosed with lactase deficiency and this can explain their&#xD;
             symptoms (i.e., symptoms resolved or reduced significantly with lactose-free diet.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has participated in a drug study within the last 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject received antibiotic treatment during the last 8 weeks. (If the subject was&#xD;
             on antibiotic treatment, a washout period of 8 weeks is required).&#xD;

          -  The subject had previous significant intestinal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is pregnant or lactating, or unwilling to maintain effective contraception&#xD;
