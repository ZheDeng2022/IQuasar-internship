  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study 1304 is a Phase I dose escalation study conducted in adults with persistent moderate&#xD;
      (grade 2) or severe (grade 3) swelling due to inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis,&#xD;
      psoriatic arthritis, or ankylosing spondylitis) in at least one peripheral joint eligible for&#xD;
      injection. Disease must not be severe enough to warrant use of a TNF-alpha antagonist in the&#xD;
      next three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current use of TNF-alpha antagonists is not permitted. Subjects with rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      must have had an adequate trial of at least one disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)&#xD;
      prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of intra-articular administration of tgAAC94.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      tgAAC94 is a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2) vector genetically&#xD;
      engineered to contain the cDNA for a human tumor necrosis factor receptor&#xD;
      (TNFR)-immunoglobulin (IgG1) Fc fusion (TNFR:Fc) gene. The DNA sequence of TNFR:Fc in tgAAC94&#xD;
      codes for a protein sequence identical to etanercept (Enbrel). TNF-alpha has been strongly&#xD;
      implicated as a major participant in the inflammatory cascade that leads to joint damage and&#xD;
      destruction in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and&#xD;
      ankylosing spondylitis (AS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-articular delivery of the TNFR:Fc gene (tgAAC94) should result in expression of the&#xD;
      secreted protein in the joint space and provide local high concentrations of soluble TNFR:Fc&#xD;
      for an extended period of time without requiring frequent administration. Thus, this proposed&#xD;
      therapy would be useful in those inflammatory arthritis patients who have a persistently&#xD;
      problematic joint despite the use of systemic TNF-alpha blockade or who have a limited number&#xD;
      of arthritic joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extensive preclinical studies using rAAV2 containing several different transgenes in a&#xD;
      variety of animal models have shown efficient and persistent gene transfer and expression&#xD;
      with minimal toxicity. The parent virus (wild-type AAV2) is a naturally occurring,&#xD;
      non-replicating virus that depends on a helper virus, such as adenovirus, for replication.&#xD;
      The recombinant AAV2 vector is unable to replicate in target host cells because it lacks the&#xD;
      AAV genes, whose protein products are also required in trans, for replication and packaging&#xD;
      of progeny virus. Extensive epidemiological studies have found AAV2 to be non-pathogenic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is no cure for inflammatory arthritis, treatment has been revolutionized by&#xD;
      the advent of anti-TNF-alpha therapies. These include etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab&#xD;
      (Remicade) and adalimumab (Humira), which consist of soluble TNF receptors, chimeric&#xD;
      human-mouse anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibodies and fully human anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, respectively. Clinical studies have shown these products to improve the signs and&#xD;
      symptoms, inhibit the structural damage, and impact functional outcomes in patients with&#xD;
      inflammatory arthritis.&#xD;
