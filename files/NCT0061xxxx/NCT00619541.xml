      The purpose of this study is to use Sorafenib + 5-FU to evaluate activity, efficacy, safety,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) in patients with advanced hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma (HCC).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous chemotherapeutic regimens have been tested for use against hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      (HCC). HCC is, however, highly resistant to chemotherapy; doxorubicin and 5- fluorouracil&#xD;
      containing regimens, alone or in combinations, results in less than a 20% response, with a&#xD;
      median survival of less than 4 months. Furthermore even the objective responses are&#xD;
      short-lasting. In a metaanalysis of the published randomized studies on HCC, neither&#xD;
      doxorubicin nor any chemotherapeutic agent has been shown to have any survival benefit for&#xD;
      HCC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorafenib (Bay 43-9006) is a novel signal transduction inhibitor that prevent tumor cell&#xD;
      proliferation and angiogenesis through blockade of the Raf/Mek/Erk pathway at the level of&#xD;
      Raf Kinase and the receptor tyrosine kinases VEGFR-2 and PDGFR-beta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent preclinical studies have shown the activation of Mek-1/2 and its downstream target&#xD;
      MAPK in HCC tumors. In a phase II study 137 patients advanced primary liver cancer with have&#xD;
      been treated with Sorafenib administered as a single agent. Investigators reported seven&#xD;
      patients with partial responses, five minor responses and 59 with stable disease for at least&#xD;
      4 months. Median overall survival was 9.2 months and median time to progression 4.2 months.&#xD;
      This study showed that Sorafenib was well tolerated and side-effects were manageable and&#xD;
      reversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a widely used agent for patients with unresectable advanced HCC,&#xD;
      with objective responses rates around 10%. Compared to bolus administration, infusional 5-FU&#xD;
      in metastatic colorectal cancers has demonstrated increased activity with less toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorafenib as single agent in HCC has demonstrated activity in terms of objective responses&#xD;
      and promising duration of stable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of Sorafenib and 5-FU was evaluated in a phase I study where the drug is&#xD;
      associated with different 5FU based schedules with good toxicity profile and objectives&#xD;
      responses in particular in colorectal carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these data our purpose is to study infusional 5-FU with Sorafenib to evaluate the&#xD;
      activity, efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and duration of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      5-FU 3000 mg/sqm 48 hours continuous infusion every 14 days Sorafenib 400 mg bid orally&#xD;
      continuously 5-FU will be administered for a maximum of 12 cycles. Sorafenib will be&#xD;
      administered from the start of treatment in combination with 5-FU until progression of&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

             agent or combination of agents with clinically proven anticancer activity administered&#xD;
             systemically, with the purpose of affecting the cancer, either directly or indirectly,&#xD;
             including palliative and therapeutic endpoints. In certain cases, local anticancer&#xD;
             therapy is allowed. See Inclusion Criteria for details.&#xD;

             toxicity, such as febrile neutropenia, when clinically indicated, or at the discretion&#xD;
             of the investigator; however, they may not be substituted for a required dose&#xD;
             reduction. Chronic Erythropoietin treatment prior to the study entry or during the&#xD;
             study is permitted.&#xD;

             negative pregnancy test performed within 7 days of the start of treatment. Both men&#xD;
             and women enrolled in this trial must use adequate barrier birth control measures&#xD;
             (e.g. cervical cap, condom, diaphragm) during the course of the trial. Oral birth&#xD;
             control methods alone will not be considered adequate on this study, because of the&#xD;
             potential pharmacokinetic interaction between SORAFENIB and oral contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Substance abuse, medical, psychological or social conditions that, in the judgment of&#xD;
             the investigator, is likely to interfere with the patient's participation in the study&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known allergy to the investigational agent or any agent given in association with this&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
