  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study. Subjects will be recruited from the urology practices of Dr. Ken&#xD;
      Peters and Dr. Ananias Diokno at William Beaumont Hospital. Subjects will be referred to the&#xD;
      study by the clinician recommending Sacral NeuroModulation therapy (SNM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study is to explore the effect of SNM on sensory pathways by measuring CPT values&#xD;
      pre and post SNM treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be scheduled 1-2 weeks prior to planned implantation of the SNM wire electrode&#xD;
      (Stage 1). Patients that do not have a 50% improvement in their symptoms in Stage 1 will not&#xD;
      go on to Stage II procedures and will not undergo further CPT testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment, the subjects will complete a short medical history questionnaire confirming&#xD;
      that they meet inclusion criteria and do not fall under exclusion criteria. This will include&#xD;
      review of recent urinalysis and/or urine culture confirming the absence of a recent urinary&#xD;
      tract infection. Participants will be given information on the relevant CPT testing including&#xD;
      the need for bladder/urethra catheterization as part of that testing pre and post SNM&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline testing visit, subjects will undergo CPT testing using transcutaneous&#xD;
      stimulation in the distribution of the pudendal nerve on the perineum. Subjects will undergo&#xD;
      bladder/urethral catheterization in using standard sterile technique. Once the&#xD;
      bladder/urethral catheter is in place CPT testing will be conducted at various frequencies of&#xD;
      to identify the current perception thresholds of each nerve fiber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the testing the catheter will be removed and the subjects will be given&#xD;
      a single dose of an oral antibiotic to minimize infection. This meeting and testing will&#xD;
      require approximately 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo Stage I of the SNM procedure with their own physician at a subsequent&#xD;
      appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subjects have a 50% improvement in their symptoms after 2 weeks with Stage 1 SNM, they&#xD;
      will under go Stage II of the SNM procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will have an appointment scheduled for their follow-up CPT testing at the&#xD;
      clinical research office 4 to 6 weeks after the Stage II procedure. The subject will be given&#xD;
      a urinalysis and urine culture lab slip, and will be instructed to drop a urine sample off at&#xD;
      the lab 3 days before their scheduled appointment for testing. If their urine culture is&#xD;
      positive, they will be given a prescription for an antibiotic and excluded from this testing.&#xD;
      They may however be tested once their urine culture is negative, as long as it is within 2&#xD;
      weeks of their original post-stage 2 CPT test appointment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo repeat CPT testing using transcutaneous stimulation in the distribution&#xD;
      of the pudendal nerve on the perineum. Subjects will then undergo bladder/urethral&#xD;
      catheterization using standard sterile technique. Once the bladder/urethral catheter is in&#xD;
      place CPT testing will then be conducted at various frequencies to identify the current&#xD;
      perception thresholds of each nerve fiber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the testing the catheter will be removed and the patients will be given&#xD;
      a single dose of an oral antibiotic to minimize infection. This evaluation will require&#xD;
      approximately 60 minutes.&#xD;

    <description>During the CPT testing a catheter will be placed in the bladder. The catheter has sensors to record the body's sensation of pressure. The sensation felt will be similar to a light touch and is painless. A gel pad will be placed in the general area of the vagina to record the feeling of a light touch.</description>
