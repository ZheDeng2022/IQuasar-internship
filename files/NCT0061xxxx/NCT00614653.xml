    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of&#xD;
      capecitabine, erlotinib hydrochloride, and bevacizumab that can be given in combination with&#xD;
      radiation to patients with pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking the&#xD;
      growth of blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capecitabine and erlotinib hydrochloride are designed to interfere with the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Dose Level:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in the study, you will begin receiving&#xD;
      capecitabine, erlotinib hydrochloride, and bevacizumab. The dose you receive will be based on&#xD;
      how many participants have been enrolled before you, and on the safety data that are&#xD;
      available. The first group of enrolled participants will be given low doses of capecitabine,&#xD;
      erlotinib hydrochloride, and bevacizumab. If no intolerable side effects occur, the next&#xD;
      group will be enrolled at a higher dose level. This process will continue until researchers&#xD;
      find the highest dose of capecitabine, erlotinib hydrochloride, and bevacizumab that can be&#xD;
      given without intolerable side effects occurring. The study doctor will tell you what dose&#xD;
      you will be receiving and how it compares to the doses other participants have received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 14, and 28, you will receive bevacizumab through a needle in your vein. Your first&#xD;
      infusion will last about 90 minutes. If you tolerate the drug well, the next infusion will&#xD;
      last about 60 minutes. If the 60-minute infusion is well tolerated, all other infusions will&#xD;
      last about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each day that you receive radiation, you will take capecitabine and erlotinib&#xD;
      hydrochloride by mouth in the morning and evening with food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive radiation once a day on Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. This&#xD;
      schedule will be continue for 5 1/2 weeks or 28 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week while you are on study, you will have the following tests and procedures&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be experiencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will repeat the same health questionnaire that you filled out at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab and Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at any time during the study the tumor can be removed surgically, you will have surgery. A&#xD;
      separate consent form would be used. Because bevacizumab may slow the healing of wounds,&#xD;
      study participants may not have surgery within 10 weeks after the last bevacizumab infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will remain on study for up to 5 1/2 weeks. You will be taken off-study early if the&#xD;
      disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-Of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four (4) to 6 weeks after you finish radiation, you will have an end-of-study visit with the&#xD;
      following tests and procedures performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a complete physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have chest x-rays and CT scans of the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will repeat the health questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Experimental Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you appear to be benefitting from the experimental therapy, the study doctor may decide to&#xD;
      continue your experimental therapy after the end-of-study visit. This would be daily&#xD;
      erlotinib hydrochloride, with bevacizumab infusions every 2 weeks unless the disease gets&#xD;
      worse or intolerable side effects occur. You would have study visits once a month, with the&#xD;
      same procedures as you did during the weekly study visits (except for the questionnaires).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Capecitabine, bevacizumab, and erlotinib hydrochloride are&#xD;
      FDA approved and commercially available. The use of capecitabine and bevacizumab for&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer and in combination with erlotinib hydrochloride is investigational. At this&#xD;
      time, the 3-drug combination is being used in research only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 patients will take part in the study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;

    <description>Complete response (CR) - complete disappearance of clinical evidence of a tumor. Partial response (PR) - 50% or greater decrease in sum of products of the longest perpendicular diameters of all measured lesions compared to baseline. Stable disease (SD) - no significant change in disease status. Progressive disease (PD) - a 25% increase in the area of malignant lesions &gt;2 cm2 or in sum of products of the longest perpendicular diameters of individual lesions in a given organ site. If only one lesion is available for measurement, a 50% increase in the size if the area of the lesion was 2 cm2. The appearance of new lesions will also constitute progressive disease. Comparisons of tumor size made with previous smallest measurement in patients who have attained a partial response or with baseline measurements in patients with stable disease. Tumor progression also defined as significant clinical deterioration that cannot be attributed to treatment or other medical conditions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must be &gt;/= 18 years of age. There will be no upper age restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Cytologic or histologic proof of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Patients can have&#xD;
             tumor originating in any part of the pancreas. Islet cell tumors are not eligible.&#xD;
             Only patients with non- metastatic, unresectable disease are eligible. Patients who&#xD;
             cannot undergo resection because of underlying medical problems are also eligible.&#xD;
             Patients with regional nodal disease are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. All patients must be staged with a physical exam, CXR, and contrast-enhanced helical&#xD;
             thin-cut abdominal CT. Unresectability is defined by CT criteria: a) evidence of tumor&#xD;
             extension to the celiac axis or superior mesenteric (SM) artery, or b) evidence on&#xD;
             either CT or angiogram of occlusion of the SM vein or SM/ portal vein confluence. If a&#xD;
             tumor does not meet this definition and is found to be unresectable at surgical&#xD;
             exploration, then that tumor is considered unresectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients may have received prior chemotherapy but not prior radiation therapy to the&#xD;
             upper abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;

             endobiliary stent, the bilirubin level must have declined on consecutive measurements&#xD;
             indicating adequate biliary decompression; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;/= 5 times&#xD;
             the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Renal function: BUN &lt;/= 30 mg%, creatinine &lt;/= 1.5 mg% and creatinine clearance &gt;/=&#xD;
             30ml/min (estimated as calculated with Cockcroft-Gault equation). Note: In patients&#xD;
             with moderate renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) at&#xD;
             baseline, a dose reduction to 75% of the capecitabine starting dose is recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must have signed informed consent indicating that they are aware of the&#xD;
             investigational nature of the study, and are aware that participation is voluntary.&#xD;
