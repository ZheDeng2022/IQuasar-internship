    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of a home-based exercise rehabilitation&#xD;
      program compared to a supervised exercise program on intermittent claudication (leg pain or&#xD;
      discomfort) and ambulatory function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to 1) compare the changes in ambulatory function, vascular function, and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life in patients limited by intermittent claudication following a&#xD;
      home-based exercise rehabilitation program, a supervised exercise program, and a light&#xD;
      resistance training exercise program; and 2) determine whether changes in walking efficiency,&#xD;
      calf muscle circulation, and calf muscle oxygen are the reasons by which both home-based and&#xD;
      supervised exercise rehabilitation improve ambulatory function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that a home-based exercise program utilizing new physical activity monitoring&#xD;
      technology that can accurately quantify exercise adherence as well as the intensity,&#xD;
      duration, and volume of exercise sessions will result in similar changes in ambulatory&#xD;
      function, vascular function, and health-related quality of life compared to a standard,&#xD;
      supervised exercise program. Further, both the home-based and supervised exercise&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs will result in greater changes in ambulatory function, vascular&#xD;
      function, and health-related quality of life than a light resistance training exercise&#xD;
      program. Finally, we hypothesize that the changes in walking efficiency, calf muscle&#xD;
      circulation, and calf muscle oxygen will each be predictive of improved ambulation following&#xD;
      the home-based exercise program as well as the supervised exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3-month program will consist of walking 3 times per week, with progressive increases in&#xD;
      duration and intensity. The two walking exercise programs will be matched on the estimated&#xD;
      caloric expenditure during the training sessions. Patients in the control group will perform&#xD;
      light resistance training without any walking exercise.&#xD;
