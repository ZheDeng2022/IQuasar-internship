  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Routine oral examination (ROE) refers to periodic monitoring of the general and&#xD;
      oral health status of patients. In most developed Western countries a decreasing prevalence&#xD;
      of oral diseases underpins the need for a more individualised approach in assigning recall&#xD;
      intervals for regular attendees instead of systematic decision making of fixed intervals.&#xD;
      From a quality of care perspective as well, one can also question the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      widespread prophylactic removal of mandibular impacted asymptomatic third molars (MIM) in&#xD;
      adolescents and adults. It is as yet unclear how quality of oral care can be improved.&#xD;
      Research data on effectiveness of interventions to promote continuing professional&#xD;
      development for dentists are rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design: This implementation study is a cluster randomised controlled trial with&#xD;
      groups of GDPs as the unit of randomisation. The aim of the study is to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness and efficiency of small group quality improvement on professional decision&#xD;
      making of general dental practitioners (GDPs) in daily practice. Six peer groups&#xD;
      ('IQual-groups') shall be randomised either to the intervention group I or group II. Groups&#xD;
      of GDPs allocated to either of these arms act as each other's control group. An IQual peer&#xD;
      group consists of 8-10 GDPs who attend in monthly structured sessions scheduled for&#xD;
      discussion on practice related topics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GDPs in both trail arms receive recent developed evidence-based CPG on ROE or MIM&#xD;
      respectively. The implementation strategy consists of 1 interactive IQual circle meeting of&#xD;
      mostly 2-3 hours. In addition, both groups of GDPs receive feedback on personal and group&#xD;
      characteristics and are invited to make use of web-based patient vignettes for further&#xD;
      individual training on risk assessment policy. A few weeks after the interactive meeting&#xD;
      reminders (flow charts) will be send by mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measure for the ROE-study and control group is the use and appropriateness&#xD;
      of individualised risk assessment in assigning recall intervals and for the MIM-study the use&#xD;
      and appropriateness of individualised mandibular impacted third molar risk management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements (pre-intervention data collection) will take place in months 1-3, starting in&#xD;
      September 2006. Post-intervention data collection will be performed after 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: In most developed Western countries a decreasing prevalence of oral diseases&#xD;
      underpins the need for a more individualised approach in assigning recall intervals for&#xD;
      regular attendees. If the evaluation of this multifaceted implementation study reveals a&#xD;
      shift in individual performance of GDPs in assessing risks for oral disease, further research&#xD;
      questions and efforts to a risk-based professional education could be promoted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific hypothesis Multifaceted implementation of consensus based clinical practice&#xD;
      guidelines (CPGs) for GDPs on ROEs and the management of asymptomatic impacted third molars&#xD;
      (MIM) in daily dental practice is more effective and efficient compared to only dissemination&#xD;
      of CPGs.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        GDPs inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  GDPs have to work in general dental practice for at least three days/week and should&#xD;
             have practice experience for at least three years. They were eligible if their&#xD;
             practice population was characterised by primary oral care patients, consisting of&#xD;
             regular attendees, and patient recordkeeping was conducted electronically. GDPs had to&#xD;
             give their informed consent to assess and evaluate electronically patient records.&#xD;
             Patient data were collected anonymously.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient's inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible for inclusion, patients should meet (fulfil) several criteria, depending on&#xD;
        the IQual's CPG to be used (ROE or MIM):&#xD;
&#xD;
        ROE:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients regularly visiting their dentist (at least once a year) over the past&#xD;
             three years for ROEs will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        MIM:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients regularly visiting their dentist (at least once a year) over the past&#xD;
             three years for ROEs are included for the study and, in addition, have to be aged&#xD;
             between 17 and 35 years, with disease-free impacted mandibular third molars in&#xD;
             retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For both group of patients, it is important that they can be linked particular to the&#xD;
        participating GDP, especially in practices with more than one GDP occupied&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient's exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        ROE:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic driven (emergency) attendance in dental practice, or&#xD;
             recently started regular attendance in the participating dental practice (within past&#xD;
             three years).&#xD;
&#xD;
        MIM:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic third molars in dental practice, or recently started regular&#xD;
             attendance (past three years) or who already had their third molars removed.&#xD;
