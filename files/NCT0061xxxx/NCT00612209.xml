  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single arm, dose escalation study of ARQ 197 in patients with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will take ARQ 197 orally twice daily continuously at dose levels specified for their&#xD;
      respective dose cohorts. The ARQ 197 starting dose will be a total daily dose of 200 mg (100&#xD;
      mg bid). ARQ 197 treatment will be continued until progression of disease, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion is met. In the case of toxicity, dose&#xD;
      adjustment is permitted. A treatment cycle is designed as four weeks (28 days) and will be&#xD;
      repeated without therapy interruption.&#xD;
