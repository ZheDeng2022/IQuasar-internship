    <textblock>
      The definition of the most 'at-risk' population within highly susceptible groups would&#xD;
      provide an opportunity for preemptive therapeutics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A convenient, safe, and tolerable therapy that delays the onset of clinical disease during&#xD;
      the pre-symptomatic stage of demyelinating disease would provide a therapeutic alternative to&#xD;
      a 'wait and see' approach in subjects at 'high risk' for CIS (clinically isolated syndrome -&#xD;
      monosymptomatic demyelinating disease) or MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identical twins share the same genes and have the highest rate of shared MS. An identical&#xD;
      female with a sister twin with MS has a 34% chance of having MS. Non concordant (no MS yet)&#xD;
      identical (monozygotic - from the same sperm-egg zygote) female twins provide an ideal&#xD;
      population to find out what factors predict the onset of MS in the non-affected twin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 30 identical female twins, one with MS and the other without MS, and obtain&#xD;
      brain MRI and biological samples on the non-affected twin and determine if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the presence of characteristic MS-like lesion(s) on baseline MRI predisposes to MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  specific proteins in blood or cerebrospinal fluid predispose to the clinical expression&#xD;
           of demyelinating disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      If we can predict by simple tests (MR brain scan and blood tests) the likelihood of the onset&#xD;
      of MS in 'at risk' subjects, and have safe and tolerable therapies, we may be able to prevent&#xD;
      the clinical onset of demyelinating disease (MS).&#xD;

      Primary Objective: Determine if the presence of characteristic MS-like lesion(s) on baseline&#xD;
      MRI predisposes to CIS/MS in female MZ twins discordant for CIS/MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: Define the protein and microarray gene expression profile predictive of&#xD;
      conversion to MS/CIS in female MZ twins discordant for CIS/MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Outcomes: This is a single center, clinical study to determine if the presence of&#xD;
      MS-like MRI brain lesions predict the rate of conversion to CIS in female MZ twins discordant&#xD;
      for CIS/MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will screen and recruit 30 subjects, and begin to follow these subjects annually for a&#xD;
      total of 5 years to determine if MR brain scans predict CIS/MS conversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions and Duration: Subjects will be recruited over 2 years and followed for five&#xD;
      years with annual neurological examinations and MR brain scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Population: 30 female co-twins discordant for CIS/MS will be studied. We&#xD;
      predict 72% of the 27% 'at risk' subjects with characteristic MR brain lesions at baseline&#xD;
      will convert to CIS within 5 years. We predict only 6% of the 73% 'at risk' subjects without&#xD;
      characteristic MR brain lesions at baseline will convert to CIS within 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data will determine if paraclinical (MRI) evidence of demyelinating disease and&#xD;
      specific blood or cerebrospinal fluid proteins predict clinical expression of disease in&#xD;
      highly susceptible populations predicts.&#xD;
