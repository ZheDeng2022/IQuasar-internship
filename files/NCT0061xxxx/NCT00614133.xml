  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loss of muscle mass and body protein are the main causes of fatigue after bowel surgery,&#xD;
      which may result in a longer hospital stay and a higher rate of complications. This&#xD;
      particularly applies to malnourished patients with cancer who undergo surgery with less&#xD;
      muscle protein reserves than patients who are well-nourished. Anesthesiologists can&#xD;
      favourably influence these undesirable consequences of surgery by choosing the type of pain&#xD;
      treatment, i.e. analgesia. Our group recently observed that pain treatment with epidural&#xD;
      catheters (these are placed in the so called epidural space, which lies between the spine and&#xD;
      the skin of the back), in contrast to the more conventional use of intravenous morphine, can&#xD;
      prevent the loss of body protein after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the present research program is to study whether this protein sparing effect of&#xD;
      epidural analgesia can be further augmented if we feed our patients intravenously with&#xD;
      glucose and protein starting the day prior to surgery. We believe that this new concept will&#xD;
      not only avoid the increased protein loss after surgery, but will also help patients to build&#xD;
      up new protein which is needed to fight the stress caused by the operation.&#xD;

      The major objective of the nutritional management of surgical patients is to accelerate wound&#xD;
      healing and increase resistance to infection while preventing wastage of functional and&#xD;
      structural proteins. Parenteral nutrition represents a useful strategy to achieve this goal,&#xD;
      particularly in patients undergoing major abdominal procedures with temporary intolerance to&#xD;
      oral feeding. At present administration of large, hypercaloric amounts of glucose together&#xD;
      with amino acids is the only nutritional modality to establish a positive protein balance&#xD;
      (anabolism) after surgery. The fact that hyperalimentation requires central venous&#xD;
      cannulation, causes hyperglycemia and is associated with increased morbidity is an impediment&#xD;
      to its routine use. Attempts to induce anabolism by diminishing the glucose load to iso- or&#xD;
      hypocaloric quantities failed because of&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  failure to control for type and quality of perioperative analgesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  inadequate assessment of the patient's catabolic status prior to surgery with subsequent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lack of individualization of energy and substrate supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recently demonstrated that segmental pain relief by epidural analgesia facilitates&#xD;
      oxidative glucose utilization thereby decreasing the amount of glucose necessary to attenuate&#xD;
      protein losses after surgery. Hypocaloric glucose and epidural analgesia prevented the&#xD;
      postoperative increase in protein oxidation, but only if preoperative fasting was avoided,&#xD;
      i.e. the glucose infusion was started 24 hours before surgery. We also showed that patients&#xD;
      with epidural analgesia could be rendered anabolic by short term administration of glucose&#xD;
      and amino acids. Based on our findings of anti-catabolic and anabolic effects of epidural&#xD;
      analgesia in the presence of energy and substrate supply we now propose that epidural&#xD;
      analgesia and hypocaloric parenteral nutrition initiated 24 hours before colorectal surgery&#xD;
      will produce a more positive postoperative protein balance including a greater muscle protein&#xD;
      synthesis than when initiated with skin incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test the validity of this assumption, patients scheduled for elective colorectal&#xD;
      cancer surgery will be randomly assigned to an &quot;early&quot; or &quot;late&quot; feeding protocol. &quot;Early&quot;&#xD;
      nutrition will start 24 hours prior to surgery, &quot;late&quot; nutrition will commence with surgical&#xD;
      skin incision. Nutrition will be adjusted to provide 50% of the patient's actual energy&#xD;
      expenditure as glucose and 20% as amino acids. The stable isotope tracer L-[1-13C]leucine&#xD;
      will be applied to assess whole body protein breakdown, amino acid oxidation and protein&#xD;
      synthesis. A positive protein balance (difference between protein synthesis and protein&#xD;
      breakdown) will be used as an indicator of anabolism. Because whole body protein kinetics&#xD;
      provide no insight into metabolic processes at organ level (muscle, liver), the fractional&#xD;
      synthesis rates of albumin, fibrinogen and muscle protein will also be determined after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demonstration of anabolic effects of epidural analgesia and nutrition with less than half&#xD;
      the commonly used energy would have a valuable practical application. If the nutrient load&#xD;
      can be decreased, use can be made of peripheral veins and hyperglycemia can be avoided, thus&#xD;
      making nutritional therapy more efficacious, safer and available to more patients.&#xD;
