  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if giving men with early stage (Grade 1-2)&#xD;
      prostate cancer dietary supplement from soybeans called isoflavones, will change their blood&#xD;
      hormone levels. Isoflavones are substances found in a high concentration in soybeans that are&#xD;
      converted in the intestines to hormone-like compounds which are similar to estrogen. They are&#xD;
      also thought to have cancer fighting properties. Clinical trials suggest that isoflavones can&#xD;
      increase certain sex hormones, which results in the slower production of prostate cancer&#xD;
      cells. This study will determine if adding isoflavones (supplied as Prevastein HC®) 80 mg/day&#xD;
      in a pill form can change your risk factors that cause early stage prostate cancer to&#xD;
      progress to more advanced disease.&#xD;

      To prevent biasing the outcome of the study, this is a double-blind study design, where both&#xD;
      the trialists and the participants are blinded to the specific nature of the product&#xD;
      (isoflavones and placebo). Participants in both groups will be discouraged from increasing&#xD;
      their intake of dietary isoflavones in the form of tofu, soy beans, soy milk, etc. In&#xD;
      addition, the intervention does not include active counseling on dietary modification and&#xD;
      supplementation of any one group. Monthly appointments will be made for all participants for&#xD;
      data collection and toxicity assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schema:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a controlled, randomized, double blinded clinical trial, having one experimental and&#xD;
      one control group (n - 75/arm). Participants in the experimental group will consume an&#xD;
      isoflavones supplement in the form of Prevastein HC®, which will deliver 80 mgs (40 mg/dose)&#xD;
      biologically active isoflavones and those in the control group will receive an identical&#xD;
      placebo. The isoflavones supplement and the placebo tablets will be manufactured and packaged&#xD;
      by Cognis Corporation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Isoflavones will be supplied at no charge by Cognis Corporation, LaGrange, Illinois as&#xD;
           Prevastein HC®. Each Prevastein HC® tablet delivers 20 mg biologically active&#xD;
           isoflavones, which is available for absorption. Participants will consume 2 tablets&#xD;
           twice daily (with meals) in addition to their usual diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Placebo will be supplied at no charge by Cognis Corporation, LaGrange, Illinois as an&#xD;
           indistinguishable tablet. Participants will consume 2 tablets twice daily (with meals)&#xD;
           in addition to their usual diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A standardized multivitamin will be supplied at no charge.&#xD;
