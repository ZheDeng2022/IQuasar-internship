  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, randomized, safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) study of sorafenib given in&#xD;
      combination with capecitabine. The study will enroll two simultaneous cohorts; patients will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to either Cohort A or Cohort B. A third cohort (C) may be added to the&#xD;
      protocol at a later date.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During Cycle 1, patients will receive capecitabine alone for the first 7 days (Cohort A will&#xD;
      receive 750 mg/m2 of capecitabine twice daily, and Cohort B will receive 1000 mg/m2 of&#xD;
      capecitabine twice daily for the first 7 days of Cycle 1). For days 8-14 of Cycle 1, patients&#xD;
      will receive capecitabine (750 mg/m2 twice daily for Cohort A; 1000 mg/m2 twice daily for&#xD;
      Cohort B) combined with sorafenib (400 mg twice daily for both cohorts); on days 15-21 of&#xD;
      Cycle 1, patients will receive sorafenib alone (400 mg twice daily for both cohorts).&#xD;
      Beginning with day 1 of Cycle 2 and all treatment cycles thereafter, patients will be dosed&#xD;
      as follows: Cohort A will receive sorafenib orally at 400 mg twice daily for 21 days, and&#xD;
      capecitabine orally at 750 mg/m2 twice daily for the first 14 days of a 21-day treatment&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B will receive sorafenib orally at 400 mg twice daily for 21 days, and capecitabine&#xD;
      orally at 1000 mg/m2 twice daily for the first 14 days of a 21-day treatment cycle. After 6&#xD;
      patients each are enrolled into Cohort A and Cohort B, one of these two cohorts will enroll&#xD;
      an additional 6-12 patients in an expansion phase.&#xD;
