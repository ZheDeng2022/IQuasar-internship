      I Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Simulation-based training in maximal barrier precaution technique during central venous&#xD;
           catheter (CVC) placement is superior to general videotape-based training&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Baseline performance in maximal barrier precaution technique of PGY 2 and 3 Medical&#xD;
           residents, certified in CVC placement, is poor&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. PGY 2 and 3 medical residents have low self-perceived confidence in mastering maximal&#xD;
           barrier precaution technique during central venous catheter (CVC) placement&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. PGY 2 and 3 medical residents undergoing simulation-based training in maximal barrier&#xD;
           precaution technique during central venous catheter (CVC) placement have good recall&#xD;
           after 3 months&#xD;

      Central line associated bloodstream infection (CL-ABI) is an important and preventable cause&#xD;
      of nosocomial infections and is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality. It is&#xD;
      estimated that 5 to 26% of patients experience an infectious complication from their central&#xD;
      venous catheter [1]. In the United States, it is estimated that nearly 50,000 patients&#xD;
      develop central line associated bloodstream infections in the ICUs annually, at a rate of&#xD;
      approximately 5 infections per 1000 catheter days [2] and as many as 15,000 deaths annually.&#xD;
      Central line associated bloodstream infections are also associated with increased hospital&#xD;
      and ICU lengths of stay in the ICU (2). Estimates of the cost of CL-ABI to hospitals range&#xD;
      from $25,000 to $65,000 per patient [3, 4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Centers for Disease Control have published guidelines for the prevention of CL-ABI that&#xD;
      represent a collaborative effort by a multidisciplinary coalition of professional&#xD;
      organizations that provide evidence based recommendations to prevent catheter related&#xD;
      infections [5]. The interventions emphasize five distinct practices, including: education and&#xD;
      training of healthcare providers who place and care for catheters, utilizing maximum sterile&#xD;
      barrier precautions during catheter placement, skin preparation using 2% chlorhexidine,&#xD;
      avoiding routine replacement of central lines as a strategy to reduce infection, and using&#xD;
      antiseptic or antibiotic coated lines in the event that infection rates remain high despite&#xD;
      adherence to the above measures [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have demonstrated impressive reductions in CL-ABI from the application of&#xD;
      these strategies, ranging from 18 to 100% reductions and realizing significant reductions in&#xD;
      mortality and cost [2]. The simple introduction of maximum sterile barrier precautions to&#xD;
      insert central lines has been observed to dramatically reduce infection rates for over a&#xD;
      decade [6]. However, the CDC's guidelines, despite their seeming simplicity, have been found&#xD;
      to be frequently insufficiently applied, whether by ignorance or omission (2) In the past 12&#xD;
      months there have been a total 24 documented central venous catheter (CVC) infections at&#xD;
      SLRHC. At RH the total number of central line days since June 2005 was3,567 with a cumulative&#xD;
      rate of infection of 2.8 per 1000 central line days and at SLH a total of 8,524 central line&#xD;
      days with an infection rate of 4.3 per 1000 central line days. These infection rate figures&#xD;
      are above the benchmark experience. The cost of CVC infections to hospitals in the United&#xD;
      States is estimated to be $45,000 per infection (7). For SLRHC the cost incurred over the&#xD;
      past 12 months is estimated to be $1,080,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training and education of healthcare personnel and the utilization of maximum sterile&#xD;
      precautions are two important areas. Residents still most frequently learn central line&#xD;
      placement techniques by the &quot;see one, do one, teach one&quot; method, which by its very definition&#xD;
      allows for a multitude of techniques in practice. While this teaching theoretically includes&#xD;
      the utilization of maximal sterile precautions for central line placement, the focus of&#xD;
      teaching, and of residents' anxieties, is most often focused on the proper placement of the&#xD;
      line, not the sterile technique used to place it. Residents in non-surgical fields may not be&#xD;
      comfortable with maximum sterile technique in bedside procedures, and surgical residents may&#xD;
      be somewhat blas√© about the need for such detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical simulators allow residents to practice skills in a realistic and interactive&#xD;
      environment that minimizes risk to patients. Studies have found simulation to be an effective&#xD;
      means for teaching skills as diverse as ACLS and airway management to laparoscopic surgical&#xD;
      skills (8, 9, 10). Additionally, the use of audio-visual equipment in a medical simulator to&#xD;
      record a resident's performance gives valuable firsthand feedback that is otherwise not&#xD;
      available, as it allows residents to visualize their own missteps (11). This is hypothesized&#xD;
      to be of particular value in the proper acquisition of physical skills such as maximum&#xD;
      sterile precautions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to examine the utility of a medical simulation environment that replicates an ICU&#xD;
      setting to first assess medical residents' ability to utilize and maintain maximum sterile&#xD;
      precautions in the placement of central venous lines using a standardized scoring tool and&#xD;
      subsequently, assess the impact of videotape training vs. individual simulated debriefing on&#xD;
      performance of correct MBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that medical residents, who have baseline training in the placement of central&#xD;
      venous lines, will show improvement following simulation and viewing of the training&#xD;
      videotape, and that greatest improvement will be seen in the residents who go through a&#xD;
      debriefing simulated method. We hypothesize that PGY 2 and 3 medical residents undergoing&#xD;
      simulation-based training in maximal barrier precaution technique during central venous&#xD;
      catheter (CVC) placement will have good recall after 3 months&#xD;
