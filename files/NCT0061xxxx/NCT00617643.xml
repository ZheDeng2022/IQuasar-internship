      Triomune is the most commonly prescribed treatment for HIV infection in Uganda. Triomune is&#xD;
      manufactured by a generic drug company and consists of three drugs combined in a single pill&#xD;
      given twice daily (stavudine 30mg plus lamivudine 150mg plus nevirapine 200mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that the levels of nevirapine in a patient's blood are highest in the first two&#xD;
      weeks of treatment. Therefore it is recommended that patients starting on nevirapine should&#xD;
      undergo dose escalation i.e start on 200mg once daily for two weeks and then increase to full&#xD;
      dose of 200mg twice daily in order to avoid nevirapine related rash. It is not possible to do&#xD;
      dose escalation with a fixed dose combination pill like Triomune and for the two weeks of the&#xD;
      dose escalation patients either can buy stavudine plus lamivudine plus nevirapine as separate&#xD;
      pills or take Triomune in the morning and then take stavudine plus lamivudine as separate&#xD;
      pills in the evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rifampicin is used to treat TB and lowers the levels of nevirapine in a patient's blood. This&#xD;
      raises two questions in routine clinical practice for patients who are co-infected with HIV&#xD;
      and TB (1) Do we need to put our patients to the trouble of dose escalation of nevirapine if&#xD;
      they are already on rifampicin? and (2) If we dose escalate nevirapine in patients on&#xD;
      rifampicin, are we putting them at risk of low drug levels and development of resistance? The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to compare the plasma concentrations of nevirapine in HIV infected&#xD;
      patients who are commencing antiretroviral therapy with and without a lead in dose of&#xD;
      nevirapine and who are also receiving concomitant treatment with antituberculous therapy&#xD;
      which includes rifampicin to assess whether dose escalation of nevirapine is appropriate in&#xD;
      this patient population&#xD;

      Many patients in Uganda are co-infected with HIV and TB and require simultaneous treatment&#xD;
      for both diseases. There is a paucity of data on the complex pharmacokinetic interactions&#xD;
      between antiretroviral and anti-TB drugs and the available data is not representative of the&#xD;
      African setting, hence it is important that these complex drug interactions be characterized&#xD;
      fully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rifampicin is a potent inducer of several liver and intestinal enzymes responsible for drug&#xD;
      metabolism including the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system, and p-glycoprotein (PgP, a&#xD;
      multi-drug resistant transport protein). The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors&#xD;
      (NNRTIs) such as nevirapine are lipophilic drugs which undergo passive diffusion through the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal lining. Once inside intestinal cells these drugs can be transported back to&#xD;
      the luminal surface by PgP or oxidatively metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. Thus induction of&#xD;
      CYP450 and PgP by rifampicin results in accelerated and more extensive presystemic metabolism&#xD;
      of the NNRTI substrates resulting in decreased oral bioavailability. Available data suggests&#xD;
      that rifampicin reduces the AUC of the NNRTI, nevirapine by 31% and the Cmin by 21% to 68%&#xD;
      (Ribera 2001, Robinson 1998) respectively. While minor reductions in levels of the nucleoside&#xD;
      reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), zidovudine have been reported (probably due to&#xD;
      increased glucuronidation; (Burger 1993), it is generally agreed that the efficacy of the&#xD;
      NRTIs is not affected by concomitant rifampicin use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevirapine, a dipyridodiazepinone, is an inducer of cytochrome P450 and also induces its own&#xD;
      metabolism with a reduction in the elimination half life from 45 to 25 hours on repeat dosing&#xD;
      (Havlir, Murphy). The recommended daily dosing regimen of nevirapine for adults is 200mg&#xD;
      twice daily. This is preceded by a two week lead in dose of 200mg once daily because of the&#xD;
      autoinduction of nevirapine hepatic metabolism. This dose escalation strategy reduced&#xD;
      nevirapine related rash from 48% (in the absence of dose escalation) to 18 %.( Murphy). Dose&#xD;
      escalation of nevirapine is complex in the resource limited setting where fixed dose&#xD;
      combinations of generically manufactured drugs are commonly prescribed. It is unclear as to&#xD;
      whether dose escalation of nevirapine is necessary in patients on rifampicin as they already&#xD;
      have full induction of their cytochrome P450 system provided that they have been on&#xD;
      rifampicin for a minimum of two weeks. Furthermore, there is concern that dose escalation of&#xD;
      nevirapine in this group of patients may expose patients to sub-therapeutic levels of&#xD;
      nevirapine with the attendant risk of development of drug resistance.&#xD;
