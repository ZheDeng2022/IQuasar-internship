      Primary Objective: To determine maximum tolerated dose &amp; dose limiting toxicity of vandetanib&#xD;
      when combined with standard dosing of etoposide among patients with recurrent malignant&#xD;
      glioma who are on &amp; not on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) Secondary&#xD;
      Objectives: To assess safety &amp; tolerability of vandetanib + etoposide in this population; To&#xD;
      evaluate pharmacokinetics of vandetanib among malignant glioma patients on &amp; not on EIAEDs&#xD;
      when combined with etoposide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective: To evaluate for evidence of anti-tumor activity of study regimen among&#xD;
      recurrent malignant glioma patients including radiographic response rate, 6-month progression&#xD;
      free survival (PFS) rate &amp; median PFS.&#xD;

      This is open-label, single center, 2-cohort phase I dose-escalation study of vandetanib&#xD;
      administered orally on continuous daily dosing schedule + oral etoposide among adult patients&#xD;
      with recurrent or relapsing malignant glioma. Patients will be stratified based on whether&#xD;
      they are receiving EIAEDs &amp; each stratum will independently dose escalate. Dose of vandetanib&#xD;
      will be increased in successive cohorts of patients. Etoposide will be given daily at a dose&#xD;
      of 50mg/day for 21 days followed by 7 days with no etoposide. Cohorts of 3-6 subjects will&#xD;
      accrue at each dose level until maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined. Subjects will be&#xD;
      adult patients with histologically confirmed malignant glioma who are presenting at time of&#xD;
      recurrence/relapse. Up to 48 subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size will be based on modified, classical &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation design. Primary safety&#xD;
      &amp; efficacy analysis will be conducted on all subject data at time all subjects who are still&#xD;
      receiving study drug will have completed at least 4 cycles of treatment. Most common adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs) associated with vandetanib are rash, diarrhea, &amp; asymptomatic QTc prolongation.&#xD;
      Protracted oral dosing of etoposide is associated with toxicity that is mild in most patients&#xD;
      &amp; consists mainly of myelosuppression &amp; diarrhea. Less commonly, protracted etoposide dosing&#xD;
      has been associated w more significant hematologic toxicity.&#xD;
