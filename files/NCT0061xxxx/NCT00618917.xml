      This is a Phase I-II study evaluating the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of swallowed&#xD;
      MnSOD plasmid/liposome (PL) transgene given as protection against radiation-induced&#xD;
      esophagitis during concurrent paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy with thoracic radiation&#xD;
      in subjects with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Phase I of the study&#xD;
      will assess the feasibility and safety of MnSOD PL by dose escalation in 3 cohorts of 3&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy subjects each (Cohort1 = 0.3 mg/dose, Cohort2 = 3 mg/dose, Cohort3 = 30&#xD;
      mg/dose). The highest dose completed (as determined by toxicity monitoring for 8 weeks from&#xD;
      initial treatment) will be the starting dose for Phase II. Phase II will examine the efficacy&#xD;
      of MnSOD PL by assessing the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 esophagitis in 27 additional&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy subjects. Incidence of esophageal toxicity, as well as clinical response to&#xD;
      the combination of chemoradiotherapy with MnSOD PL are the outcomes of interest.&#xD;

If one DLT observed, the cohort is expanded to six patients. If two of six patients experienced a DLT, dose escalation stops and the next lowest dose declared maximum tolerated dose (MTD). If none of three or one of six patients experience DLT at the 30-mg tier, that dose is defined as the starting dose for the efficacy phase and the MTD would be undefined).</description>

Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20%increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).
