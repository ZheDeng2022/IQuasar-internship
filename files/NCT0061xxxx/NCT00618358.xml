      Study Objective:To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Vascular Sealant compared&#xD;
      with Gelfoam/Thrombin when used to seal bleeding anastomotic suture lines in patients&#xD;
      undergoing vascular reconstructive surgery requiring placement of a PTFE graft (including&#xD;
      extra-anatomic, infrainguinal bypass and arteriovenous (AV) access procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The study is a multi-center, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      that will compare two methods for treating anastomotic leakage (bleeding). All subjects (n&#xD;
      =151) will be randomized at a 3:1 ratio to receive either the investigational treatment&#xD;
      (Vascular Sealant) or the control treatment (Gelfoam/Thrombin). Up to two (2) treatment sites&#xD;
      may be evaluated for each subject. Subjects will be stratified by type of graft procedure: AV&#xD;
      access graft or extra-anatomic and infra-inguinal graft. A minimum of 60 patients, and a&#xD;
      maximum of 91 patients, will be enrolled in each stratum. Treatment randomization will be&#xD;
      blocked by center and type of graft procedure (e.g., bypass or AV grafts). All subjects will&#xD;
      undergo preoperative screening to determine eligibility and will be evaluated&#xD;
      intraoperatively, at discharge or within 7 days of surgery, and 30 days post-procedure to&#xD;
      monitor for hematologic disturbances, hemorrhagic events, wound complications and other&#xD;
      potential acute post-operative adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to ten (10) investigational sites will participate in the study. Enrollment is expected to&#xD;
      take approximately 8 months for an anticipated duration of the clinical investigation of&#xD;
      approximately 9 to 10 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate non-inferiority of the Vascular Sealant&#xD;
      to Gelfoam/Thrombin when used to seal anastomotic suture lines in patients undergoing&#xD;
      placement of PTFE vascular grafts (including extra-anatomic, infrainguinal bypass and&#xD;
      arteriovenous access procedures).&#xD;
