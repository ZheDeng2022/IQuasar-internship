      Children are at risk of developing an involuntary movement disorder after streptococcal&#xD;
      throat infections. Not all children are affected and the severity is individually variable.&#xD;
      Affected children have alteration in their behaviour and mood and can become quite&#xD;
      compromised in their activities of daily living. The condition is believed to be related to&#xD;
      the body having an over efficient immune response to the infection and some of the antibodies&#xD;
      made in response to the infection also &quot;attack&quot; centres in the brain controlling movement and&#xD;
      mood. Treating these children with immunoglobulins, which &quot;mop up&quot; the antibodies may reverse&#xD;
      or improve affected children. This study hopes to clarify this.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Acute Rheumatic Fever (ARF), chronic rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric/ movement disorders related to group A beta haemolytic streptococcal&#xD;
      infections (GABAS) remain major public health problems in South Africa. RHD may require&#xD;
      repeated hospital admissions, invasive surgery and often results in premature death. In&#xD;
      Africa ARF has a mortality of 2-3%. 1 Likewise, neuropsychiatric disorders such as Sydenham's&#xD;
      Chorea (SC) resulting from GABAS result in school difficulties, frequent absenteeism,&#xD;
      behaviour problems such as obsessive compulsive disorder and may progress to Tourette&#xD;
      Syndrome (personal experience). Patients may suffer from disabling neurologic and psychiatric&#xD;
      symptoms many years after their initial episode of ARF (personal experience). The morbidity&#xD;
      from these conditions demands enormous resources from the state in terms of medical and&#xD;
      surgical treatment and we believe results in preventable stress and suffering to the patient&#xD;
      and his or her family. Whilst the ideal goal is primary prevention a measure of secondary&#xD;
      prevention has been attained by the use of monthly prophylactic penilente. In cases where ARF&#xD;
      has occurred, some further intervention is desirable, to prevent the above complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Rheumatic Fever Clinic (RFC) at Red Cross Hospital patients with established RHD and&#xD;
      old cases of Sydenham's Chorea ( SC) are seen. There are 2-4 new cases of ARF seen per month.&#xD;
      ARF remains a notifiable disease but it appears that these new cases are often not notified.&#xD;
      (personal communication PAWC health officials) SC is a major manifestation of ARF and&#xD;
      following the 1992 update of the modified Jones Criteria, it is sufficient alone to make a&#xD;
      diagnosis of ARF.2 The duration of SC ranges from a few weeks to 2 years. Recurrences occur&#xD;
      in one third of patients.3 Current treatment of SC is purely symptomatic and whether it&#xD;
      resolves in 6 weeks or 2 years is dependent on innate healing mechanisms within the&#xD;
      individual. SC is postulated to be mediated through auto- antibodies that mis-recognise&#xD;
      neuronal cell components. These complexes then result in an inflammatory response in the&#xD;
      basal ganglia with the resultant clinical picture of SC. 3 We hypothesise, that the use of&#xD;
      intravenous immunoglobulins ( IVIG) will decrease the number of circulating antibodies&#xD;
      thereby decreasing symptom severity and shortening the course of the illness. Prophylactic&#xD;
      penicillin must be continued to prevent re-exposure and further formation of antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM We aim to determine whether treatment of SC with IVIG expedites recovery and thus cuts&#xD;
      down on morbidity and frequent follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD Our aim is to collect a minimum of 20 patients with acute SC, diagnosed according to&#xD;
      the revised Jones Criteria for ARF and with an absence of indicators of other causes of&#xD;
      chorea. (Table 1) The study would run for 4 years or until the minimum number are recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients would be identified and the chorea would be rated as mild, moderate or severe and&#xD;
      all signs of chorea carefully documented as per attached format. (A) Special investigations&#xD;
      would be performed (Table 2). Patients with IgA deficiency would be excluded from the study.&#xD;
      Informed consent would be obtained. Patients would be randomly selected to receive IVIG and&#xD;
      or standard treatment. Each patient will be allocated a code number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be admitted to a neurology bed, as usually occurs for the acute management of&#xD;
      moderate and severe SC. Patients will be notified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard pharmacological treatment (Table 3) of haloperidol and or sodium valproate will be&#xD;
      administered, in addition the trial group will receive IVIG. All patients will commence&#xD;
      penicillin prophylaxis. On day two (once the administration of IVIG is complete) the&#xD;
      investigator (KW) and a blinded observer (WM) will examine the patient for signs of chorea as&#xD;
      per addendum A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will remain hospitalised until he or she can cope with activities of daily&#xD;
      living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be reviewed at one month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year and any other time if&#xD;
      necessary, this being consistent with current management. They will be assessed by a blinded&#xD;
      observer (WM) and by the chief investigator(KW). Follow up will be at the RFC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMI penicillin to be given at discharge, 1.2 million units if over 30 KG and 600,000 units if&#xD;
      weight less than 30 KG NB. Improvement of symptoms with IVIG alone, can only be expected&#xD;
      after the third week post treatment.5 The aim of this therapy is to shorten the overall&#xD;
      course of the illness and to prevent complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE We aim to get a minimum of twenty cases, 10 will receive IVIG and 10 standard&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS Aim to get a minimum of 20 new cases. Statistical analysis of the outcome measures&#xD;
      will be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICS / CONSENT In recent years IVIG have been used successfully and safely in a number of&#xD;
      auto-immune conditions. 4 Informed consent will be obtained. Parent consent forms will be&#xD;
      available in English, Afrikaans and Xhosa COSTING Salaries. No contract staff or casual&#xD;
      assistants would be employed. Already salaried staff would look after the patients. Patients&#xD;
      with SC are usually admitted to hospital and all the above treatment is administered except&#xD;
      for the administration of IVIG, the assessment of serum gamma-globulins and brain&#xD;
      spectroscopy scans (single photon emission computed tomographic scanning). The department of&#xD;
      Nuclear Medicine has consented to perform these scans. It has been shown that in hemichorea&#xD;
      hypermetabolism occurs in the contralateral basal ganglion and this disappears with&#xD;
      resolution of symptoms.8 Nursing duties would remain the same as for current admissions of&#xD;
      SC. The only additional nursing duty would be the monitoring of the IV infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registrars and senior house officers will assist in the management of these patients. As&#xD;
      stated earlier ARF is a public health problem in South Africa. It is important therefore that&#xD;
      health professionals are aware of the preventative and curative treatments available for the&#xD;
      treatment of SC.&#xD;
