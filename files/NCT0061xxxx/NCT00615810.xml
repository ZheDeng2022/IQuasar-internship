  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate whether patients switching their backbone from Kivexa to&#xD;
      Truvada, who already have raised total cholesterol prior to switching, have an improvement in&#xD;
      their total cholesterol after 12 weeks of treatment. If an improvement is demonstrated the&#xD;
      study aims to show whether this has a beneficial effect on the patient's overall&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk and long term prognosis.&#xD;

      This protocol is a Phase 4, open label, randomized, UK multi-center, controlled study to&#xD;
      assess the effect on lipid profile of switching from a stable HAART regimen of Kivexa + EFV&#xD;
      to once daily Atripla in adult HIV 1 infected subjects with raised cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Baseline, subjects will be randomized 1:1 to one of two treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group 1: switch to Atripla Treatment Group 2: Continuation of previous stable HAART&#xD;
      regimen of Kivexa + EFV Initiation of treatment with study drugs must take place within 24&#xD;
      hours after Baseline visit. At Week 12, subjects in Treatment Group 2 (continuation of Kivexa&#xD;
      and EFV regimen) will switch to Atripla. Treatment in both groups will continue through Week&#xD;
      24&#xD;
