      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tobacco smoking is one of the most preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the&#xD;
           world, but the addictive property of nicotine is such that fewer than 10 percent of&#xD;
           people who attempt to quit smoking remain tobacco-free after 1 year. Researchers are&#xD;
           studying the addictive properties of nicotine in an attempt to develop more successful&#xD;
           medication therapies for smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nicotine acts on chemical receptors in the brain, including opioid receptors that affect&#xD;
           the perception of pain. Repeated nicotine administration can cause adaptations in the&#xD;
           brain s opioid receptors, which heightens the addictive properties of nicotine and&#xD;
           increases the likelihood and severity of withdrawal symptoms associated with smoking&#xD;
           cessation. Researchers are interested in using positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
           scanning to study brain chemical responses to nicotine in current smokers and&#xD;
           nonsmokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study brain chemical activity related to cigarette smoking and nicotine&#xD;
           administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the brain chemical activity of current daily smokers with that of nonsmokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals 21 to 50 years of age who are either current smokers (10 to 25 cigarettes daily&#xD;
      for at least 2 years) or have had some exposure to tobacco but have never smoked regularly&#xD;
      (may have had a maximum of 20 cigarettes in their lifetime and none in past year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will undergo initial medical and psychological screening and&#xD;
           neuropsychological testing before beginning the main phase of the study. Participants&#xD;
           will be required to abstain from alcohol and drugs (except caffeine, nicotine, and&#xD;
           prescription drugs) for 24 hours before each session, and smokers will refrain from&#xD;
           smoking after midnight on the night before each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Session 1: Participants will answer questions about nicotine craving and withdrawal&#xD;
           symptoms, followed by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to provide baseline&#xD;
           information about brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Session 2 and 3: Participants will answer questions about nicotine craving and&#xD;
           withdrawal symptoms, and then will smoke one cigarette (either active nicotine or&#xD;
           placebo). Researchers will document participants consumption of the cigarette. After the&#xD;
           cigarette is smoked, participants will have a PET scan. Blood samples will be drawn&#xD;
           during the PET session.&#xD;

      Objective: To determine whether nicotine, at the dose delivered through a cigarette (1-2 mg),&#xD;
      will increase the release of endogenous opioids, measured by the displacement of the&#xD;
      mu-opioid PET receptor radioligand [(11)C]carfentanil and to determine whether smokers have&#xD;
      adaptations in the opioid system compared with nonsmokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: 20 current, daily smoikers and 20 never-smokers who have smoked between 1&#xD;
      and 20 cigarettes in their lifetime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: 1) displacement [(11)C]carfentanil binding, secondary to the release of&#xD;
      endorphins by nicotine; 2) upregulation of [(11)C]carfentanil specific binding in smokers&#xD;
      compared with nonsmokers; 3) [(11)C]carfentanil specific binding as a function of the&#xD;
      mu-opioid receptor A118G polymorphism; and 4) correlation between self-report measures of&#xD;
      nicotine effect and [(11)C]carfentanil binding profile.&#xD;
