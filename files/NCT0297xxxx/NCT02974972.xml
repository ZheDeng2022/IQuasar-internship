  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators conducted research among HIV-infected and -uninfected&#xD;
      pregnant and lactating women to understand the potential role and importance of food&#xD;
      insecurity on participant physical and psychosocial health and nutrition.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The central hypothesis of this study was that food and nutrition insecurity are detrimental&#xD;
      to the health of HIV+ pregnant women and their infants via nutritional, disease, and&#xD;
      psychosocial pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first phase, the investigators collected descriptive data to describe and assess food&#xD;
      and nutrition insecurity and the associated modifiable determinants among HIV+ pregnant and&#xD;
      lactating women in Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase, the investigators collected longitudinal cohort data from women who were&#xD;
      recruited during pregnancy and have been followed throughout the infant's first year of life.&#xD;

        A cohort of 371 pregnant HIV-infected and -uninfected women (ratio 1:1) were recruited from&#xD;
        7 rural and urban clinics in Nyanza, Kenya. Participants were followed from ≤30 weeks&#xD;
        pregnancy until 9 months postpartum.&#xD;
