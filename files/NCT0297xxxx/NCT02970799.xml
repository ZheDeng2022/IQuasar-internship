    <textblock>
      This crossover design study evaluates the effectiveness of the Oculeve Intranasal&#xD;
      Neurostimulator comparing the effect of intranasal (active) versus extranasal (control)&#xD;
      stimulation on tear production as measured by the Jones Schirmer test in participants with&#xD;
      dry eye disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized, controlled study, participants will receive two applications of&#xD;
      approximately a three-minute duration, one intranasal (active) and one extranasal (control),&#xD;
      in randomized sequence at Visit 2 (Day 1). At Visits 3 (Day 15) and 4 (Day 29), participants&#xD;
      will undergo two applications of approximately an eight-minute duration, one intranasal&#xD;
      (active) and one extranasal (control), in randomized sequence. The Schirmer test is a&#xD;
      clinically relevant and accepted measure to assess tear production over a specified time&#xD;
      interval, generally five minutes. Tear meniscus height (TMH) and, to a lesser extent, tear&#xD;
      meniscus area (TMA) have been reported as measures of tear quantity and/or production and&#xD;
      have been used to diagnose dry eye disease (DED). One reliable means of measuring TMH and TMA&#xD;
      is via use of optical coherence tomography (OCT), an established medical imaging technique&#xD;
      that uses light to capture micrometer-resolution images from within optical scattering media&#xD;
      such as biological tissue. Due to the non-invasive nature of the technique, this study was&#xD;
      designed to explore the utility of TMH and TMA captured by OCT as a means of evaluating&#xD;
      stimulated tear production following use of the study device.&#xD;
