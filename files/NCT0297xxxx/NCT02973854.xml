  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients seen at the SLUCare Center for Endometriosis (including those with or without pain)&#xD;
      undergoing laser excision surgery for known or suspected endometriosis will be recruited for&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per the PI's standard surgical approach to endometriosis, all areas of abnormal peritoneum&#xD;
      will be excised (removed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgical excision has been performed, in order to provide standardized specimens for&#xD;
      our research, a 3mm punch biopsy will be obtained from the excised peritoneum tissue. The 3&#xD;
      mm biopsy will be sent for research analysis, and the rest of the excised peritoneum tissue&#xD;
      will be sent to histology (SSM) for evaluation and classification as having endometriosis or&#xD;
      not. For each patient in the study, blood will also be collected to look for markers for&#xD;
      endometriosis.&#xD;

      The study is investigator-initiated, prospective, comparative study. Laparoscopic surgery for&#xD;
      endometriosis on patients presenting with pain, infertility or both will be performed by the&#xD;
      principal investigator at St. Mary's Hospital. We will be collecting preoperative, operative&#xD;
      and postoperative follow-up data on all patients recruited for this study based on&#xD;
      comprehensive preoperative questionnaires, which includes data collection on pain scores (by&#xD;
      VAS scales) and standardized QOL scales, and the 6-12 month follow questionnaire. The&#xD;
      surgical approach in the treatment of endometriosis is by excision only, so that all lesions&#xD;
      (abnormal areas of peritoneum) are excised resulting in tissue specimens that are classified&#xD;
      at a histologic level, which is the gold standard way to diagnose the presence of&#xD;
      endometriosis.&#xD;
