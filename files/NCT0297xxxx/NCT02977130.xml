  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The American Diabetes Association indicates that diabetes self-management is a skill that&#xD;
      diabetic patients must learn in the Diabetes Self-Management Education; thus, this&#xD;
      contributes to shared care for diabetes, in which teams of physicians, professional nurses,&#xD;
      and dietitians offer shared care to patients. However, according to the statistical analysis&#xD;
      of the conditions of glycemic control in diabetic patients in 28 countries across 4&#xD;
      continents (Asia, Africa, Europe, and South America), the mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of&#xD;
      the 12,727 patients was 9.5% by Litwak et al. in 2013. In Taiwan, a national survey among&#xD;
      diabetic patients in a shared-care program found that the percentage of patients with HbA1c&#xD;
      lower than 7% increased by 6.5% from 2006 to 2011; yet, among the 720 patients who completed&#xD;
      both surveys in 2006 and 2011, the percentage with HbA1c lower than 7% decreased by 2.1%&#xD;
      during that period. These results suggest that despite the increase in the proportion of&#xD;
      patients who successfully managed their diabetes, some patients still encountered difficulty&#xD;
      in glycemic control.Therefore, numerous health education tools on diabetes continue to be&#xD;
      developed. In 2011,JoAnn et al. determined that the mode of health care had a substantial&#xD;
      influence on the dietary habits of diabetic patients, and that individual health education&#xD;
      had the largest effect on diabetes control. In addition, using the conversation map for&#xD;
      diabetes control also had a substantial influence on improving health behaviors. Among&#xD;
      existing studies that have adopted the conversation map, no large-scale research has been&#xD;
      conducted, the research samples and relevant studies in Taiwan have been scant, and no&#xD;
      theoretical foundation has been applied in evaluating the effects of the conversation map.&#xD;
      Accordingly, the investigators aimed to enhance the mutual experience exchange and learning&#xD;
      among diabetic patients through adopting the conversation map to observe its influence on&#xD;
      their health behaviors by incorporating it into existing health education modalities.&#xD;
      Furthermore, on the basis of the Health Belief Model, a relevant questionnaire was designed&#xD;
      for assessing the effectiveness of glycemic control in diabetic patients.&#xD;
