  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with hormone&#xD;
      receptor positive inflammatory breast cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body,&#xD;
      who are receiving hormone therapy and did not achieve a pathological complete response to&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the disease free survival (DFS) at 2 years of patients with maintenance&#xD;
      therapy using pembrolizumab in combination with standard adjuvant hormonal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the safety and toxicity profile of primary inflammatory breast cancer (IBC)&#xD;
      patients who received combination of pembrolizumab and hormone receptor blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the association between immune related biomarkers in the peripheral blood&#xD;
      and tumor tissue, such as PD-L1 expression, with safety and efficacy for IBC patients treated&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 21 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 24 months.&#xD;
