  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antenatal absent or reversed end-diastolic flow (AREDF) velocity through the umbilical&#xD;
      arteries places preterm infants at significant risk for developing gastrointestinal&#xD;
      complications, such as feeding intolerance, necrotizing enterocolitis or spontaneous&#xD;
      intestinal perforation. Due to the fear of the aforementioned conditions, the establishment&#xD;
      of adequate enteral feeds is frequently hampered in this population. Previous postnatal&#xD;
      Doppler studies have shown that AREDF preterm infants who later developed feeding intolerance&#xD;
      have a decreased blood flow velocity in the superior mesenteric artery in response to the&#xD;
      first enteral feed; to date, however, it is not known whether this hemodynamic impairment&#xD;
      persists over time, or if it is associated with reduced splanchnic oxygenation and perfusion,&#xD;
      monitored by Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational prospective study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess the patterns of abdominal oxygenation and perfusion in response to enteral&#xD;
           feeds in AREDF preterm infants at different phases of enteral feeding establishment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate a possible correlation with the development of gastrointestinal&#xD;
           complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a major cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Severe IUGR is often due to impaired placental circulation, with absent or reversed&#xD;
      end-diastolic flow (AREDF) velocity through the umbilical arteries. Fetuses with AREDF adapt&#xD;
      to chronic hypoxia by undergoing a blood flow redistribution, which favors cerebral perfusion&#xD;
      at the expense of the mesenteric district. The resulting hypoxic-ischemic injury of the&#xD;
      intestinal mucosa represents a major risk factor for the post-natal development of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal complications, such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), spontaneous&#xD;
      intestinal perforation (SIP) and feeding intolerance (FI). Due to the fear of the&#xD;
      aforementioned conditions, the establishment of adequate enteral feeding in AREDF preterm&#xD;
      infants is often difficult; hence, the identification of infants at highest risk for GI&#xD;
      complications could aid their delicate nutritional management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postnatal Doppler studies have shown a decreased blood flow velocity in the superior&#xD;
      mesenteric artery in response to the first enteral feed in AREDF preterm infants who later&#xD;
      developed feeding intolerance. A similar Doppler impairment and lower values of splanchnic&#xD;
      oxygenation at feeding introduction have been described in non-IUGR preterm infants with&#xD;
      later GI complications. To date, however, it is not known whether the impaired mesenteric&#xD;
      blood flow observed after the first feed in high-risk AREDF infants persists over time, or if&#xD;
      it correlates with reduced splanchnic oxygenation and perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational prospective study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess the patterns of abdominal oxygenation and perfusion in response to enteral&#xD;
           feeds in AREDF preterm infants at different phases of enteral feeding establishment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate a possible correlation with the development of gastrointestinal&#xD;
           complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) are consecutively enrolled in the&#xD;
      study if fulfilling the following criteria: gestational age ≤34 weeks, stable clinical&#xD;
      conditions, documented evidence of antenatal umbilical Doppler impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enteral feeding prior to the enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major congenital abnormalities (including congenital heart diseases, gastroschisis,&#xD;
           exomphalos)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemodynamic instability, hypotension, patent ductus arteriosus, anemia, sepsis or other&#xD;
           infections at time of NIRS monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written, informed consent to participate in the study is obtained from the parents/legal&#xD;
      guardians of each infant before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled infants undergo a continuous monitoring of splanchnic oxygenation (SrSO2) at enteral&#xD;
      feeding introduction (15 ml/kg/die volumes administered within the first 48 hours of life)&#xD;
      and full enteral feeding (FEF) achievement (enteral intake ≥150 ml/kg/die) from 30' before to&#xD;
      3 h after feed administration by means of INVOS 5100 oximeter (Somanetics Corporation, Troy,&#xD;
      MI, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A simultaneous monitoring of peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) is be performed in order to&#xD;
      calculate splanchnic fractional oxygen extraction (SFOE) ratio ([SpO2-SrSO2]/SpO2). SrSO2&#xD;
      values recorded during hypoxic episodes (SpO2 &lt;85%) are excluded from statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GI complications are defined as NEC stage ≥2, SIP and/or FI (enteral feeding withholding ≥1&#xD;
      day because of suggestive clinical signs). Enrolled infants are retrospectively divided into&#xD;
      two groups: lack (group 1) vs. development (group 2) of GI complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistic version 20.0.0 (IBM Corporation, IBM Corporation&#xD;
      Armonk, New York, United States). Clinical characteristics in the study groups are compared&#xD;
      by Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical&#xD;
      variables. Mann-Whitney U test is used to compare abdominal SrSO2 and FSOE patterns in&#xD;
      response to feeds between groups 1 and 2.&#xD;
