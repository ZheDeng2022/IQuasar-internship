    <textblock>
      An observational and prospective study involving about 30 healthy lactating mothers whose&#xD;
      preterm infant(s) is/are hospitalized at Neonatal Intensive Care Unit after childbirth and&#xD;
      who can provide enough maternal milk (3mL) to be analyzed from 4th day of admission until&#xD;
      15th day of hospitalization or until discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the lack of evidence related to breast milk nutritional composition from&#xD;
      Brazilian lactating mothers of preterm infants; and also the utilization of human milk&#xD;
      analyzer as a tool to optimize nutritional therapy and reach proper growth and development of&#xD;
      preterm babies, this study aim to evaluate the nutritional composition of human milk from&#xD;
      lactating mothers of preterm infant during the hospitalization, the infant grow and also the&#xD;
      applicability of mid infrared (MIR) human milk analyzer (HMA) as a methodology.&#xD;

      This is an observational and prospective study involving approximately 30 healthy lactating&#xD;
      mothers whose preterm infant(s) is/are hospitalized at Neonatal Intensive Care Unit from the&#xD;
      Hospital Santa Casa de Misericordia after childbirth. Lactating mothers should have enough&#xD;
      milk to provide enough maternal milk their infant(s) require plus additional collection of&#xD;
      samples (3mL). After consenting to the study, milk from lactating mothers of preterm infants&#xD;
      in the local ICU will be analyzed daily from the moment they express sufficient milk volume&#xD;
      beyond their child's requirement until discharge (from 4th day of admission until 15th day of&#xD;
      hospitalization ). Three mL of sample milk will be collected every morning and analyzed,&#xD;
      according to hospital routine. Characteristics of subjects and details of their premature&#xD;
      children, such as gestational age, birth weight (BMI) and birth details (causes of preterm&#xD;
      birth, delivery, complications, etc) will be collected by applying a questionnaire on the&#xD;
      first day of analysis. The nutritional composition of the last meal before the milk sample&#xD;
      collection and also a three no consecutive nutrition questionnaire daily intake will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The determination of the macronutrient content will be made from the use of Human Milk&#xD;
      Analyzer MIRIS (MIRIS HMA), Uppsala, Switzerland, properly calibrated. The analyzer is based&#xD;
      on the adopted infrared (IR) technology in combination with a patented technology. Sample&#xD;
      collection, storage and analysis, as well as equipment conservation, will be carefully&#xD;
      followed according to MIRIS protocol. Information about effectiveness, feasibility and&#xD;
      equipment costs will also be evaluated. The data obtained by the HMA will be compared to the&#xD;
      nutritional composition of human milk and nutritional needs of preterm found in the&#xD;
      literature and included in the main guidelines&#xD;
