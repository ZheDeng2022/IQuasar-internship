      To verify whether X-ray combined with MRI is able to carry out correct fracture&#xD;
      classification and postoperative evaluation in patients with ankle fractures.&#xD;

      History and current related studies Intraarticular fractures and ruptures of ligaments around&#xD;
      the joint often occur after ankle injury. Early correct treatment can effectively help joint&#xD;
      repair, and reduce the incidence of serious complications. Ankle fractures are one of the&#xD;
      common orthopedic fractures. X-ray is a common method for detecting ankle injury, can&#xD;
      determine the fracture site, type and extent. However, X-ray is difficult to display ankle&#xD;
      fracture, bone fragments, displacement, or ligament injury, so it cannot make accurate&#xD;
      fracture classification or formulate treatment programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can clearly show the ankle ligament, tendon, and cartilage&#xD;
      injury, is advantageous in the diagnosis of ligament injury after ankle fracture, and can&#xD;
      provide accurate imaging information. MRI can provide accurate preoperative assessment of&#xD;
      clinical indicators for the rational formulation of treatment programs to reduce&#xD;
      complications. The observation of ankle contusion observed by MRI is conducive to analyzing&#xD;
      the mechanism of ankle joint injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, X-ray combined with MRI would perfectly verify soft tissue injury after ankle&#xD;
      fractures so as to make effective surgical program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events Adverse events including incision pain, incision nonunion, ankle pain,&#xD;
      peripheral nerve injury of ankle joint, ankle joint inflammation, and soft tissue injury.&#xD;
      Severe adverse events are events occurred during clinical trial, including requiring&#xD;
      hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, disability, inability to work, life-threatening,&#xD;
      or fatalities. If severe adverse events occur, investigators would report details, including&#xD;
      the date of occurrence and measures taken to treat the adverse events, to the principle&#xD;
      investigator and the institutional review board within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection, management, analysis and open-access&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Case report forms with demographic data, disease diagnosis, accompanying diseases, drug&#xD;
           allergy history, and adverse events were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data were processed using Epidata software (Epidata Association, Odense, Denmark),&#xD;
           collated, and then recorded electronically. All data regarding this trial were preserved&#xD;
           by the First Hospital, Hebei Medical University, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The electronic database was statistically analyzed by a professional statistician who&#xD;
           created an outcome analysis report that was submitted to the lead researchers.&#xD;
