  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the benefits of an educational program, the Ostomy&#xD;
      Self-Management Training (OSMT) program, for improving patient activation (preparedness to do&#xD;
      self-care), self-efficacy (patients' ability to do self-care), knowledge of ostomy/urostomy&#xD;
      self-care, quality of life, mood, use of medical services, and financial burden in patients&#xD;
      with ostomies. The study will compare patients in the intervention (training) group and&#xD;
      patients in the usual care group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects' participation in this study is expected to last about 7 months. The PI plans to&#xD;
      enroll up to 176 subjects at 3 hospitals (University of Pennsylvania, Yale University School&#xD;
      of Nursing, and City of Hope in Los Angeles). All patient telehealth education will be&#xD;
      coordinated by the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over one million individuals in the U.S. have ostomies. The American Cancer Society estimates&#xD;
      39,610 rectal cancer cases and 74,000 bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2015. Of&#xD;
      these, at least 30,000 will receive ostomies, and an additional unknown number due to&#xD;
      gynecologic, other gastrointestinal tumors. The HRQOL impact is tremendous and greater than&#xD;
      with many other cancer treatments. An ostomy is often a prolonged or lifelong disabling&#xD;
      problem for cancer survivors. The adaptation period is quite variable. 18% of participants&#xD;
      took at least one year, or never felt comfortable, in their ostomy care. Importantly, many&#xD;
      patients cannot attend selfmanagement programs or patient groups for a myriad of reasons,&#xD;
      including distance to travel, monetary outlays, comorbidities making travel difficult, or&#xD;
      lack of access to transportation. In addition, a national shortage of OCNs means patients&#xD;
      with an ostomy, whether newly placed or a long-term issue, receive little help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is imperative to study interventions for these cancer survivors aimed to limit family&#xD;
      financial burdens, decrease medical care use, and improve well-being. This study has the&#xD;
      potential to improve health care outcomes for cancer survivors with ostomies by enhancing&#xD;
      their knowledge of and self-efficacy with ostomy care. This will be accomplished by improving&#xD;
      the ability to communicate an established educational curriculum developed based on patient&#xD;
      needs and desires and refined via a pilot study.&#xD;

    <time_frame>baseline, on completion of session ( 5 weeks) and 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The patient activation measure (PAM) is a 100-point, quantifiable scale determining patient engagement in healthcare. PAM uses a uni-dimensional, probabilistic Guttman-like scale that reflects a developmental model of activation involving four stages (see below). 0 indicates lower activation (worse) whereas 100 indicates higher activation (better)&#xD;
(1) believing the patient role is important, (2) having the confidence and knowledge necessary to take action, (3) actually taking action to maintain and improve one's health, and (4) staying the course even under stress.</description>

    <ipd_description>Our Program Project team supports and promotes the sharing of resources as promoted by PCORI. Progress in medical research in general, and patient-reported outcome cancer research in particular, benefits from enhanced collaboration and sharing of data between productive, collaborative investigators. Based on this concept, our policy is to make the data collected as part of this proposal available to outside investigators based on the following guidelines.&#xD;
Our final research data will be shared with interested colleagues through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at scientific meetings.&#xD;
Any sharing of data with outside investigators must preserve the anonymity of the subjects per HIPAA guidelines.&#xD;
Collaboration with key personnel identified in the proposal is encouraged, but not strictly required.</ipd_description>

    <ipd_access_criteria>• All requests will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator and Co-Investigators named in this proposal who will apply the following principles when deciding whether the data should be shared:&#xD;
The request should be scientifically rigorous.&#xD;
If a collaboration with one or more project investigators is appropriate, such a collaboration should be established.&#xD;
The request should not conflict with ongoing or planned research by the PI or Co-Investigators.&#xD;
The request should not conflict with each institutional requirements. The investigators should agree to acknowledge the contribution in all presentations and publications.</ipd_access_criteria>

PAM uses a uni-dimensional, probabilistic Guttman-like scale that reflects a developmental model of activation involving four stages (see below). 0 indicates lower activation (worse) whereas 100 indicates higher activation (better)&#xD;

The curriculum was delivered via four group sessions by trained ostomy certified nurses and peer/experienced ostomates.

Telehealth real-time videoconferencing was used to enhance program delivery to participants, usually in their homes, in three different geographic areas across two time zones.&#xD;

          <title>Ostomy Self Management Training</title>
          <description>The intervention arm integrates goal setting and problem-solving approaches to enhance buy-in and encourage ability to carry out ostomy self-care. The curriculum was delivered via four group sessions by trained ostomy certified nurses and peer/experienced ostomates. An additional session was offered to support persons to address their needs related to ostomy care. Telehealth real-time videoconferencing was used to enhance program delivery to participants, usually in their homes, in three different geographic areas across two time zones. Self management Training group in which subject will learn using pouches and equipment, skin care, ostomy complications, nutritional needs, Impact on feelings, clothing changes, social relationships, being prepared for emergencies, Intimacy and sexuality, communication skills, tips for travelling and physical activity recommendations</description>
