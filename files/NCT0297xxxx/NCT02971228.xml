  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether the Bionic Pancreas with ZP4207&#xD;
      (dasiglucagon*) was feasible to improve glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *dasiglucagon is the proposed International Nonproprietary Name (pINN) for ZP4207&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single-center, open-label, 2-part, randomized cross-over trial. The trial was to&#xD;
      enrol up to 20 adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and assess the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the Bionic Pancreas (BP) using either the iLet or iPhone platform when used with&#xD;
      the glucagon analogue ZP4207 (dasiglucagon) versus Lilly glucagon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1, patients participated in two 1-day treatment arms in random order (iPhone-based BP&#xD;
      using ZP4207 (dasiglucagon) and iPhone-based BP using Lilly glucagon) according to a&#xD;
      pre-generated randomization scheme. In Part 2, it was planned to enrol additional patients to&#xD;
      participate in two 1-day treatment arms in random order (iLet using ZP4207 (dasiglucagon) and&#xD;
      iLet using Lilly glucagon) according to a pre-generated randomization scheme. However, due to&#xD;
      unavailability of the iLet, the sponsor decided to stop the trial upon completion of Part 1.&#xD;
      Part 2 of the trial using the iLet was consequently not conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One day the BP will use glucagon analogue ZP4207 (dasiglucagon) and the other day the BP will&#xD;
      use Lilly glucagon. Subjects will also receive insulin lispro through the BP on both days.&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted at single center, the Massachusetts General Hospital Diabetes&#xD;
      Center in Boston, MA.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 50 days</time_frame>
    <description>Safety and tolerability of ZP4207 in the BP using either the iPhone or the iLet platform, as measured by adverse events (AEs), local tolerability of infusion site reactions, and clinical laboratory parameters.&#xD;
See adverse events section for results on AEs by system organ class and preferred term. Clinical laboratory parameters in terms of overall 'investigations' AEs and abnormal hematology parameters that did not resolve by the follow-up visit are presented below. LLN = lower limit of the normal range. Investigations and vital signs AEs by preferred term are presented in the AE section.&#xD;
Participants with infusion site pain and nausea measured by visual analog scales (VAS) are presented below; mean values are presented under secondary outcomes. For the VAS, individuals marked on a 10-cm line corresponding to the amount of pain or nausea being experienced, with low scores (cm) indicating no feelings of pain or nausea and high scores (cm) indicating high feelings of pain or nausea.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Measured on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS scale was used to measure pain at the end of the visit (16 hours) for patients in both treatment groups. The VAS was a psychometric response scale used to measure subjective characteristics of pain. Patients marked a location on a 0 to 10-cm line that corresponded to the amount of pain being experienced, with low scores (cm) indicating no feelings of pain and high scores (cm) indicating high feelings of pain. Actual values are shown. The maximum value in the Lilly glucagon group was recorded at hour 3.</description>

        <description>Safety and tolerability of ZP4207 in the BP using either the iPhone or the iLet platform, as measured by adverse events (AEs), local tolerability of infusion site reactions, and clinical laboratory parameters.&#xD;
See adverse events section for results on AEs by system organ class and preferred term. Clinical laboratory parameters in terms of overall 'investigations' AEs and abnormal hematology parameters that did not resolve by the follow-up visit are presented below. LLN = lower limit of the normal range. Investigations and vital signs AEs by preferred term are presented in the AE section.&#xD;
Participants with infusion site pain and nausea measured by visual analog scales (VAS) are presented below; mean values are presented under secondary outcomes. For the VAS, individuals marked on a 10-cm line corresponding to the amount of pain or nausea being experienced, with low scores (cm) indicating no feelings of pain or nausea and high scores (cm) indicating high feelings of pain or nausea.</description>

          <description>Safety and tolerability of ZP4207 in the BP using either the iPhone or the iLet platform, as measured by adverse events (AEs), local tolerability of infusion site reactions, and clinical laboratory parameters.&#xD;
See adverse events section for results on AEs by system organ class and preferred term. Clinical laboratory parameters in terms of overall 'investigations' AEs and abnormal hematology parameters that did not resolve by the follow-up visit are presented below. LLN = lower limit of the normal range. Investigations and vital signs AEs by preferred term are presented in the AE section.&#xD;
Participants with infusion site pain and nausea measured by visual analog scales (VAS) are presented below; mean values are presented under secondary outcomes. For the VAS, individuals marked on a 10-cm line corresponding to the amount of pain or nausea being experienced, with low scores (cm) indicating no feelings of pain or nausea and high scores (cm) indicating high feelings of pain or nausea.</description>
          <population>The full analysis set (intent-to-treat population) consisted of all randomized patients: 10 patients received ZP4207 treatment and 12 patients received Lilly Glucagon treatment in a crossover design. Results are presented by treatment received. Only Part 1 of the trial was conducted.</population>

        <description>The VAS scale was used to measure pain at the end of the visit (16 hours) for patients in both treatment groups. The VAS was a psychometric response scale used to measure subjective characteristics of pain. Patients marked a location on a 0 to 10-cm line that corresponded to the amount of pain being experienced, with low scores (cm) indicating no feelings of pain and high scores (cm) indicating high feelings of pain. Actual values are shown. The maximum value in the Lilly glucagon group was recorded at hour 3.</description>

            <description>In Part 1, 12 patients received treatment with Lilly glucagon in the iPhone-based Bionic Pancreas with insulin lispro according to a pre-generated randomization scheme.&#xD;
Insulin Lispro: Used to lower blood glucose. Commercially available by prescription and is indicated for patients with T1DM, but not for use in a bionic pancreas. Individualized dose based on metabolic needs and frequent monitoring of blood glucose.&#xD;
Glucagon: A hormone normally made by the pancreas to raise blood glucose. Used to treat low blood sugar. Commercially available by prescription and is indicated for patients with T1DM in severe hypoglycemia, but not for use in a BP. Subcutaneous administration in one BP arm.&#xD;

          <title>Nausea Measured on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</title>
          <description>The VAS scale was used to measure nausea at the end of the visit (16 hours) for patients in both treatment groups. The VAS was a psychometric response scale used to measure subjective characteristics of nausea. Patients marked a location on a 0 to 10-cm line that corresponded to the amount of nausea being experienced, with low scores (cm) indicating no feelings of nausea and high scores (cm) indicating high feelings of nausea. Actual values are shown. The maximum values in both groups were recorded at hour 6, the start of the exercise period.</description>
          <population>The full analysis set (intent-to-treat population) consisted of all randomized patients: 10 patients received ZP4207 treatment and 12 patients received Lilly Glucagon treatment in a crossover design. Results are presented by treatment received. Only Part 1 of the trial was conducted.</population>
