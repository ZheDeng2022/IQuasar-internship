      In radiotherapy high-tech scans with x-rays (CT scans) are taken before and during treatment&#xD;
      to locate the tumour and ensure the radiation is hitting the target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These x-rays expose patients to additional radiation and the quality of these scans is often&#xD;
      poor which makes it difficult to distinguish tumour from normal tissue and there may be&#xD;
      uncertainty in the tumour position due to movement or shrinkage. To allow for these&#xD;
      uncertainties a large margin around the tumour is also treated, but this means that large&#xD;
      volumes of normal tissue also receive significant doses of radiation, which can result in&#xD;
      early and late toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is better than CT scanning at being able to tell the&#xD;
      difference between tumour and normal tissues and does not expose patients to additional&#xD;
      radiation. A new machine called an MR Linac (or magnetic resonance imaging-guided linear&#xD;
      accelerator) integrates high quality MRI with a state-of-the-art radiotherapy machine and the&#xD;
      Institute of Cancer Research (ICR)/The Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) are currently&#xD;
      installation a prototype, which will be one of the first in the world. This revolutionary&#xD;
      technology has the potential to change the way radiotherapy is delivered. We hope the&#xD;
      improved precision and accuracy in hitting the target will mean reductions in margins around&#xD;
      tumours and that this will lead to higher cure rates with significantly fewer side effects.&#xD;
      Studies are required to simulate treatment on the MR Linac before it can be used in routine&#xD;
      clinical practice and to conduct these studies, we need to obtain MRI scans on volunteers and&#xD;
      patients who are currently undergoing treatment. This study will involve imaging with MRI in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers as well as in patient volunteers before and during their standard course&#xD;
      of radiotherapy to allow us to develop MRI sequences derived on the MR Linac for MR&#xD;
      Linac-based research focusing on clinical application and establishment into a MR-CT and MR&#xD;
      only workflow, treatment adaptation and quality assurance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study protocol for the acquisition of MR Linac derived images with a view to MRIgRT&#xD;
      for patients undergoing radiotherapy with radical intent at sites predicted to benefit most&#xD;
      from MRIgRT (namely, for rectum, cervix, lung, prostate, bladder, breast, brain, oesophagus,&#xD;
      head and neck, hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) and paediatric abdomino-thoracic cancers).&#xD;
      These will be used to build a database of MR images for MR Linac-based research focusing on&#xD;
      clinical application and establishment into a MR-CT and MR only workflow, treatment&#xD;
      adaptation and quality assurance. The primary aims are to 1) develop MR Linac image sequences&#xD;
      suitable for seeing tumour/target and normal tissue at the time of radiotherapy and 2)&#xD;
      determine variations in image registrations and tissue contouring using the MR Linac images.&#xD;
      Four stages of imaging development sub-studies will be included in this protocol for&#xD;
      optimisation of MR imaging on the MR Linac. Consideration will be given to image quality,&#xD;
      scan times, and IT requirements for reconstruction, storage and image transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These imaging sub-studies will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Non-patient Volunteer Imaging Studies of Normal Tissue (n = 18 - 54 per centre). The four&#xD;
      anatomical regions selected to be studied are Head and neck, Thorax (chest wall/breast and&#xD;
      lung/oesophagus), Abdomen and Pelvis (male and female). Recruitment will continue until&#xD;
      imaging from a minimum of three consecutive patients using the same 'exam card' are deemed to&#xD;
      be acceptable for normal tissue visualisation for each anatomical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Patient Volunteer Imaging Studies of Normal Tissue (n = 39 - 72 per centre). We will&#xD;
      further develop the protocols to visualise site specific tumours in 13 target areas (brain,&#xD;
      oropharynx/larynx/hypopharynx, oesophagus, lung, chest wall _+/- regional lymph nodes),&#xD;
      paediatric abdomen-thoracic cancers, hepatobiliary tract, bladder, gynaecology, prostate,&#xD;
      rectum, oligomets bone and oliogmets soft tissue). Patients will be recruited for imaging for&#xD;
      a minimum of one and maximum of 12 imaging sessions whilst undergoing radiotherapy planning&#xD;
      and/or radiotherapy treatment. Repeat imaging will allow for the determination of protocol&#xD;
      robustness. The aim will be to produce images appropriate for tumour and normal tissue&#xD;
      visualisation with a view to directing radiotherapy. Recruitment will continue until imaging&#xD;
      from a minimum of three consecutive patients using the same 'exam card' are deemed to be&#xD;
      acceptable for tumour/target visualisation at each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Pathway development studies (n = 39 - 208 per centre). At each centre, it is estimated&#xD;
      that 16 imaging sessions per tumour site are required for inter and intra registration&#xD;
      observer variability. To establish library of images to be used to develop adaptive&#xD;
      radiotherapy workflows, up to 50 imaging sessions may be required depending on the tumour&#xD;
      site. Images for normal tissue and tumour visualisation will also be used to refine exam&#xD;
      cards from Stage B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This stage requires a minimum of three patient volunteers to be recruited to each tumour site&#xD;
      which may (or may not) include images acquired in the previous Stage B of the study, and a&#xD;
      maximum of 16 patient volunteers to reach the desired number of imaging sessions. Each&#xD;
      volunteer should undergo a minimum of two and not more than twelve imaging sessions (max&#xD;
      1/day, 3/week). The methodology of image acquisition will follow methodology for Stage B as&#xD;
      above. The primary aim will be to establish that both online and offline image-matching using&#xD;
      MR Linac with a view to guiding radiotherapy treatments can be undertaken with minimal intra&#xD;
      and inter user variability. Development of treatment workflow to help implement radiotherapy&#xD;
      treatment on the MR Linac can also be carried out. Refined exam cards from Stage B but fine&#xD;
      tuning as necessary can be used to acquire sets of images and to use this information to plan&#xD;
      treatment by simulating an on-line treatment whilst not delivering radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D) On-going image development and continuous quality improvement of images&#xD;
&#xD;
      This stage of the study can run in parallel, subsequent to or independently of stages B and&#xD;
      C. The purpose will be to recruit patients receiving radiotherapy, non-radiotherapy cancer&#xD;
      patients or non-patient volunteers in order to optimise MRI guided radiotherapy delivery.&#xD;
      Examples of this include, investigating suitability of radiotherapy immobilisation devices&#xD;
      for patient positioning and treatment set-up development and/or development of new/novel&#xD;
      imaging sequences, optimisation of existing sequences and undertaking continuing image&#xD;
      quality improvement for the tumour sites listed in this protocol. Adult patient with cancers&#xD;
      not conventionally treated using radiotherapy could be recruited in order to investigate&#xD;
      whether radiotherapy could be used as a treatment modality in the future. Patients with&#xD;
      unusual or rare cancer (for example sarcoma, kidney and lymphoma) that do receive&#xD;
      radiotherapy could be recruited to investigate the benefit of using the MR Linac for cancers&#xD;
      of this type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total number of volunteers is, as yet, unknown; however the recruitment progress will be&#xD;
      monitored by the trial management group (TMG). The TMG will ensure that this protocol is&#xD;
      being adhered to, that all volunteers are being imaged safely and that the information gained&#xD;
      from the imaging sessions is being used appropriately. The investigator may recruit between&#xD;
      one and five volunteers (patient, non- radiotherapy patient or non patient). On going&#xD;
      evaluation of technique MRI sequence and/or equipment etc should be carried out to determine&#xD;
      number of required volunteers with a maximum of 5 repeated imaging sessions per volunteer.&#xD;
      The TMG can restrict the maximum number of volunteers and repeated imaging sessions, if&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 150 volunteers will be recruited to this section of the study&#xD;
