      This study is designed to evaluate the feasibility of using digital-enabled education in&#xD;
      clinical care in order to improve patient outcomes related to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).&#xD;
      If effective, educational interventions could be used to improve the long-term survival of&#xD;
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to make clinical care for these patients more&#xD;
      cost effective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that educational interventions in patients nearing end-stage renal disease&#xD;
      (ESRD) can delay the need for dialysis and increase the likelihood of the patient choosing&#xD;
      in-home vs. in-center dialysis. Given the higher cost of in-center hemodialysis compared to&#xD;
      in-home strategies, such as peritoneal dialysis, efforts at increasing use of in-home&#xD;
      dialysis modalities are likely to be cost-effective. Moreover, while few studies of&#xD;
      educational interventions have long-term follow-up, one study suggests that patients exposed&#xD;
      to educational interventions have improved long-term survival once on dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal is to improve clinical and patient-centered outcomes in patients&#xD;
      transitioning from Chronic Kidney Disease Stage (CKD) IV and V to dialysis-requiring ESRD.&#xD;
      The short-term goal of this pilot project is to evaluate the feasibility of delivering&#xD;
      digital-enabled ESRD education to patients with CKD stage IV and V (eGFR&lt;30ml/min/1.73m2, not&#xD;
      yet on dialysis) in clinical care. The investigators will provide this education in the form&#xD;
      of in-person nurse advice, online digital content including videos, and online messaging with&#xD;
      a nurse, moderated patient group and peer mentor. The main objective of the educational&#xD;
      program will be to 1) Increase awareness of options, 2) Prioritize options based on patient&#xD;
      lifestyle and values, 3) Build confidence in modality decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will develop individualized, digitalized educational content (which&#xD;
      includes videos, text and illustration) for patients with CKD that will increase awareness of&#xD;
      ESRD care options including in-home hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and choosing not to&#xD;
      have dialysis. Patients will enroll in a month-long program during which they have access to&#xD;
      the educational app, including lifestyle and modality educational content and online&#xD;
      messaging where they can access a nurse for 1 on 1 discussion, a patient mentor for 1 on 1&#xD;
      discussion, and a patient group for group mentorship exercises. The investigators will pilot&#xD;
      these materials in patients at high risk of progression to dialysis and evaluate the primary&#xD;
      outcomes of whether they were able to complete the program and make a modality choice.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include assessments to determine the intervention's impact on patient&#xD;
      dialysis modality awareness and likelihood of choosing a home-dialysis modality. At the end&#xD;
      of the study, the investigators will provide an insights report to the study participants'&#xD;
      doctors and survey the doctors to ascertain their perspectives on the usefulness of the&#xD;
      educational program for their patients' care.&#xD;
