    <textblock>
      A randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that inhaled therapies for chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have differential effects on the upper airway&#xD;
      microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD is the third leading cause of death worldwide. Exacerbations drive disease progression&#xD;
      and worsening quality of life and therefore prevention of exacerbations has been a major goal&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with COPD are frequently prescribed inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) which have been&#xD;
      shown to reduce exacerbations in combination with long acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists&#xD;
      (LABA). In recent years, all ICS preparations have been associated with a significant&#xD;
      increased risk of pneumonia in either randomised trials or observational studies leading to&#xD;
      warnings from national regulatory authorities and leading experts. This has led to a&#xD;
      re-evaluation of the role of ICS in COPD treatments. It is likely that the risk of pneumonia&#xD;
      is not equal across all ICS doses and molecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a compelling rationale for ICS having a strong effect on the upper airway&#xD;
      microbiome, and that this may be one mechanism of increased pneumonia risk with these drugs.&#xD;
      The existing literature regarding ICS and pneumonia risk are lacking; 1) there are no head to&#xD;
      head trials comparing different ICS preparations and 2) the comparator in these studies to&#xD;
      date have been long acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists alone, whereas the most appropriate&#xD;
      comparator in current management would be combined LABA and long-acting muscarinic antagonist&#xD;
      (LAMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MUSIC TRIAL is a multi-centre randomised open label controlled parallel group study with&#xD;
      four treatment arms and a total of 120 participants. Severe COPD patients currently treated&#xD;
      with inhaled corticosteroid therapy will be randomised to treatment with one of three&#xD;
      preparations of ICS in combination with LABA or the control arm of dual bronchodilator&#xD;
      therapy following a four week washout period. Participants will return monthly to determine&#xD;
      if there are changes in the microbiome in their upper airway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will establish one potential mechanism for the increased susceptibility to&#xD;
      pneumonia in ICS users and assess intraclass differences in ICS molecules and the effect of&#xD;
      ICS dose on the microbiome. Demonstrating that different COPD treatments can have different&#xD;
      effects on the lung microbiome is an important step in understanding clinical differences in&#xD;
      the safety and effectiveness of different treatments for severe COPD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are commonly prescribed for patients with chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD), but their role in the management of COPD is currently being&#xD;
      re-evaluated in light of new evidence and the emergence of alternative treatments. Studies&#xD;
      have shown that the use of ICS and particularly ICS combined with long acting&#xD;
      beta2-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA) in individuals with COPD reduces the frequency of COPD&#xD;
      exacerbations and improves health status and lung function compared to LABA alone or placebo.&#xD;
      The current National Institute for Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for COPD recommend ICS&#xD;
      for patients with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second below 50% predicted, or for patients&#xD;
      with higher lung function who have persisting symptoms or exacerbations despite treatment&#xD;
      with long acting bronchodilators. Data suggests that up to 75% of patients with COPD in the&#xD;
      United Kingdom (UK) are subsequently prescribed ICS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The daily dose of ICS utilised in COPD treatments are much higher than those used in asthma&#xD;
      treatments, with licensed daily doses being 1000 mcg fluticasone propionate (2000 mcg&#xD;
      beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) equivalents) or 800 mcg budesonide (800 mcg BDP&#xD;
      equivalents).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent concerns have been expressed about the safety of ICS in COPD following several&#xD;
      randomised controlled trials of fluticasone propionate and fluticasone furoate, among others,&#xD;
      demonstrating an increase in rates of pneumonia as an adverse event. Several systematic&#xD;
      reviews and observational studies confirm an association between ICS use and risk of&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ICS preparations have been associated with an increased risk of pneumonia in either&#xD;
      randomised trials or observational studies leading to warnings from national regulatory&#xD;
      authorities and leading experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is likely however, that the risk of pneumonia is not equal across all ICS doses and&#xD;
      molecules. Research into this area is greatly limited by the lack of head to head comparisons&#xD;
      between different ICS preparations in COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesised that the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of ICS lead to&#xD;
      increase susceptibility to colonisation of the upper respiratory tract with pathogenic&#xD;
      bacteria associated with pneumonia such as S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. This&#xD;
      study will establish one potential mechanism for the increased susceptibility to pneumonia in&#xD;
      ICS users and assess intraclass differences in ICS molecules used in COPD and the effect of&#xD;
      ICS dose. It is known that changes in the microbiome in COPD are associated with disease&#xD;
      severity and with lung inflammation. Demonstrating that different COPD treatments can have&#xD;
      different effects on the lung microbiome is an important step in understanding clinical&#xD;
      differences in the safety and effectiveness of different treatments for severe COPD. The&#xD;
      longer term clinical objective of this study is therefore to determine whether a proportion&#xD;
      of patients with COPD might be more safely managed with either lower dose, pharmacologically&#xD;
      different ICS preparations or with LABA/LAMA therapies to reduce the risk of pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Fluticasone propionate will facilitate a higher level of bacterial airway&#xD;
      colonisation by pathogens associated with pneumonia compared to budesonide or treatment&#xD;
      exclusively with bronchodilators, therefore providing a mechanistic explanation for increased&#xD;
      pneumonia risk associated with ICS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES To determine a potential mechanism of inhaled corticosteroid associated&#xD;
      pneumonia in COPD by demonstrating ICS effects on the upper (throat and nasal swabs) and&#xD;
      lower airway (sputum) microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the mechanism of observed differences in pneumonia risk between fluticasone&#xD;
      propionate, and budesonide by demonstrating differential effects on the airway microbiome.&#xD;
