      Investigators will use a cluster-randomized design to evaluate the overall impact of the&#xD;
      Alive &amp; Thrive infant and young child feeding communication strategies in Lagos and Kaduna&#xD;
      States, Nigeria. The impact in each state and in a subset of urban local government areas&#xD;
      (LGAs) will also be tested.This is a mixed methods evaluation; the quantitative data will be&#xD;
      complemented by qualitative data obtained from different groups targeted by or involved in&#xD;
      the program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adequate nutrition during the first 1,000 days is necessary for children to grow and develop&#xD;
      to their full potential. Alive &amp; Thrive (A&amp;T) contributes to better nutrition during the&#xD;
      first 1,000 days by promoting improved infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices. A&amp;T&#xD;
      is expanding its efforts to Nigeria and will target Lagos and Kaduna States. In Nigeria, 33%&#xD;
      of infants are breastfed within 1 hour of delivery, 60% are given other fluids in the first 3&#xD;
      days of life, and only 17% of children 0-5.9 months are exclusively breastfed. Approximately&#xD;
      60% of children 6 to 23 months achieve the minimum meal frequency for their age and 19% are&#xD;
      fed four or more food groups per day. To address these gaps in optimal IYCF practices, A&amp;T&#xD;
      will use an implementation framework for IYCF impact at scale that includes advocacy,&#xD;
      interpersonal communication and community mobilization, mass communication, and strategic use&#xD;
      of data. The A&amp;T intervention will be compared to mass media communication on IYCF, which&#xD;
      will be provided throughout the two states. LGAs in Lagos and Kaduna will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated such that two-thirds receive the A&amp;T intervention and one-third are assigned to the&#xD;
      comparison group. The primary objectives of the evaluation are to measure the impact of the&#xD;
      A&amp;T intervention on IYCF practices among mothers with children 0-23 months of age overall, in&#xD;
      each state, and in a subset of urban LGAs. Secondary evaluation objectives are to document:&#xD;
      the type, quantity, and timing of the implementation of A&amp;T program activities; coverage&#xD;
      levels A&amp;T achieves with different program activities; extent to which A&amp;T increases&#xD;
      knowledge and awareness of optimal IYCF practices among women with children 0 to 23 months&#xD;
      and health providers; extent to which A&amp;T improves the capacity of health providers to&#xD;
      counsel mothers on IYCF; and extent to which A&amp;T improves the capacity of stakeholders to&#xD;
      implement community-based activities that support optimal IYCF practices.&#xD;
