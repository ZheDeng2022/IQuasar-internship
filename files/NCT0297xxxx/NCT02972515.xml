      Tobacco use among women now approaches that of men, with approximately 27 million women&#xD;
      smokers in the United States alone. Women report greater difficulties quitting smoking and&#xD;
      are more likely to relapse than men. In addition, tobacco use co-varies with poor dietary&#xD;
      practices and lack of physical activity, with 92% of smokers reporting at least one other&#xD;
      health risk factor. Concerns surrounding weight gain, negative body image, and low&#xD;
      self-efficacy, may be key factors affecting smoking cessation among weight-concerned women&#xD;
      smokers. Guided imagery has been successfully employed in separate lines of inquiry to&#xD;
      address physical activity, diet and smoking cessation. However, guided imagery has not been&#xD;
      employed to target weight concerned women who smoke or to simultaneously target smoking,&#xD;
      diet, and exercise behavior in a single intervention. The proposed study would be the first&#xD;
      of its kind to create a theory-based, guided imagery intervention to assist weight-concerned&#xD;
      women smokers to quit. The use of a mobile app offers an innovative approach to addressing&#xD;
      the multiple behaviors involved in smoking cessation efforts of weight-concerned women, and&#xD;
      has the potential to reach large numbers of women smokers. The project aims to develop and&#xD;
      test the feasibility of a mobile health application using guided imagery in order to increase&#xD;
      smoking cessation among a population of weight-concerned women smokers.&#xD;

      SPECIFIC AIMS Tobacco use among women now approaches that of men, with approximately 27&#xD;
      million women smokers in the United States alone. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer&#xD;
      death among women, and more than 180,000 women die of other illnesses linked to smoking&#xD;
      annually. Women report greater difficulties quitting smoking and are more likely to relapse&#xD;
      than men. In addition, tobacco use co-varies with poor dietary practices and lack of physical&#xD;
      activity, with 92% of smokers reporting at least one other health risk factor. The presence&#xD;
      of multiple behavioral risk factors greatly increases the risk of developing many acute and&#xD;
      chronic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerns about weight gain, negative body image, and lack of self-efficacy may be key factors&#xD;
      affecting smoking, diet, and exercise behavior of women. Women smokers are less satisfied&#xD;
      with their bodies, have lower self-esteem, and are more concerned about becoming overweight&#xD;
      than non-smokers. Approximately 50% of women smokers report that concerns about body weight&#xD;
      are reasons they do not quit. Research indicates that women report lower self-efficacy in&#xD;
      quitting than men, especially women concerned about controlling their weight. These findings&#xD;
      suggest that targeting weight concerns, body image, and self-efficacy to quit with&#xD;
      weight-concerned women who smoke may be an effective intervention strategy. Recent studies&#xD;
      suggest that a multi-behavioral approach, including diet and physical activity, may be more&#xD;
      effective at helping weight-concerned smokers to quit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One cognitive approach, guided imagery, has been successfully employed in separate lines of&#xD;
      inquiry to address body image concerns and self-efficacy in our three target&#xD;
      behaviors-exercise, diet and smoking cessation. However, guided imagery has not been employed&#xD;
      to target weight concerned women who smoke or to simultaneously target smoking, diet, and&#xD;
      exercise behavior in a single intervention. The proposed study would be the first of its kind&#xD;
      to create a theory-based, guided imagery intervention to assist weight-concerned women&#xD;
      smokers to quit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While imagery is an effective therapeutic tool for behavior change, the mode of delivery has&#xD;
      generally been in-person, limiting the dissemination of guided imagery-based interventions to&#xD;
      large populations. Mobile health applications (mobile apps) delivered via smart phones offer&#xD;
      a unique channel through which to distribute imagery-based interventions. Mobile apps may&#xD;
      enhance the use of guided imagery through the use of audio files. The app may allow guided&#xD;
      imagery scripts to be tailored by the user, and flexibly administered at varying times (e.g.,&#xD;
      during nicotine cravings). This approach could be especially useful for women, who are more&#xD;
      likely than men to use the Internet to obtain health information. The use of a mobile app&#xD;
      offers an innovative approach to addressing the multiple behaviors involved in smoking&#xD;
      cessation efforts of weight-concerned women, and has the potential to reach large numbers of&#xD;
      women smokers. If successful, a mobile application for guided imagery could be used to&#xD;
      address other health behaviors as well. The present project aims to develop and test the&#xD;
      feasibility of a mobile health application using guided imagery in order to increase smoking&#xD;
      cessation among weight-concerned women smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Specific Aims for this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Develop guided imagery content, user interface, and resources to reduce weight&#xD;
      concern, and increase body image and self-efficacy for behavior change among weight-concerned&#xD;
      women smokers. Scripts incorporating imagery across these domains will be developed&#xD;
      specifically for smoking cessation, eating a healthy diet and engaging in physical activity.&#xD;
      The investigators will develop initial content and user interface ideas based on experience&#xD;
      in using guided imagery for increasing physical activity, and using technology to assist&#xD;
      tobacco cessation and healthy eating. Ten focus group participants (weight-concerned women&#xD;
      smokers who own a smart phone, representing various racial/ethnic groups) will provide&#xD;
      feedback on content, potential tailoring of content by race/ethnicity, functions, and design,&#xD;
      which will inform development of the mobile app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Program a prototype of the app that contains all the necessary elements of text,&#xD;
      graphics, multimedia and interactive features. Users will be able to customize certain&#xD;
      elements of the application, and be required to provide input in response to app prompts. The&#xD;
      investigators will conduct usability testing, observing 10 participants using &quot;think aloud&quot;&#xD;
      procedures as they interact with the app, to ensure that it is fully functional and easy to&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the app with 50&#xD;
      weight-concerned women smokers. The primary outcome will be self-reported tobacco abstinence&#xD;
      at 3 months post-enrollment. The investigators will also measure: dietary intake; level of&#xD;
      physical activity; body image; self-efficacy; cravings; and participants' use of the app,&#xD;
      including the imagery scripts, diary, and resource links.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential impact of this proposed intervention is great, because it addresses behavioral&#xD;
      risk factors that can be applied to populations beyond smokers. This proposal is significant&#xD;
      because it intervenes with women smokers; innovative, in that it uses guided imagery to&#xD;
      change lifestyle behaviors important for the prevention of chronic diseases, and, technology&#xD;
      to maximize dissemination potential. The proposed investigation takes a theory-based&#xD;
      approach, builds on the considerable track records of the investigators, and will be&#xD;
      conducted in an environment highly suited for this study. Results of this study will be used&#xD;
      to prepare for a future randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of a multi-behavioral, guided imagery mobile health application versus a&#xD;
      single smoking cessation imagery mobile health application.&#xD;
