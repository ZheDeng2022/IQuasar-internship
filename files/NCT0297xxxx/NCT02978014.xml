      A two-arm randomised controlled trial in patients receiving post-prostatectomy radiotherapy&#xD;
      in the adjuvant or salvage setting, with patients randomised to receive daily ProSpare&#xD;
      (obturator) guided IMRT or Centre standard (non-obturator) guided IMRT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Surgery to remove the prostate gland is one of the ways of treating prostate cancer. Some&#xD;
      patients receive radiotherapy after surgery if the cancer may not have been completely&#xD;
      removed. Radiotherapy to the area where the prostate was can cause side effects, which can&#xD;
      cause bowel and bladder symptoms as well as reducing sexual function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy alone is also a standard treatment for prostate cancer. At the Royal Marsden&#xD;
      Hospital and Institute of Cancer Research the investigators have designed and patented a&#xD;
      device called ProSpare to improve the accuracy of radiotherapy. The device has already been&#xD;
      developed and tested in over 80 patients having prostate radiotherapy and was well tolerated.&#xD;
      Treatment accuracy was improved and the radiation dose to the rectum was reduced. Patients&#xD;
      have given very valuable feedback and comments about ProSpare's design and use, which the&#xD;
      investigators have incorporated in the final design. It is now important to test ProSpare in&#xD;
      a multi-centre randomised controlled trial. The investigators aim to determine whether&#xD;
      ProSpare will reduce the side effects reported by patients having radiotherapy after&#xD;
      prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ProSpare device is inserted by the patient into the rectum for each daily radiotherapy&#xD;
      treatment. The disposable device stays in place for about 15 minutes each day. The curve in&#xD;
      the device is designed to follow the shape of the rectum and it stays in the correct place by&#xD;
      securely locating in the anal sphincter. ProSpare contains small &quot;markers&quot; - steel ball&#xD;
      bearings - which can be &quot;seen&quot; on the standard scans taken before a radiotherapy treatment.&#xD;
      Treatment is adjusted before each daily treatment to account for patient movement and&#xD;
      radiotherapy set-up variation. As a result, treatment is more accurate than using the&#xD;
      standard methods of radiotherapy localisation. This means the radiotherapy &quot;safety margins&quot;&#xD;
      which are placed around the prostate bed can be reduced. The dose to the rectum and bladder&#xD;
      as well as the structures that are associated with erectile function will be reduced. This&#xD;
      may lead to an improvement in the side effects caused by radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other ways to identify the treatment target area for such image guided radiotherapy (IGRT)&#xD;
      includes the insertion of fiducial markers - usually in the form of gold seeds into the&#xD;
      prostate or prostate bed. This has become standard practice in some radiotherapy centres for&#xD;
      prostate radiotherapy but is technically complex for prostate bed radiotherapy and not&#xD;
      routinely used. ProSpare has the additional advantage of being non-invasive and without the&#xD;
      risk of infection associated with fiducial insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly selected to either have standard treatment or use ProSpare daily&#xD;
      with adjusted set-up margins. During and after treatment, patients will be asked questions&#xD;
      and given questionnaires to complete, asking about bowel, urinary and sexual function. The&#xD;
      investigators will look at the results in each group and see if treatment with ProSpare has a&#xD;
      benefit in improving the side effects from radiotherapy. If a benefit is seen, the aim will&#xD;
      be for ProSpare guided radiotherapy to become part of the standard treatment for prostate bed&#xD;
      radiotherapy nationally and internationally.&#xD;
