  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The over-65 population is not only increasing at an alarming rate, but because six out of 10&#xD;
      will be managing more than one chronic condition by 2030, they will make up a much greater&#xD;
      proportion of hospitalizations than ever before. Hospitalizations for disease, injury, and/or&#xD;
      surgery in this group are likely to impair physical mobility and, therefore, the older adults&#xD;
      capacity to be physically active both during hospitalization and beyond. The resulting&#xD;
      sedentary lifestyle is likely to be accepted as the &quot;new normal&quot;, ultimately increasing the&#xD;
      risk of skeletal muscle and metabolic dysfunction (e.g. impaired glucose disposal, insulin&#xD;
      resistance). These devastating outcomes are neither inevitable nor necessary if prevented&#xD;
      with an appropriate mechanism-based intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel mechanism that may contribute to physical inactivity-induced insulin resistance is&#xD;
      accumulation of inflammation and ceramide within skeletal muscle. Of interest, increased&#xD;
      skeletal muscle inflammation and ceramide has been tied to various metabolic disturbances&#xD;
      such as diabetes and insulin resistance. However, it is currently unknown if skeletal muscle&#xD;
      inflammation and ceramide are a key mechanism associated with insulin resistance due to&#xD;
      physical inactivity in older adults.&#xD;

      The investigator team will recruit younger and older (N=30; 18-35y and 60-85 yrs) male and&#xD;
      female adults recruited in the Salt Lake City area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator team will then schedule separate visits for Strength, Power and Physical&#xD;
      Function and the separate visits for Lean Mass and OGTT measurements (see description below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Lean Mass, oral glucose tolerance test , Strength, Power, Exercise Testing and Physical&#xD;
           Function Measurements. Lean mass assessment via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA),&#xD;
           ultra sound and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) will be assessed in&#xD;
           the center for clinical and translational sciences (CCTS) while knee extensor isometric&#xD;
           strength, power and physical function testing will be conducted in the Skeletal muscle&#xD;
           exercise research facility (SMERF) laboratory (520 Wakara Way). These endpoints will be&#xD;
           considered secondary objectives to determine relationships with insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
           muscle cell signaling events. These tests will occur within one week before the reduced&#xD;
           activity experiment and will be repeated after completing the reduced activity period&#xD;
           and after exercise training. For lean mass assessment, subjects will be tested in the&#xD;
           morning after an overnight fast prior to the DXA scan. Isometric strength will be&#xD;
           assessed in both legs with a maximal voluntary isometric contraction effort (at a 600&#xD;
           knee angle) developed by the knee extensors (quadriceps) and plantar/dorsi flexor&#xD;
           muscles on a dynamometer. For lower extremity extension power testing a Nottingham power&#xD;
           rig will be used. The following battery of functional performance tests will be used:&#xD;
           Stair ascent/descent time, six-minute walk distance, 50 foot walk time, and the timed up&#xD;
           and go test. All tests are tests that we frequently and safely perform in older&#xD;
           individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Maximal oxygen consumption (exercise testing) will be measured by a metabolic cart&#xD;
           during a graded maximal exercise test on a stationary cycle ergometer. This test will be&#xD;
           performed in the CCTS under direct supervision of an exercise physiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physical Activity Monitoring, Dietary Record. Subjects will be fitted with an ankle Step&#xD;
           Activity Monitor in order to determine their daily level of physical activity over 7&#xD;
           days period preceding the reduced physical activity study. Additionally, a 3-day daily&#xD;
           dietary record will be self-reported before this period. The participant will be&#xD;
           properly instructed by a research team member on how to conduct this reporting and how&#xD;
           to wear the ankle activity monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Insulin Clamp Study, Metabolic Rate and Muscle Biopsies. On a separate day, participants&#xD;
           will arrive at the CCTS fasted in the morning on Day 1 and a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic&#xD;
           clamp study will be performed as we have done previously. The research team physician&#xD;
           will oversee the clamp procedure as he is very experienced using this method.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Metabolic rate will be determined 30 minutes before the initiation of the insulin&#xD;
           infusion and 30 minutes at the end of the insulin infusion period. Metabolic rate will&#xD;
           be determined using a indirect calorimeter housed at the CCTS. To do so, the participant&#xD;
           will be fitted with a canopy hood. The participant with breathe normally for 30 minutes&#xD;
           during the procedure. The canopy will be removed then the first muscle biopsy will&#xD;
           occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A vastus lateralis muscle biopsy will be sampled before and 3h after the clamp combined&#xD;
           with periodic blood sampling for measure of fasting and insulin-stimulated insulin,&#xD;
           glucose, muscle cell signaling endpoints, and specific ceramide species. Biopsies will&#xD;
           occur on opposite legs. Muscle biopsies were be performed by trained CCTS nurses as we&#xD;
           have done routinely in our bed rest studies in older adults. Muscle samples will then be&#xD;
           flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored for later analysis. After the clamp&#xD;
           experiment, subjects will begin the reduced physical inactivity study which will take&#xD;
           place at the participant home.&#xD;
&#xD;
           On Day 14, the participant again will return to the CCTS following an overnight fast and&#xD;
           the insulin clamp study will be repeated in order to make comparisons to the pre insulin&#xD;
           clamp study (Day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Reduced Physical inactivity experiment. After completion of the first insulin clamp&#xD;
           experiment (Day 1), subjects will adhere to 14-days of reduced physical activity at&#xD;
           their home as has been conduced before. The goal will be for the participant to maintain&#xD;
           no more than ~2000 steps/day as determined by a monitor that the subject will be able to&#xD;
           see and record. The investigators will inform the participant that their normal diet&#xD;
           should remain the same. As mentioned above, on day 7, the participant will return for a&#xD;
           DXA scan, OGTT's and thigh muscle biopsies. Also mentioned above, on Day 14, after an&#xD;
           overnight fast, a second insulin clamp study coupled with muscle biopsies will be&#xD;
           conducted as detailed above in the CCTS. Lean mass, strength, power, and physical&#xD;
           function measurements will be re-assessed on a later day following the reduced activity&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
