  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart attacks and strokes are common causes of death worldwide. These events occur in part,&#xD;
      due to increased activity of platelets, which cause clotting (thrombosis) within heart and&#xD;
      brain blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-platelet therapies (e.g. aspirin) reduce the likelihood of platelet thrombosis and&#xD;
      therefore protect against heart attacks and strokes. However serious bleeding into the gut&#xD;
      and brain occurs in a number of individuals prescribed aspirin. Currently, there is no&#xD;
      reliable method for assessing the relative risks of thrombosis versus bleeding in individual&#xD;
      patients prior to or during aspirin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have recently discovered that individuals with a particular genetic make-up, those with&#xD;
      genetic variants in two genes called PPARGC1β and CNTN4, demonstrate more active (sticky)&#xD;
      platelets. We then found that these same individuals suffered a greater number of&#xD;
      cardiovascular events. Interestingly, low dose aspirin suppressed the excessive platelet&#xD;
      stickiness and protected against heart attacks and strokes in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, we aim to confirm and extend the above findings. We hope that testing for&#xD;
      PPARGC1β and CNTN4 genetic variants will allow us to identify which patients will benefit&#xD;
      from low dose aspirin therapy - i.e. receive protection from heart attacks and strokes, but&#xD;
      not suffer any bleeding complications.&#xD;

             the requirements of this study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be at intermediate to high cardiovascular risk as determined by a&#xD;
             calculated 5 year CVD risk of 5% or greater (calculated using the 1991 Anderson&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have any other significant disease or disorder (including concurrent&#xD;
             malignancy) which, in the opinion of the investigator, may either put the subject at&#xD;
