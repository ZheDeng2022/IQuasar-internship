      The purpose of this European, multicentric, prospective, non-interventional study is to&#xD;
      document and evaluate the efficacy and safety of the treatment of severely infected patients&#xD;
      with intravenously administered fosfomycin, including patients with osteomyelitis,&#xD;
      complicated urinary tract infection, nosocomial lower respiratory tract infection, bacterial&#xD;
      meningitis/central nervous system infection, bacteraemia/sepsis, skin and soft tissue&#xD;
      infection, endocarditis or other infections, each as far as covered by the respective&#xD;
      nationally relevant SmPC.&#xD;
