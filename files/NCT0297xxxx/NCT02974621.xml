  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well cediranib maleate and olaparib work compared&#xD;
      to bevacizumab in treating patients with glioblastoma that has come back (recurrent).&#xD;
      Cediranib maleate and olaparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      bevacizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the antitumor activity of cediranib maleate (cediranib)/olaparib versus&#xD;
      reference bevacizumab monotherapy, as measured by progression-free survival at 6 months&#xD;
      (PF6), in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS) and objective response&#xD;
      (ORR) in patients with recurrent GBM treated with cediranib/olaparib versus bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the safety of the combination of olaparib and cediranib in patients with&#xD;
      recurrent GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the association of blood based biomarkers involved with angiogenesis using&#xD;
      the Biomarker Review Committee-approved Plasma Angiome Panel (bFGF, Ang-1, Ang-2, Tie-2,&#xD;
      SDF1-alpha, Collagen IV, PlGF, sVEGFR1, sVEGFR2, VEGF, Il-1beta, Il-6, Il-8, TNF-alpha, CAIX)&#xD;
      with the clinical activity of cediranib/olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the association of tissue biomarkers involved with deoxyribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (DNA) repair using the Biomarker Review Committee-approved BROCA panel with the clinical&#xD;
      activity of cediranib/olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To identify genomic alteration by whole exome sequencing in GBM tumor specimens that&#xD;
      correlate with the clinical activity of cediranib/olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate the association of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging parameters (tumor&#xD;
      perfusion and oxygenation, brain tumor cellularity) with the biological response of&#xD;
      cediranib/olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To contribute genetic analysis data from de-identified biospecimens to Genomic Data&#xD;
      Commons (GDC), a well annotated cancer molecular and clinical data repository, for current&#xD;
      and future research; specimens will be annotated with key clinical data, including&#xD;
      presentation, diagnosis, staging, summary treatment, and if possible, outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To bank formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, blood (for cell-free DNA&#xD;
      analysis), and nucleic acids obtained from patients at the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical&#xD;
      Trials Network (ETCTN) Biorepository at Nationwide Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and cediranib maleate PO once&#xD;
      daily (QD) on days 1-28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then&#xD;
      periodically for 3 years.&#xD;
