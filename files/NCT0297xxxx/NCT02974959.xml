      The purpose of this single-center, prospective, randomized (1:1), double-blind,&#xD;
      sham-controlled parallel-arm pilot study is to provide initial evidence of use of the&#xD;
      noninvasive vagus nerve stimulator for treatment in patients recovering from concussion and&#xD;
      moderate traumatic brain injury to improve clinical recovery. The study compares the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an active gammaCore treatment against a sham treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our primary aim is to assess for evidence of the effectiveness of the nVNS in reducing&#xD;
      clinical symptoms such as motor and cognition deficits. As a primary endpoint, we will&#xD;
      analyze the difference between groups at all time points in standardized cognitive&#xD;
      assessments. We will also assess the levels of different inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints for moderate TBI are functional assessments and quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaires including a depression screen. Our secondary aim is to assess the safety of a&#xD;
      non-invasive VNS (nVNS) in a subset of patients who have suffered a moderate TBI. We do not&#xD;
      anticipate any significant difference between heart rate variability (HRV) in active compared&#xD;
      to sham treatments and no difference symptoms experienced during treatment sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a single-center, prospective, randomized (1:1), double-blind, sham-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel-arm pilot study. We determined that an N of 30 patients would be needed to reach&#xD;
      significance. Moderate TBI will be defined by the Head Injury Interdisciplinary Special&#xD;
      Interest Group of the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (full list in inclusion&#xD;
      criteria) seeking care at HCMC within 2 weeks of injury. Recruited subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to active treatment or sham-treatment control arms. Randomization to active or&#xD;
      sham gammaCore treatment will occur during the screening visit after enrollment, and&#xD;
      intervention will begin at the baseline visit that occurs 72 hours (+/- 1 day) after&#xD;
      enrollment. Informed consent will be obtained from patients or their proxy prior to&#xD;
      enrollment. If a proxy elects to enroll a patient, who then recovers during the course of the&#xD;
      study, they will be able to withdraw from the study if they so desire. We anticipate&#xD;
      enrollment to take approximately 6 months, and enrolled subjects will be followed through the&#xD;
      final week 18 follow up visit, estimating a completion date 9 months after the first&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will include 12 weeks of active interventional therapy, with seven visits,&#xD;
      including the screening visit that takes place within 2 weeks of injury. From the baseline&#xD;
      visit, there will be a follow up phone call at 1 week, and a follow up visit at 2, 6, 12 and&#xD;
      18 weeks. During each of these visits, data assessing heart rate variability will be obtained&#xD;
      using a chest strap heart rate monitor and a non-invasive heart rate variability monitor will&#xD;
      be used to measure minute phenomenon in heartbeats. This will be done while supine, during&#xD;
      treatment and after an orthostatic challenge (i.e. standing or sitting upright). An EKG will&#xD;
      be obtained at each visit to assess for bradycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nVNS therapy will be performed using the gammaCore-R (electroCore LLC, NJ), which is an&#xD;
      external hand-held vagal nerve stimulator. The gammaCore-R produces a low voltage electric&#xD;
      signal consisting of five 5000 Hz pulses that are repeated at a rate of 25 Hz. The strength&#xD;
      of the stimulation is lower than that required to activate efferent vagal nerve fibers that&#xD;
      mediates cardiac specific effects and will only be used on the left vagus nerve, which has&#xD;
      fewer cardiac projections. It allows for a 120 second stimulation session. The stimulation&#xD;
      will occur twice daily, one time in the morning and one time in the evening. This should be&#xD;
      done as close to 12 hours apart as possible and should occur twice daily for the entire 12&#xD;
      week study period. The sham device appears identical to the gammaCore but does not provide a&#xD;
      frequency of stimulation powerful enough to stimulate either efferent or afferent fibers of&#xD;
      the vagus nerve. However, it does supply a low frequency current which will cause a tingling&#xD;
      of this skin to improve blinding of the patients. After the 12 week visit, the device will be&#xD;
      returned. However, both the treating physician and the patient will remain blinded to the&#xD;
      study arms until the completion of the study at week 18. Blood samples (10 mL or two&#xD;
      teaspoons) will be drawn at the screening visit, as well as the 12 and 18-week time points&#xD;
      for biomarker analysis.&#xD;
