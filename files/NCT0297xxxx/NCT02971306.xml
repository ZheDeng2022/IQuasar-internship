  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcoholic hepatitis is related to very high mortality rate. About 40% of the patients are&#xD;
      died within first 6 months after the detection of the clinical syndrome. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      very essential for proper diagnosis and early treatment. In response to acute or chronic&#xD;
      liver damage, bone marrow derived stem cells can spontaneously populate liver and&#xD;
      differentiate into hepatic cells. Animal and human studies suggested that injured hepatocyte&#xD;
      may be replaced by pluripotent bone marrow cells. However, this hepatocyte repopulation is&#xD;
      highly dependent on varieties of liver injury and therapeutic conditions6. The studies has&#xD;
      suggested Granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSF) can regenerate hepatocyte by fusing&#xD;
      with hematopoietic cells, thereby enhancing the liver histology and survival rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G-CSF is a cytokine capable to regulate a number of functions in neutrophils. In three recent&#xD;
      studies mobilization of bone marrow stem cells induced by G-CSF was observed in patients with&#xD;
      alcoholic hepatitis. In two of this studies there was a survival benefit with the use of&#xD;
      G-CSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alcoholism leads to decrease in endogenous antioxidant potential. Alcoholic liver disease&#xD;
      (ALD) patients show low endogenous antioxidants. Chronic ethanol consumption cause selective&#xD;
      deficiency in the availability of reduced glutathione (GSH) in mitochondria has been&#xD;
      reported. This is due to impaired functioning of GSH transporter from cytosol to&#xD;
      mitochondrial matrix. The effect on glutathione replenishing potential by N-acetyl cysteine&#xD;
      (NAC) can be used to reduce oxidative stress, which also has excellent safety profile.&#xD;
      Therefore, NAC can be used for severe alcoholic hepatitis treatment due to its therapeutic&#xD;
      potential factor. NAC also inhibit apoptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. In a&#xD;
      study high doses of intravenous N-acetyl cysteine therapy for 14 days conferred neither&#xD;
      survival benefits nor early biological improvement in severe alcoholic hepatitis patients&#xD;
      with adequate nutritional support.However, these results must be viewed with caution, since&#xD;
      the study suffered from a lack of power. In a recent study, NAC and corticosteroids&#xD;
      combination therapy benefits among patients with severe acute alcoholic hepatitis in 1 month&#xD;
      survival, although the final outcome at 6 month survival was not improved. There are no&#xD;
      studies on the use of combination therapy of NAC plus G-CSF in patient with severe alcoholic&#xD;
      hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore we plan to study the safety and efficacy of combination therapy of G-CSF and NAC in&#xD;
      the patients with alcoholic hepatitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, admitted to Department of Hepatology PGIMER,&#xD;
      Chandigarh from July 2014 to December 2016 will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an open label trial. A randomization code is generated by random number table.&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized to receive standard medical therapy of pentoxifylline only as&#xD;
      control and combination therapy of Pentoxifylline with NAC and G-CSF as cases. There will be&#xD;
      one control and two cases as below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Pentoxifylline (control) 2) Pentoxifylline+G-CSF (case 1) 3) Pentoxifylline+G-CSF +NAC&#xD;
      (case2) A) Pentoxifylline 400 mg thrice daily for 28 days A) Pentoxifylline 400 mg thrice&#xD;
      daily for 28 days plus G-CSF 5 mcg/kg every 12 hourly for consecutive 5 days A)&#xD;
      Pentoxifylline 400 mg thrice daily for 28 days plus G-CSF 5 mcg/kg every 12 hourly for 5 days&#xD;
      plus NAC 300 mg/kg on day 1 (150 mg/kg in 250 ml of 5% dextrose over a minute of 30&#xD;
      minutes,50 mg/kg in 500ml 5% dextrose over a period of 4 hours, 100mg /kg in 1000 ml of 5%&#xD;
      dextrose over a period of 16 hours ) and on day 2 through 5 100mg /kg/day in 1000ml of&#xD;
      glucose solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single time therapy. Patients will be admitted in the department of hepatology&#xD;
      and will be assessed everyday clinically as well as by laboratory tests during therapy to&#xD;
      assess safety and effects of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Total leukocytes count will be assessed daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Circulating CD 34 positive cells will be measured on day 0 and 6 of G-CSF therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In addition, ultrasonography will be performed at day 1 and 6 in order to evaluate&#xD;
           difference in spleen size and portal vein flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Biochemical, coagulation, and hematological parameters (Liver function tests, Renal&#xD;
           Function Tests, Prothrombin Time, International Normalised Ratio, etc.) will be&#xD;
           monitored periodically, daily for 1 week, then weekly for 1month and monthly for three&#xD;
           month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed at weekly interval for 1 month and then monthly for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival at 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobilisation of CD34 positive cells in peripheral blood. Clinical/biochemical improvement in&#xD;
      liver function profile. Improvement in prognostic scores-Maddrey's Discriminant function,&#xD;
      MELD score, and Child score.&#xD;
