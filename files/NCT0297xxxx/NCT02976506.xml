    <textblock>
      To evaluate safety and the effects of a unsupervised physical activity program (USPAP) over&#xD;
      blood pressure (BP), physical fitness (PF) and quality of life (QL) of elderly hypertensive&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      The present study was approved by the Human and Animal Ethics Committee of the institution&#xD;
      and the participants were only randomized to participate after having signed the informed&#xD;
      consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A population of elderly hypertensive patients registered at a reference center for&#xD;
      hypertension treatment was selected. The sample size was calculated considering a test power&#xD;
      of 80% with significance level of 5% and estimating a difference to be observed within the BP&#xD;
      values of 7 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 4 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure&#xD;
      (DBP). The sample calculated was 25 participants in each group being selected 20% more in&#xD;
      case of losses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An electronic chart was created with numbers for the patients that were randomized into&#xD;
      control (CG) and intervention groups (IG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IG was included in an USPAP and the control group was kept under the usual care of the&#xD;
      service that includes orientation to perform PA according to the World Health Organization&#xD;
      recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the beginning of the protocol clinical and laboratorial data collected included:&#xD;
      weight, height, waist circumference, fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1C and lipid profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to that health-related quality of life was assessed with the Short Form 36-item&#xD;
      Health Survey (SF-36). The SF-36 Questionnaire includes one multi-item scale that assesses&#xD;
      eight health concepts: 1) functional capacity; 2) physical aspects; 3) pain; 4) general&#xD;
      health status; 5) vitality; 6) social aspects; 7) emotional aspects; and 8) mental health.&#xD;
      The score of each health concept ranges from 0 to 100, in which zero means the worst general&#xD;
      health state and one hundred the best health state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients underwent physical tests to evaluate their physical fitness: cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      fitness test (Cooper Test) and abdominal resistance test. Patients were classified according&#xD;
      to the Physical Aptitude Classification Tables for Users of Public Parks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BP was assessed with office BP measurements using OMRON - HEM 705 CPÂ® semi-automatic&#xD;
      devices according to the VI Brazilian Hypertension Guidelines (BHG). Home blood pressure was&#xD;
      also performed following the same technics of office measurements and according to the III&#xD;
      Brazilian Guidelines of Home Blood Pressure Monitoring with 3 measurements in the morning&#xD;
      fasting and 3 at night before dinner in four consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical activity prescriptions were individualized so that the patients would have no&#xD;
      doubts regarding execution when performing the exercise without the presence of the&#xD;
      prescribing professional. The prescribed physical activity was aerobic and walking was the&#xD;
      chosen one. The activity was prescribed in a planned, structured and repetitive way aiming to&#xD;
      maintain or improve one or more components of physical fitness. To achieve those goals&#xD;
      patients attended to 2 supervised sessions that took place in a one week period in&#xD;
      non-consecutive days. They were instructed to perform training at least 3 times a week during&#xD;
      30 minutes or more with a moderate intensity of 40 to 60% of their reserve heart rate which&#xD;
      mean walking slightly breathless but being able to pronounce complete phrases according to&#xD;
      the VI BHG recommendations. The total number of sessions prescribed was 36 throughout the 12&#xD;
      weeks. The minimum of 30 sessions was needed so the results could be validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health educational strategies were used simultaneously to data collection to improve&#xD;
      adherence of both groups. Motivational actions were used specific for the IG. Weekly phone&#xD;
      calls were carried out to the IG in order to know about the number of sessions performed that&#xD;
      week, the duration of the practice and the total number of steps of each session. All&#xD;
      participants received a pedometer and a diary to register activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety was assessed considering: need to interrupt training due to lesions, falls,&#xD;
      incapacitating pain or acute events related to training that would require medical&#xD;
      assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 12 weeks all participants were reevaluated and all procedures were repeated to evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected was analyzed with software Statistical Package of Social Science, version&#xD;
      23.0, Chicago, USA. Qualitative variables were presented in absolute numbers and percentages&#xD;
      with the comparison between them being made with Qui Square Test or Exact Fisher Test.&#xD;
      Proportion comparison in the groups was performed applying Wilcoxon Test. Quantitative&#xD;
      variables were initially analyzed in terms of its distribution with Shapiro-Wilk test. Mean&#xD;
      variables comparison was performed with T-Student test for paired and unpaired samples. The&#xD;
      results were presented as mean values and standard deviation and p value &lt; 0,05 was&#xD;
      considered significant.&#xD;
