  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the number of older people in Europe grows, increasing healthy life years is a priority.&#xD;
      As people live longer, ensuring good mental as well as physical health into later years is&#xD;
      becoming ever more important. Cognitive decline, dementia (e.g. Alzheimer's Disease, AD),&#xD;
      sleep disturbances and depression, all related to psychological distress and anxiety, are&#xD;
      significant drivers of reduced quality of life in older adults. This project builds on&#xD;
      evidence that meditation practice have the potential to downregulate these adverse factors&#xD;
      and positively impact mental and neurological conditions including AD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Understanding of the neurocognitive mechanisms of meditation is still limited. Meditation can&#xD;
      be conceptualized as &quot;a set of complex emotional and attentional regulation strategies&#xD;
      developed for a variety of purposes including the development of emotional well-being and&#xD;
      balance&quot;. Affective (emotional) and cognitive (attentional) control are therefore the most&#xD;
      likely mechanisms by which meditation could impact aging and AD. Specifically, meditation&#xD;
      could enhance the controlling role of mid-brain structures and the executive network over&#xD;
      structures involved in memory, emotions, and regulation of the immune system. This would lead&#xD;
      to better emotional and cognitive control which in turn would be associated with improved&#xD;
      mental and physical health.&#xD;
