      The aim of study is to determine if 99mTc Annexin V-128 (AxV- 128/Tc) single photon emission&#xD;
      computed tomography (SPECT)-computed tomography (CT) can detect perioperative lung injury.&#xD;
      The investigators will study patients undergoing major surgery, specifically Whipple&#xD;
      procedures (pancreatico-duodenectomies) and compare AxV-128/Tc SPECT-CT scans before and&#xD;
      after surgery in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and non-COPD patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung injury is commonly not detected unless structural damage has occurred. SPECT-CT scanning&#xD;
      using a specific tracer that lights up when it detects apoptosis (programmed cell death) has&#xD;
      been used to detect even minor lung injury for example by smoke inhalation in animals and may&#xD;
      be more sensitive to detect a less severe injury. The present study aims to study SPECT-CT&#xD;
      scan using a tracer for apoptosis, 99mTc Annexin V-128 (AxV- 128/Tc), to detect lung injury&#xD;
      after major surgery. Prolonged ventilation during surgery can cause minor lung injury but is&#xD;
      usually not clinically detected. The investigators are planning to study 40 patients (20&#xD;
      patients with pre-existing lung disease-COPD and 20 patients with normal preoperative lung&#xD;
      function) who are undergoing Whipple operations or other major surgery. The investigators&#xD;
      will obtain SPECT-CT scans before and then 2-3 days after surgery and compare the uptake of a&#xD;
      radioactive tracer with plasma markers of lung injury (Soluble Receptors for Advanced&#xD;
      Glycation End Products (sRAGE), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Clara-cell 16 and lung surfactant&#xD;
      protein D (SP-D) among others). The investigators will ask the subjects to undergo spirometry&#xD;
      testing, blood draws and urine collection. In addition, a SPECT-CT scan that lasts&#xD;
      approximately 1 hour will be performed prior to surgery and 2-3 days post-operatively (while&#xD;
      still hospitalized).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total effective dose from the combined SPECT and CT scans is 6.2 millisievert (mSv). This&#xD;
      effective dose is below what a patient receives during a standard 2 dose rest and stress&#xD;
      cardiac nuclear imaging study and well within the range of current clinical nuclear imaging&#xD;
      tests. The exact long term risk for development of cancer from diagnostic radiological&#xD;
      procedures is currently under debate but all imaging procedures in this study are aimed to&#xD;
      keep total radiation burden As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA).&#xD;

Whipple procedure: A Whipple procedure - also known as a pancreaticoduodenectomy - is a complex operation to remove the head of the pancreas, the first part of the small intestine (duodenum), the gallbladder and the bile duct.&#xD;
The Whipple procedure is used to treat tumors and other disorders of the pancreas, intestine and bile duct. It is the most often used surgery to treat pancreatic cancer that's confined to the head of the pancreas. After performing the Whipple procedure, your surgeon reconnects the remaining organs to allow you to digest food normally after surgery. Standard of care.&#xD;
Major surgery: Additional surgical procedure(s) that is clinically indicated. Standard of care.</description>

Whipple procedure: A Whipple procedure - also known as a pancreaticoduodenectomy - is a complex operation to remove the head of the pancreas, the first part of the small intestine (duodenum), the gallbladder and the bile duct.&#xD;
The Whipple procedure is used to treat tumors and other disorders of the pancreas, intestine and bile duct. It is the most often used surgery to treat pancreatic cancer that's confined to the head of the pancreas. After performing the Whipple procedure, your surgeon reconnects the remaining organs to allow you to digest food normally after surgery. Standard of care.&#xD;
Major surgery: Additional surgical procedure(s) that is clinically indicated. Standard of care.</description>
