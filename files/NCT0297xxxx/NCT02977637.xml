    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is performed with contrast agents to highlight the blood&#xD;
      vessels and allow interpretation and diagnosis of blood vessel abnormalities. HHT (Hereditary&#xD;
      Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia) is a disease of blood vessels, and can suffer fatal bleeding if&#xD;
      abnormal blood vessels are not detected and treated early. Patients with HHT also require&#xD;
      many imaging studies through their lifetimes for surveillance of blood vessels. Many HHT&#xD;
      patients also have co-existing iron deficiency anemia from bleeding in their nose and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract, and receive daily iron therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ferumoxytol is an alternative MR contrast agent, which is FDA (Food and Drug Administration)&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia. In addition, it is not associated with&#xD;
      the risks to the kidneys of the other agents. The use of ferumoxytol for MR imaging may&#xD;
      benefit the patients who do not currently receive imaging due to the contraindications of the&#xD;
      conventional contrast agents. It avoids the use of ionizing radiation. Also, the conventional&#xD;
      contrast agents are associated with risks. Iodinated contrast in CT is associated with&#xD;
      significant risks of kidney damage. Another imaging technique, MR, uses gadolinium based&#xD;
      contrast agents. Gadolinium, if used in patients with pre existing kidney dysfunction&#xD;
      (defined as GFR &lt; 30ml/min) is associated with the development of another devastating disease&#xD;
      called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. As HHT patients will require repeated scans throughout&#xD;
      their lifetimes, this study will provide them a safer alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten patients from the HHT clinic in whom the use of ferumoxytol as an MR agent is clinically&#xD;
      indicated will be invited to participate in this study, which will determine if MR with&#xD;
      ferumoxytol is able to detect and characterize vascular malformations in HHT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The safety of the use of gadolinium based contrast agents in MR is a concern for the FDA,&#xD;
      with risks of development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and the more recent discovery of&#xD;
      accumulation of gadolinium in the brain in patients who have received multiple prior MR&#xD;
      scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) manifests with multiple vascular malformations&#xD;
      (VMs) in the skin, mucous membranes and solid organs affecting the spine, brain, liver,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and lungs. The disease has an autosomal dominant&#xD;
      inheritance and affects 1 in 5000 individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral vascular malformations occur in 23 % of HHT patients, with a bleeding risk of 0.5%&#xD;
      per year. Pulmonary AVMs occur in 15-50% of HHT patients, with a complication rate of 50%&#xD;
      ranging from fatal hemoptysis or hemothorax to stroke or cerebral abscess. Liver vascular&#xD;
      malformations are present in 32-78% of HHT patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for screening for vascular malformations is detection of a treatable lesion&#xD;
      prior to the development of a fatal complication. The international guidelines currently&#xD;
      recommend different first line screening tests in each organ: MRI for cerebral VMs,&#xD;
      transthoracic echocardiography for pulmonary VMs, endoscopy for gastrointestinal VMs, Doppler&#xD;
      US or CT for liver VMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) may play an important role in the&#xD;
      simultaneous whole body screening of vascular malformations. The advantages of CE-MRA include&#xD;
      visualization of the entire body vasculature in one examination, high spatial resolution&#xD;
      comparable to CT, no ionizing radiation and easy of multiplanar reconstructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substituting a conventional gadolinium based contrast agent (GBCA) with an ultra small, super&#xD;
      paramagnetic iron oxide agent (USPIO) e.g ferumoxytol, will eliminate any potential risk of&#xD;
      developing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Since 2009, ferumoxytol ('Feraheme' Advanced&#xD;
      Magnetics, Cambridge, MA) has been FDA approved for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia&#xD;
      in adult patients with chronic kidney disease. The results of prior studies suggest that&#xD;
      ferumoxytol is comparable to standard GBCAs for CE- MRA. Our experience with use of&#xD;
      ferumoxytol to date suggests that it will be a superior agent for detection of vascular&#xD;
      malformations in a range of vascular territories and that it will be uniquely capable of&#xD;
      interrogating multiple territories in one sitting, due to its highly stable intravascular&#xD;
      residence time.&#xD;
