      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malaria is a serious disease. It is passed by infected mosquitoes. In many parts of Africa,&#xD;
      malaria continues to be the main cause of death in young children and pregnant women.&#xD;
      Researchers want to find out more about how malaria affects pregnant women and their babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the rate of miscarriage and stillbirth during the second and third trimesters among&#xD;
      women in a certain district in Mali. To study rates of malaria infection over time among&#xD;
      pregnant women and children in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women of any age and pregnancy stage and their newborns. They must live in&#xD;
      Ouelessebougou, Mali. Children up to 10 years old who live there.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about the study will be shared at community meetings, during visits to the health&#xD;
      centers, and during census updates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will read and sign a consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women will be screened to see if they are eligible. They may have a urine test. They&#xD;
      may have an ultrasound to date their pregnancy. Ultrasound uses sound waves to take pictures&#xD;
      of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be enrolled in the study after they have their babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will provide a finger/heel prick blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a questionnaire. They will be asked about:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antimalarial and other interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socioeconomic status&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous pregnancies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health of their newborn...&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Placental malaria (PM) leads to poor outcomes for pregnant women and their babies, and is&#xD;
      caused by Plasmodium falciparum sequestration in the intervillous spaces of the placenta and&#xD;
      ensuing inflammation. Severe maternal anemia, low birth weight (LBW) delivery and fetal loss&#xD;
      are common sequelae. Malaria-related LBW alone is estimated to cause 62,000-363,000 infant&#xD;
      deaths in Africa each year. To reduce poor pregnancy outcomes associated with malaria&#xD;
      infection, WHO recommends monthly anti-malarial treatment with sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (SP)&#xD;
      during the second and third trimester and the use of insecticide-treated bed nets. However,&#xD;
      in East and Southern Africa, SP has lost its efficacy due to the spread of drug-resistant&#xD;
      parasites. Therefore, an effective vaccine for PM is needed. Although the ideal vaccine will&#xD;
      be given to adolescent girls prior to becoming pregnant, at this early stage of pregnancy&#xD;
      malaria vaccine development, it is unknown if a boosting dose may be needed during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before testing new interventions to improve pregnancy outcomes, it is important to obtain&#xD;
      baseline information on pregnancy outcomes in the target population. In our recent&#xD;
      longitudinal study of 1,885 pregnant women in Mali, in which women were closely followed&#xD;
      during pregnancy (including malaria prevention and treatment), 2.9%, 2.4% and 6% of&#xD;
      pregnancies ended in miscarriage, stillbirth, and preterm delivery, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of the study is to assess pregnancy outcomes in women in the community with&#xD;
      access to the WHO recommended standard of care. In the first part of the study, all women&#xD;
      presenting for an antenatal visit at Ouelessebougou health centers will be recruited into the&#xD;
      study. In the second part of the study, non-pregnant women will be enrolled and followed to&#xD;
      capture data on pregnancy outcomes including early pregnancy losses. Pregnancy outcome&#xD;
      information will be collected after the birth of the child or after pregnancy termination&#xD;
      (i.e. miscarriage/stillbirth). Primary and secondary endpoints will be analyzed using&#xD;
      appropriate statistical methods, including possible confounders, to determine the prevalence&#xD;
      and factors associated with poor pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
