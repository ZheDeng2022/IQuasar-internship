  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study consists in enriching knowledge of health professionals, on the&#xD;
      functional difficulties encountered by hemiplegic patients outside the hospital, in&#xD;
      particular on hobbies, going out with friends or family, work, daily life and the personal&#xD;
      projects. Another objective is to evaluate the diversity of the attitudes and representations&#xD;
      of the patients about their body damage. Lastly, the study seeks to develop a new grid of&#xD;
      evaluation of the quality of life of the patients, which determines more fields of the&#xD;
      existence significantly impacted by the hemiparesy, from the point of view of the patients.&#xD;
      It is a question of improving the therapeutic care of the patients and to determine if&#xD;
      various therapeutic approaches (occupational, pharmacological, surgical) have an impact on&#xD;
      these various fields. The study will be based on qualitative data (interviews) and&#xD;
      quantitative (questionnaires).&#xD;

      1. To conduct the research, a sociologist will collaborate with Doctor Nicolas Roche, the&#xD;
           study director. The contribution of a sociologist will offer a viewpoint from outside&#xD;
           the medical aspect, which will allow more global identification of the areas of the&#xD;
           lives of patients that are affected by hemiparesis. Furthermore, the sociological&#xD;
           perspective will seek to demonstrate the social aspects, which have heretofore been&#xD;
           explored little or not at all in medical and public health studies, such as, for&#xD;
           example, in terms of intimacy or self-image. It must delicately capture the practices,&#xD;
           logic of action and though of the patients, by placing them in the social contexts in&#xD;
           which they evolve and develop. Therefore, attention will be paid to certain &quot;social&#xD;
           determinants&quot; (such as sociocultural setting, age or gender) and certain resources&#xD;
           (particularly economic, relational and material), which can have an effect on the ways&#xD;
           in which patients perceive and cope with the consequences of their hemiparesis. The role&#xD;
           of loved ones (partner, family members, friends) will also be examined, since many&#xD;
           sociological works have shown that they are usually on the front line to accompany,&#xD;
           shape and manage the effects of the motor impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The study will target adults regularly followed in the department of physical medicine&#xD;
           and rehabilitation of the Raymond-Poincaré hospital. These individuals must present with&#xD;
           hemiparesis secondary to a single, hemispheric cerebrovascular accident, be living at&#xD;
           home and be able to move inside and outside of the home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients having several severe cognitive disorders or aphasia will not be interviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include an exploration phase (a corpus of approximatively 30 examinations) and&#xD;
      a quantitative component (approximatively 100 questionnaires).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the examinations have been completed, the preparation of the questionnaire will be done&#xD;
      with the validation of clinical experts. The questionnaire will include approximately 20&#xD;
      items, distributed over several dimensions of patients' lives. The participants' response&#xD;
      time to the questionnaire should be in a range from 8 to 12 minutes, in order to facilitate&#xD;
      its insertion in the professional practices when the patients are at a hospital visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher will be in charge of completion of the questionnaire. This will be performed&#xD;
      around or during the consultation of patients at Raymond-Poincaré hospital. The first&#xD;
      completions will be recorded (with the written approval of surveyed patients) in order to be&#xD;
      able to work on possible improvements, particularly in terms of the order of questions or in&#xD;
      their understanding and response options. After ten completions, the questionnaire will be&#xD;
      slightly revised if modifications appear necessary, then will remain the same until the&#xD;
      desired volume of questionnaires is received (approximatively 100).&#xD;
