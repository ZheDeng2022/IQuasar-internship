    <textblock>
      Rectal cancer, comprised of 30% of overall colorectal cancer cohort, is one of the leading&#xD;
      cancers of Taiwan. In patients with advanced disease, the standard of care is concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) before surgery. After CCRT, the abscopal effect, a phenomenon that&#xD;
      localized radiation not only destroys local tumor but also inhibits the growth of tumor at&#xD;
      the remote site, has been observed. This effect is believed to be associated with tumor&#xD;
      immune response. In addition, other immune checkpoint molecules, such as Programmed cell&#xD;
      death-1(PD-1), Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), and Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Associated&#xD;
      Protein 4 (CTLA-4), have been reported associated with therapeutic outcome. However, after&#xD;
      CCRT, more than 50% of patients were still either having persistent disease or developed&#xD;
      distant metastasis. To improve therapeutic outcome of patients with rectal cancer, this&#xD;
      project, thus, aims at exploring the evolution of factors that may affect the abscopal effect&#xD;
      and immune checkpoint functions in tissues and in blood before and after CCRT.&#xD;

      For most patients, preoperative chemoradiotherapy results in clinically tumor regression, but&#xD;
      the degree of response varies among patients. There are approximately 40-60% of LARC patients&#xD;
      treated with CCRT achieve some degree of pathologic response. However, there is yet an&#xD;
      effective method before the commencement of CCRT that can predict how patients will respond&#xD;
      to CCRT and can subsequently render better survival. Identify patents who will benefit most&#xD;
      from CCRT is crucial not only in lowering treatment-related morbidity and sustaining local&#xD;
      control but also to improve survival rate in LARC.&#xD;
