    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      belzutifan Tablets and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of belzutifan Tablets in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Part 1A: This is a Phase 1, multiple-dose, dose-escalation trial of belzutifan Tablets, where&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors will be assigned to sequential dose cohorts. Patient&#xD;
      safety will be monitored with frequent physical examinations, vital sign measurements,&#xD;
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), and hematology and chemistry laboratory studies, and by recording&#xD;
      all adverse events (AEs). Blood will be obtained for analysis of the concentration of&#xD;
      belzutifan and to assess biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1B: Once the MTD and/or the RP2D is achieved, and expansion cohort of 50 patients with&#xD;
      advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: After determination of the MTD/RP2D, up to 25 patients with other specified solid&#xD;
      tumors may be enrolled. Up to 3 different tumor types may be included in this part of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2A: A cohort of 25 patients with glioblastoma (GBM)&#xD;
