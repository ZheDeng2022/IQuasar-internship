    <textblock>
      The objective of this non-interventional study (NIS) is to evaluate patients' adherence and&#xD;
      persistence to carfilzomib therapy in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone or in&#xD;
      combination with dexamethasone alone or in combination with daratumumab and dexamethasone in&#xD;
      adult patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least one prior therapy in a&#xD;
      real-life setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dual combination of lenalidomide (Revlimid®) (R) and dexamethasone (d) (Rd) as well as&#xD;
      the dual combination of bortezomib (Velcade®, V) and dexamethasone (Vd) are standard regimens&#xD;
      to treat MM patients who have received at least one prior therapy. Recently published&#xD;
      clinical data indicate that the next-generation proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib (Kyprolis®)&#xD;
      (K) may substantially change the treatment paradigm for patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      MM (RRMM).1 Three pivotal trials were conducted leading to market authorization of&#xD;
      carfilzomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone or in combination with&#xD;
      dexamethasone alone or in combination with dexamethasone and daratumumab for the treatment of&#xD;
      MM patients who have received at least one prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASPIRE, NCT010803912 To compare the efficacy and safety of carfilzomib in combination with Rd&#xD;
      (KRd) with the dual combination therapy Rd, a randomized, multicenter, open-label phase III&#xD;
      study was performed in patients with relapsed MM (RMM). After cycle 18, carfilzomib was&#xD;
      discontinued in the KRd arm, but Rd administration was continued thereafter until disease&#xD;
      progression. The trial met its primary endpoint progression-free survival (PFS) (Hazard Ratio&#xD;
      (HR) for progression or death, 0.69; p=0.0001). Median PFS was 26.3 months with KRd treatment&#xD;
      compared to 17.6 months with Rd treatment. The study further demonstrates that carfilzomib&#xD;
      improves patients' overall survival (OS) rate at 24 months (KRd, 73.3% vs. Rd, 65.0%; HR for&#xD;
      death, 0.79; p=0.04) and overall response rate (ORR) (KRd, 87.1% vs. Rd, 66.7%; p&lt;0.001).&#xD;
      Objective assessment of adverse events (AEs) and patient-reported outcomes (PRO) revealed&#xD;
      that the benefit-risk ratio is favorable for the three-drug combination KRd.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDEAVOR, NCT015688663 To compare the efficacy and safety of the dual combination therapy Kd&#xD;
      with the dual combination therapy Vd, a randomized, multicenter, open-label phase III study&#xD;
      was performed in patients with RRMM. Patients in both arms received treatment until&#xD;
      progression. Results of the preplanned interim analysis show, that the trial met its primary&#xD;
      endpoint PFS (HR for progression or death, 0.53; p&lt;0.0001). Median PFS was 18.7 months with&#xD;
      Kd treatment compared to 9.4 months with Vd treatment. In addition, the Kd combination&#xD;
      therapy demonstrated superiority over the Vd combination therapy for secondary objectives,&#xD;
      like ORR (77% vs. 63%; p&lt;0.0001) and median duration of response (DOR) (21.3 months vs. 10.4&#xD;
      months). OS data were not available at time of analysis. Despite higher rates for cardiac and&#xD;
      renal failure as well as higher incidence of hypertension and dyspnea in the Kd arm,&#xD;
      carfilzomib given as a 30 min infusion has an acceptable safety profile, particularly with&#xD;
      respect to lower peripheral neuropathy events. The number of patients who had ≥ grade 2&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy was significantly higher in the Vd group than in the Kd group (32% vs.&#xD;
      6%). In conclusion, data of the ENDEAVOR study demonstrate, that carfilzomib given in&#xD;
      combination with dexamethasone has a favorable benefit-risk profile and provides an important&#xD;
      new treatment option for patients with RRMM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CANDOR, NCT031586884-7 To compare the efficacy and safety of carfilzomib in combination with&#xD;
      dexamethasone and daratumumab (KdD) with the dual combination therapy Kd, a randomized,&#xD;
      multicenter, open-label phase III study was performed in patients with RRMM. Patients in both&#xD;
      arms received treatment until progression. The trial met its primary endpoint PFS (HR for&#xD;
      progression or death, 0.59). Median PFS was 28.6 months in the KdD arm and 15.2 months with&#xD;
      Kd treatment with a median follow-up time of 27.8 months and 27.0 months, respectively.&#xD;
      Further, KdD treatment demonstrates improved response rates by providing deeper responses.&#xD;
      ORR was 84% (with 29% complete response (CR) or better) for KdD treatment and 75% (with 10%&#xD;
      CR or better) for Kd treatment (p=0.0080). The minimal residual disease (MRD) negative CR&#xD;
      rate at 12 months is nearly 10-times higher with KdD (12.5%) compared to Kd (1.3%). Overall,&#xD;
      the safety profile is consistent with the known safety profiles of each agent, with the&#xD;
      exception of an imbalance in treatment-emergent fatal AEs, which might be partially explained&#xD;
      by longer treatment exposure, age, and frailty status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to now, no real-life data on patients' adherence, persistence, quality of life (QoL) and&#xD;
      patterns of use, effectiveness and safety of the KRd,the Kd and the KdD regimen have been&#xD;
      systematically collected and analyzed. Thus, after market approval of KRd, Kd and KdD as&#xD;
      treatment for patients with MM who have received at least one prior therapy, the purpose of&#xD;
      the CARO NIS is to evaluate patients' adherence, persistence and QoL as well as effectiveness&#xD;
      and safety of both regimens in a real-life setting.&#xD;
