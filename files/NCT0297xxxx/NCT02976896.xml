      We conduct the phase II clinical trial to further explore the efficacy and safety of Apatinib&#xD;
      Mesylate in treating recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after the&#xD;
      failure of conventional treatments. An exploratory molecular marker analysis will be&#xD;
      performed in order to find out the beneficial population of Apatinib Mesylate.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumor in China. In Asian countries,&#xD;
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is the main pathological type of esophageal carcinoma.&#xD;
      Prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is usually poor and surgery is the only&#xD;
      radical treatment. Cisplatin (DDP, cisplatin), 5 - Fluorouracil (5 - Fluorouracil, 5 - FU)&#xD;
      and taxane are the most adopted chemotherapy agents, with efficacy rates of 33%-40% as&#xD;
      first-line treatment for metastatic or recurrent esophageal squamous carcinoma and a median&#xD;
      overall survival of 6-10 months. New agents were needed. Apatinib Mesylate is a small&#xD;
      molecule VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The anti-tumor mechanism of Apatinib is inhibiting&#xD;
      angiogenesis in malignancy by inhibiting VEGFR. Apatinib Mesylate was approved by CFDA (China&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration) for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer. In the previous&#xD;
      clinical practice, we observed that part of the patients with esophageal squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma were resistant to conventional treatments benefited from Apatinib Mesylate. Based&#xD;
      on the research situation mentioned above, we decided to conduct a phase II clinical trial to&#xD;
      further explore the efficacy and safety of Apatinib Mesylate in treating recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after the failure of conventional treatments.&#xD;
      An exploratory molecular marker analysis will be performed in order to find out the&#xD;
      beneficial population of Apatinib Mesylate.&#xD;
