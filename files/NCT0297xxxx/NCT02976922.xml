      Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is one of the most common ulcerative diseases affecting&#xD;
      the oral mucosa. The aetiology remains unknown, but several local, systemic, immunologic,&#xD;
      genetic, allergic, nutritional, and microbial factors have been proposed as causative agents.&#xD;
      Clinically, RAS is characterised by recurrent bouts of one or several rounded, shallow,&#xD;
      painful oral ulcers at intervals of a few months or days. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      characterise the salivary and faecal microbiome in 20 patients with RAS and compare the&#xD;
      findings with those of 20 healthy controls. The study also includes a double-blind randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled intervention with probiotics (Lactobacillus reuteri-containing lozenges 2&#xD;
      tablets daily for 3 months) or placebo. The salivary and faecal microbiome in RAS patients is&#xD;
      compared before and after treatment. This study will improve our understanding of the&#xD;
      pathogenesis in RAS and provide us with knowledge on potential future therapeutic approaches.&#xD;

      Purpose of the study The purpose of this study is to characterise the salivary and faecal&#xD;
      microbiome in patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) and to compare the findings&#xD;
      to those of a matched healthy control group. Another purpose is to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      treatment with probiotics on the microbiome in whole saliva and faeces as well as the&#xD;
      severity and number of RAS outbreaks. Moreover, a smear will be taken from present aphthous&#xD;
      ulcers before and after treatment with probiotics in order to characterise the local&#xD;
      microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is assumed that the microbiome in whole saliva and faeces from patients with RAS (minor or&#xD;
      major type aphthous ulcers) differs from the microbiome in whole saliva and faeces from age-&#xD;
      and gender-matched control persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also hypothesised that probiotic treatment has a beneficial effect on the mucosal pain&#xD;
      and reduces the severity of RAS and the frequency of outbreaks. Furthermore, it is assumed&#xD;
      that treatment with probiotic has an effect on microbiome in whole saliva and faeces from&#xD;
      patients with RAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is one of the most common ulcerative diseases&#xD;
      affecting the oral mucosa. The prevalence varies from 5-25%. The aetiology remains unknown,&#xD;
      but several local, systemic, immunologic, genetic, allergic, nutritional, and microbial&#xD;
      factors have been proposed as causative agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, RAS is characterised by recurrent bouts of one or several rounded, shallow,&#xD;
      painful oral ulcers at intervals of a few months or days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RAS can be classified into three different types: minor, major and herpetiform. Minor RAS&#xD;
      comprises about 80% of the cases. This type is characterised by aphthous ulcers with a&#xD;
      diameter of about 5 mm, often localised in the buccal and labial mucosa. The ulcers heal&#xD;
      within 7-10 days without formation of scars. Major RAS appear in 10-15% of the patients. The&#xD;
      ulcers are often crateriform with a diameter of 10-30 mm, and typically present on the labial&#xD;
      mucosa, the soft palate, the tonsillar region and oropharynx. The healing time may vary from&#xD;
      2 to 6 weeks and leaving cicatrix. These ulcers are very painful and food intake may be&#xD;
      compromised. The prevalence of the herpetiform type is 5-10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This type is often localised in the floor of the mouth and the ventral part of the tongue,&#xD;
      and it characterised by aggregation of multiple small ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aetiology remains unknown, but a number of local and systemic factors are assumed&#xD;
      increase the predisposition, including mucosal trauma, stressful events, hormonal changes,&#xD;
      smoking cessation, allergy to various food substances as well as vitamin- and/or mineral&#xD;
      deficiency. The is also a genetic predisposition as the possibility of developing RAS is 90%&#xD;
      if both parents have RAS and 20% if one of the parents has RAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbial factors A number of microorganisms have been suggested involved in the&#xD;
      aetiopathogenesis of RAS. These include oral streptococci, especially Streptococcus mitis,&#xD;
      but the cross-reaction between oral streptococci and oral mucosal antigens is unspecific and&#xD;
      considered clinically insignificant. Helicobacter pylori, which is associated with gastritis&#xD;
      and duodenal ulcers may also be seen in dental plaque and therefore also be suggested&#xD;
      involved in the pathogenesis of RAS, but the anti-H. pylori seropositivity has not been found&#xD;
      increased in patients with RAS. Various vira have been found in biopsies from aphthous ulcers&#xD;
      such as cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus. Herpes simplex, varicella zoster and&#xD;
      adenovirus have also been assumed to play a role in the aetiopathogenesis. However, it is has&#xD;
      not been possible to show a causal relationship between virus infection and RAS, and viral&#xD;
      DNA may be present due to a secondary infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novel technologies improve our ability to make more in depth analyses of the microbiota in&#xD;
      patients with RAS. While working on this study protocol one study on the microbiome in&#xD;
      patients with RAS has been published showing an increased proportion of Bacteroides species&#xD;
      in the oral mucosa of patients with RAS compared to healthy controls. Thus, as previous&#xD;
      studies also suggest the oral microbiota appears to play a role in the development of RAS as&#xD;
      well as in perpetuation of RAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will characterise the microbiome in whole saliva, faeces and the aphthous&#xD;
      ulcers of patients with RAS (with active lesions) and analyse how it differs from the&#xD;
      microbiome of healthy subjects. This characterisation could be essential for our&#xD;
      understanding the pathogenesis of RAS and contribute to the development of novel strategies&#xD;
      for managing these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunopathological factors Several studies indicate that the pathogenesis of RAS includes a&#xD;
      number of cell-mediated mechanisms, but the exact immunopathogenesis is still not clarified.&#xD;
      Phagocytic and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes may be a role in the destruction of the oral&#xD;
      epithelium and the presence of these immune cells is regulated and maintained by local&#xD;
      release of cytokines. Patients with outbreak of RAS have an increased presence of gamma-delta&#xD;
      T-cells in the blood compared to healthy control persons and patients without active RAS.&#xD;
      Moreover, patients with RAS have an increased presence of Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha&#xD;
      compared to those who do not have RAS, but also other proinflammatory cytokines like&#xD;
      interleukin-2 and -6 are likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of RAS. Finally,&#xD;
      aphthous-like ulcers have been found associated to a number of inflammatory bowel diseases&#xD;
      such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and celiac disease as well as cyclic&#xD;
      neutropenia, HIV-infection and immunoglobulin A (IgA)-deficiency. Accordingly, an immune&#xD;
      component may be involved in RAS which contribute to a change in the intestinal microbiota or&#xD;
      vice versa. In this study, we will characterise the microbiota in saliva and in faeces from&#xD;
      patients with RAS before, during and after treatment with probiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design and methods The project comprises a cross-sectional study which investigates&#xD;
      the microbiome in whole saliva and faeces from 20 patients with RAS and 20 healthy control&#xD;
      persons. The project also includes a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled intervention&#xD;
      with probiotics (Lactobacillus reuteri-containing lozenges 2 tablets daily for 3 months) or&#xD;
      placebo. The salivary and faecal microbiome in RAS patients is compared before and after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients with RAS are recruited among patients referred to the Oral Medicine Clinic,&#xD;
      Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen. The 20 healthy controls are&#xD;
      recruited via www.forsoegsperson.dk&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interview re. onset of RAS, oral symptoms (assessed by means of a visual analogue&#xD;
           scale), comorbidity, medication intake, smoking and alcohol habits, oral hygiene habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of chewing paraffin-stimulated whole saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral examination including evaluation of aphthous ulcers (Ulcer Severity Score),&#xD;
           registration of dental status and periodontal status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A smear from one of the aphthous ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A faecal sample will be collected by the subjects themselves in their homes after&#xD;
           thorough instruction and handled according to manual from the Statens Serum Institut.&#xD;
           From the sample 250 mg is collected and kept in a freezer kept at -80°C until further&#xD;
           processing and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A blood test including haemoglobin (HgB), C reactive protein (CRP), iron, cobalamin,&#xD;
           folate, transferrin, ferritin and vitamin D levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extraction of bacterial DNA from saliva, faecal and smear samples (at baseline, 7-day and&#xD;
      90-day of intervention with probiotics or placebo, respectively) will be carried out in the&#xD;
      laboratory at Department of Odontology, University of Copenhagen, using previously&#xD;
      established procedures based on instructions from the Human Microbiome Project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metagenomic analyses on extracted bacterial DNA from saliva, smear and faecal samples are&#xD;
      made by Beijing Genomics Institute. Illumina 16S rDNA sequencing allows determination of&#xD;
      bacterial taxonomy and phylogenetic diversity.&#xD;
