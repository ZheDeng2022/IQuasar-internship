      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newborns and infants with severe bronchiolitis admitted in PICU (Pediatric Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit) are patients at high risk for invasive mechanical ventilation support. In current&#xD;
      literature, there is lack of multicenter, prospective and randomized studies to assess and&#xD;
      describe the impact of non invasive ventilation support among severe bronchiolitis admitted&#xD;
      in PICU, notwithstanding the actual improvement of non invasive ventilation technique on&#xD;
      intubation rate reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, we can find studies on bronchiolitis management in pediatric ward and supported&#xD;
      with high flow nasal cannula (HFNC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studies on severe bronchiolitis admitted in PICU do not evaluate positive end expiratory&#xD;
      pressure (Peep) level applied during Helmet continous positive airway pressure (CPAP)&#xD;
      support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Italian PICU Network (TIPNET) data, severe bronchiolitis admitted in PICU&#xD;
      intubation rate is close to 10% (report 2010-2016), whatever non invasive ventilation support&#xD;
      has been used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal investigators have performed a retrospective and cohort chart review among severe&#xD;
      bronchiolitis (82) admitted in PICU from 2011 to 2015. Early Helmet CPAP was applied to&#xD;
      patients, but peep level has been provided according to clinician experience, because of lack&#xD;
      of indication on this issue. Patients were admitted in PICU from Emergency department,&#xD;
      pediatric ward and up to 72 hours of ineffective HFNC support. The investigators have studied&#xD;
      intubation rate, length of stay, bronchiolitis severity score, virus infection, peep level&#xD;
      and gas flow applied on Helmet CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to preliminary results, 10 cmH2O peep level results 50 time more protective than&#xD;
      lower (5-7.5 cmH2O) peep among flow rate of 50 L/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intubation rate with peep level 10 cmH2O was 3%, while it rose over 15% among 7.5-5 cmH2O&#xD;
      peep level. Statistically significant difference were found on length of PICU stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific literature on Helmet CPAP noising exposure is poor. Such noising was proved to be&#xD;
      reduced with filter application on Helmet CPAP respiratory circuit. There are not report, and&#xD;
      we have never experienced acoustic system impairment in patients undergone Helmet CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS Primary aim: to evaluate escalation therapy (higher peep, non invasive ventilation in&#xD;
      pressure support mode, or intubation and mechanical ventilation) rate on severe bronchiolitis&#xD;
      admitted in PICU and supported with Helmet CPAP non invasive ventilation with 10 cmH2O peep&#xD;
      level in group 1, and 5 cmH2O peep level in group 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim: to evaluate, among two study groups, length of PICU stay, pneumothorax&#xD;
      incidence on Helmet CPAP, sedation effect during Helmet CPAP, early enteral feeding&#xD;
      tolerance, syncytial and other respiratory virus incidence, bacterial infection and 30 days&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN Prospective, randomized, cohort, controlled and multicentric study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: sample size The study requires 488 patients, enrolled among 20 national and&#xD;
      international PICU. Sample size have been calculated on preliminary results of our&#xD;
      retrospective chart review; we hypothesize that intubation rate with 5 cmH2O peep level is&#xD;
      15% and application of 10 cmH2O peep level may reduce it to 50%. According to these&#xD;
      hypothesis, we need 244 patients for each group to have 5% of significativity level and 80%&#xD;
      of study power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of study 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection and patient enrollment Severe bronchiolitis admitted in PICU and requiring&#xD;
      respiratory support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Binary randomized peep level of Helmet CPAP (1-0). The first patient enrolled will be assign&#xD;
      to treatment 1 (10 cmH2O peep level), independently from its BSS. The following patients&#xD;
      enrolled will be assign to treatment 0 (5 cmH2O peep level), and consecutively up to 25&#xD;
      patients at least.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 cmH2O peep, 50 L/min gas flow, FiO2 0.5 on PICU admission (random 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 cmH2O peep, 50 L/min gas flow, FiO2 0.5 on PICU admission (random 0) If clinical and&#xD;
           respiratory worsening, reduction of pH or PaO2/FiO2 occurs in the following first hour&#xD;
           after Helmet CPAP treatment start, patients enrolled will receive endotracheal&#xD;
           intubation, full face mask non invasive ventilation or higher peep level treatment&#xD;
           (7.5-10 cmH2O) according to clinical evaluation, if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In investigators' experience, early worsening of severe bronchiolitis in PICU in the first&#xD;
      hour of Helmet CPAP treatment with 10 cmH2O peep level leads to endotracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PLAN Application of a standard treatment protocol for all patients enrolled. It is the&#xD;
      same standard of care applied to treat these patients in our PICU in the last 2 years. Of&#xD;
      course, patients who will not be enrolled in the study will be supported and treated with the&#xD;
      best feasible care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Registration of the modified Wood's Clinical Asthma score (mWCAS) for severe&#xD;
           bronchiolitis admitted in PICU (Bronchiolitis Severity Score-BSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clarithromycin prophylaxis for newborns (up to 30 days old), or I generation&#xD;
           cephalosporine for older infants, if high fever, lung opacities or high inflammation&#xD;
           markers occurs (PCR, procalcitonin, White body cells)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  volume replacement (20 ml/kg of sodium chloride solution or albumine 5%) in 60 min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  morphine ev bolus: 20 mcg/kg in 2 min and following 5 mcg/kg/h infusion (or other&#xD;
           sedatives according to local PICU investigator)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  nasogastric tube placement and early enteral feeding 4-6 hours after admission (5-10&#xD;
           ml/h)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  desamethasone 0.2 mg/kg x3/die ev (according to local PICU investigator ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  proton pump inhibitors or H2 receptor antagonist (according to local PICU investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  aerosol therapy 4 time/die: sodium chloride hypertonic solution 3% (or sodium chloride&#xD;
           0.9%) 2 ml with ipratropium bromide .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arterial blood gas exam (ABE) before Helmet CPAP application and in the following 1,12&#xD;
           24, and 48 hours; arterial catheter positioning is preferred (or arterial blood sampling&#xD;
           by direct arterial puncture according to local PICU practice).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharyngeal swab for molecular analysis to detect viral DNA will be performed on PICU&#xD;
           admission, if not yet performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  occipital and neck skin protection will be used to avoid Helmet CPAP pressure sores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  each Helmet will be provided of a filter to reduce noise inside it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Helmet gas will flow through heat-moisture device switched on 5 min/hour&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients whose parents have signed written informed consent will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      study. Any direct follow up is supposed after PICU discharge. Monitoring of hospital&#xD;
      discharge will be followed by intranet database of the participant hospital.&#xD;
