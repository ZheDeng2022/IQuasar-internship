  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dabrafenib and trametinib are drugs that are usually given for the treatment of melanoma.&#xD;
      Combinations of dabrafenib and trametinib have also been studied and when used together have&#xD;
      shown to increase tumour shrinkage in animals compared to either drug alone. Dabrafenib and&#xD;
      trametinib have also shown potential to penetrate the blood-brain-barrier when given together&#xD;
      and have an effect on brain metastases. Giving these drugs at the same time and then giving&#xD;
      brain stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) may also be preferred in patients with brain metastases&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to find out the effects of giving dabrafenib in combination with&#xD;
      trametinib continuously with stereotactic radiotherapy (SRS) has on melanoma and brain&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) is a non-surgical radiation therapy used to treat tumours of&#xD;
      the brain. It can deliver precisely targeted radiation. Currently SRS alone is the usual&#xD;
      treatment for patients with up to 4 brain lesions. This study will include 2 groups 1)&#xD;
      patients with 1-4 brain lesions treated with SRS concurrently with dabrafenib and trametinib&#xD;
      and 2) patients with 5-10 brain lesions treated with SRS concurrently with dabrafenib and&#xD;
      trametinib.&#xD;
