      The overall aim of the study is to construct a scale that systematically incorporates the&#xD;
      callers' perspective in a &quot;degree of worry - scale&quot; and to explore the consequences for the&#xD;
      actors in the system - caller, call-handler, and health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be done through four independent studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is it possible to validate &quot;the degree of worry&quot; scale with the software system &quot;Corti&quot;?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does callers' degree of worry relieve after telephone consultation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does call handlers' awareness of degree of worry affect triage outcome?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Is callers' degree of worry a predictor of illness severity?&#xD;

      Does call-handlers awareness of caller Degree-Of-Worry affect triage outcome in telephone&#xD;
      consultation? - a randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background When conducting a telephone consultation the call handler will make the decision&#xD;
      of help needed on the basis of the dialog with the caller. The need of health care is&#xD;
      difficult to estimate due to the lack of visual cues (Rothwell, Ellington, Planalp, &amp; Crouch,&#xD;
      2012) and might be complicated by factors related to the caller or the call handler herself&#xD;
      (Lindström, Heikkilä, Bohm, Castrèn, &amp; Falk, 2014). Especially in cases of low-urgency and&#xD;
      non-normative symptom description, as in the case of the majority of calls to the OOH, the&#xD;
      call handlers' own health belief will have an impact on the triage outcome (Leprohon &amp; Patel,&#xD;
      1995; Ogden, 2011). Callers' Degree-Of-Worry (DOW) when contacting an Out-of-Hours service&#xD;
      (OOH) has proven to be a valuable source of information of the callers' perception of the&#xD;
      actual situation (not published). Call-handlers awareness of DOW can potentially increase the&#xD;
      amount of telephone consultations terminated with advice of self-care or to seek General&#xD;
      Practioner (GP) during office hours. Therefore, the present study seeks to investigate if&#xD;
      call handlers' awareness of DOW affect triage outcome?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: Does call-handlers awareness of caller Degree-Of-Worry affect triage outcome in&#xD;
      telephone consultation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Design The design of the study is a randomized controlled design blinding the&#xD;
      call-handlers to callers' DOW in a computer assisted 1:1 ratio Eliglibility: all calls to&#xD;
      hotline 1813 where informed consent is obtained. Intervention: blinding call-handlers to&#xD;
      callers' DOW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting The acute care system within the Capital Region of Denmark is divided into two&#xD;
      facilities. The Medical Emergency Service and the Out-Of-Hours services (OOH) (hotline 1813)&#xD;
      (Wadmann, Kjellberg, &amp; Kjellberg, 2015). All acute contact to the health care system within&#xD;
      the region is pre-assessed and triaged. The OOH handles approx. 1 million calls per year of&#xD;
      which approx. 40% are triaged to either self-care or consultation at their general&#xD;
      practitioner (GP). The call handler is a nurse or physician, who triages the caller to either&#xD;
      home visit, clinic consultation, self-care or GP. Triage and determination of urgency is&#xD;
      guided by criterion based triage tools. The triage tool used in the OOH has been locally&#xD;
      developed and has not been validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a part of a larger study which aims to construct a scale that&#xD;
      systematically incorporates the callers' perspective in a &quot;DOW&quot; -scale&quot; and to explore the&#xD;
      consequences for the actors in the system - caller, call-handler, and health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection The research questions (see above) will be answered through the analysis of&#xD;
      carefully collected data material incorporating the state of art set up at the hotline 1813&#xD;
      and the Danish health registers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection points are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Datapoint 1: After calling the hotline 1813 before reaching the call handler (caller&#xD;
           delivers data).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Datapoint 2: Right after call terminated (caller delivers data)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Datapoint 3: 48 hours after initial contact to the medical hotline 1813 (Danish&#xD;
           Registers delivers data)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected at three different points during a call made to the hotline 1813.&#xD;
      Participation in the study is voluntary. The data collection will be carried out as an&#xD;
      automated telephone questionnaire. After the telephone consultation the caller will receive&#xD;
      an automated call for further information. In case of non-response a text message will be&#xD;
      sent after 30 and 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization data is generated by reviling caller DOW to the call-handlers. DOW will be&#xD;
      shown as a part of the medical history template, alongside civil registration number,&#xD;
      address. In order to assure the DOW is seen by the call-handler this will be presented on the&#xD;
      medical history template in red, size 14 numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triage outcome will be collected from the internal database at the hotline 1813.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data analysis within the RCT will be limited to triage response given by call-handlers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan of analysis is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome Does call-handlers awareness of caller Degree-Of-Worry affect triage outcome&#xD;
      in telephone consultation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chi2 test and OR of difference between intervention-and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Log regression on outcome in exposure (little, medium and very much worry)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-group of primary outcome (caller)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eksplorative outcomes- DOW in three groups (little, some, much)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is there a difference (intervention/control group) in triage outcome in the group of young&#xD;
      children and old people, respectively?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chi2 test of difference between intervention-and control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-group of primary outcome (call-handler)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eksplorative outcomes - Is there a difference (intervention/control group) in triage outcome&#xD;
      in call-handler gender, years of experience, waiting time?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gender (chi2 test), Years of experience and waiting time&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-response analysis Is there a difference between age, sex, triage-response, criteria, time&#xD;
      of day and weekday? (participants/non-participants) age, sex, triage response, Criteria, Time&#xD;
      of day, Weekday (Descriptive - mean and %)&#xD;
