    <textblock>
      With the extension of the average life expectancy, the incidence of cardiovascular diseases&#xD;
      is also rising. Stroke in Taiwan has been the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, but&#xD;
      also in countries around the world), stroke and the impact of socio-economic and health&#xD;
      spending are large how to reduce the degree of disability after stroke is an important issue&#xD;
      in medicine. For a long time, the resident will fill the clinical pathway form before the&#xD;
      stroke inpatients were discharged. We also analyzed the data of clinical pathway every three&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the current data of stroke clinical pathway included demographic data, length of&#xD;
      hospitalization days, complications, functional independent measure, Brunnstrom motor&#xD;
      recovery stage, mini-mental state examination, geriatric depression scale, blood pressure&#xD;
      data, and post-stroke checklist for a retrospective analysis to provide more complete and&#xD;
      more comprehensive information on follow-up care for stroke patients and effective use of&#xD;
      medical resources, to improve the quality of future medical care and quality of life for&#xD;
      stroke patients.&#xD;
