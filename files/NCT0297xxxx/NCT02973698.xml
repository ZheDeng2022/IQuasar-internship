      Objective: To verify the effectiveness of chin-down posture maneuver in swallowing therapy&#xD;
      for Parkinson's disease (PD).&#xD;

      Participants Participants were PD patients recruited from a Parkinson´s disease and Movement&#xD;
      Disorders Clinic from Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA), a reference hospital, in&#xD;
      the Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. It was obtained from participants the written free and&#xD;
      informed consent to participate in the research. This study was approved by the hospital&#xD;
      central research ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria Patient evaluation It was performed cognitive screening&#xD;
      which consists of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment&#xD;
      (MoCA) in all patients before the intervention. It was also applied the instruments Parkinson&#xD;
      Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39), translated to Portuguese, and the Beck Depression&#xD;
      Inventory (BDI). These tests were applied to verify the influence of cognitive aspects,&#xD;
      depression and quality of life in the therapeutic process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the intervention's effectiveness, an evaluation of swallowing was conducted in&#xD;
      two moments (before and after intervention). Three kinds of assessments were performed: (1).&#xD;
      Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES); (2) Clinical evaluation and (3)&#xD;
      assessment of the quality of life related to swallowing (SWALQOL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES): This objective examination of&#xD;
           swallowing was performed according to the following protocol: First, it was tested the&#xD;
           prior state of secretion in the nasopharyngeal structures, oropharynx, and&#xD;
           laryngopharynx. Next, the individual received liquid consistency offered through a&#xD;
           syringe, 3 and 5ml of water with edible blue food coloring. For the pasty consistency, 3&#xD;
           and 5ml of thickened water were provided through a syringe with edible blue food&#xD;
           coloring. It was offered ¼- water and salt biscuits with good blue food coloring to&#xD;
           assess the solid consistency. No anesthetic was used for the examination. The images&#xD;
           were later analyzed by an otolaryngologist physician, experienced in the dysphagia area.&#xD;
           It was observed the presence of thickening on the posterior laryngeal wall, tremor in&#xD;
           structures (base of tongue and vallecula), early escape (characterized by the presence&#xD;
           of food in the hypopharynx or larynx before the swallowing reflex was triggered),&#xD;
           vallecular stasis in glossoepiglottic folds and pyriform sinus (characterized by&#xD;
           accumulation of food after the third swallowing on the mentioned structures),&#xD;
           penetration (characterized by the presence of food in the laryngeal vestibule), tracheal&#xD;
           aspiration (characterized by food intake in the region located below the vocal folds, in&#xD;
           the subglottic region and in the trachea, at any time of swallowing) and cough reflex.&#xD;
           The alterations were classified as present or absent. The equipment used was the&#xD;
           flexible nasopharyngoscope Maschida ENT-III, 3.2mm, with Xerônio Storz light source.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical evaluation and Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS): clinical evaluation of&#xD;
           swallowing was performed by a certified speech therapist, previously trained to apply&#xD;
           the protocols. All the evaluations were conducted by the same professional. This&#xD;
           assessment had the purpose of checking signs and symptoms of oropharyngeal dysphagia. It&#xD;
           was used solid food consistency (half portion of bread) and liquid (100ml of water)&#xD;
           evaluated by free demand. The analyzed signs and symptoms were: history of aspiration&#xD;
           pneumonia; alert state; interaction attention/ability; awareness of the swallowing&#xD;
           problem; awareness of secretion; ability to manipulate flows; postural control;&#xD;
           fatigability; anatomy and oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal physiology; orofacial tonus;&#xD;
           oral apraxia; orofacial sensitivity; gag pharyngeal contraction; saliva swallowing;&#xD;
           cough and hawk; swallowing apraxia; oral residue; delayed swallowing reflex; reduction&#xD;
           in laryngeal elevation; wet voice; and multiple swallowing. A total of 21 signs and&#xD;
           symptoms were evaluated as present or absent. At the end of the objective and clinical&#xD;
           evaluation, the intake of food was scored according to Functional Oral Intake Scale&#xD;
           (FOIS). This scale scores the level of oral food intake of patients at specific levels,&#xD;
           from 0 (restricted to alternative food pathway) to 7 (total oral intake with no&#xD;
           restrictions), with the aim of monitoring the patients' evolution during the therapeutic&#xD;
           process. A translated and validated version for Brazilian Portuguese was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The quality of Life in Swallowing Disorders: The questionnaire Quality of Life in&#xD;
           Swallowing Disorders (SWAL-QOL) was applied, to verify the symptoms presented by the&#xD;
           patients, as well as their influence on the quality of life. This instrument has Alpha&#xD;
           Cronbach coefficient higher than 0.80, except in one domain. Thus, it presents excellent&#xD;
           internal consistency and short-term reproducibility. It is a sensitive scale to&#xD;
           differentiate oropharyngeal dysphagia degrees of severity. The version translated and&#xD;
           validated for Brazilian Portuguese was used. All questionnaires were applied in a&#xD;
           waiting room. The questions and possible answers were read by the researcher for all&#xD;
           patients. The questionnaires application was performed individually, for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Individuals who agreed to participate in this study were allocated to one of the&#xD;
      three interventions groups: (1) experimental group (patients performed the chin-down posture&#xD;
      maneuver), (2) control group (PD individuals without any intervention) and (3) orientation&#xD;
      group (PD participants that received swallowing orientations).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Experimental group (EG) (chin-down posture maneuver group): patients in received an&#xD;
           intervention program consisting of four weekly individual sessions of 30 minutes. In&#xD;
           these sessions, it was performed the training of Chin-down postural maneuver with saliva&#xD;
           and water. The participants were trained to perform the maneuver twice a day, swallowing&#xD;
           saliva, and during meals, throughout the week, at home. The participants received a&#xD;
           form, so they recorded the number of times they performed the maneuver at home. It&#xD;
           allowed the control of adherence, being reinforced at each session the importance of&#xD;
           adherence to treatment. Besides, the subjects received instructions regarding feeding.&#xD;
           All the instructions, as well as the explanation about the maneuver, were submitted to&#xD;
           the patients through a written document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control group (CG) (PD individuals without any intervention): The participants of this&#xD;
           group underwent evaluation of swallowing, and the same assessment was repeated after&#xD;
           four weeks, without any intervention during that period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Orientations group (OG): the individuals participated in an intervention program which&#xD;
           consisted of four individual sessions a week, with 30 minutes. In these sessions, the&#xD;
           instructions about feeding were performed. The individuals received all the instructions&#xD;
           on a written document. In the sessions, it was verified doubts about the guidelines and&#xD;
           treatment adherence. In this group, it was not applied the Chin-down postural maneuver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EG and OG interventions were used by the same researcher, previously trained. After the&#xD;
      end of the research, it was offered to the CG and OG individuals the same swallowing therapy&#xD;
      performed to the GE.&#xD;
