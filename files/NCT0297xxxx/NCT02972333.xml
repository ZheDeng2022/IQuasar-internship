      Patients with confirmed EGFR T790M positive NSCLC who have received prior therapy with an&#xD;
      EGFR-TKI and concurrent with brain metastasis will be enrolled into the study. All eligible&#xD;
      patients will have access to AZD9291 regimen through the ASTRIS study as long as they&#xD;
