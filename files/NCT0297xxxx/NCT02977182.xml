      Injuries to the face caused by traumatic events such as motor vehicle collisions, assault,&#xD;
      and falls can result in facial trauma, which can result in swelling and disfiguration that&#xD;
      impairs the important functions of the face, sometimes to a life threatening degree. These&#xD;
      injures and the resultant swelling can also precipitate psychological and social&#xD;
      consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymphedema is an abnormal amount of fluid that causes swelling, usually in the arms or legs.&#xD;
      The most common presentation of lymphedema is in the upper extremities due to breast cancer&#xD;
      treatment (Maclellean RA et al). As such, standards of care for management of lymphedema are&#xD;
      primarily derived from the cancer research literature and involve the extremities (Moffatt&#xD;
      CJ. 2003 QJM). The current gold standard treatment for patients with extremity lymphedema is&#xD;
      complete decongestive therapy (CDT) (Zuther 2013). CDT is a multimodal therapy consisting of&#xD;
      four components: manual lymph drainage, compression wrapping, exercise, and skin care (Zuther&#xD;
      2013).These same therapeutic techniques of CDT have been employed at Our Lady of the Lake&#xD;
      Regional Medical Center (OLOLRMC) and adapted to treat patients with facial trauma with&#xD;
      anecdotally good results primarily related to cosmesis. To the best of our knowledge, no&#xD;
      clinical studies examining the effect of lymphedema treatment in the management of blunt&#xD;
      facial trauma currently exist.. Beyond the consideration of cosmesis, we also seek to&#xD;
      determine if this intervention improves clinical outcomes such as time to swallowing and&#xD;
      reduced time utilizing mechanical ventilation. This study will prospectively evaluate the use&#xD;
      of complete decongestive therapy to test the hypothesis that this intervention results in&#xD;
      improved clinical outcomes in patients with blunt facial trauma.&#xD;

      Introduction The face is an anatomically complex structure, consisting of skin, muscles for&#xD;
      both fine and gross motor functions, a complex bony structure, and vital sensory organs.&#xD;
      These structures allow one to eat, breathe, see, hear, and speak. Injuries to the face caused&#xD;
      by traumatic events such as motor vehicle collisions, assault, and falls can result in facial&#xD;
      trauma, which can result in swelling and disfiguration that impairs the important functions&#xD;
      of the face, sometimes to a life threatening degree. These injures and the resultant swelling&#xD;
      can also precipitate psychological and social consequences.1-3 Lymphedema is an abnormal&#xD;
      amount of fluid that causes swelling, usually in the arms or legs. Though lymphedema can&#xD;
      occur as a result of trauma, it is most commonly associated with side effects of certain&#xD;
      cancer-related treatments such as radiation therapy and lymph node removal. The most common&#xD;
      presentation of lymphedema is in the upper extremities due to breast cancer treatment.4 As&#xD;
      such, standards of care for management of lymphedema are primarily derived from the cancer&#xD;
      research literature and involve the extremities.5 The current gold standard treatment for&#xD;
      patients with extremity lymphedema is complete decongestive therapy (CDT).6 CDT is a&#xD;
      multimodal therapy consisting of four components: manual lymph drainage, compression&#xD;
      wrapping, exercise, and skin care.6 Manual lymph drainage (MLD) is a delicate form of massage&#xD;
      designed to improve tissue and cellular health by facilitating fluid removal from edematous&#xD;
      areas. Compression wrapping utilizes compression garments or short stretch compression&#xD;
      bandages and is primarily used in the acute (or intensive) phase of CDT as a means to&#xD;
      reinstate sufficient resistance to skin tissues whose elastic fibers are damaged by&#xD;
      lymphedema. Exercise, especially when combined with compression, improves removal of fluid&#xD;
      from the affected area. Finally, skin care treatments keep skin clean and moisturized to&#xD;
      reduce infections that can occur with lymphedema.6 These same therapeutic techniques of CDT&#xD;
      have been employed at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center (OLOLRMC) and adapted to&#xD;
      treat facial edema in patients with facial trauma with anecdotally good results in terms of&#xD;
      cosmesis. To the best of our knowledge, no clinical studies examining the effect of&#xD;
      lymphedema treatment in the management of blunt facial trauma currently exist. Beyond the&#xD;
      consideration of cosmesis, we also seek to determine if this intervention improves clinical&#xD;
      outcomes such as time to swallowing and reduced time utilizing mechanical ventilation. This&#xD;
      study will prospectively evaluate the use of complete decongestive therapy to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that this intervention results in improved clinical outcomes in patients with&#xD;
      blunt facial trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims Specific Aim I: To determine whether complete decongestive therapy can&#xD;
      significantly reduce facial lymphedema as measured by a previously established facial&#xD;
      composite scoring protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim II: To determine whether complete decongestive therapy can improve clinical&#xD;
      outcomes for patients with facial trauma Study Objective and Endpoints Study Objective The&#xD;
      primary objective of this study is to determine the effect(s), if any, of complete&#xD;
      decongestive therapy in the management of facial trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint will be the composite facial score measured on the day&#xD;
      of discharge from the Trauma Neuro Critical Care (TNCC) intensive care unit (ICU) at OLOLRMC.&#xD;
      This measurement is based on the Head &amp; Neck Lymphedema (HNL) program at MD Anderson Cancer&#xD;
      Center (MDACC) whose standard evaluation protocol includes specific point-to-point&#xD;
      measurements of the face (Smith &amp; Lewin 2010; Smith and Lewin 2014). A series of key facial&#xD;
      measurements are totaled to provide a &quot;composite facial score&quot;. Based on the clinical&#xD;
      experience at MDACC with more than 150 patients, their HNL program has developed criteria to&#xD;
      define clinically detectable improvements in external HNL. Those criteria are a drop in&#xD;
      lymphedema stage or a minimum threshold of 2% reduction in the composite measurement equating&#xD;
      to at least a 2-cm change in absolute values (Smith &amp; Lewin 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the facial and neck composite scores only provide evaluation of the extent of edema,&#xD;
      we also seek to assess patient outcomes with regards to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stage of lymphedema as defined by the MDACC HNL edema rating scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Number of mechanical ventilation days&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Narcotic pain medicine utilization&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Steroid utilization&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Pain scale scores as determined by the Visual Analog Scale or the adult non-verbal pain&#xD;
           score&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Time to swallowing&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. ICU length of stay (ICULOS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Hospital length of stay (LOS)&#xD;
