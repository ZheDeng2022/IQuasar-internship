      The present phase I trial evaluates the feasibility of a postoperative stereotactic&#xD;
      hypofractionated external beam radiation therapy delivered in patients who underwent radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy with adverse pathological features or early biochemical failure. Modern&#xD;
      computer-driven technology enables the implementation of ultra-high hypofractionated&#xD;
      Image-Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT) safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients for this study are those with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with radical prostatectomy (any type of radical&#xD;
           prostatectomy is permitted including retropubic, perineal, laparoscopic or robotically&#xD;
           assisted; there is no time limit for the date of radical prostatectomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pathologic (p)T3 disease, positive margin(s), Gleason score 8-10, or seminal vesicle&#xD;
           involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Undetectable post-radical prostatectomy PSA that becomes detectable and then increases&#xD;
           on 2 subsequent measurements (PSA of &gt; 0.1 - ≤ 2.0 ng/mL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Life expectancy: 10 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status of 0 -1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No distant metastases, based on the following workup within 60 days prior to&#xD;
           registration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PSMA/Choline Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to exclude systemic disease in patients&#xD;
           with biochemical recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients can be on androgen deprivation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a study-specific informed consent prior to&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the study will undergo image-guided, volumetric intensity-modulated arc&#xD;
      radiotherapy (IGRT-VMAT) with state-of-the-art treatment-planning and quality assurance&#xD;
      procedures with emphasis on normal tissue sparing and delivery accuracy via the use of&#xD;
      devices that ensure stability and beam location reproducibility.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The present study evaluates the feasibility of postoperative stereotactic hypofractionated&#xD;
      external beam radiation therapy delivered in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy&#xD;
      with adverse pathological features or early biochemical failure. Regardless the two settings&#xD;
      (adjuvant or salvage), external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer is usually a&#xD;
      protracted course, since a total dose of 66 Gy to 70 Gy is needed to be effective. At the&#xD;
      typical rate of 1.8 Gy to 2.0 Gy per treatment, it takes approximately 35 treatments over the&#xD;
      course of 7 weeks to complete, which is very costly and extremely time consuming. On the&#xD;
      other hand, the α/β ratio for prostate cancer has estimated to be as low as 1.5 Gy,&#xD;
      significantly lower than the 3 Gy value estimated for late complications.Therefore, the&#xD;
      delivery of the same equivalent total dose at 2 Gy/fraction (normalized total dose) to the&#xD;
      prostate using a hypofractionation regimen, a part from the practical benefits of reducing&#xD;
      the treatment cost and number of sessions for patients to radiotherapy departments, should&#xD;
      have a sparing effect on early responding normal tissues through the reduction in the total&#xD;
      dose delivered, as well as a reduction in the incidence of late complications. Trials&#xD;
      investigating clinical and toxicity outcomes of moderate hypofractionation schedules in the&#xD;
      curative setting have reached sufficient follow-up to show similar efficacy and toxicity to&#xD;
      conventionally fractionated regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic body radiation therapy, or SBRT, is on the shortest end of the hypofractionation&#xD;
      spectrum. It is accomplished in a five treatments. With its pinpoint accuracy, many&#xD;
      Institutions currently use it for primary treatment at doses up to 9 Gy per treatment,&#xD;
      leading to excellent outcomes at least at early time points.Patients enrolled in the study&#xD;
      will undergo image-guided, volumetric intensity-modulated arc radiotherapy (IGRT-VMAT) with&#xD;
      state-of-the-art treatment-planning and quality assurance procedures with emphasis on normal&#xD;
      tissue sparing and delivery accuracy via the use of devices that ensure stability and beam&#xD;
      location reproducibility.A rectal balloon with air filling will be used for anatomical&#xD;
      reproducibility, while a urethral catheter loaded with beacon transponders will be used to&#xD;
      ensure set-up reproducibility and online target tracking. Previously untreated patients who&#xD;
      underwent radical prostatectomy with adverse pathologic findings will be enrolled in a phase&#xD;
      I study, consisting of 31 Gy (5 fractions of 6.2 Gy), respectively, delivered over a 1-week&#xD;
      period at 5 fractions per week. This dosage corresponds to 68.2 Gy (for an α/βratio estimate&#xD;
      of 1.5 Gy), compared to 52.7 Gy (for an α/β estimate of 4 Gy) in a conventional schedule. In&#xD;
      those who developed early biochemical failure the radiation schedule will consists in 32.5 Gy&#xD;
      (5 fractions of 6.5 Gy), respectively, delivered over a 1-week period at 5 fractions per&#xD;
      week. This dosage corresponds to 74.3 Gy (for an α/β ratio estimate of 1.5 Gy), compared to&#xD;
      56.9 Gy (for an α/β estimate of 4 Gy) in a conventional schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed at one month post-treatment and every 3 months for up to 12 months&#xD;
      (+/- 4 weeks) and every 6 months thereafter. Acute and chronic toxicity evaluations will&#xD;
      focus, though not exclusively, on urinary, rectal and sexual functions and will be assessed&#xD;
      through validated EPIC questionnaires. Serum PSA values will be drawn on the same schedule as&#xD;
      clinical follow-up. The study will be continuously monitored for a minimum of 5 years. In the&#xD;
      event unexpected severe (grade ≥3) toxicities are observed in any one of the treatment&#xD;
      regimens, the trial will be terminated according to the standard stopping rules: &gt;3/first 10,&#xD;
      and &gt;5/first 25 patients.&#xD;
