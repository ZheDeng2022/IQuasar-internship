      Retrospective multicenter study aimed to evaluate radiation exposure associated with&#xD;
      different interventional procedures involving interventional cardiologists, interventional&#xD;
      radiologists and electrophysiologists.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use fluoroscopically guided interventional procedures is progressively increasing over&#xD;
      the past 20 years.Some previous reports have shown that the radiation dose absorbed by&#xD;
      interventional cardiologists is the greatest registered by any medical staff exposed to&#xD;
      X-rays. However in recent years new procedures have been introduced and validated in the&#xD;
      setting of interventional cardiology and radiology and there is wide variation in patient&#xD;
      dose among different procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation issue is an important issue for patients and operators due to the acute&#xD;
      deterministic effects and most important for the long term stochastic risk of cancer&#xD;
      induction: however this problem is often under-evaluated. Even if the stochastic risk is an&#xD;
      all-or-none phenomenon for any individual cell, the greater the radiation exposure, the more&#xD;
      cells are injured. Moreover non cancerous effects are possible such as cataract formation in&#xD;
      the eye and the probability increases with increasing dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation dose can be expressed in different ways: the Air Kerma is the amount of energy&#xD;
      absorbed in a given mass of air, whereas the Dose Area Product (DAP) is the absorbed dose of&#xD;
      radiation across a given surface area. Generally DAP measurements are more accurate than&#xD;
      using Air Kerma measurements for the estimation of patient radiation dose as DAP allows for&#xD;
      variations in field size. DAP consents a good estimation of the dose to the irradiated tissue&#xD;
      and is an indicator for patient cancer risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of our study is to evaluate the radiation dose exposure during different fluoroscopically&#xD;
      guided interventional procedures comparing different specialties (electrophysiology,&#xD;
      interventional radiology, interventional cardiology).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods From January 2013 to December 2015 all diagnostic or interventional procedures&#xD;
      performed by interventional operators will be included in this multicenter study without&#xD;
      exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of data will be retrospective in a dedicated database. Radiation exposure will be&#xD;
      assessed measuring the DAP and fluoroscopy times for each procedure. Moreover for each&#xD;
      procedure all the centers are requested to give information about operator, patient and&#xD;
      procedure details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End point of the study The primary end-point of the study is the comparison of DAP dose among&#xD;
      interventional cardiologist, electrophysiologist and interventional radiologist procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end-point of the study is to compare fluoroscopy times among different procedures.&#xD;
