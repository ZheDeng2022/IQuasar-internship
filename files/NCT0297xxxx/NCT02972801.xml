  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Testicular tissue cryopreservation is an experimental procedure where a young boy's&#xD;
      testicular tissue is retrieved and frozen. This technique is reserved for young male patients&#xD;
      who are not yet producing mature sperm, with the ultimate goal that their tissue may be used&#xD;
      in the future to restore fertility when experimental techniques emerge from the research&#xD;
      pipeline.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fertility status has an important impact on the post-treatment quality of life for cancer&#xD;
      survivors and other patients that receive gonadotoxic therapies (e.g., prior to bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation). Semen cryopreservation is an established fertility preserving therapy, but&#xD;
      is not accessible or appropriate for all men. Currently there are no therapies to preserve&#xD;
      the future fertility of preadolescent boys. However, new reproductive therapies are under&#xD;
      development and may one day offer &quot;fertile hope&quot; to those survivors that do not currently&#xD;
      have access to fertility preserving therapies. Clinical management of fertility threatening&#xD;
      diseases and treatments must have foresight of the gonadotoxic side effects and the potential&#xD;
      for infertility. When no established fertility sparing options are available, it is&#xD;
      reasonable to offer harvesting and cryopreservation of testicular tissue as a possible means&#xD;
      of fertility preservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will harvest testicular tissue from eligible patients. Separate portions of the&#xD;
      harvested tissue and/or cells will be 1) designated for research and 2) cryopreserved and&#xD;
      maintained for participating patients as a resource for future elective procedures to attempt&#xD;
      fertility restoration.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be male at any age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be scheduled to undergo surgery, chemotherapy, drug treatment and/or radiation for the&#xD;
             treatment or prevention of a medical condition or malignancy with risk of causing&#xD;
             permanent and complete loss of subsequent testicular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Or, have a medical condition or malignancy that requires removal of all or part of one&#xD;
             or both testicles.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have newly diagnosed or recurrent disease. Those who were not enrolled at the time of&#xD;
             initial diagnosis (i.e., patients with recurrent disease) are eligible if they have&#xD;
             not previously received therapy that is viewed as likely to result in complete and&#xD;
             permanent loss of testicular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have two testicles if undergoing elective removal of all or part of a testicle for&#xD;
             fertility preservation only. Note: removal of both testicles will limit fertility&#xD;
             preservation options.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sign an approved informed consent and authorization permitting the release of personal&#xD;
             health information. The patient and/or the patient's legally authorized guardian must&#xD;
             acknowledge in writing that consent for specimen collection has been obtained, in&#xD;
             accordance with institutional policies approved by the U.S. Department of Health and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consent for serum screening tests for infectious diseases [HIV-1, HIV-2, Hepatitis B,&#xD;
             Hepatitis C], to be performed at the time of testicular tissue harvesting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undergo a full history and physical examination and obtain standard pre-operative&#xD;
             clearance (based on the most recent ACC/AHA Guideline for Perioperative Cardiovascular&#xD;
             Evaluation for Noncardiac Surgery) as determined by their primary surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participating in long term follow-up is a requirement of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with psychological, psychiatric, or other conditions which prevent giving&#xD;
             fully informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with an underlying medical condition that significantly increases their risk&#xD;
             of complications from anesthesia and surgery.&#xD;
