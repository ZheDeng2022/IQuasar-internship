  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a nonrandomized, open-label, single group assignment, safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) study to determine the MTD and optimal dosing regimen of Oraxol in&#xD;
      combination with ramucirumab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a sequential-group, dose escalation trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose of&#xD;
      oral Oraxol in combination with intravenous ramucirumab. After a screening period of up to 28&#xD;
      days subjects will be enrolled into the treatment phase of the study. Each cycle of therapy&#xD;
      will last 4 weeks. Subjects may continue in the study until they experience disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Three to six subjects will be enrolled at each dose&#xD;
      level. Once the tolerability of a dose level has been determined, an additional 3-6 subjects&#xD;
      may be enrolled at a higher dose level, to determine the maximum tolerated dose. Safety will&#xD;
      be monitored through recording of adverse events, serious adverse events, monitoring of&#xD;
      laboratory tests including hematology, blood chemistry, urinalyses, physical examinations and&#xD;
      electrocardiograms. Subjects will undergo radiographic assessments for tumor response at&#xD;
      specified time points. Blood samples will also be obtained in the first cycle of therapy at&#xD;
      multiple time points for determination of the amount of paclitaxel and metabolites and&#xD;
      HM30181 in the circulation. After the treatment period, there will be a follow-up period&#xD;
      during which the subject or family may be contacted every three months for follow-up.&#xD;
