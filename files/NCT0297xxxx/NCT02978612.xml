    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, randomized study where the aim of the study is to investigate the&#xD;
      tolerance of adjuvant chemotherapy, measured by functional decline, after surgery for colon&#xD;
      cancer stage III in elderly patients. Secondary aims are disease-free survival, toxicity,&#xD;
      late functional outcome, quality of life, to establish a geriatric assessment for selection&#xD;
      of patients, and to examine the prognostic value of gene signature tests / biomarkers for&#xD;
      stage III colon cancer.&#xD;

      Patients ≥ 75 years who have undergone surgery for colon cancer stage III, are eligible for&#xD;
      inclusion in the study. Non-eligibility includes patients with obvious impaired cognitive or&#xD;
      physical function or patients living in nursing homes. After signing informed consent, the&#xD;
      patients first undergo geriatric assessment. Patients that are classified as having fit or&#xD;
      intermediate function, and with no significant cardiovascular disease, are randomized with a&#xD;
      2:1 randomization process to either chemotherapy (Arm A: Capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 bid day 1-14&#xD;
      q3 weeks, 8 cycles) or no chemotherapy (Arm B: observation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine the tolerability of chemotherapy in elderly (&gt; 75&#xD;
      years) patients operated on for colon cancer stage III. There is little evidence of benefit&#xD;
      and tolerability of this therapy in the elderly; it is recommended individual consideration&#xD;
      in elderly. In the study, a comprehensive geriatric a comprehensive geriatric assessment is&#xD;
      performed first, to exclude frail patients or patients with serious comorbidities such as&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Fit or intermediate patients will then be randomized so that 2/3 will&#xD;
      receive chemotherapy with capecitabine tablets for 6 months, and 1/3 will not receive&#xD;
      chemotherapy. A new geriatric assessment is performed after 6 and 12 months. The main&#xD;
      objective of the study is to examine whether chemotherapy leads to significant loss of&#xD;
      function, but secondary aims include survival, quality of life, and prognostic effect of&#xD;
      biomarkers. The study may provide useful information on selection of patients who tolerate&#xD;
      and benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
