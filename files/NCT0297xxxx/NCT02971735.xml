      New designs of 6-year undergraduate medical education (UME) in Taiwan mainly include (1)&#xD;
      integral curricula of body organ system, (2) multiple methods of clinical teaching and&#xD;
      assessment, and (3) generalism in UME. Accompany with decreasing educational hours in the&#xD;
      classrooms and hospital, essential but minor components of primary healthcare such as&#xD;
      ophthalmology and otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (ORL-HNS) is disproportionately&#xD;
      under-represented in UME. Novel medical education stresses on enabling self-directory&#xD;
      learning and increasing learning hours outside the classrooms. Accordingly, we hypothesize&#xD;
      that innovations in educational technology can enhance the learning outcomes of ORL-HNS. This&#xD;
      study is aimed to determine whether mobile technology in e-learning (M-TEL) is an effective&#xD;
      tool for the instruction of ORL-HNS and to compare effects of different cognitive styles on&#xD;
      learning outcomes of M-TEL with various modules of medical education. This is a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial. We will recruit 60 UME students without previous training in ORL-HNS to&#xD;
      undergo the Group Embedded Figures Test to determine their cognitive styles such as field&#xD;
      dependence or field-independence. After blinded randomization, students are instructed on two&#xD;
      modules of emergent ORL-HNS disorders, using either a standard e-learning of text-figure&#xD;
      Power Point show or an interactive multimedia module. Subjects are evaluated on emergent&#xD;
      ORL-HNS disorders using text-based assessment and multimedia assessment take place prior to&#xD;
      and following instruction. After 7 days later, they will be assessed using global&#xD;
      satisfaction score and AttrakDiff2 questionnaire. We anticipate that this study can confirm&#xD;
      M-TEL can enhance the efficiency of the instruction of ORL-HNS and understand differences in&#xD;
      learning outcomes of M-TEL with various modules of medical education between field dependence&#xD;
      and filed independence using this platform.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      New designs of 6-year undergraduate medical education (UME) mainly include (1) integral&#xD;
      curricula of body organ system, (2) multiple methods of clinical teaching and assessment, and&#xD;
      (3) generalism in UME. UME is meant to enable graduates to become undifferentiated general&#xD;
      physicians. Accompany with decreasing educational hours in the classrooms and hospital,&#xD;
      essential but minor components of primary healthcare such as ophthalmology and&#xD;
      otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (ORL-HNS) is disproportionately under-represented in&#xD;
      UME. In Canada, substantial downstream effects on managing ORL-HNS problems have been noted&#xD;
      in family medicine residents. In order to improve learning insufficiency and enhance clinical&#xD;
      competency without increasing extra-hours in the classrooms and hospitals, novel medical&#xD;
      education stresses on enabling self-directory learning and increasing learning hours outside&#xD;
      the classrooms. Accordingly, we hypothesize that innovations in educational technology can&#xD;
      enhance the learning outcomes of ORL-HNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purposes: This study is aimed to determine whether mobile technology in e-learning (M-TEL) is&#xD;
      an effective tool for the instruction of ORL-HNS and to compare effects of different&#xD;
      cognitive styles on learning outcomes of M-TEL with various modules of medical education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled trial. Firstly, we have been setup a e-learning platform of&#xD;
      the Top 10 emergent ORL-HNS disorders with translating into an application (APP) function&#xD;
      that can execute in mobile devices. Secondly, we will recruit 60 UME students without&#xD;
      previous training in ORL-HNS to undergo the Group Embedded Figures Test to determine their&#xD;
      cognitive styles such as field dependence or field-independence. After blinded randomization,&#xD;
      students are instructed on two modules of emergent ORL-HNS disorders, using either a standard&#xD;
      e-learning of text-figure Power Point show or an interactive multimedia module. Subjects are&#xD;
      evaluated on emergent ORL-HNS disorders using a text-based assessment and a multimedia&#xD;
      assessment take place prior to and following instruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipating Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study can (1) establish a M-TEL of ORL-HNS that can deliver an innovatively mobile&#xD;
      e-learning to supplement the deficiency of the classroom hours, (2) confirm M-TEL can enhance&#xD;
      the efficiency of the instruction of ORL-HNS, and (3) understand differences in learning&#xD;
      outcomes of M-TEL with various modules of medical education between field dependence and&#xD;
      filed independence using this platform.&#xD;

AttrakDiff2 is developed as a tool by Hassenzahl's research group to be able to quantify attractive, identifiable, stimulating, and pragmatic qualities. The tool consists of 28 seven-step items whose poles are opposite adjectives (e.g. &quot;confusing - clear&quot;, &quot;unusual - ordinary&quot;, &quot;good - bad&quot;). Each set of adjective items is ordered into a scale of intensity. Each of the mean values of an item group creates a scale value for pragmatic quality (PQ), hedonic stimulation (HQ-S), hedonic identification (HQ-I), and attractiveness (ATT) (range: -3-3).</description>

          <description>The cognitive style of the participants was assessed using the 25-item GEFT after enrollment. On the basis of the number of correct answers given by the participants, the GEFT scores ranged from 0 (the most field-dependent [FD]) to 18 (the most field-independent [FI]). We stratified the students into two subgroups: &quot;classical FD&quot; (GEFT score ≤12) and &quot;classical FI&quot; (GEFT score &gt;12).</description>

        <title>AttrakDiff2 Questionnaire: Pragmatic Quality Score</title>
        <description>For more delicately evaluate the acceptance of technical innovations, we will assess &quot;user experience&quot; using the AttrakDiff2. AttrakDiff2 is developed as a tool by Hassenzahl's research group to be able to quantify attractive, identifiable, stimulating, and pragmatic qualities. The tool consists of 28 seven-step items whose poles are opposite adjectives (e.g. &quot;confusing - clear&quot;, &quot;unusual - ordinary&quot;, &quot;good - bad&quot;). Each set of adjective items is ordered into a scale of intensity. Each of the mean values of an item group creates a scale value for pragmatic quality (PQ), hedonic stimulation (HQ-S), hedonic identification (HQ-I), and attractiveness (ATT) (range: -3-3).</description>

        <title>AttrakDiff2 Questionnaire: Hedonic Stimulation</title>
        <description>For more delicately evaluate the acceptance of technical innovations, we will assess &quot;user experience&quot; using the AttrakDiff2. AttrakDiff2 is developed as a tool by Hassenzahl's research group to be able to quantify attractive, identifiable, stimulating, and pragmatic qualities. The tool consists of 28 seven-step items whose poles are opposite adjectives (e.g. &quot;confusing - clear&quot;, &quot;unusual - ordinary&quot;, &quot;good - bad&quot;). Each set of adjective items is ordered into a scale of intensity. Each of the mean values of an item group creates a scale value for pragmatic quality (PQ), hedonic stimulation (HQ-S), hedonic identification (HQ-I), and attractiveness (ATT) (range: -3-3).</description>
