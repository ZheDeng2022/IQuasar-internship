    <textblock>
      This is a single arm Phase II study for patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of the head and neck, who are previously treated with a platinum based regimen or&#xD;
      with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      combination of cetuximab and afatinib.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a multicenter, single-arm, open-label Phase II trial. Patients with&#xD;
      advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, who are previously treated with a&#xD;
      platinum based regimen or with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy or both, will be eligible&#xD;
      for participation on the study. After a baseline evaluation and biopsy (where feasible), they&#xD;
      will be treated with weekly/bi-weekly intravenous cetuximab and daily oral afatinib. Biopsy&#xD;
      will be repeated where feasible after 4 weeks (window of +1 week) on therapy and again at&#xD;
      disease progression or end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will continue until disease progression or development of Grade 3 or higher drug&#xD;
      related toxicities that fail to resolve to Grade 2 despite appropriate supportive care.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck that is&#xD;
             metastatic, recurrent or locally advanced and not treatable with curative intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous treatment with a platinum-based regimen or immune checkpoint inhibitor or&#xD;
             both.2-week washout period prior to treatment start will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have experienced progression of disease within 6 months following&#xD;
