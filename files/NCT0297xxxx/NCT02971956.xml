  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a targeted therapy as a possible treatment for advanced&#xD;
      esophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study intervention involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Pembrolizumab&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Pembrolizumab for the&#xD;
      participant specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab, also known as KEYTRUDA or MK-3475, is approved in the USA and several other&#xD;
      countries to treat other types of diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this research study is to&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Evaluate the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab in participants with advanced esophageal&#xD;
      cancer that have not responded to standard treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed, measurable, unresectable adenocarcinoma or squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinoma of the esophagus. For the purposes of this study, undifferentiated&#xD;
             carcinomas or adenosquamous carcinomas will be categorized as adenocarcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The primary tumor must originate in the esophagus. Tumors that involve the GE junction&#xD;
             must meet Sievert Type 1 criteria: &quot;Adenocarcinoma of the distal oesophagus which&#xD;
             usually arises from an area with specialized intestinal metaplasia of the oesophagus&#xD;
             (i.e. Barrett's oesophagus) and which may infiltrate the oesophagogastric junction&#xD;
             from above.&quot; For the purposes of this protocol, this will be interpreted as: greater&#xD;
             than 50% of the tumor must be above the GE junction or, alternatively, the tumor must&#xD;
             involve the GE junction and arise in the setting of biopsy-documented Barrett's&#xD;
             esophagus (specialized intestinal metaplasia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have received at least one prior therapy for unresectable disease.&#xD;
             Patients with recurrence within 6 months of completion of neoadjuvant or adjuvant&#xD;
             therapy may be considered as having received one prior therapy for unresectable&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be â‰¥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have measurable disease based on irRECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained biopsy of a tumor lesion, most&#xD;
             commonly an EGD biopsy from the esophagus. Newly-obtained is defined as a specimen&#xD;
             obtained up to 6 weeks (42 days) prior to initiation of treatment on Day 1. Subjects&#xD;
             for whom newly-obtained samples cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject&#xD;
             safety concern) may submit an archived specimen only upon agreement from the Sponsor.&#xD;
             Please note, patients may not initiate therapy until the biopsy specimen is received&#xD;
             at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The first 15 patients with adenocarcinoma will be offered an optional tumor biopsy&#xD;
             (typically EGD biopsy) at 8 weeks. Starting with adenocarcinoma patient #16, patients&#xD;
             must have an accessible tumor and must agree to tumor biopsy at 8 weeks; this will&#xD;
             continue to be mandatory until a total of 20 patients have undergone biopsy at 8&#xD;
             weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale (Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subject of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy&#xD;
             within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine&#xD;
             test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be&#xD;
             required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use 2 methods of birth&#xD;
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course&#xD;
             of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication (Reference&#xD;
             Section 6.3.2). Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been&#xD;
             surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects must agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the&#xD;
             first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.&#xD;

             performed within 10 days of treatment initiation.&#xD;

&#xD;
             -Hepatic&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum total bilirubin â‰¤ 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin â‰¤ ULN for subjects with total&#xD;
