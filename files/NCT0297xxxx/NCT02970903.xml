  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The VitalPAD is a unified, portable and intelligent device that integrates information from&#xD;
      multiple patient monitors, mechanical ventilators, infusion pumps and clinical information&#xD;
      systems on a mobile platform. It will allow nurses, respiratory therapists and physicians to&#xD;
      continuously monitor and coordinate care of critically ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a participatory design process to guide the design of an integrated&#xD;
      mobile device, followed by an evaluation of the proposed device in a simulated ICU setting.&#xD;

      1. Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
           Critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) need constant monitoring by&#xD;
           nurses, respiratory therapists, and physicians. To make decisions and plan therapies,&#xD;
           these clinicians must observe and reconcile a vast array of information originating from&#xD;
           devices located at the bedsides of multiple patients. Their efforts are hindered by:&#xD;
           information being physically limited to the bedside; information overload from the&#xD;
           number of devices and separate displays; lack of integration and interaction between&#xD;
           devices; displays which fail to present information in a way that is easy to understand;&#xD;
           alarm fatigue; lacking historical data or clinical context to support clinical decision&#xD;
           making; difficulty locating a team member for consultation or to provide an extra pair&#xD;
           of hands&#xD;
&#xD;
           This project aims to integrate information from multiple monitoring and therapy devices&#xD;
           (multi-parameter monitor, infusion pumps, mechanical ventilator) onto one application,&#xD;
           the VitalPAD, hosted on a mobile device (tablet or smartphone). The VitalPAD will&#xD;
           process information from multiple bedside monitors in an intelligent decision-support&#xD;
           system, and provide an intuitive display of vital signs information, alerts and&#xD;
           reminders to ICU healthcare team members.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assigning priority of care and early detection of deterioration of critically ill&#xD;
           patients represents an enormous source of preventable morbidity, mortality and cost.&#xD;
           Enhanced efficiency in patient monitoring can help reduce the time to detection of&#xD;
           critical conditions and improve priority assignment, contributing to enhanced patient&#xD;
           safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The goal of this project is to demonstrate that a mobile application (VitalPAD) can&#xD;
           provide dynamic, meaningful, integrated information to intensive care clinicians in&#xD;
           real-time. (also see above)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis / Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
           Part I - Participatory Design. The participatory design process, as proposed by&#xD;
           Holtzblatt, for system development is a mixed-method approach. The aim is to develop a&#xD;
           prototype that is easy to use, supports decision making, improves awareness of the&#xD;
           patient's condition by ICU healthcare team members, and reduces mental workload.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Part II - Simulation Experiment. The hypothesis is that in simulated ICU scenarios,&#xD;
           critical care physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists will prioritize the care of&#xD;
           critically ill patients more more rapidly and more accurately with the use of VitalPAD&#xD;
           than without it. Specifically, using VitalPAD to triage 5 patients will be 30 seconds&#xD;
           faster (moderate effect) than performing the same task with the control display.&#xD;
           Expected secondary outcomes are a decrease in mental workload as well as an increase in&#xD;
           situational awareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Justification This research represents a significant opportunity to enhance patient&#xD;
           safety in ICUs in Canada and elsewhere by directly advancing the conceptual, theoretical&#xD;
           and clinical knowledge required to optimize the use of information in the ICU. It will&#xD;
           leverage advances in mobile computing to provide real time support to healthcare&#xD;
           providers on the move and reduce cognitive demands.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This integrated system aims to enhance performance of the clinicians in real-time,&#xD;
           optimize therapeutic interventions, reduce adverse outcomes and ultimately save lives.&#xD;
           The aim is to provide healthcare team members with a one-stop solution for their patient&#xD;
           monitoring needs, which will improve the way work is done in the ICU and will decrease&#xD;
           worker stress, especially for nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Research Design Part I - Participatory design: an inter-professional team of nurses,&#xD;
           physicians, designers, engineers, and human factors experts will follow a user-centered&#xD;
           design process to refine the system requirements, and obtain feedback during the rapid&#xD;
           prototyping phase of prototype development.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In Part II - Simulation Experiment: the prototype device will be evaluated in a&#xD;
           simulated ICU setting using a triaging task. Answer accuracy and time taken to complete&#xD;
           task will be measured. Participants will complete questionnaires (NASA-TLX workload&#xD;
           assessment and a PSSUQ usability evaluation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Statistical Analysis Part I - Participatory design: qualitative methods will be used to&#xD;
           analyze and summarize data. Specific themes will be identified and similar themes&#xD;
           merged. Specific obstacles to usability, design preferences, and opportunities for&#xD;
           information integration will be collated and summarized. In the usability experiment,&#xD;
           error rates and task completion times will be used to detail opportunities for&#xD;
           additional usability improvements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II - Simulation Experiment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of Response Time. Mixed linear effect modeling will be used to explore the&#xD;
           effects of display, triaging set, and presentation order, and their interactions.&#xD;
           Differences between groups (increase or decrease in time taken to triage) will be&#xD;
           expressed using the nonparametric Hodges-Lehmann estimator and its 95% confidence limit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of Answer Accuracy. As a secondary outcome, the number of correct responses for&#xD;
           each participant will be recorded. The two proportions will be compared using Fisher's&#xD;
           exact test. False positive and false negative detection rates will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of Workload Scores. The NASA-TLX scores will be analyzed using two approaches:&#xD;
           a Friedman's ANOVA, a non-parametric version of the ANOVA, of each of the 6 individual&#xD;
           sub-scores to test for individual effects; and an analysis of the weighted composite&#xD;
           score using the same statistical test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of Usability Questionnaire. The PSSUQ results will be tabulated and specific&#xD;
           problematic usability issues identified. Friedman's ANOVA will be used to test for&#xD;
           individual effects. Feedback provided by the subjects will be screened for improvement&#xD;
           of both user interface and decision support system rules.&#xD;
