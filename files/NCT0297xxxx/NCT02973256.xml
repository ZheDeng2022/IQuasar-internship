      Meningiomas with malignant components include grade II meningiomas (GIIM, the most common&#xD;
      ones) and grade III meningiomas (GIIIM). They represent 5-35% of all meningiomas.&#xD;
      Histological diagnosis of GIIM criteria were changed in 2007 and might be viewed by some as&#xD;
      being quite subjective. &quot;Standards of care&quot; and consensus do not exist for GIIM, particularly&#xD;
      in regards to performing, or not, radiotherapy after surgery. One other limitation in the&#xD;
      literature is lack of data on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Clinical trials for&#xD;
      GIIM are very difficult to conduct. No results have been made available. Here, we propose to&#xD;
      study clinical, pathological, radiological and therapeutic factors of an exhaustive&#xD;
      population of GIIM and GIIIM patients, at national level. The main objective (for GIIM) is to&#xD;
      assess the impact of postoperative radiotherapy, or the absence of postoperative&#xD;
      radiotherapy, on overall survival and on quality of life&#xD;

      Meningiomas with malignant components include grade II meningiomas (GIIM, the most common&#xD;
      ones) and grade III meningiomas (GIIIM). They represent 5-35% of all meningiomas.&#xD;
      Histological diagnosis of GIIM criteria were changed in 2007 and might be viewed by some as&#xD;
      being quite subjective. &quot;Standards of care&quot; and consensus do not exist for GIIM, particularly&#xD;
      in regards to performing, or not, radiotherapy after surgery. One other limitation in the&#xD;
      literature is lack of data on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Clinical trials for&#xD;
      GIIM are very difficult to conduct. No results have been made available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: to assess the impact of postoperative radiotherapy after GIIM surgery on&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) in a population-setting study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives (for GIIM and GIIIM):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the recurrence/progression free survival (PFS), volumetric velocity of the&#xD;
           tumor growth (VVTG) after surgery and other treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate long term HRQoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the relevance and impact of histopathological review in a population setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Looking for prognostic (clinical, radiological and biological) factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proposing therapeutic decision trees in general or for certain categories of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identifying relevant cases to conduct further studies to identify new therapeutic&#xD;
           targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perspectives for the TUCERA network to help design specific prospective projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Looking for disparities in care management, survival and HRQoL in the various regions of&#xD;
           France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the study: nationwide population-based study analysis and patterns of care/quality&#xD;
      of care study, for all cases of incident GIIM and GIIIM operated in Metropolitan France&#xD;
      during the 2007-2010 period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology used is based on a multidisciplinary national network already established by&#xD;
      the French Brain Tumor DataBase (FBTDB), with the active participation of societies involved&#xD;
      in the French neuro-oncology and the &quot;Inter Groupe Coop√©rateur en Neuro-Oncologie&quot;, labeled&#xD;
      by the French National Cancer Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FBTDB has already identified all incident cases of GIIM (n=1046) and GIIIM (n=158)&#xD;
      operated in Metropolitan France from 2007 to 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study proposed is a retrospective study based on the medical charts of all these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, for all surviving patients not lost to follow-up, the follow-up consultations&#xD;
      will include a prospective HRQoL evaluation (cutoff date: 2019/11/30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be conducted a systematic pathological review (with eventually additional biological&#xD;
      work-up), and a study of prognostic factors (clinical, radiological, biological), treatments&#xD;
      administered, OS, PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: OS. The statistical analysis (to answer to the main question) will concern&#xD;
      all GIIM only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group: Group of GIIM with postoperative radiotherapy (n=314). Control group:&#xD;
      Group of GIIM with postoperative follow-up only (n=732). With a bilateral type I error of 5%&#xD;
      (two-sided) and a statistical power of 80% we will be able to demonstrate that postoperative&#xD;
      radiotherapy will be associated with a Hazard ratio (mortality risk) of 0.80.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints (for GIIM and GIIIM):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PFS, VVTG after surgery and other treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HRQoL will be assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30, BN20 questionnaires, Europol EQ5D, and with&#xD;
           a questionnaire on professional and social activities (HRQoL will be assessed for all&#xD;
           patients alive, every six months, since inclusion, for an 18-month period).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mapping between HRQoL questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concordance/discordance analysis between the initial histological diagnosis and the&#xD;
           diagnosis of the pathological review.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct an inventory of cryopreserved material available for translational research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define subgroups of patients, according to prognostic factors, which would benefit from&#xD;
           postoperative radiotherapy in GIIM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define subgroups of patients, according to their prognostic factors, which would benefit&#xD;
           from not having postoperative radiotherapy in GIIM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Propose personalized therapeutic attitudes according to prognostic factors (clinical,&#xD;
           radiological, and biological) in general, but also for specific categories of patients&#xD;
           such as elderly subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define subgroups of GIIM and GIIIM that will justify conducting trials in the framework&#xD;
           of the TUCERA network.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate in population settings, the relevance and impact of a systematic&#xD;
           histopathological review.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop HRQoL evaluation in population settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acquire better knowledge of prognostic factors (clinical, radiological and biological)&#xD;
           for GIIM and GIIIM, their natural history, and maybe help determine elements able to&#xD;
           differentiate GIIM that will progress to GIIIM, from those that will remain GIIM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Build a clinical-biological database to identify and/or develop new therapeutic targets&#xD;
           in GIIM and GIIIM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate potential disparities in terms of survival and HRQoL in the different French&#xD;
           regions, and if some disparities are found, look for eventual causes.&#xD;
