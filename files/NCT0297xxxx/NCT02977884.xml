  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project proposes to provide the Complete Health Improvement Program (CHIP) initially up&#xD;
      to 25 adult (non-pregnant) Ohio University employees (and/ or their adult family members)&#xD;
      with with diabetes / prediabetes, obesity / overweight, hypertension / prehypertension,&#xD;
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or dyslipidemia in an effort to improve&#xD;
      self-management and the consequences of biometric factors that can be modified by lifestyle&#xD;
      changes. The CHIP program is an educationally based, lifestyle intervention program that aims&#xD;
      to reduce healthcare cost, absenteeism, and increase employee productivity. The investigators&#xD;
      expect that participants following the programs guidelines will lower their body mass index,&#xD;
      cholesterol, reduce blood pressure and blood glucose levels, and therefore help to prevent&#xD;
      chronic disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In our Western culture, lifestyle changes focusing on diet, exercise and tobacco could&#xD;
      prevent about 40% of all cancer deaths, and 82% of cardiac deaths, in the U.S. It is&#xD;
      estimated that 71% of colon cancers, 70% of strokes, and 91% of diabetic cases could be&#xD;
      avoided by living a healthy lifestyle. These health problems add a tremendous burden to our&#xD;
      healthcare budget, and to the loss of productivity of our society. In 2007, it was estimated&#xD;
      that 2.3 trillion dollars was spent on healthcare in the U.S., $7,600 for each individual.&#xD;
      Expectations are that without dramatic change, this cost will continue to increase to&#xD;
      unsustainable levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Complete Health Improvement Program (CHIP) is a community based lifestyle medicine&#xD;
      program with proven effectiveness in addressing these problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project proposes to provide the Complete Health Improvement Program (CHIP) to adult&#xD;
      (non-pregnant) Ohio University employees (and/ or their adult family members) with with&#xD;
      diabetes / prediabetes, obesity / overweight, hypertension / prehypertension, atherosclerotic&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, or dyslipidemia in an effort to improve self-management and the&#xD;
      consequences of biometric factors that can be modified by lifestyle changes. The CHIP program&#xD;
      is an educationally based, lifestyle intervention program that aims to reduce healthcare&#xD;
      cost, absenteeism, and increase employee productivity. The investigators expect that&#xD;
      participants following the programs guidelines will lower their body mass index, cholesterol,&#xD;
      reduce blood pressure and blood glucose levels, and therefore help to prevent chronic&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ohio University Human Resources (HR) will provide research participants with scholarships to&#xD;
      attend the CHIP program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One aim of the project is to compare biometrics factors (weight, cholesterol, LDL, HDL,&#xD;
      triglycerides, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose, HgA1c) of participants before and&#xD;
      after completion of the program (program completion defined as those who attended at least 14&#xD;
      of 16 CHIP classes, or 15 of the 18 new CHIP+ classes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second aim is to compare this groups health claims (health care utilization office visits,&#xD;
      emergency room visits, hospitalizations, medication costs) with a control groups data (OU&#xD;
      employees who have diabetes / prediabetes, obesity / overweight, hypertension /&#xD;
      prehypertension, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or dyslipidemia and do not&#xD;
      participate in CHIP program).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third aim is to compare the treatment groups absenteeism due to illness data with that of&#xD;
      the control group.&#xD;

    <description>CHIP focuses on food, diet, activity, exercise, stress management, by viewing videos, cooking demonstrations, discussion, and exercise. Intervention nurtures intelligent self-care through enhanced understanding of the epidemiology, etiology, and risk factors associated with chronic lifestyle related diseases. The primary focus is the consumption of plant-based whole foods, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts. The goal was to keep dietary fat below 20% of total calories, daily intake of added sugar below 10 tsps, sodium below 2,000 mg, and cholesterol below 50 mg. High fiber food intake (&gt;35 g/day) is encouraged, and flexibility exercises, a daily walk of 30 minutes or 10,000 steps and daily use of stress management techniques.</description>
