  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will implement the validated household-level water insecurity scale developed by&#xD;
      study investigators among a cohort of postpartum women in Nyanza, Kenya and will assess a&#xD;
      range of outcomes linked to water insecurity, such as viral load, hydration status, maternal&#xD;
      depression, stress, food insecurity, and cognitive development.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop the first well-known household water insecurity scale. Currently,&#xD;
      water insecurity cannot be measured at the level of the household or individual, i.e. at the&#xD;
      endpoint of water use. Although there are myriad national, regional, community, and&#xD;
      hydrological indexes of water availability, to the investigators' knowledge, there is no way&#xD;
      of measuring water access at the household or individual levels. Without a comprehensive,&#xD;
      validated scale to measure household water insecurity, the scientific, programmatic, and&#xD;
      public health communities cannot empirically test the prevalence of household water&#xD;
      insecurity access and its potential impacts on economic, nutrition, disease, and psychosocial&#xD;
      health pathways and outcomes.&#xD;
