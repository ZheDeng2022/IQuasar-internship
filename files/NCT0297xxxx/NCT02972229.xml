      This study is a prospective, randomized, single center, controlled explorative study in the&#xD;
      parallel-group design to evaluate the difference in clinical outcomes for patients with&#xD;
      metastatic spine disease treated with a whole versus partial vertebral body contouring&#xD;
      approach. Thereby two different techniques were evaluated: whole vertebral body (WB) group&#xD;
      with 10 x 3Gy or partial vertebral body (PB) group with 10x (3-5)Gy. Prior to their enrolment&#xD;
      into the study, the patients will undergo a staging of the vertebral column in connection&#xD;
      with their radiation-planning computed tomography (CT) and MRI to measure the myelon&#xD;
      dimension. After the baseline results have been recorded, the patients will be randomized&#xD;
      into one of the two groups: PB group RT 10x (3-5) Gy (n = 30) or WB group RT 10 x 3 Gy (n =&#xD;
      30). The target parameters will be measured and recorded at baseline, at 1 to 2 weeks; and at&#xD;
      months 2 to 3, 4 to 6 and 7 to 12 after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint was the time to pain relief. Secondary endpoints were quality of life&#xD;
      (QoL), fatigue, pain, overall survival, bone survival, local control, pathological fracture,&#xD;
      pain-free internal and neurological deficit. The baseline examination shall be carried out on&#xD;
      the first day of radiotherapy prior to the start of therapy and is scheduled to comprise the&#xD;
      comprehensive recording of the sociodemographic data, the recording of the current pain&#xD;
      situation, the quality of life, and the current degree of fatigue. The follow-up examinations&#xD;
      shall take place at each follow up visit , measuring those parameters recorded at the&#xD;
      baseline examination. The further follow-up examinations shall correspond to those carried&#xD;
      out as standard after-care investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints such as fatigue and quality of life shall be recorded using validated&#xD;
      questionnaires (EORTC QLQ FA13 and EORTC QLQ BM22. All patients will also be asked to record&#xD;
      their pain history using a pain diary (documentation of medication daily during treatment,&#xD;
      once weekly after the end of treatment, VAS pain scale). Furthermore, the local control was&#xD;
      assessed by means of CT images taken prior to, three and six months after RT. The pain&#xD;
      response was documented on the VAS (range 0-10). Complete response (CR) was defined as VAS =&#xD;
      0 after three and six months, partial response (PR) as an improvement by at least two score&#xD;
      points after three and six months. Overall survival (OS) was defined as time from initial&#xD;
      diagnosis until death, bone survival as time from initial diagnosis of spinal bone metastasis&#xD;
      until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each case, the treatment plan was designed based on tumor geometry, proximity to the&#xD;
      spinal cord, and location. The planning tumor volume (PTV) was defined as equal to gross&#xD;
      tumor volume (GTV). The spinal cord, cauda equina, nerve roots, and bowel were contoured as&#xD;
      organs at risk (OARs) and critical structures. An inverse treatment planning method along&#xD;
      with a linear optimization algorithm were employed. The target volume was designated to&#xD;
      include either the GTV and the entire vertebral body (WB group) or only the GTV (PB group) at&#xD;
      each spinal level.&#xD;
