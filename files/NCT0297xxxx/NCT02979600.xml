      An oral tolerance induction (OTI) protocol is conducted at the allergy Unit of Saint Vincent&#xD;
      Hospital of Lille (France) in standard care since 2006. This protocol consists in exposing&#xD;
      patients to regularly increasing doses of allergen. This protocol induces an increase of the&#xD;
      threshold reactive dose (the minimum dose of allergen that triggered a reactive reaction) and&#xD;
      a decrease of the quantity of specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) against peanut proteins. The&#xD;
      protocol is ended when the patient reaches a threshold reactive dose of 2942mg of peanut&#xD;
      proteins, corresponding to 14 peanuts of middle size, which is the maximum dose of peanut&#xD;
      that can be found in standard product in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to study the evolution of the threshold reactive dose and of the sIgE&#xD;
      of patients that have followed the OTI protocol. All the needed data are available in the&#xD;
      medical records so the study will be conducted on retrospective data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence of food allergy is estimated at 3.5% in Europe. In particular, peanut allergy&#xD;
      prevalence in France is between 0.3% and 0.75%, when it is 1% in the US, UK and Canada.&#xD;
      Peanut allergy is a severe allergy, second behind tree nut allergy in the general population,&#xD;
      with a risk of fatal reactions. The risk is especially high for young adults. It is also a&#xD;
      long lasting condition with only 20% of natural healing that happened most of the time&#xD;
      between 6 and 8y.o. These last years, the only proposed &quot;treatment&quot; was an elimination diet.&#xD;
      However, it has been proved that it makes allergy severity worse, and sensitization and&#xD;
      reactivity increase with time. Elimination diet can also lead to the apparition of&#xD;
      avoidant/restrictive food intake disorders, and has a major impact on patient habits, causing&#xD;
      patient quality of life to decrease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the risks and limits of an elimination diet and the low natural healing rate, a&#xD;
      therapeutic alternative has been proposed with the development of peanut oral tolerance&#xD;
      induction (OTI) protocols. As sublingual immunotherapies have low efficacies and as injection&#xD;
      strategies have a high risk of severe allergic reactions, oral route is preferred. This&#xD;
      strategy needs to ensure patients an increasing tolerance to the allergen, thus limiting the&#xD;
      risks of anaphylactic shock at low doses, but also needs to ensure patient safety, with&#xD;
      controlled risks of secondary reactions at home. It can be followed by young patients, its&#xD;
      efficiency being increased. An OTI protocol is conducted at the allergy Unit of Saint Vincent&#xD;
      Hospital of Lille (France) in standard care since 2006. It consists in daily giving small&#xD;
      peanut doses to the patient, and to regularly increase those doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this OTI protocol, an oral food challenge (OFC) is performed. This OFC allows the&#xD;
      determination of the threshold reactive dose, i.e. the minimum dose of allergen that induces&#xD;
      an allergic reaction. A safe dose of peanut is then determined that will be regularly eaten&#xD;
      by the patient. Every 6 months, a new OFC is performed and thus a new threshold reactive dose&#xD;
      is measured, and the dose to be eaten by the patient updated. The protocol is followed until&#xD;
      the patient reaches an ideal dose of 2942mg of peanut protein, corresponding to 14 peanuts of&#xD;
      middle size, which is the maximum dose of peanut that can be found in standard product in&#xD;
      France. Of course, the protocol can also be ended if the patient decided so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although this protocol is performed in the allergy Unit of Saint Vincent Hospital, very few&#xD;
      data are published on the subject. The aim of the study is to study the evolution of the&#xD;
      threshold reactive dose and the evolution of the quantity of specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE)&#xD;
      against peanut proteins (rAra h 1, rAra h 2 and rAra h 3) in patient that had followed the&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to study the clinical efficiency of peanut OTI by&#xD;
      measuring the evolution of the patient threshold reactive dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to study the biological efficiency of peanut OTI by measuring the&#xD;
      evolution of the dosage of sIgE against peanut proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the OFC and the IgE dosage are a standard part of the OTI protocol, all the data are&#xD;
      obtained from the medical records. The study is retrospective and thus observational.&#xD;
