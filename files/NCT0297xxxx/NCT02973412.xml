    <textblock>
      The incidence and prevalence of diabetes mellitus has now reached over 4 million in the UK.&#xD;
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for approximately 90% of the UK population with&#xD;
      diabetes and confers significant morbidity and mortality on patients and healthcare systems.&#xD;
      Despite new therapies and management tools to improve quality of life and outcomes for&#xD;
      patients with T2DM, diabetic complications with cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the&#xD;
      greatest cause of mortality. New paradigms for characterising and treating these patients&#xD;
      could enhance current T2DM management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, there has been considerable interest in the association between quantity and&#xD;
      quality of sleep and circadian rhythms and the development of cardiometabolic disease&#xD;
      especially metabolic syndrome, T2DM and CVD. A &quot;U&quot;-shaped relationship related to both short&#xD;
      and long sleep duration exists between sleep duration and T2DM, obesity, CVD, hypertension&#xD;
      and stroke. A meta-analysis of nearly 500,000 individuals (~4% T2DM) identified a relative&#xD;
      risk (RR) of 1.14 (95% CI 1.03-1.26) for every additional hour of sleep and RR 1.09 (95% CI&#xD;
      1.04-1.15) with each hour of shorter sleep compared to 7-hours sleep per day for the&#xD;
      development of T2DM. Despite this many individuals do not consider sleep essential for good&#xD;
      health but instead consider it to be rather more of an inconvenience. Subsequently, lifestyle&#xD;
      choices, societal pressures and shift-work render the population chronically sleep deprived&#xD;
      and thus at increased risk of metabolic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep is regulated, in part, by a homeostatic drive and is therefore unavoidable in humans&#xD;
      (without sleep disorders). The circadian system, our internal clock, is also responsible for&#xD;
      the regulation of sleep. Sleep is a multidimensional behaviour (and biological process) where&#xD;
      the investigators need to not only consider duration and quality but timing also. A person's&#xD;
      sleep pattern, in relation to the 24-hour clock, i.e. timing, is individual to them and&#xD;
      referred to as their chronotype. The investigators can quantitatively characterize these&#xD;
      individual differences in daily timing using a number of questionnaire based tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five different chronotypes have been identified using the 'Morningness-Eveningness'&#xD;
      Questionnaire i.e. definite evening type, moderate evening type, intermediate, moderate&#xD;
      morning type and definite morning type.The identification of these different chronotypes,&#xD;
      which describes preferred circadian phases, into, at the two extremes, &quot;morning type&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;evening type&quot; has led to further research confirming that &quot;evening types&quot; are at greater&#xD;
      risk of cardiometabolic disease. The underlying causes have not been clearly defined but&#xD;
      appear to be related to circadian mal-alignment causing chronic sleep deprivation and leading&#xD;
      to dysregulation of metabolic, immune and hormonal processes that govern energy regulation&#xD;
      and glycaemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several clock genes have been identified in the control of circadian rhythms including Clock&#xD;
      (Circadian locomotor output cycles protein kaput), Npas2 (Neuronal PAS domain protein2),&#xD;
      Bmal1 (Brain and muscle ARNT-like protein), Per1 (Period), Per2, Per3, Cry1 (Cryptochrome),&#xD;
      Cry2, Rev-Erbs (Reverse erythroblastosis virus) and CkI (Casein kinase). However their role&#xD;
      if any, in prevention and progression in T2DM remains to be elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of &quot;social jetlag&quot; has been developed to describe the deleterious effects of&#xD;
      chronic sleep deprivation related to weekday occupational obligations on &quot;evening types&quot; and&#xD;
      weekend social demands on &quot;morning types&quot;. For example, a large epidemiological study in&#xD;
      Germany has shown that social jetlag is associated with obesity. Several public health&#xD;
      questions are raised by these associations, not least whether chronotyping of all individuals&#xD;
      should be considered and whether the individual chronotype can be adjusted by sleep hygiene&#xD;
      and training (which requires discipline for maintenance) and/or exogenous treatment with&#xD;
      melatonin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this cross-sectional observational study, the investigators therefore propose to&#xD;
      extensively chronotype a sample of patients with T2DM, and to determine the impact of&#xD;
      chronotype on glycaemic control, insulin resistance, biochemical profile, and inflammatory,&#xD;
      adipocytokine and genetic markers using a validated questionnaire and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an optional sub-study we will explore the association between chronotype and objectively&#xD;
      measured physical activity, energy intake and clock genes.&#xD;
