  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to look at how educational videos provided by doctors might&#xD;
      affect patients knowledge, satisfaction, confidence, and anxiety with post-operative Mohs&#xD;
      surgery care. Patients will be randomized to either: 1) a group that receives educational&#xD;
      videos in addition to standard-of-care written and verbal instructions or 2) a group that&#xD;
      receives only standard-of-care written and verbal instructions.&#xD;

      The Primary Objective of this study is to determine if video discharge instructions, when&#xD;
      added to standard of care written and verbal instructions, lead to a decrease in unnecessary&#xD;
      phone calls from patients in a Mohs dermatology clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary Objectives of this study are to determine if video discharge instructions, when&#xD;
      added to standard of care written and verbal instructions, help to improve patients'&#xD;
      satisfaction with education materials provided by the clinic, improve patients' knowledge of&#xD;
      post-operative management, improve patients' confidence in taking care of their suture site&#xD;
      post-operatively, and reduce post-operative anxiety about their suture site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a randomized controlled trial in which the impact of video discharge&#xD;
      instructions on patient calls, anxiety, and confidence will be evaluated. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized using a permuted block model generated through SAS.&#xD;

    <description>These videos contain the same instructions that a patient receives via the standard-of-care verbal and written discharge instructions. These instructions will be delivered by the same nursing and medical staff that also regularly provides verbal and written discharge instructions to patients. There will be no difference in the content between the standard-of-care verbal and written instructions and the video discharge instructions. Patients in this group will receive telecommunication reminders on how to access discharge videos.</description>
