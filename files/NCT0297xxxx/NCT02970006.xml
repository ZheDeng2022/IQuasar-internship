      The study hypothesis is that spinal cord stimulation (SCS) combined with virtual leg&#xD;
      illumination (provided through a wearable headset (OculusRift, OculusVR, Irvine, CA) and a&#xD;
      custom-designed virtual reality leg scenario) will lead to controlled analgesia induction,&#xD;
      boosting analgesic effects obtained with standard SCS treatments and will further be&#xD;
      associated with changes in the perception of the affected body part.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidural spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an approved treatment for truncal and extremity&#xD;
      neuropathic pain. The mechanisms underlying the efficacy of SCS are unknown. Recent advances&#xD;
      in cognitive neuroprosthetics using virtual reality allow for modulation of body perception&#xD;
      and bodily experience, which has also been shown to modulate pain perception. The present&#xD;
      research proposal plans to merge expertise in cognitive neuroprosthetics with neuromodulation&#xD;
      techniques in order to test the analgesic properties of the combination of epidural spinal&#xD;
      cord stimulation with a new system of multisensory stimulation based on virtual and enhanced&#xD;
      reality (i.e., neuro-visual stimulation). The investigators propose to study this hypothesis&#xD;
      prospectively in 25 patients with implanted SCS systems for the treatment of chronic&#xD;
      neuropathic pain. Primary outcomes will be pain reduction (based on subjective, functional&#xD;
      and physiological measures) and changes in body perception (based on subjective and objective&#xD;
      measures). The present study will generate a proof-of-concept for the application of&#xD;
      neuro-visual stimulation for the treatment of chronic pain and will form the basis for future&#xD;
      NIH funding application.&#xD;

    <description>Validated questionnaires developed by the collaborators (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) will be used in order to investigate induced changes in leg perception and ownership. In particular, we will assess: 1) feeling of ownership towards the leg shown in the virtual reality set-up (leg ownership); 2) tactile sensations felt on the virtual legs, depending on the different conditions of SCS and visual stimulation. Patients will be asked to indicate how much they agreed with each item using a 7-point colored vertical Likert scale ranging from 0 (complete disagreement, the bottom extreme, red point) to +6 (complete agreement, the top extreme, green point).</description>

        <description>Validated questionnaires developed by the collaborators (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) will be used in order to investigate induced changes in leg perception and ownership. In particular, we will assess: 1) feeling of ownership towards the leg shown in the virtual reality set-up (leg ownership); 2) tactile sensations felt on the virtual legs, depending on the different conditions of SCS and visual stimulation. Patients will be asked to indicate how much they agreed with each item using a 7-point colored vertical Likert scale ranging from 0 (complete disagreement, the bottom extreme, red point) to +6 (complete agreement, the top extreme, green point).</description>

        <population>Patients will rate their pain reduction on a scale of 0-6, each minute in each of the three virtual reality conditions. The pain score change reported is an average of all time points in all virtual reality settings. A change in pain rating was calculated between different SCS and VR conditions. Percentage pain reduction was then calculated to test whether SCS combined with VR reduced pain more significantly than VR alone. The calculation done was a mean score of all pain ratings at all points.</population>

      <time_frame>The experiment included 2 sessions occurring at 24 hours interval, the first session was used for clinical assessment and the personalization of the visual illumination administered in the virtual environment, while the experimental protocol was performed the second day. The duration of each session was between 90-120 minutes. Adverse events were monitored over that time.</time_frame>
