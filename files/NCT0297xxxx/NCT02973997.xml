  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab and lenvatinib work in treating patients&#xD;
      with differentiated thyroid cancer that has spread to other places in the body or has come&#xD;
      back and cannot be removed by surgery. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the clinical efficacy, as indicated by the rate of complete response (CR)&#xD;
      per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, of combination therapy with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in lenvatinib-naive patients with progressive&#xD;
      radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC). (Cohort 1) II. To determine the&#xD;
      overall response rate (ORR) by the addition of pembrolizumab to patients with&#xD;
      radioiodine-refractory DTC who have progressive disease on lenvatinib alone. (Cohort 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety profile and toxicity of combination therapy with pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      lenvatinib in patients with progressive DTC. (Cohort 1 and cohort 2) II. To determine&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). (Cohort 1 and cohort 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To correlate tumor response (RECIST 1.1) with pretreatment frequency of CD8+ T cells in&#xD;
      the primary and/or metastatic tumor. (Cohort 1 and cohort 2) II. To correlate tumor response&#xD;
      (RECIST 1.1) with pretreatment PD-L1 and PD-L2 levels in the primary and/or metastatic tumor.&#xD;
      (Cohort 1 and cohort 2) III. To correlate tumor response (RECIST 1.1) with pretreatment&#xD;
      frequency of lymphocytes expressing CD3, CD4, PD-1, FoxP3, or CD20, and of CD163+&#xD;
      macrophages. (Cohort 1 and cohort 2) IV. To correlate tumor response (RECIST 1.1) with the&#xD;
      phenotype and frequency of key leukocyte subsets (i.e., PD-1+ T cells, regulatory T cells&#xD;
      [Tregs], myeloid subsets) in the peripheral blood before, at 6 and 18 weeks on therapy, and&#xD;
      at 54 weeks (study completion), progressive disease (PD), or study withdrawal. (Cohort 1) V.&#xD;
      To correlate tumor response (RECIST 1.1) with PD-1+ T cell functional capacity. (Cohort 1)&#xD;
      VI. To correlate tumor response (RECIST 1.1) with serum anti-thyroglobulin antibody levels&#xD;
      assessed before, and at 18 weeks on therapy. (Cohort 1 and 2) VII. To correlate tumor&#xD;
      response (RECIST 1.1) with tumor mutation status. (Cohort 1) VIII. To broadly investigate&#xD;
      mechanisms of response and resistance to combination therapy, gene expression profiles will&#xD;
      be generated from frozen biopsies for analysis by ribonucleic acid-sequencing (RNA-Seq).&#xD;
      (Cohort 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive lenvatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 19&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may continue&#xD;
      treatment for up to 35 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 3&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

    <description>All analyses with respect to the translational component of this study are intended to be hypothesis-generating and descriptive in manner. Clinical data (i.e. CR rates confirmed response rates, PFS, OS, etc.) will be correlated with tumor marker data of interest (CD8+, PD-L1, PD-L2, T cell functional capacity markers, anti-thyroglobulin antibody levels, tumor mutation status, and other markers). The Chi-Square (or Fisher's Exact test) will be used to assess the association of categorical clinical data with categorical biomarker data. Time-to-event clinical data (PFS, OS) will be correlated with biomarker data using Kaplan-Meier methodology and Cox regression models. Logistic regression models will also be used to predict binary clinical data with baseline biomarker data. Finally, graphical methods and descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the data as well. Two-sided p-values &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.</description>

&#xD;
          -  History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that&#xD;
             might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation&#xD;
             for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to&#xD;
             participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation&#xD;
             with the requirements of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or&#xD;

             detected)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received a live vaccine =&lt; 30 days of planned start of study therapy; NOTE: seasonal&#xD;
             influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are&#xD;
             allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist) are live attenuated&#xD;
             vaccines, and are not allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Proteinuria &gt; 1+ on dipstick urinalysis; patients with &gt; 1+ proteinuria on dipstick&#xD;
             urinalysis will undergo 24-hour urine collection for quantitative assessment; NOTE:&#xD;
             patients with &gt; 1 g/24 hours will be ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant gastrointestinal malabsorption syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  New York Heart Association congestive heart failure of grade II or above, unstable&#xD;

             ejection fraction (EF) by multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) or echo should not be less&#xD;
             than the institutional lower limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corrected QT (QTc) prolongation &gt; 480 msec, as calculated by either the Bazett or&#xD;
             Fridericia formula, as per institutional standard&#xD;
