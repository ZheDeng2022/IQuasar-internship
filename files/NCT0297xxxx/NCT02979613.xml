          <title>Percentage of Participants With Normalized ALT at Week 96 (by Central Laboratory and AASLD Criteria)</title>
          <description>ALT normalization was defined as an ALT value that changed from above the normal range at baseline to within the normal range at the given postbaseline visit. Central laboratory ULN for ALT were as follows: ≤ 43 U/L for males aged 18 to &lt; 69 years and ≤ 35 U/L for males aged ≥ 69 years; ≤ 34 U/L for females aged 18 to &lt; 69 years and ≤ 32 U/L for females aged ≥ 69 years. The ULN for ALT using the 2018 AASLD normal range was 25 U/L for females and 35 U/L for males. M = F approach was used for analysis.</description>
          <population>Participants in the Full Analysis Set with Baseline ALT &gt; ULN were analyzed. Participants were analyzed according to the treatment to which they were randomized.</population>
