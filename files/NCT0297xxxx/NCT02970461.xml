      Electronic personal health record systems (PHRs) support patient centered healthcare by&#xD;
      making medical records and other relevant information accessible to patients, thus assisting&#xD;
      patients in health self-management[1,2]. The Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires (HIBA) is a&#xD;
      private hospital in Buenos Aires, capital of Argentina. It has 500 beds and serves around&#xD;
      50,000 patients per month. Its main facilities cover a surface area of 78,000 m² (850,000&#xD;
      ft²). The hospital treats both private patients and those derived by social security. It also&#xD;
      provides its own Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) being the most important pre-paid&#xD;
      healthcare service in Argentina, with about 150,000 clients. HIBA has a Health Information&#xD;
      System (HIS) and Electronic Health Records (EHR) since 1998 and implemented a PHR in 2007.&#xD;
      The PHR gives patients access to aspects of the EHR related to their Health Care (laboratory,&#xD;
      diagnosis, preventive information, medications lists), supports messaging with their&#xD;
      physician, scheduling services and medication delivery for Self management, among other&#xD;
      things. The majority of HIBA HMO affiliates are enrolled to this PHR. In 2015 HIBA underwent&#xD;
      the process of accreditation by the United States Joint Commission[3]. As part of this&#xD;
      process, HIBA redefined and refined the EHR/PHR data set, including new fields and regrouping&#xD;
      pre-existent ones. EHR/PHR's personal data set is now composed of a series of fields grouped&#xD;
      as depicted below. Personal data information is a difficult data set to capture, particularly&#xD;
      those regarding social and cultural background information[4]. This data set is not only&#xD;
      useful to help better healthcare system management, it is also relevant as it is used for&#xD;
      epidemiological and preventive purposes[5-7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gamification is a term used to describe using game elements in non-game environments to&#xD;
      enhance user experience[8,9]. It has been incorporated with commercial success into several&#xD;
      platforms (Linkedin, Badgeville, Facebook). While over the past years gamification elements&#xD;
      have been incorporated in healthcare scenarios there is still little evidence on how&#xD;
      effective they are[10-12]. Game elements provide engagement consistent with various theories&#xD;
      of motivation[13], positive psychology (e.g., flow)[14], and also provide instant feedback.&#xD;
      Feedback is more effective when it provides sufficient and specific information for goal&#xD;
      achievement and is presented relatively close in time to the event being evaluated. Feedback&#xD;
      can reference individual progress, can make social comparisons, or can refer to task&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess whether gamification is an effective tactic to drive PHR users' behavior,&#xD;
      an intervention was designed. The investigators used gamification elements such as points,&#xD;
      graphical representations and playful attitude to the design and interactions of the Bio page&#xD;
      in the Hospital's PHR. These elements provide instant feedback to user actions. A control&#xD;
      group with no game elements will be compared with a gamified group to see if these new game&#xD;
      elements would increase patient's personal data rectification, validation and completion in&#xD;
      the Hospital's PHR. A status variable was created and assigned to all fields according to the&#xD;
      following scheme:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completed: user has modified empty field.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Corrected: user has modified non-empty field.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Verified: user has updated Group but field data has experienced no change.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validated: user has clicked on the &quot;validate&quot; button.&#xD;
