    <textblock>
      The first objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of pitolisant&#xD;
      given at 10, 20, or 40 mg per day versus placebo during 12 weeks of the Double Blind period,&#xD;
      to treat the Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS) in patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea&#xD;
      (OSA) refusing the nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (nCPAP) therapy or treated by&#xD;
      nCPAP but still complaining of EDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study include assessing the long-term tolerance as well as&#xD;
      the maintenance of efficacy of pitolisant given at 10, 20 or 40 mg per day during 39 weeks of&#xD;
      Open Label Extension period.&#xD;

             submitted to nCPAP therapy for a minimum period of 3 months, and still complaining of&#xD;
             EDS despite the efforts made beforehand to obtain an efficient nCPAP therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Polysomnography performed (for patients submitted to nCPAP therapy - under nCPAP)&#xD;
