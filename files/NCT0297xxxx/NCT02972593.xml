      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference in outcomes between&#xD;
      liberal transfusion (transfusing when hemoglobin drops below a set higher value number) and&#xD;
      conservative transfusion (transfusing when hemoglobin drops below a set lower value number).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transfusion of Orthopaedic trauma patients is routinely done in asymptomatic individuals as&#xD;
      there is no accepted national standard or recommendations from the American Academy of&#xD;
      Orthopaedic Surgeons or the Orthopaedic Trauma Association for what level of anemia is&#xD;
      appropriate in an asymptomatic patient. Individual practitioners typically make this decision&#xD;
      based on anecdotal experiences and expert opinion. No prospective study has been performed to&#xD;
      date to answer this question in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis of this proposed pilot study is that no difference will be seen with a&#xD;
      liberal transfusion strategy to keep a patient's hemoglobin above 7 g/dL versus a&#xD;
      conservative strategy to keep the patient's hemoglobin above 5.5 g/dL in patients&#xD;
      asymptomatic at rest. The primary outcome of this pilot study will be infection; defined as&#xD;
      postoperative wound infection (superficial or deep) or other perioperative infection but not&#xD;
      surgical site (urinary tract infection or pneumonia). Deep infection is defined as the need&#xD;
      for intravenous antibiotics or a return to surgery for debridement. Superficial infection is&#xD;
      defined as the use of oral antibiotics only successfully treat a surgical site infection.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, acute renal&#xD;
      failure or insufficiency, nonunion, delayed union, compartment syndrome, osteomyelitis, nerve&#xD;
      palsy, anoxic brain injury, cardiac ischemia or infarct, pancreatitis, or death, and the&#xD;
      musculoskeletal functional assessment.&#xD;
