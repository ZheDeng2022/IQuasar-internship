      The purpose of this prospective study is to evaluate the efficacy of the ResAppDx software&#xD;
      application in diagnosis of pneumonia and other respiratory conditions (bronchiolitis,&#xD;
      asthma/reactive airway disease, croup, upper or lower respiratory tract infections) in&#xD;
      infants and children. Patient's cough sounds will be recorded using a smartphone and analysed&#xD;
      using the ResAppDx software. The ResAppDx diagnosis will be compared to radiologic diagnosis&#xD;
      and/or clinical diagnosis. The ResAppDx diagnosis will not be provided to the clinician or&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
