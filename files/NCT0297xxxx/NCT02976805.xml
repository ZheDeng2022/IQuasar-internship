      PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this multi-centre randomized clinical trial is to compare two bowel&#xD;
      preparation regimens for patients who fail to cleanse their colon during their index&#xD;
      colonoscopy. Although many clinical trials already exist examining the optimal bowel&#xD;
      preparation for colonoscopy in general, surprisingly none address patients who failed bowel&#xD;
      preparation in the past. Failure to achieve bowel preparation is a result of complex factors,&#xD;
      including underlying colonic dysmotility, co-morbidities, and concurrent medication usage and&#xD;
      is rarely the result of patient non-compliance.(1) Given the frequency of inadequate bowel&#xD;
      preparation, its negative impact on colonoscopy quality, the increased risk for an adverse&#xD;
      event, and the need to repeat the procedure, an important public health need exists to&#xD;
      address this question urgently.(1) This study will use many of the same methodology and&#xD;
      investigators as an ongoing Canadian multicenter study titled, &quot;The Bowel CLEAnsing: a&#xD;
      National initiative ( B-CLEAN) &quot; but on a smaller scale to answer this question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate bowel preparation is a prerequisite for high quality colonoscopy and is needed to&#xD;
      maximize visualization of the colonic mucosa.(1-4) Unfortunately, inadequate bowel&#xD;
      preparation is common and reported to occur in 4% to 17% of cases.(5-12) Procedures with poor&#xD;
      preparation are more likely to be incomplete, have an adverse event, and are less likely to&#xD;
      detect polyps.(1, 9, 13) Repeat colonoscopies within one year have shown a 36% miss rate for&#xD;
      advanced adenomas in these patients.(12) Recognizing the importance of high quality&#xD;
      colonoscopy, Cancer Care Ontario and other provincial health authorities now track adequacy&#xD;
      rates for bowel preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases of poor bowel preparation, the colonoscopy must be repeated, exposing patients to&#xD;
      another invasive procedure and adding additional costs to the healthcare system. Although&#xD;
      health economic data regarding colonoscopy utilization in Canada is sparse, an illustrative&#xD;
      example from the United States is possible. Assuming 14.2 million screening colonoscopies are&#xD;
      performed annually in the United States (14) of which 5% have inadequate bowel preparation&#xD;
      (6, 8), a total of 710,000 colonoscopies have to be repeated at a cost of $763 million&#xD;
      dollars, based on a per case cost of $1,075.(15) This is likely an underestimation of the&#xD;
      true cost due to exclusion of non-screening colonoscopies in the calculation and the use of a&#xD;
      low colonoscopy cost estimate based on the Nationwide Colonoscopy Program for the&#xD;
      Uninsured.(15)&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are numerous definitions of inadequate bowel preparation and the term's lack of&#xD;
      specificity contributes to the varied incidence of inadequate bowel preparation reported in&#xD;
      the literature. The Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) is a user friendly validated&#xD;
      measure that is based on three colonic segment scores (right, transverse, left, each scored&#xD;
      between 0 - 3) and is summed for a total score between 0 - 9.(16, 17)(Appendix A) Adequacy&#xD;
      was recently formally defined in a large study involving 2,516 patients undergoing&#xD;
      colonoscopies at 36 centres as a total score ≥6 and/or all segment scores ≥2.(18)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal bowel preparation to use for repeat colonoscopy in patients who failed the&#xD;
      initial preparation is unknown. However, a combination of a stimulant, such as bisacodyl, and&#xD;
      a larger volume of an electrolyte and fluid balanced osmotic laxative, such as PEG, is often&#xD;
      used. In a recent case series, Ibanez et al.(19) identified 83 patients with inadequate bowel&#xD;
      preparation at their index colonoscopy. 51 patients agreed to a repeat colonoscopy using an&#xD;
      'intensive' regimen consisting of a low fibre diet, bisacodyl, and 3L split dose polyethylene&#xD;
      glycol (PEG). Using this regimen, 90% had adequate bowel preparation at the second&#xD;
      colonoscopy. However, the bowel preparation at the index colonoscopy was not given in a split&#xD;
      dose manner in the majority of patients, which is now the standard of practice due to&#xD;
      superior cleansing, and the lack of a control group makes an accurate assessment of efficacy&#xD;
      impossible.(1) In another study, patients with inadequate bowel preparation after split dose&#xD;
      PEG (4L) were offered a repeat colonoscopy the same day after ingestion of another 2L of PEG&#xD;
      or a colonoscopy 1 week later using a low fibre diet, bisacodyl, and 4L split dose PEG.(20)&#xD;
      There was no difference in adequacy of bowel preparation although 20% of cases were still&#xD;
      inadequate and the lack of randomization and blinding threaten the validity of these results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no consensus exists regarding the optimal bowel preparation regimen to use in&#xD;
      patients with inadequate cleansing due to the absence of clinical trials. Given 4% to 17% of&#xD;
      colonoscopies have inadequate bowel preparation, there is a significant public health need to&#xD;
      address this issue.(5-12, 21-23) A highly efficacious yet tolerable bowel preparation regimen&#xD;
      is needed for these patients to ensure adequate cleansing for their next procedure. The&#xD;
      objective of this multi-centre randomized clinical trial will be to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      two regimens in achieving adequate bowel preparation after failing to cleanse at the index&#xD;
      colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Study Design, Randomization, and Blinding This multi-centre randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      will compare two bowel preparation regimens for patients who have already failed bowel&#xD;
      preparation at their index colonoscopy, defined as inadequate visualization to detect lesions&#xD;
      &gt; 5 mm and requiring a shortened colonoscopy interval as a result. This clinical definition&#xD;
      of failed bowel preparation was chosen instead of the BBPS since the latter may not be&#xD;
      available from the index colonoscopy depending on the endoscopist. However, where possible,&#xD;
      the BBPS at the index colonoscopy will be recorded. A total of four centres from the original&#xD;
      B-CLEAN study group have agreed to participate (Appendix E).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to one of 2 arms (see '3.2 Selection of Bowel Preparation&#xD;
      Regimens' for details). Randomization will be performed centrally using Research Electronic&#xD;
      Data Capture (REDCap) in a 1:1 allocation in blocks of varying sizes stratified by site. In&#xD;
      addition, data entry will be performed online through REDCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding of the endoscopist will be strictly enforced. Endoscopists are required to remain&#xD;
      blinded to the subject's bowel preparation until after completing the bowel cleanliness&#xD;
      section of the CRF. Subjects will be asked to not discuss the bowel preparation with any&#xD;
      endoscopy unit staff except for research personnel until the colonoscopy preparation rating&#xD;
      has been completed by the endoscopist. Unfortunately, blinding of the patient (ie. double&#xD;
      blinding) is impossible due to the volume differences between the two bowel preparation&#xD;
      regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Selection of Bowel Preparation Regimens Regimen A: 4L PegLyte + 15 mg bisacodyl Regimen&#xD;
      B: 6L PegLyte + 15 mg bisacodyl&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no standard bowel preparation utilized after a colonoscopy with failed bowel&#xD;
      preparation. Regimen A was adapted from Ibanez et al.(19) who used a regimen consisting of 3L&#xD;
      polyethylene glycol (PEG) and 10 mg bisacodyl with reasonable effectiveness. In our study, 4L&#xD;
      PEG is used instead of 3L to avoid reducing the amount of PEG consumed by those who were&#xD;
      originally prepped with 4L PegLyte at their index colonoscopy. 15 mg bisacodyl was used&#xD;
      instead of 10 mg for consistency with dosing used in BiPegLyte. This regimen is modestly more&#xD;
      intensive than standard bowel preparation due to an additional 2L PEG compared to BiPegLyte&#xD;
      and 15 mg bisacodyl compared to 4L PegLyte.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen B was adapted from Kim et al.(20) as a more intensive yet tolerable regimen. In this&#xD;
      regimen, 6L of PEG is combined with 15 mg of bisacodyl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Bowel Preparation &amp; Colonoscopy Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation to either&#xD;
      regimen A or B. Regardless of randomization, subjects will be instructed to follow a low&#xD;
      fibre diet for 2 days followed by clear fluid diet for 24 hours prior to the scheduled&#xD;
      colonoscopy. The time and amount of PEG the subjects will consume will depend on&#xD;
      randomization.(APPENDIX B) To optimize patient adherence, all participants will receive a&#xD;
      handout with their specific bowel preparation instructions based on their randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All colonoscopies will be performed within 12 weeks of randomization but not within 2 weeks&#xD;
      of index colonoscopy (ie. washout period from the index bowel preparation). Procedures will&#xD;
      be performed according to local standard operating procedures. All participating endoscopists&#xD;
      will complete standardized training and calibration in the use of the Boston Bowel&#xD;
      Preparation Scale prior to the start of the study at&#xD;
      http://www.bmc.org/gastroenterology/research.htm. A record of training will be sent to the&#xD;
      coordinating centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects who do not present for their colonoscopy after randomization (ie. forgot&#xD;
      appointment), they may remain in the study and be prepped with the same regimen again as long&#xD;
      as their next colonoscopy is not scheduled within the next two weeks. For subjects who&#xD;
      decline ongoing study participation, they can withdraw and follow up with their physician.&#xD;

      3.5 Statistical Considerations Sample size was calculated as follows. Assuming 70% adequacy&#xD;
      among those randomized to regimen A, 87.5% adequacy among those randomized to regimen B,&#xD;
      significance of 0.05, and power of 0.8, 85 patients are required in each group (total = 170).&#xD;
      An adequacy rate of 70% was selected based on the existing literature.(19, 20) Additional&#xD;
      factors considered in arriving at this figure include the lack of split dosing used at the&#xD;
      index colonoscopy (19), inadequate intake of PEG at the index colonoscopy (20), and the&#xD;
      performance of the second colonoscopy within a week of the first.(20) An adequacy rate of&#xD;
      87.5% was selected based on a 25% relative increase in adequacy to be considered clinically&#xD;
      significant. Based on a target sample size of 170 and a conservative 15% dropout, 196&#xD;
      subjects are required for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be reported as mean (SD), median (range), and proportions as&#xD;
      appropriate. Data will be analyzed as intention-to-treat and hypothesis testing performed&#xD;
      with t-test, chi-square, and Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Pre-planned secondary&#xD;
      analyses will include per-protocol analysis, stratification by timing of colonoscopy (ie.&#xD;
      morning versus afternoon procedures), and stratification by initial bowel preparation used.&#xD;
