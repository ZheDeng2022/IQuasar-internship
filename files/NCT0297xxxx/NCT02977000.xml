    <textblock>
      Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a major cause of blindness and visual impairment in&#xD;
      children in both developing and developed countries around the world. ROP is a multifactorial&#xD;
      disease characterized by perturbation of normal vascular development in the retina. The&#xD;
      pathogenesis of ROP is hypothesized to consist of two distinct phases of which the second&#xD;
      phase is characterized by hypoxia-induced up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      (VEGF) and retinal neovascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown a relationship between the β-adrenergic system and angiogenesis.&#xD;
      This relationship has been observed in several diseases, like infantile hemangiomas, ROP, and&#xD;
      neoplasias. Studies in animal models have shown that norepinephrine stimulates VEGF&#xD;
      expression and secretion in retinal cells. In oxygen induced retinopathy, blockage of&#xD;
      β-adrenergic receptors (β-AR) can inhibit the angiogenic cascade and interfere with further&#xD;
      proliferation of retinal vasculature. Also, angiogenesis seems to be impaired in β-Argene&#xD;
      deficient mice, when exposed to hypoxia and other stimuli, but this function is restored&#xD;
      after gene therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming in human preterm newborns with ROP that VEGF overexpression and retinal&#xD;
      neovascularization in response to hypoxia might involve b-AR activation, we design&#xD;
      prospective randomized study to assess the effect of oral propranolol on the progression of&#xD;
      early stages of ROP in very low birth weight infants.&#xD;

      Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a major cause of blindness and visual impairment in&#xD;
      children in both developing and developed countries around the world. ROP is a multifactorial&#xD;
      disease characterized by perturbation of normal vascular development in the retina. The&#xD;
      pathogenesis of ROP is hypothesized to consist of two distinct phases of which the second&#xD;
      phase is characterized by hypoxia-induced up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      (VEGF) and retinal neovascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown a relationship between the β-adrenergic system and angiogenesis.&#xD;
      This relationship has been observed in several diseases, like infantile hemangiomas, ROP, and&#xD;
      neoplasias. Studies in animal models have shown that norepinephrine stimulates VEGF&#xD;
      expression and secretion in retinal cells. In oxygen induced retinopathy, blockage of&#xD;
      β-adrenergic receptors (β-AR) can inhibit the angiogenic cascade and interfere with further&#xD;
      proliferation of retinal vasculature. Also, angiogenesis seems to be impaired in β-Argene&#xD;
      deficient mice, when exposed to hypoxia and other stimuli, but this function is restored&#xD;
      after gene therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An association between ROP and infantile hemangiomas was observed over 50 years ago with a&#xD;
      higher prevalence of ROP in children with hemangiomas. Studies have also shown that β-AR&#xD;
      blockage reduces VEGF levels and favors the regression of infantile hemangiomas. The&#xD;
      treatment of choice in threshold stages of ROP is laser photocoagulation and/or intravitreal&#xD;
      bevacizumab injections, but management of early stages of ROP, until now has been expectant,&#xD;
      with ophthalmologic follow-up but no therapeutic interventions to prevent its progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propranolol is a non-selective β-AR blocker, with equal affinity for β1 and β2 receptors. It&#xD;
      has a systemic effect, and acts in different tissues. In vivo models of proliferative&#xD;
      retinopathies have shown a strong inhibitory role of β-AR on vascular changes. In particular,&#xD;
      β2-AR seems to be the most involved in these responses&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Propranolol has shown to be highly effective in inhibiting both the increase of VEGF&#xD;
      expression caused by a hypoxic insult, and the consequent neovascular Response. Studies have&#xD;
      shown that propranolol reduces the overproduction of VEGF in oxygen induced retinopathy, but&#xD;
      VEGF levels remain unchanged in the normal retina. Assuming in human preterm newborns with&#xD;
      ROP that VEGF overexpression and retinal neovascularization in response to hypoxia might&#xD;
      involve b-AR activation, we design prospective randomized study to assess the effect of oral&#xD;
      propranolol on the progression of early stages of ROP in very low birth weight infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial was performed with preterm newborns with GA &lt;32 weeks of age&#xD;
      and Stage 2 ROP without plus in zone II, Although infants were receiving supplemental oxygen,&#xD;
      the target range of oxygen saturation was maintained between 91% and 95%. The treated and&#xD;
      control newborns are randomized with a 1:1 allocation in blocks of 8 by using a computer&#xD;
      random number generator and stratified by center in 2 groups of GA 24-28 and 28-32 weeks;&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria included newborns with congenital or acquired cardiovascular anomalies,&#xD;
      renal failure or cerebral hemorrhage at enrollment, and newborns with ROP in zone I or at a&#xD;
      more advanced stage than Stage 2 without plus in zone II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With severe adverse effects related to propranolol (severe bradycardia, hypotension, or&#xD;
      wheezing), the administration of propranolol was permanently discontinued. If these episodes&#xD;
      had been observed within the first 2 days of treatment, these newborns were included into the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All newborns withGA &lt;32 weeks had ophthalmologic evaluations through indirect ophthalmoscopy.&#xD;
      When ROP in zone II reached Stage 2 without plus, newborns were enrolled, and ophthalmologic&#xD;
      examinations were scheduled weekly or more frequently, according to the severity of ROP.&#xD;
      Propranolol was administered orally as a dose of 1.5 mg/kg.d divided q8h. investigators used&#xD;
      powdered drug, dissolved in 5% dextrose. The treatment was continued until complete&#xD;
      development of retinal vascularization, although administration was not permitted for more&#xD;
      than 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses were performed with the Statistical Software SPSS 17.0. investigators&#xD;
      used t tests to assess possible differences in demographic, biochemical, hemodynamic, and&#xD;
      respiratory variables between the treated and control newborns. The null hypothesis was&#xD;
      accepted with a P &gt; .05. The efficacy of the treatment was evaluated by means of the risk&#xD;
      ratio, which is the ratio between the proportion of subjects progressing to more&#xD;
      advanced-stage ROP in the propranolol group vs the control group. The relative reduction of&#xD;
      risk, which is the reduction percent of events in the treated group vs the control group&#xD;
      event rate, was calculated when it was not possible to calculate the risk ratio.&#xD;
