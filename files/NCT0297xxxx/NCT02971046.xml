  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To measure the fractional and absolute synthesis rates of GSH, an antioxidant that protects&#xD;
      cells from damage, in the erythrocytes of healthy school-aged children, young adults and old&#xD;
      adults in response to graded intakes of protein in order to determine if increasing the&#xD;
      protein intake above the current recommended DRI produces increases in the GSH synthesis&#xD;
      rates in erythrocytes of these individuals. Participants will consume specially formulated&#xD;
      diets with varying protein levels.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current dietary reference intake (DRI) recommendations for protein in children (6-11&#xD;
      years old) and adults (&gt;19 years old) are based on nitrogen balance data and set at a mean&#xD;
      (EAR) of 0.76 and 0.66 g/kg/day respectively and population safe (RDA) recommendation of 0.95&#xD;
      and 0.80 g/kg/day respectively. Using the indicator amino oxidation (IAAO) method we&#xD;
      estimated higher protein requirements in these populations. This suggests that current&#xD;
      recommendations are underestimated. Studies in adults have shown that protein recommendation&#xD;
      set on the basis of nitrogen balance data, while sufficient to maintain nitrogen balance,&#xD;
      does not maintain GSH status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glutathione (GSH) is most important intracellular antioxidant and scavenger and its&#xD;
      deficiency has been shown to compromise recovery in acute as well as chronic stressors.&#xD;
      Deficiency of GSH results when protein and/or cysteine intake is inadequate. Inadequate&#xD;
      protein intake in children not only compromises growth, but could increase susceptibility to,&#xD;
      and compromise recovery from regular childhood illness. Similarly, in young and older adults'&#xD;
      inadequate intakes may result in increased oxidative stress and compromised immune function.&#xD;
      Measurement of GSH synthesis provides a functional method whereby the current protein&#xD;
      recommendation can be tested against higher estimates derived using the IAAO method. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study therefore is to measure GSH synthesis in healthy school aged children&#xD;
      (6-11 years), and healthy young (19 - 40 years) and old (60 - 90 years) adults in response to&#xD;
      current recommended protein intakes and in response to protein requirement estimates derived&#xD;
      using the IAAO method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In healthy school-aged children, each level of protein will be studied over three days. For&#xD;
      two days (adaptation days), participants will eat some low protein foods plus a milkshake&#xD;
      drink. On the study day, participants will consume 8 hourly protein drinks and special&#xD;
      cookies at SickKids. In healthy young and old adults, each level of protein will be studied&#xD;
      over three days. For two days (adaptation days), young adults will eat some low protein foods&#xD;
      plus a milkshake drink. On the one study day, young adults will consume 10 hourly milkshake&#xD;
      diets at SickKids. In old adults, each level of protein will be studied over four days. For&#xD;
      three days (adaptation days), old adults will eat some low protein foods plus a milkshake&#xD;
      drink. On the one study day, old adults will consume 10 hourly milkshake diets at SickKids.&#xD;
