      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety and tolerability of GZ402668 after a single subcutaneous (SC) dose in&#xD;
      men and women with progressive multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess in men and women with progressive multiple sclerosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of GZ402668 after a single SC dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pharmacodynamic (PD) response to GZ402668 after a single SC dose.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The total study duration from screening for a patient can be approximately up to 8 weeks.&#xD;
      Upon completion of this trial, patients treated with GZ402668 will be required to enroll in a&#xD;
      4 year safety follow-up study for continued safety observation.&#xD;
