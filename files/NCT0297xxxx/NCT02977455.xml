  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Existing researches show that brain is an organ highly dependent on continuous blood supply.&#xD;
      Energy and oxygen required for normal physiological activities in the brain are stably&#xD;
      maintained by a neurovascular regulatory mechanism, also known as functional congestion.&#xD;
      While under pathological condition such as ischemia, this regulatory mechanism would be&#xD;
      impaired and brain function loss and tissue damage occur. During anesthesia in cardiac&#xD;
      surgery, inevitable circulatory fluctuations could result in decreasing blood pressure and&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow and therefore brain tissue is in ischemia. In this situation the&#xD;
      neurovascular regulatory mechanism will function and the brain oxygen saturation also changes&#xD;
      based on how this mechanism is influenced. the investigators were devoted to observe how this&#xD;
      mechanism was influenced during surgery and how the neural function recovers after surgery so&#xD;
      to explore the relationship between them.&#xD;

      Preoperative: Routine examinations, including pulse, blood pressure, electrocardiogram,&#xD;
      hematological and biochemical tests from blood and urine. Anesthetist paid visit to patient&#xD;
      and made judgement whether patient could be included or not based on rating of cognition.&#xD;
      Anesthetist also introduced the research plan in detail and patient or guardian signed&#xD;
      consent out of participants' own free will.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. After admission, the investigators recorded regular vital signs and measured basic&#xD;
           cerebral oxygen saturation, then inducted anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After induction the investigators recorded anesthetic dose, vital signs and measured&#xD;
           cerebral blood flow and oxygen saturation changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Using BIS to monitor we controlled the anesthesia depth at BIS value of 40 to 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assuring patient's vital signs to be stable and safe, the investigators gave propofol (3&#xD;
           mg/kg, from Fresenius Kabi) intravenously when BIS was greater than 60 and observed&#xD;
           while recorded any changes in BIS value, cerebral blood flow and oxygen saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative: Patient was transferred to chest surgery ICU and vital signs were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data record:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General information: including name, gender, age, height, weight, education, name of disease,&#xD;
      surgery method, admission number, ID number, address, contact information and so on;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative: cardiovascular medicine, vasoactive drugs, lab test results, result reviews,&#xD;
      cognition rating and cerebral blood oxygen saturation basic value;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative: circulatory parameters, medicine, temperature, BIS value, cerebral blood&#xD;
      oxygen saturation and blood flow parameters;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative: extubation time, time of vasoactive drug administration, cognition rating&#xD;
      (postoperative day 3 and day 7), postoperative complications (sudden cardiac death,&#xD;
      disturbance of consciousness, pulmonary infection, acute lung injury, acute pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism, cerebral infarction and so on);&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative stay in hospital, ICU stay time, hospitalization cost, readmission, mortality&#xD;
      (one, three and six months) and so on.&#xD;
