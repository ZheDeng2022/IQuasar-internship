  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathies (CIPN) remain a problem in oncology because no&#xD;
      &quot;gold standard&quot; treatment exists to prevent or treat the CIPN. Therefore, oncologists reduce&#xD;
      or stop the chemotherapy doses to limit degradation of the quality of life of patients with&#xD;
      CIPN. Bortezomib is relatively understudied while neurotoxicity remains a limiting factor for&#xD;
      treatment. Since 2012, the FDA and the EMA validated by the administration of bortezomib&#xD;
      subcutaneously (SC) instead of intravenous (IV) in order to limit neurotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a retrospective study reported that the prevalence of neuropathy induced by&#xD;
      bortezomib after SC administration remains high and equivalent to IV route. No studies have&#xD;
      quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated the sensory disorders in peripheral neuropathies&#xD;
      induced by bortezomib after SC administration. On the other hand, the QLQ-CIPN20&#xD;
      questionnaire (EORTC) evaluating the intensity of sensory, motor and autonomic disorders&#xD;
      associated with CIPN has never been tested in this population. The objective of this study is&#xD;
      twofold: (i) psychophysical evaluation of neuropathic disorders by studying the thermal and&#xD;
      vibratory detection thresholds and thermal nociceptive thresholds and (ii) quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative assessment of neuropathic disorders by the QLQ-CIPN20 and related comorbidities&#xD;
      in a population of neuropathic patients treated with bortezomib (n = 15), compared to control&#xD;
      patients treated with bortezomib but non-neuropathic (n = 45).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Peripheral neuropathies induced by cancer chemotherapy (CIPN) remain a problem in oncology.&#xD;
      These CIPN are induced by certain classes of chemotherapy such as taxanes (paclitaxel and&#xD;
      docetaxel), platinum salts (cisplatin and oxaliplatin), alkaloids of the Madagascar&#xD;
      periwinkle (vincristine), bortezomib, thalidomide and eribulin. These CIPN is essentially&#xD;
      resulting in sensory disturbances such as paresthesia, dysesthesia or numbness.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, no treatment can be offered as &quot;gold standard&quot; for preventing or treating the&#xD;
      CIPN. Therefore, oncologists reduce or stop doses of chemotherapy because patients suffering&#xD;
      from CIPN have a marked deterioration in their quality of life and suffer from comorbidities&#xD;
      such as anxiety, depression and sleep disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among chemotherapy, bortezomib remains relatively understudied in terms of pathophysiology,&#xD;
      compared to the platinum salts or taxanes, whereas the neurotoxicity of bortezomib remains a&#xD;
      limiting factor for treatment. Currently, bortezomib is indicated for the treatment in 1st&#xD;
      line of multiple myeloma in the following protocols:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients &lt;65 years: Protocol VTD: Velcade (bortezomib), thalidomide, dexamethasone +&#xD;
           autologous transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients&gt; 65: Protocol MPV: Melphalan, Prednisone, Velcade. Or Protocol VD: Velcade,&#xD;
           dexamethasone Since 2012, the FDA and the EMA have validated the subcutaneous&#xD;
           administration of bortezomib instead of intravenously, in order to limit the adverse&#xD;
           effects of bortezomib, including neurotoxicity. Indeed, a large study reported that the&#xD;
           subcutaneous bortezomib allowed to keep the same therapeutic efficacy while improving&#xD;
           the safety profile and in particular by limiting peripheral neuropathies (CIPN any&#xD;
           grade: 38% vs 53%, grade ≥2: 24% vs 41%, grade ≥3 6% vs 16%). However, a recent&#xD;
           retrospective study reported that the prevalence of peripheral neuropathies induced by&#xD;
           bortezomib after subcutaneous administration remain relatively high: CIPN any grade:&#xD;
           41%, grade ≥2: 18% grade ≥3: 4 %, and especially that this prevalence of CIPN is no&#xD;
           different between subcutaneous and intravenous route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bortezomib is administered subcutaneously to limit the appearance of neuropathic disorders&#xD;
      and no study has evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively (QST) the sensory disorders in&#xD;
      patients with peripheral neuropathies induced by bortezomib after subcutaneous&#xD;
      administration. On the other hand, a measurement tool like the QLQ-CIPN20 questionnaire&#xD;
      (EORTC) evaluating the intensity of sensory, motor and autonomic disorders associated with&#xD;
      CIPN has never been tested in this patient population. While the questionnaire is presented&#xD;
      as the most appropriate tool in the evaluation of CIPN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the exploration of peripheral neuropathies induced by bortezomib after subcutaneous&#xD;
      administration through QST (thermal) and QLQ-CIPN20 questionnaire would complement the&#xD;
      clinical knowledge of the CIPN. This knowledge will be essential to propose and test new&#xD;
      strategies for treatment and prevention of peripheral neuropathies induced by bortezomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is twofold: (i) psychophysical evaluation of neuropathic&#xD;
      disorders by studying the QST (thermal and vibratory sensory thresholds, thermal nociceptive&#xD;
      thresholds) and (ii) quantitative and qualitative assessment of neuropathic disorders by the&#xD;
      QLQ -CIPN20 questionnaire (EORTC) and associated comorbidities in patients treated with&#xD;
      bortezomib (subcutaneous administration).&#xD;
