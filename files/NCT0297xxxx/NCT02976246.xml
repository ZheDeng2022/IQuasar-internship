    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most frequent cause of death in patients (ptt.) with&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). Compared to the general population death due to CVD is 10-20&#xD;
      times higher in CKD ptt. being treated with hemodialysis. Vascular calcification and hence&#xD;
      arterial stiffness is of great importance for the high incidence of CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CKD ptt. in dialysis treatment also have a 3 times higher risk of bone fractures. Both&#xD;
      vertebral and other fractures of low energy are associated with a high mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Matrix Gla Protein (MGP) is an important inhibitor of vascular calcification and Osteocalcin&#xD;
      (OC) is an important regulator of bone metabolism. The function of both MGP and OC depend on&#xD;
      vitamin K.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin K is supplied with food. The content is low in food recommended to CKD ptt. which is&#xD;
      reflected in very low concentrations of vitamin K in their blood samples. A correlation&#xD;
      between vitamin K level, incidence of vascular calcification and bone density has been&#xD;
      proven; yet there are no trials elucidating the clinical effect of vitamin K on vascular&#xD;
      calcification or bone strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a randomized placebo controlled trial examining the clinical&#xD;
      effects of vitamin K2 on vascular calcification and bone mineralization in order to prevent&#xD;
      and treat CVD and bone disease in CKD ptt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Changes in arterial stiffness assessed by pulse wave examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Changes in bone mineral density (BMD) in distal radius assessed by DXA-scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in coronary artery and valvular calcification assessed by heart-CT-scans, blood&#xD;
      pressure, body composition, total and regional BMD, lateral column/aortic calcification score&#xD;
      as well as a panel of correlating blood tests.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular calcification is a significant problem among patients (ptt.) with chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease (CKD) and the prevalence of aortic calcification is twice as high as the general&#xD;
      population e.g. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most frequent cause of death in ptt. with&#xD;
      CKD. Death due to CVD is 10-20 times higher in CKD ptt. being treated with hemodialysis&#xD;
      compared to the background population. Whereas atherosclerosis is a dominating cause of CVD&#xD;
      in the general population CKD ptt. tend to develop medial calcification and hence arterial&#xD;
      stiffness which is thought to be of great importance in the high incidence of CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CKD ptt. in dialysis treatment also have a 3 times higher risk of bone fractures compared to&#xD;
      the general population. Both vertebral and other fractures of low energy are associated with&#xD;
      a high mortality in CKD ptt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The genesis of the arteriosclerosis is still unresolved but seems to be multifactorial. The&#xD;
      impaired kidney function itself and the treatment so far both seem to be of importance. The&#xD;
      vitamin K-dependent Gla proteins; Matrix Gla Protein (MGP) and Osteocalcin (OC) are described&#xD;
      as the most potent inhibitors of vascular calcification and osteoporosis. Until recently CKD&#xD;
      ptt. have been treated with vitamin K antagonists which just adds to the focus on vitamin K&#xD;
      in this progressive, vascular calcification- and bone demineralization process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin K is supplied with food. It consists of several subtypes, e.g. vitamin K1 which is&#xD;
      transformed into K2 during digestion. The recommended diet for CKD ptt. is low on vitamin K&#xD;
      which is reflected in very low concentrations of vitamin K in blood samples from CKD ptt. in&#xD;
      hemodialysis. A supplement of vitamin K1 or K2 will make activation possible for MGP and OC&#xD;
      by increasing the concentration of vitamin K2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A correlation between vitamin K level and incidence of vascular calcification in dialysis&#xD;
      ptt. has been proven; yet there are no trials elucidating the clinical effect of vitamin K on&#xD;
      vascular calcification in CKD ptt. There are not any trials elucidating the effect of vitamin&#xD;
      K on bone strength or number of fractures in dialysis ptt, although a relation between&#xD;
      vitamin K and bone mineral density in dialysis ptt. has been shown and a significant increase&#xD;
      in age related bone strength was found in a study by introducing a daily supplement of&#xD;
      vitamin K.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE AND HYPOYHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the clinical effect of vitamin K2(MK7) on arterial stiffness assessed by pulse&#xD;
      wave examination and bone mineral density assessed by DXA-scans in a group of dialysis ptt.&#xD;
      in order to be able to prevent and treat cardiovascular and bone disease in CKD ptt. in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that a daily supplement of vitamin K2 (MK7) will reduce the calcification&#xD;
      process in larger arteries, coronary arteries and -valves and hence reduce the risk of CVD as&#xD;
      well as increase the bone mineral density and hence the frequency of bone fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      RenaKvit is an investigator initiated, prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo&#xD;
      controlled intervention trial performed as a nationally, multicenter trial that will run for&#xD;
      2 years. Data will be compiled after 1 and 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is divided into two sub-studies; RenaKvit-kar (vessel) (n= 48) and RenaKvit-knogle&#xD;
      (bone) (n=123), in which the effect of vitamin K2(MK7) on larger arteries, coronary arteries-&#xD;
      and valves and the effect on bone with regards to bone mineral density and frequency of&#xD;
      fractures are respectively examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS AND RECRUITMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ptt. will be equally divided by randomization and hence daily be given a tablet of either&#xD;
      vitamin K2(MK7) or placebo. According to the criteria of inclusion ptt. will either join the&#xD;
      RenaKvit-vessel or the bone group. If criteria are fulfilled ptt. are to join both vessel and&#xD;
      bone groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determined by calculation of statistical power, incl. a level of significance of 5%, a&#xD;
      standard deviation of 0,95 and strength of 80%, a minimum of 40 ptt (RenaKvit-vessel) and 140&#xD;
      ptt. (RenaKvit-bone) will be included, thus taking potentially drop-outs in account. Both&#xD;
      ptt. in hemo- and peritoneal dialysis treatment will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ptt. will be recruited by the dialysis departments at Zealand University Hospital Roskilde,&#xD;
      Holbaek Hospitals, Aarhus University Hospital and Aalborg University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no fee for participating ptt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEDICINE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are given a daily tablet of either vitamin K 360 micrograms or placebo during a&#xD;
      period of 2 x 12 months. Both types of tablets will be of similar look and content, besides&#xD;
      vitamin K2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulse Wave examination: Includes both pulse wave analysis and pulse wave velocity&#xD;
           measurements. Done by using SphygmoCorÂ©-pulse wave apparatus. Pulse wave examination is&#xD;
           used as a measure of the arterial stiffness and is performed after standardized method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour blood pressure and blood pressure measurements: Done by current Danish&#xD;
           guidelines (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coronary artery and -valve calcification: Assessed by CT-scans of the heart using the&#xD;
           Agatston Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone Mineral Density: Assessed by DEXA-scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lateral lumbal x- ray and aortic calcification score: A semi-quantitative scoring system&#xD;
           used to describe the plaques on the front and the back of the aorta level with each&#xD;
           level of the lumbar vertebrae. The method has been found to be predictive of vascular&#xD;
           morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measuring predictors/establishing a biobank: Partly as &quot;routine tests&quot; during dialysis&#xD;
           and partly as special kits developed at Vejle Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will have descriptive statistics performed for as well as the presentation of the&#xD;
      total population, stratified for gender, age and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal-distributed data will be expressed as mean value +/- standard deviation (SD), while&#xD;
      other distributed data also will be expressed as median values (interquartile range;&#xD;
      interquartile range, IQR). Categorical values will be expressed in numbers and percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal-distributed variables will be compared with Student's t-test. Where found appropriate,&#xD;
      logarithmic transformation shall be performed. Non-normally distributed variables will be&#xD;
      compared with the Mann Whitney U test. Categorical values are to be compared with the Chi&#xD;
      Square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes within the treatment groups over time will be analyzed by paired analysis, and&#xD;
      between the treatment groups compared with the non-paired analysis. Forward stepwise&#xD;
      multivariate logistic regression analysis is carried out to correct significant confounders&#xD;
      of the primary and secondary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of Cox proportional hazards will be performed from time to first clinical event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pâ¤0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All results - negative and positive -&#xD;
      are expected to be published in peer-review magazines.&#xD;
