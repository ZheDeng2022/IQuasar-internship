      The main purpose of this study is to unravel the mechanisms by which the &quot;Low Viral Reservoir&#xD;
      Treated&quot; patients (LoViReT) maintain extremely low HIV-1 DNA levels despite having initiated&#xD;
      cART during chronic HIV-1 infection. This group may have specific and different clinical,&#xD;
      virological and immunogenetical characteristics, compared to patients with regular reservoir&#xD;
      size, which might be useful to design new and more effective treatment approaches.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is highly successful suppressing HIV-1 replication&#xD;
      and clinical progression in infected patients. However, it does not hamper the establishment&#xD;
      of viral reservoirs, generating latently infected cells that provoke a quick rebound of HIV&#xD;
      viremia after treatment interruption. Different strategies to tackle HIV-1 reservoirs have&#xD;
      been suggested during last years with limited success. Actually, the few cases of described&#xD;
      HIV-1 functional cure are found in elite and post-treatment controllers. Thus, some patients&#xD;
      with regular HIV progression can control replication spontaneously, most of them after&#xD;
      receiving cART during primary HIV-1 infection. Indeed, the &quot;Mississippi baby&quot;, who was&#xD;
      treated 36h after birth, had sustained undetectable viremia for 27 months after treatment&#xD;
      interruption. Recently, it has also been proven in successfully treated patients that low&#xD;
      proviral reservoir is related to better HIV-1 control after treatment discontinuation. Thus,&#xD;
      the identification of patients with lower latent reservoir in chronic infection will allow&#xD;
      unveiling potential mechanisms to achieve a functional cure after cART withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our center in Badalona allocates a biological sample collection containing 72,000 specimens&#xD;
      from HIV-1-infected subjects. Samples from 319 patients under suppressive cART for more than&#xD;
      3 years have been screened using the high sensitive BioRad droplet digital Polymerase Chain&#xD;
      Reaction platform (ddPCR). Among the screened patients, a cohort of 20 &quot;Low Viral Reservoir&#xD;
      Treated&quot; patients (LoViReT) with extremely low or undetectable HIV-1 DNA levels in peripheral&#xD;
      blood despite having initiated cART during chronic HIV-1 infection have been established,&#xD;
      which is expected to be increased up to 40 patients. Discovering the factors that reduce HIV&#xD;
      reservoir and make LoViReT patients maintain extremely low levels of proviral HIV-1 DNA will&#xD;
      open new treatment strategies based on maintaining the reservoir to the lowest levels beside&#xD;
      the regular clinical marker of viral load. In addition, a further second step of controlled&#xD;
      cART interruption can be designed to evaluate the real impact of harboring extremely low&#xD;
      levels of latent reservoir for further functional HIV cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To unravel the mechanisms by which the LoViReT cohort maintain extremely low HIV-1 DNA levels&#xD;
      despite having initiated cART during chronic HIV-1 infection, this cohort will be studied&#xD;
      from different points of view. All the results will be compared to a control group of 40&#xD;
      individuals with standard levels of total HIV DNA (reservoir). Three mayor aims will be&#xD;
      addressed to then extrapolate our results to larger chronic HIV-1-infected populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the role of cART on the suppression of the HIV reservoir in the LoViReT&#xD;
           patients, compared to controls. To address this objective, a longitudinal analysis of&#xD;
           proviral HIV DNA for each patient will be performed, including time points previous to&#xD;
           cART. In total, 200 samples will be analyzed and dynamic models will be built for the&#xD;
           two different levels of reservoir establishment. General immune phenotype of cellular&#xD;
           populations, including also activation markers, will be also assessed in all time&#xD;
           points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the integrity of HIV sequences in the LoViReT patients and its&#xD;
           relationship with pathogenesis, in comparison to controls. Genotypic HIV tropism and the&#xD;
           full viral genome will be analyzed through sequencing from DNA of patients' Peripheral&#xD;
           Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC). Fresh blood samples will be taken from the 40 LoViReT&#xD;
           and 40 control patients in the study. In addition, for those exerting virus production,&#xD;
           viral isolates will be used to analyze viral replication capacity and cell pathogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the role of immune-genetic factors that along with cART contribute to&#xD;
           reduce the HIV reservoirs in the LoViReT patients. Functional T-cell response will be&#xD;
           measured isolating CD8 T cells and measuring the inhibition capacity for HIV replication&#xD;
           in each patient. Specific HIV-related CD8 T-cell interferon production will be also&#xD;
           evaluated under epitope stimulus. Other progression associated genetic factors as Human&#xD;
           Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) type, and CCR5, CCR2 and SIGLEC-1 Single Nucleotide&#xD;
           Polymorphisms (SNPs) will be also explored.&#xD;
