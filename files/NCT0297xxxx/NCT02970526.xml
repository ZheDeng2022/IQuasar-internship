  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will evaluate the neurotoxic effects of oxaliplatin. Oxaliplatin is considered&#xD;
      the most neurotoxic chemotherapy, and at the origin of peripheral neuropathies. These&#xD;
      neuropathies remain a problem in oncology because currently no prevention strategy has proved&#xD;
      effective and only duloxetine seems to have a therapeutic benefit in improving symptoms. In&#xD;
      the case of oxaliplatin, neuropathy forced oncologists to reduce the dose or to stop the&#xD;
      chemotherapy, potentially degrading the oncological prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of this study will be to assess, on a large number of patients (n&gt; 500) who&#xD;
      completed adjuvant chemotherapy (FOLFOX), the intensity of neuropathic disorders out of 5&#xD;
      years after the end of chemotherapy. Furthermore, this study should enable an assessment of&#xD;
      the relationship between the intensity of neuropathy and comorbidities, such as anxiety and&#xD;
      depression and health related quality of life of patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxaliplatin remains the reference treatment of advanced colorectal cancer and more broadly of&#xD;
      digestive cancers, incorporated in the FOLFOX protocol (folinic acid, 5-Fu, Oxaliplatin). But&#xD;
      oxaliplatin chemotherapy is certainly the most neurotoxic, as on average 90% of patients&#xD;
      develop acute neuropathic disorders (within hours or days of the infusion) and 30% to 50% of&#xD;
      patients develop a chronic neuropathy with repeated cycles of chemotherapy. The neuropathic&#xD;
      grade and duration of symptoms remain variable across studies. Although symptoms improve with&#xD;
      time, long-term studies suggest a persistent neuropathy beyond 24 months. Moreover,&#xD;
      Vatandoust and colleagues suggest that chemotherapy-induced neuropathy is more frequent and&#xD;
      severe over the long term (≥ 12 months) than in previous works published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cancer survivors, neuropathy induced by oxaliplatin has a deleterious impact on their&#xD;
      quality of life. But, few studies are available on the consequences of oxaliplatin-induced&#xD;
      neuropathy in these patients, while these patients remain, in 2003, the third largest group&#xD;
      of cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only 7 studies have specifically evaluated neuropathic disorders induced by oxaliplatin after&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Moreover, as pointed Vatandoust and colleagues, there is a real need to&#xD;
      understand the long term effects of this chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. More specifically,&#xD;
      only two studies have evaluated the effects of neuropathy on quality of life and&#xD;
      comorbidities of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of this study will be to assess, on a large number of patients (n&gt; 500) who&#xD;
      completed adjuvant chemotherapy (FOLFOX), the intensity of neuropathic disorders out of 5&#xD;
      years after the end of chemotherapy. Furthermore, this study should enable an assessment of&#xD;
      the relationship between the intensity of neuropathy and comorbidities, such as anxiety and&#xD;
      depression and health related quality of life of patients.&#xD;
