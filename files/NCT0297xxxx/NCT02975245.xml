      This study will determine the short-term effects of chemotherapy on sperm DNA.The study&#xD;
      involves the collection of semen sample through ejaculation prior to initiation of&#xD;
      chemotherapy and up to three time points after initiation of chemotherapy.&#xD;

      While medical advances in the area of cancer treatment have successfully improved the overall&#xD;
      detection and treatment of many cancers affecting men and women alike, these very treatment&#xD;
      modalities can adversely affect their reproductive capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certain types of chemotherapy, such as alkylating agents, are notorious for placing patients&#xD;
      at high risk for infertility. For men, the best recommendation for patients undergoing such&#xD;
      therapy is to cryopreserve semen prior to initiation of chemotherapy. Unfortunately, this may&#xD;
      not always occur. Some patients have been noted to present to discuss fertility preservation&#xD;
      options after completing their first cycle of chemotherapy. In this situation, they will most&#xD;
      likely still have sperm which was produced prior to chemotherapy that can be collected even&#xD;
      if the stem cells producing the sperm have been damaged or destroyed. However, there are no&#xD;
      national guidelines addressing this particular situation. Typically, physicians may advise&#xD;
      men to avoid conception anywhere from three months to two years after the final dose of&#xD;
      chemotherapy to ensure all exposed germ cells have passed through and only newly formed germ&#xD;
      cells remain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is crucial to further assess the effects of chemotherapeutic agents on male germ cells in&#xD;
      the short window of time between exposure and potential sterility. If a safe time frame could&#xD;
      be determined to collect sperm after a single dose of chemotherapy, then these men could be&#xD;
      given a second chance to retain their fertility potential.&#xD;
