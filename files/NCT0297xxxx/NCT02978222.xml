    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, parallel groups Phase II trial. Patients with&#xD;
      platinum-sensitive advanced ovarian cancer, defined as a lack of progression by RECIST v1.1&#xD;
      criteria following completion of standard-of-care chemotherapy, including a minimum of 4&#xD;
      cycles of a platinum-containing regimen. Patients will be randomized to either the vaccine&#xD;
      regimen with GM-CSF adjuvant or GM-CSF adjuvant alone as a control group. Treatment will be&#xD;
      administered as a consolidation therapy within one year of the last administration of&#xD;
      platinum, targeting the first remission.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter double-blind controlled randomized Phase II study to evaluate the&#xD;
      activity of folate receptor alpha (FRα) peptide vaccine as a consolidation treatment&#xD;
      following completion of no less than 4 cycles of a platinum containing regimen in patients&#xD;
      with platinum-sensitive, non-mucinous ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will have demonstrated a tumor response or stable disease upon their last&#xD;
      regimen (per RECIST v1.1 and/or CA125 GCIG criteria) prior to enrolment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following randomization, patients will be administered TPIV200 with GM-CSF adjuvant or GM-CSF&#xD;
      control alone. Patients will have booster doses and tumor assessments done every 12 weeks ± 1&#xD;
      week for up to 1.5 years, until objective disease progression or the patient withdraws&#xD;
      consent. Tumor responses will be assessed at the study sites by evaluating tumor images/scans&#xD;
      according to RECIST v1.1.&#xD;
