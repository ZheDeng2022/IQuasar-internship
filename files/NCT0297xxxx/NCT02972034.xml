  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of MK-8353 when&#xD;
      administered in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475). There are two parts in this study:&#xD;
      Part 1 will be dose escalation and confirmation, and Part 2 will be a cohort expansion. In&#xD;
      Part 1, the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of MK-8353 in combination with a fixed dose of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in participants with advanced malignancies will be identified and confirmed.&#xD;
      Participants will be initially enrolled to receive MK-8353 at 350 mg twice a day (BID) in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab at a fixed dose of 200 mg on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle (Q3W)&#xD;
      for up to 24 months of treatment. In Part 2, participants with advanced colorectal cancer&#xD;
      (CRC) that is microsatellite stable (i.e., non-microsatellite instability-high/deficient&#xD;
      mismatch repair [non-MSI-H/dMMR]) who received at least one and up to five prior lines of&#xD;
      therapy will be enrolled at the RP2D in the expansion cohort to further evaluate safety and&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol has been amended to lower the starting doses of MK-8353 in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. In addition, 3 arms have been added: one in which MK-8353 will be administered&#xD;
      continuously once a day (QD) in combination with pembrolizumab, one optional arm in which&#xD;
      MK-8353 will be administered 1 week on/1 week off QD in combination with pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      one optional arm in which participants undergo a MK-8353 QD run-in period prior to starting&#xD;
      combination therapy with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
