      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoking is a major public health problem in the U.S. Almost a half a million Americans die&#xD;
      from it in a year. One thing that contributes to why people smoke is the marketing of&#xD;
      cigarettes. Cigarette direct mail marketing usually targets young smokers of lower&#xD;
      socioeconomic status. Researchers want to find out more about how this kind of marketing&#xD;
      influences smoking behavior in young people from different socioeconomic levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the effects of cigarette direct mail marketing on beliefs, responses, and arousal.&#xD;
      To study how these things may differ among young adult smokers of high and low socioeconomic&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18 to 29 who smoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 1 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked questions about their health and recent smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A nurse will check their vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a simple eye exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will give blood and urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be connected to equipment. This will collect data while they look at&#xD;
      pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then they will have a 10-minute break. A nurse will observe them during the break.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have their breath analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will answer questions. The topics will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Education&#xD;
&#xD;
      Job&#xD;
&#xD;
      Income&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tobacco use&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure to pro-smoking and anti-smoking messages&#xD;
&#xD;
      History of drug and alcohol use&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking remains a public health problem in the US, and cigarette marketing has been concluded&#xD;
      as one of the causal factors for the epidemic. Previous studies on cigarette direct mail&#xD;
      marketing yielded a limited data on mechanisms influencing smoking behavior. Therefore, there&#xD;
      is a need for a study that would provide a stronger evidence on how direct mail marketing&#xD;
      influences smoking behavior. The prosed study will consist of two parts where pilot data are&#xD;
      to be collected in Part 1, and further data are to be collected in Part 2 conducted as a&#xD;
      randomized comparative trial. Up to a total of 530 healthy volunteers ages 18-29 are to be&#xD;
      recruited for the study. After meeting the eligibility and enrolling onto the study,&#xD;
      participants will have their biospecimens collected followed by an experiment in which they&#xD;
      are to be shown images on the computer. Study participants will then take a break and&#xD;
      afterwards will provide additional sociodemographic and psychosocial information through an&#xD;
      audio computer assisted self-administered interview.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: 18 to 29 years, given our focus on young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Smoking status: Current smokers who report smoking every day and who have smoked at&#xD;
             least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime with a breath carbon monoxide level greater&#xD;
             than 6ppm per device guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SES: For the purpose of the study, we will use the empirical groups from our analysis&#xD;
             of the Current Population Survey -Tobacco Use Supplement data. Two groups are chosen&#xD;
             based on their social determinants and prevalence of smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Low SES: Young adults who do not have a four-year college degree, are not&#xD;
                  currently enrolled in a four-year college, were born in the US, and have an&#xD;
                  annual income less than $50,000. This is the group that has been shown to have&#xD;
                  the highest prevalence of smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. High SES: Young adults who are currently enrolled in or graduated from a four&#xD;
                  year college. This is the group that has been shown to have the lowest prevalence&#xD;
                  of smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English proficiency: since study materials are available only in English, only&#xD;
             participants who are able to understand English and follow instructions in English are&#xD;
             to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitive ability: Able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
             document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  General health: Participants need to be generally healthy, as defined as someone with&#xD;
             no known significant health problems. Participants can have chronic health conditions&#xD;
             if the condition is well managed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability, in the judgment of the investigator, to understand and follow the&#xD;
             requirements of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently enrolled in high school.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with eye conditions that restrict their ability to track an object with&#xD;
             their eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with myopia, hyperopia, and/or astigmatism who cannot pass a simple&#xD;
             vision test even with corrective lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with medical condition(s) that may be triggered by infrared radiation&#xD;
             (e.g., epilepsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Self-reported use of alcohol, recreational drugs or prescription medications used for&#xD;
             recreational purposes (e. g. amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, MDMA, ketamines, LSD,&#xD;
             opiates and opioids, tranquilizers or opioid analgesics) that may influence their&#xD;
             judgement at the time of study in the past 12 hours before the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who cannot see an object located between 15 to 27 inches away from them&#xD;
             (the required distance between the computer screen and the participants for accurate&#xD;
             eye-tracking), even with corrective contact lenses.&#xD;
