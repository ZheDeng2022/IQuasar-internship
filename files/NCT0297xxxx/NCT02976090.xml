      Despite the fact that small intestine makes up 75% of the length of the digestive tract and&#xD;
      90% of its mucosal surface area, small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) is rare. SBA is not equally&#xD;
      dispatched along the small bowel, a predisposing disease is frequently associated. All these&#xD;
      data suggest particular carcinogenesis pathway. SBA carries poor prognosis at all stages and&#xD;
      no standard treatment have proved efficacy. So far, no data are available for targeted&#xD;
      therapy. From the literature and a previous study of our group some biologic data showed that&#xD;
      SBA carcinogenesis is closer to colorectal than gastric carcinogenesis. Nevertheless, some&#xD;
      differences arise (ie: low Adenomatous Polyposis Coli mutation rate or frequent DNA mismatch&#xD;
      repair deficiency). Even if some trends are founded the prognostic value of molecular&#xD;
      alteration and phenotype variation according to small bowel segment, or predisposing disease&#xD;
      could not been demonstrate due to small sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIONADEGE study is a planned biologic ancillary study of the NADEGE cohort that enrolled 366&#xD;
      patients with SBA from 2009 to 2012 in France. The tumour blocks and clinical data of 187&#xD;
      patients have been collected. The main objective is to assess the prognostic value for&#xD;
      recurrence free survival (RFS) in non-metastatic patients and overall survival (OS) in&#xD;
      metastatic patients of molecular alteration in a set of 46 genes and abnormal protein&#xD;
      expression potentially implicated in carcinogenesis. The mains secondary objectives are: 1)&#xD;
      to identify potential mutation targetable in small intestine tumours and protein expression,&#xD;
      2) to state the frequency of molecular alteration according to the tumour location, stage or&#xD;
      predisposing disease and established clinico-biologic correlation. Tissue microarrays will be&#xD;
      performed and several potential prognostic markers will be assessed. Sequencing on tumour DNA&#xD;
      will investigate the presence of 740 hot spot somatic mutations in 46 genes involved.The&#xD;
      abnormal protein expression or the genetic alterations with an expected frequency superior to&#xD;
      10% will be assessed as potential prognostic factor to RFS and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These evaluations on a large cohort could allow comparison between pathways and will offer&#xD;
      better knowledge of tumour molecular phenotype and prognosis will give rational for targeted&#xD;
      therapy trials The predisposing diseases for SBA involved several different carcinogenesis&#xD;
      pathways. Finally, a molecular classification of SBA will be attempt.&#xD;

      The NADEGE cohort involves 75 centres and had enrolled 365 patients. Among them 232 patients&#xD;
      had a resection of the primary tumour in 58 centres. This will is be the largest series in&#xD;
      the world of SBA for biological study. The patients enrolled in the NADEGE cohort were aware&#xD;
      of the biologic study and their authorisation to perform is already collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline clinical data of patients enrolled in NADEGE cohort are already available and were&#xD;
      presented in a poster discussion session at the European Society for Medical Oncology&#xD;
      congress 2013. In all the cohort the primary location was duodenum in 51% of the patients,&#xD;
      and a predisposing disease was reported in 18.8% of the patient mainly Crohn disease in 8%&#xD;
      and Lynch syndrome in 6% of the patients. The follow-up is ongoing. The analyses of 3-years&#xD;
      recurrence-free survival is planned in 2015 and the analysis of 5-years overall survival in&#xD;
      2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today 187 tumour sample are collected and archived in the pathology department of Saint&#xD;
      Antoine hospital (Paris). Among these 187 tumours the tumour stage are: stage 0: 4, stage I:&#xD;
      10, stage II: 34, stage III: 63, undetermined stage non-metastatic: 30 (thus 141&#xD;
      non-metastatic tumours) and stage IV: 48, and the primary are: duodenum: 128, jejunum: 31,&#xD;
      ileon: 27, undetermined: 3. The chemotherapy performed was FOLFOX in 80% of the cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Package 1: Database (team 1) The clinical data of NADEGE cohort are collected with an&#xD;
      e-crf. The initial descriptive data are already monitored by the GERCOR team. The results&#xD;
      have been already presented. BIONADEGE is a planned ancillary study of the NADEGE cohort. The&#xD;
      complementary queries for the purpose of BIONADEGE will be addressed by the team 1 to the&#xD;
      NADEGE investigator. The follow-up data for progression (metastatic patients), recurrence&#xD;
      (non-metastatic patient) and death (all patients) will be obtained every 6 months. Follow-up&#xD;
      data will be collected until 2019 in order to obtain 5-years follow-up for all the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Package 2: Anatomopathology (team 2) All the tumour samples are already bank in the&#xD;
      pathology laboratory of Saint Antoine hospital. Slides from representative tumour area will&#xD;
      be selected and send to Paris Descartes university to allow DNA extraction. Tissue&#xD;
      microarrays (TMA) for immunohistochemistry validation studies will be performed. Several&#xD;
      potential prognostic markers will be assessed as MismatchRepair (MMR) protein, P53,&#xD;
      beta-catenin, c-myc protein. Other predictive markers for chemotherapy as hENT1,&#xD;
      O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) and for targeted therapy as Proto-oncogene&#xD;
      tyrosine-protein kinase (ROS1), hepatocyte growth factor receptor c-Met (HGFR), Alk, Human&#xD;
      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-2 (HER-2) and Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) will also be&#xD;
      assessed. The cases overexpressing HER-2 and HGFR protein by immunohistochemistry will be&#xD;
      tested by Fluorescent In Situ Hybridisation (FISH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Package 3: Biochemistry (team 3) DNA will be extracted from tumour block in the&#xD;
      university unit S1147 according to the following protocol. Using a 1.0-mm punch, paraffin&#xD;
      embedded tissues from all cases will be sampled from representative areas that will contain&#xD;
      more than 50% of tumour cells. DNA will be thereafter extracted from each sample following&#xD;
      the manufacturer's recommendation. The team3 will use a competitive allele specific taqman&#xD;
      probe designed on Kras wild type allele (Hs.00000174-rf - Life Technologies) on serial&#xD;
      dilution of each DNA sample in order to quantify amplifiable DNA. Only samples with more than&#xD;
      10 ng of amplifiable DNA will be retained for the sequencing. DNA from each sample will be&#xD;
      amplified. The presence of more than 740 hot spot somatic mutations in the 46 genes will be&#xD;
      investigate. Data analysis, including alignment to the hg19 human reference genome and&#xD;
      variant calling, will be done using the Software of Life Technologies. Alignments will be&#xD;
      visually verified and annotated with the software of Integrative Biosoftware. A sequence&#xD;
      variation will be considered as a potential mutation if (i) the coverage is superior to 200×,&#xD;
      (ii) the allelic frequency is superior to 10%, (iii) the strand bias is from 0.2 to 0.8, (iv)&#xD;
      the variation is not reported in the 1000 genomes database, (v) the variation is a missense&#xD;
      or a non-sense variation. All these selected variations will be controlled using the Sanger&#xD;
      sequencing technics using amplified fragments of less than 150 bp centred on the potential&#xD;
      mutation.&#xD;
