  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to 1) determine whether Mindfulness Training for Primary Care&#xD;
      (see study &quot;MINDFUL-PC: Integrating Mindfulness Into the Patient-Centered Medical Home - A&#xD;
      Pilot Study&quot;) engages self-regulation targets such as emotion regulation, attention, and&#xD;
      interoceptive awareness; and 2) changes brain activation in neuroimaging tasks before&#xD;
      compared to after the training. Neuroimaging fMRI tasks probe mechanisms related to&#xD;
      self-regulation, such as attention/inhibition, emotion regulation, self-compassion,&#xD;
      interoception and pain regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also look at whether chronic disease self-management and successful engagement&#xD;
      of self-report and behavioral self-regulation targets (emotion regulation, attention, and&#xD;
      interoceptive awareness) relates to the observed brain activation changes after compared to&#xD;
      before the mindfulness intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study aims to test brain activation changes related to self-regulation targets of&#xD;
      attention, emotion regulation, self-compassion, interoception and pain regulation that are&#xD;
      influenced by mindfulness training within primary care (compare MINDFUL-PC study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also look at whether successful chronic disease self-management relates to the&#xD;
      observed brain activation changes after compared to before the mindfulness intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will examine the relationship between mindfulness training within primary care and&#xD;
      medical regimen adherence (initiation and maintenance) as well as the underlying neural&#xD;
      correlates associated with changes in self-regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-arm pilot trial, recruiting from a randomized controlled trial (see&#xD;
      MINDFUL-PC study). .&#xD;
