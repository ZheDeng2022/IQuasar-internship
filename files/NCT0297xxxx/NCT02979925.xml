    <measure>Evaluation of Spontaneous Pain Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed during each of the subject's baseline visit, 1 week post treatment visit, and 4 weeks post treatment visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Spontaneous pain rating: Spontaneous pain level will be measured by using a sliding algometer, known as the Mechanical Visual Analog Scale (M-VAS). The device has been well validated, and is anchored at the left by &quot;no pain sensation&quot; and at the right by &quot;the most intense pain sensation imaginable.&quot; The corresponding length of the red bar with a scale from 0 to 100, which can be read on the back by the tester, represents the subject's intensity of pain. 0 represents &quot;no pain sensation&quot; and 100 represents &quot;the most intense pain sensation imaginable.&quot; A lower value indicates a better outcome with lower levels of pain reported.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of Evoked Pain Scores: Stroking</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed during each of the subject's baseline visit, 1 week post treatment visit, and 4 weeks post treatment visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Stroking evoked pain will be assessed by gently moving a paintbrush over the site of PTNP. The patients will be asked if pain is felt. If so, the intensity of pain will be rated on a scale known as the Mechanical Visual Analog Scale (M-VAS). The device has been well validated, and is anchored at the left by &quot;no pain sensation&quot; and at the right by &quot;the most intense pain sensation imaginable.&quot; The corresponding length of the red bar with a scale from 0 to 100, which can be read on the back by the tester, represents the subject's intensity of pain. 0 represents &quot;no pain sensation&quot; and 100 represents &quot;the most intense pain sensation imaginable.&quot; A lower value indicates a better outcome with lower levels of pain reported.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of Evoked Pain Scores: Von Frey</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed during each of the subject's baseline visit, 1 week post treatment visit, and 4 weeks post treatment visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Punctate evoked pain will be conducted by gently pressing a 5.18 von Frey monofilament against the site of PTNP. The patients will be asked if pain is felt. If so, the intensity of pain will be rated on a scale known as the Mechanical Visual Analog Scale (M-VAS). The device has been well validated, and is anchored at the left by &quot;no pain sensation&quot; and at the right by &quot;the most intense pain sensation imaginable.&quot; The corresponding length of the red bar with a scale from 0 to 100, which can be read on the back by the tester, represents the subject's intensity of pain. 0 represents &quot;no pain sensation&quot; and 100 represents &quot;the most intense pain sensation imaginable.&quot; A lower value indicates a better outcome with lower levels of pain reported.</description>

        <title>Evaluation of Evoked Pain Scores: Von Frey</title>
        <description>Punctate evoked pain will be conducted by gently pressing a 5.18 von Frey monofilament against the site of PTNP. The patients will be asked if pain is felt. If so, the intensity of pain will be rated on a scale known as the Mechanical Visual Analog Scale (M-VAS). The device has been well validated, and is anchored at the left by &quot;no pain sensation&quot; and at the right by &quot;the most intense pain sensation imaginable.&quot; The corresponding length of the red bar with a scale from 0 to 100, which can be read on the back by the tester, represents the subject's intensity of pain. 0 represents &quot;no pain sensation&quot; and 100 represents &quot;the most intense pain sensation imaginable.&quot; A lower value indicates a better outcome with lower levels of pain reported.</description>
        <time_frame>Assessed during each of the subject's baseline visit, 1 week post treatment visit, and 4 weeks post treatment visit.</time_frame>
