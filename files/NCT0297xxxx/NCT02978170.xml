  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) works in&#xD;
      guiding bronchoscopy in patients with lung lesions. CBCT during bronchoscopy may help doctors&#xD;
      to biopsy lung lesions that are harder to reach.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the feasibility of using CBCT as an additional aid to guided-bronchoscopy with&#xD;
      radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (RP-EBUS)/hybrid scope for the diagnosis of peripheral&#xD;
      lung nodules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Describe the proportion of patients with peripheral nodules undergoing bronchoscopy in&#xD;
      whom the lesion is identified by RP-EBUS (RP-EBUS-navigation yield) and confirmed with CBCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Describe the proportion of patients with peripheral nodules undergoing bronchoscopy in&#xD;
      whom the lesion is identified by RP-EBUS and samples are diagnostic (diagnostic&#xD;
      yield-RP-EBUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Describe the proportion of patients with peripheral nodules undergoing bronchoscopy in&#xD;
      whom the lesion is identified by RP-EBUS, samples were non-diagnostic, and CBCT prompted&#xD;
      further tool re-location (i.e. change of needle angle, change of tool) leading to diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Describe the proportion of patients with peripheral nodules undergoing bronchoscopy in&#xD;
      whom the lesion is not identified by RP-EBUS, and CBCT-aided navigation allowed the operator&#xD;
      to reach the lesion (CBCT-added navigation yield).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Describe the proportion of patients with peripheral nodules undergoing bronchoscopy in&#xD;
      whom the lesion is not identified by RP-EBUS and CBCT-aided navigation allowed the operator&#xD;
      to reach the lesion and obtain a diagnosis (CBCT-added diagnostic yield).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Describe the relationship between RP-PROBE and target (contact/no contact;&#xD;
      central/peripheral).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Describe the relationship between needle tip and target (contact/no contact;&#xD;
      central/peripheral).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Describe the influence of points 6 and 7 on diagnostic yield. IX. Describe fluoroscopy&#xD;
      time. X. Describe estimated amount of radiation generated by CBCT use. XI. Describe&#xD;
      bronchoscopy time (first scope in/last scope out). XII. Describe the proportion of patients&#xD;
      in whom molecular analysis for lung cancer (i.e. EGFR, K-RAS, ALK) can be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo CBCT during standard of care bronchoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients with lesions found not to be cancerous are followed up&#xD;
      for 6 months to watch for changes (standard care).&#xD;
