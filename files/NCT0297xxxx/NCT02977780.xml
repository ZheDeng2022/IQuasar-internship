      This research study is studying several investigational drugs as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      Glioblastoma (GBM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abemaciclib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temozolomide (temodar)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neratinib&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the study drug works in&#xD;
      treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking to compare the effects, good and bad,&#xD;
      of the standard of care with the three investigational agent sub-studies Abemaciclib,&#xD;
      Neratinib, CC115 to help people with Glioblastoma including the specific molecular changes in&#xD;
      the genes and proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has approved Temozolomide (temodar) as a treatment for this disease, however the FDA&#xD;
      has not approved Abemaciclib, CC115, Neratinib for any diseases.&#xD;
