      The purpose of this study is to compare two types of acupuncture with usual care on treating&#xD;
      chronic pain. This study has three groups. Two groups will received acupuncture. One group&#xD;
      will receive usual standard of care for 12 weeks and then will receive acupuncture.&#xD;
      Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese technique of using very thin needles inserted in the skin&#xD;
      to treat different symptoms and illness, and to promote healing. Each group will undergo a&#xD;
      different method of needle administration.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive 10 treatment of Electro-Acupuncture over the course of 10 weeks (with a maximum of 2 treatments per week). The acupuncturist will insert acupuncture needles in at least 4 local points around the body with the most pain and at least 4 distant points to address the patient's baseline constitution. The needles will be electrically stimulate at 2 Hz by connecting to a TENS unit. The needles will be in place for 30 minutes.</description>
