    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Change in Total NAFLD (Non- Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease) Activity Score (NAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants who had worsened, improved or had no change in total NAS from baseline to week 72 is presented. Worsening is defined as an increase of at least 1 in the NAS; Improvement is defined as a decrease of at least 1 in the NAS; while no change corresponds to no change in NAS from baseline to week 72. NAS is calculated as the sum of scores for steatosis (0 to 3), lobular inflammation (0 to 3), and hepatocyte ballooning (0 to 2). Therefore, it is assessed on a scale of 0-8, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from in-trial period which started on the date of the randomisation visit and ended on the first of the following dates (both inclusive): 1) follow-up visit (Week 79); 2) withdrawal of consent; 3) last contact with participant (for participants lost to follow-up); 4) death.</description>

    <measure>Change in NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>Change in NFS from baseline to week 72 is presented. NFS is calculated using formula: NFS = -1.675 + 0.037 * age (years) + 0.094 * body mass index (BMI) (kg/m^2) + 1.13 * hyperglycaemia (yes/no) + 0.99 * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio + 0.013 × platelet count (*10^9/L) - 0.66 * albumin (g/dL). The score is used to classify the probability of fibrosis. A score a) &lt; -1.5 indicates a low probability, b) &gt; -1.5 to &lt; 0.67 indicates intermediate probability, and a score of c) &gt; 0.67 indicates a high probability of liver fibrosis. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from in-trial period which started on the date of the randomisation visit and ended on the first of the following dates (both inclusive): 1) follow-up visit (Week 79); 2) withdrawal of consent; 3) last contact with participant (for participants lost to follow-up); 4) death.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>Change in liver steatosis assessed by FibroScan® from baseline to week 72 is presented. FibroScan® is a specialized ultrasound machine for the liver. It measures fibrosis (scarring) and steatosis (fatty change) in the liver. Fatty change is fat building up in the liver cells. To assess liver steatosis, the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP; giving an estimate of ultrasound attenuation ∼3.5 MegaHertz (MHz)) is available with the M probe of the FibroScan. The CAP score is measured in decibels per meter (dB/m). It ranges from 100 to 400 dB/m, with higher scores indicating higher amount of liver with fatty change.

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Non- Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Resolution Without Worsening of Fibrosis After 72 Weeks (Yes/No)</title>
        <description>NASH resolution defined by NASH clinical research network as lobular inflammation of 0 or 1 and hepatocellular ballooning reduced to 0; both criteria were necessary conditions. Hepatocellular ballooning ranges from 0-2; lobular inflammation ranges from 0-3, with higher scores indicating more severe hepatocellular ballooning or lobular inflammation. Worsening of fibrosis defined by an increase in fibrosis at least one stage of Kleiner fibrosis classification: fibrosis stages range from 0-4, with higher scores indicating greater fibrosis (0=None, 4=Cirrhosis). Endpoint was evaluated based on data from in-trial period which started on date of randomisation visit and ended on first of following dates (both inclusive):1) follow-up visit (Week 79); 2) withdrawal of consent; 3) last contact with participant (for participants lost to follow-up); 4) death.</description>

Overall number of participants analysed = Number of participants with fibrosis stage 2 or 3 at baseline who contributed to the analysis. In below table, 'Yes' infers percentage of participants who achieved NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis and 'No' infers vice-versa; 'Missing' refers to percentage of participants with data missing due to different reasons (lost to follow-up, withdrawal).</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Change in Total NAFLD (Non- Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease) Activity Score (NAS)</title>
        <description>Percentage of participants who had worsened, improved or had no change in total NAS from baseline to week 72 is presented. Worsening is defined as an increase of at least 1 in the NAS; Improvement is defined as a decrease of at least 1 in the NAS; while no change corresponds to no change in NAS from baseline to week 72. NAS is calculated as the sum of scores for steatosis (0 to 3), lobular inflammation (0 to 3), and hepatocyte ballooning (0 to 2). Therefore, it is assessed on a scale of 0-8, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from in-trial period which started on the date of the randomisation visit and ended on the first of the following dates (both inclusive): 1) follow-up visit (Week 79); 2) withdrawal of consent; 3) last contact with participant (for participants lost to follow-up); 4) death.</description>

        <title>Change in Fibrosis-4 Score</title>
        <description>Change in fibrosis-4 score is presented as ratio to baseline. Fibrosis-4 is the ratio of age in years and aminotransferase to platelet count. It is a non-invasive hepatic fibrosis index score combining standard biochemical values, platelets, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), AST and age that is calculated using formula: Fibrosis-4 = (Age [years] x AST [U/L]) / (platelets [10^9/L] x (square root of ALT [U/L])). A Fibrosis-4 index of &lt; 1.45 indicated no or moderate fibrosis and an index of &gt; 3.25 indicated extensive fibrosis/cirrhosis. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from in-trial period which started on the date of the randomisation visit and ended on the first of the following dates (both inclusive): 1) follow-up visit (Week 79); 2) withdrawal of consent; 3) last contact with participant (for participants lost to follow-up); 4) death.</description>

        <title>Change in NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS)</title>
        <description>Change in NFS from baseline to week 72 is presented. NFS is calculated using formula: NFS = -1.675 + 0.037 * age (years) + 0.094 * body mass index (BMI) (kg/m^2) + 1.13 * hyperglycaemia (yes/no) + 0.99 * Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio + 0.013 × platelet count (*10^9/L) - 0.66 * albumin (g/dL). The score is used to classify the probability of fibrosis. A score a) &lt; -1.5 indicates a low probability, b) &gt; -1.5 to &lt; 0.67 indicates intermediate probability, and a score of c) &gt; 0.67 indicates a high probability of liver fibrosis. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from in-trial period which started on the date of the randomisation visit and ended on the first of the following dates (both inclusive): 1) follow-up visit (Week 79); 2) withdrawal of consent; 3) last contact with participant (for participants lost to follow-up); 4) death.</description>

        <title>Change in International Normalized Ratio (INR)</title>
        <description>Change in INR is presented as ratio to baseline. INR is the ratio of measured prothrombin time over normal prothrombin time and it evaluates the extrinsic coagulation pathway (vitamin K dependent clotting factors II; V, VII, IX and X). These clotting factors are synthesised in the liver, thus INR is used as a marker of liver synthesis function. The therapeutic INR range varies, most commonly an INR 2-3 goal, but ranging from 1.5-4.0. Bleeding complications are more likely to occur above an INR value of 4.0. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from in-trial period which started on the date of the randomisation visit and ended on the first of the following dates (both inclusive): 1) follow-up visit (Week 79); 2) withdrawal of consent; 3) last contact with participant (for participants lost to follow-up); 4) death.</description>

        <title>Change in Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF)</title>
        <description>Change in ELF from baseline to week 72 is presented. The ELF discriminant score was derived as a log-linear combination of the markers hyaluronic acid (HA), amino-terminal propeptide of type III collagen (PIIINP) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1). ELF score = -7.412 + 0.681 × ln(HA (nanograms per millilitre (ng/mL)) + 0.775 × ln(P3NP (ng/mL)) + 0.494 × ln(TIMP1 (ng/mL)). ELF score: a) &lt; 7.7: no to mild fibrosis; b) ≥ 7.7 - &lt; 9.8: Moderate fibrosis; c) ≥ 9.8 - &lt; 11.3: Severe fibrosis; d) ≥ 11.3: Cirrhosis. A negative change from baseline indicates decreased fibrosis. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from in-trial period which started on the date of the randomisation visit and ended on the first of the following dates (both inclusive): 1) follow-up visit (Week 79); 2) withdrawal of consent; 3) last contact with participant (for participants lost to follow-up); 4) death.</description>

          <title>Change in Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF)</title>
          <description>Change in ELF from baseline to week 72 is presented. The ELF discriminant score was derived as a log-linear combination of the markers hyaluronic acid (HA), amino-terminal propeptide of type III collagen (PIIINP) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1). ELF score = -7.412 + 0.681 × ln(HA (nanograms per millilitre (ng/mL)) + 0.775 × ln(P3NP (ng/mL)) + 0.494 × ln(TIMP1 (ng/mL)). ELF score: a) &lt; 7.7: no to mild fibrosis; b) ≥ 7.7 - &lt; 9.8: Moderate fibrosis; c) ≥ 9.8 - &lt; 11.3: Severe fibrosis; d) ≥ 11.3: Cirrhosis. A negative change from baseline indicates decreased fibrosis. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from in-trial period which started on the date of the randomisation visit and ended on the first of the following dates (both inclusive): 1) follow-up visit (Week 79); 2) withdrawal of consent; 3) last contact with participant (for participants lost to follow-up); 4) death.</description>

        <title>Change in Liver Steatosis Assessed by FibroScan®</title>
        <description>Change in liver steatosis assessed by FibroScan® from baseline to week 72 is presented. FibroScan® is a specialized ultrasound machine for the liver. It measures fibrosis (scarring) and steatosis (fatty change) in the liver. Fatty change is fat building up in the liver cells. To assess liver steatosis, the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP; giving an estimate of ultrasound attenuation ∼3.5 MegaHertz (MHz)) is available with the M probe of the FibroScan. The CAP score is measured in decibels per meter (dB/m). It ranges from 100 to 400 dB/m, with higher scores indicating higher amount of liver with fatty change. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from in-trial period which started on the date of the randomisation visit and ended on the first of the following dates (both inclusive): 1) follow-up visit (Week 79); 2) withdrawal of consent; 3) last contact with participant (for participants lost to follow-up); 4) death.</description>

        <title>Change in Short Form 36 (SF-36) Score</title>
        <description>Change in SF-36 score from baseline to week 72 is presented. SF-36 measures participant's overall health related quality of life (HRQoL). It is a 36-item generic measure of health status and yields 2 summary scores for physical health and mental health, and 8 domain scores (physical functioning, role functioning, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, mental health). The scores 0-100 (where higher scores indicates a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from in-trial period which started on the date of the randomisation visit and ended on the first of the following dates (both inclusive): 1) follow-up visit (Week 79); 2) withdrawal of consent; 3) last contact with participant (for participants lost to follow-up); 4) death.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial participant administered or using a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or usage.

On-treatment period: the period starting on the date of first administration of trial product and ending on the date of the last dose of trial product +7 days; except for the evaluation of AEs and hypoglycaemic episodes for which the period ended on the date of whatever came first: 1) last dose of trial product + 49 days (7 half lives of semaglutide); 2) end of the in-trial period.</description>
