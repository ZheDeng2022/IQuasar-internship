  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For most advanced solid tumors, current therapy is inadequate at improving quality of life,&#xD;
      slowing progression of disease, prolonging survival, and providing a cure. Hence, there is a&#xD;
      continuous need for innovative, safer and more effective anti-cancer therapies. Our study is&#xD;
      based on the dependence receptor paradigm and the associated therapeutic strategy. In&#xD;
      preclinical models, preventing Netrin-1 interaction with its receptors is sufficient to&#xD;
      trigger Netrin-1-expressing tumor cell death in vitro as well as tumor growth and metastasis&#xD;
      inhibition in vivo. This indicates that a therapeutic approach based on Netrin-1/Netrin-1&#xD;
      receptors interaction inhibition is both feasible and promising. NP137 is a &quot;first-in-class&quot;&#xD;
      humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the Netrin-1 ligand, a secreted protein recently&#xD;
      described as a driver of tumor initiation and progression. NP137 demonstrated anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity as a single agent in several pre-clinical models of cancer, including breast and&#xD;
      lung cancer. Taken together, several studies strongly support the rational for preclinical&#xD;
      development and clinical evaluation of a highly potent and selective anti-Netrin-1 antibody&#xD;
      in cancer patients. The proposed study is an open label, multicenter, Phase I dose escalation&#xD;
      study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and&#xD;
      preliminary anti-tumor activity of NP137 administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) as single agent in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This trial will be the First in&#xD;
      Human (FIH) study for NP137; there is no clinical experience with this antibody in the&#xD;
      clinic. The study consists of 3 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1) a dose escalation part to define the Maximum tolerated dose and the Recommended Phase&#xD;
      II dose (MTD /RP2D) of NP137 as well as to research some PD biomarkers (Biological collection&#xD;
      cohorts) - This part is now completed with Last Patient In on December 20th 2018 - Part 2) an&#xD;
      expansion part#1 to investigate NP137 clinical activity as a single agent by collecting the&#xD;
      3-month objective response rate (ORR3m).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3) an expansion part#2 to investigate NP137 clinical activity as a single agent by&#xD;
      collecting the 3-month objective response rate (ORR3m) in RH+ patients with endometrial&#xD;
      carcinoma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dose escalation part (NP137 administered as a single agent by intravenous injection with&#xD;
      7 ascending dose levels) has been initiated with an accelerated dose titration with 1 patient&#xD;
      per DL until the occurrence of a ≥ Grade 2 drug-related AE. Following the occurrence of such&#xD;
      moderate toxicity, patients have been enrolled in a slower dose escalation design with at&#xD;
      least 3 patients per DL using a Modified Continual Reassessment Method. Of note, in case no&#xD;
      toxicity occurs up to the DL4, the classical 3+3 design has been initiated. Cohorts of&#xD;
      patients with biopsable disease have been added in order to assess the impact of NP137&#xD;
      treatment on epithelial phenotype signature (assessed by RNAseq and subsequent bioinformatic&#xD;
      profiling using published E vs M score). Up to 4 additional and independent cohorts of&#xD;
      patients (n= up to 6 pts/ cohort) with biopsable disease have been enrolled. Starting from&#xD;
      DL4, the enrolment in such cohort will be allowed at highest DL that has cleared its DLT&#xD;
      assessment window. Such cohorts will allow to collect pre and on-treatment tumor biopsies in&#xD;
      order to identify PD biomarkers correlated to NP137 clinical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In expansion parts, patients are treated at the RP2D defined in Part 1 (14 mg/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both parts, NP137 will continue to be administered as long as patient experience clinical&#xD;
      benefit in the opinion of the investigator or until unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic&#xD;
      deterioration attributed to disease progression as determined by the investigator after an&#xD;
      integrated assessment of radiographic data and clinical status or withdrawal of consent or&#xD;
      patient willingness to stop the treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Dose Limiting toxicities (DLTs) are defined as any of the following AEs grading using NCI-CTCAE v4.0 occurring during the DLT period (i.e. 28 days) and assessed as related to study drug: Hematological toxicity ( Grade ≥ 4 neutropenia (ANC &lt; 500/μL); Grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia; Grade ≥ 4 thrombocytopenia); Any Grade ≥ 3 major organ adverse event with some exceptions; Dose delay &gt;14 days due to related AE; Any other study drug related toxicity considered significant enough to be qualified as DLT in the opinion of the investigators after discussion with the sponsor. Indeed, as a principle in this first in Man study, any toxicity that the investigator or the sponsor determines to be dose-limiting, regardless of the grade, may be considered as a DLT.</description>
