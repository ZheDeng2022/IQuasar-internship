    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted at 32 sites in the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Russia, Spain, and Turkey between 16 November 2017 (first participant first visit) and 06 July 2020 (last participant last visit).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 29 participants were screened, out of which 6 participants were screen failures and 23 participants were grouped into 2 cohorts: Prior On-demand and Switch (based on the previous von Willebrand disease [VWD] treatment they received prior to the study) and received prophylactic treatment with recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF).</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Prior On-demand Participants</title>
          <description>Participants who had taken only on-demand von Willebrand factor (VWF) prior to the current study received rVWF (vonicog alpha) initial prophylactic treatment at a dose range of 50 plus minus (+/- ) 10 international unit per kilogram (IU/kg), intravenous infusion, twice per week for a planned period of 12 months. Dose escalation to higher dose (up to 80 IU/kg per infusion) or frequency (up to 3 times a week) was based on medical indication and investigator judgment. During this prophylactic treatment period, any breakthrough bleeding episodes requiring replacement therapy with VWF concentrate was treated with rVWF with or without ADVATE (recombinant Factor VIII [rFVIII]); the dose was determined according to the bleeding type and severity, and was adjusted based on the participant's clinical response.</description>

          <title>Switch Participants</title>
          <description>Participants who had taken prophylactic treatment with plasma derived VWF product (pdVWF) prior to current study and switched to prophylaxis with rVWF (vonicog alpha) during the study for a planned period of 12 months; received rVWF twice weekly at an initial prophylactic dose of +/- 10 percent (%) of VWF in the pdVWF weekly dose received prior to this study. Dosing with rVWF up to 80 IU/kg per infusion or at a frequency up to 3 times a week or once a week were allowed depending on the total weekly dose and the dosing regimen used in their previous pdVWF prophylaxis regimen and based on medical indication and investigator judgment. During this prophylactic treatment period, any breakthrough bleeding episodes requiring replacement therapy with VWF concentrate was treated with rVWF with or without ADVATE (rFVIII); the dose was determined according to the bleeding type and severity, and was adjusted based on the participant's clinical response.</description>

Dosing with rVWF up to 80 IU/kg per infusion or at a frequency up to 3 times a week or once a week were allowed depending on the total weekly dose and the dosing regimen used in their previous pdVWF prophylaxis regimen and based on medical indication and investigator judgment. During this prophylactic treatment period, any breakthrough bleeding episodes requiring replacement therapy with VWF concentrate was treated with rVWF with or without ADVATE (rFVIII); the dose was determined according to the bleeding type and severity, and was adjusted based on the participant's clinical response.</description>

        <description>ABR for treated spontaneous BEs while on prophylactic treatment with rVWF through month 12 of treatment period/observation period (in years), where an observation period = (date of completion/termination - date of first dose + 1)/365.2425. Bleeds occurred at the same anatomical location with the same etiology within 24 hours after onset of the first bleed were considered a single bleed. Bleeding occurred at multiple locations related to the same injury were considered as a single bleeding episode. Historical observation period for historical BEs was 365 days prior to first dose of study drug. On-study observation period started on the day of first administration of study drug and continuing through the date of completion/discontinuation from study. The comparison of the two ABRs (on-study and historical) for spontaneous bleeding episodes (not related to trauma) during prophylactic treatment with rVWF was reported as a ratio of mean ABRs (on-study ABR:historical ABR).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Based on Categorized Spontaneous ABR (sABR) Through Month 12</title>
        <description>The sABR was the number of spontaneous bleeds divided by the observation period in years, where an observation period = (date of completion/termination-date of first dose+1)/365.2425.sABR was categorized based on number of BEs as 0, greater than (&gt;) 0 through 2,&gt;2 through 5,&gt;5 during the prophylactic treatment with rVWF (vonicog alfa) through 12 months. Bleeding at multiple locations related to the same injury was counted as single bleeding episode. BEs of unknown cause were counted as spontaneous bleeds. Observation period for historical BEs was 365 days prior to first dose of study drug. The baseline sABR for treated BEs was based on historical BE data and on-study sABR was based on treated spontaneous BEs during prophylaxis with rVWF through Month 12. On-study observation period started on the day of first administration of study drug continuing through the date of completion/discontinuation from study. Number of participants based on categorized sABR was calculated and reported.</description>

Dose escalation to higher dose (up to 80 IU/kg per infusion) or frequency (up to 3 times a week) was based on medical indication and investigator judgment. During this prophylactic treatment period, any breakthrough bleeding episodes requiring replacement therapy with VWF concentrate was treated with rVWF with or without ADVATE (rFVIII); the dose was determined according to the bleeding type and severity, and was adjusted based on the participant's clinical response.</description>

Dose escalation to higher dose (up to 80 IU/kg per infusion) or frequency (up to 3 times a week) was based on medical indication and investigator judgment. During this prophylactic treatment period, any breakthrough bleeding episodes requiring replacement therapy with VWF concentrate was treated with rVWF with or without ADVATE (rFVIII); the dose was determined according to the bleeding type and severity, and was adjusted based on the participant's clinical response.</description>

          <title>Prior On-demand Participants</title>
          <description>Participants who had taken only on-demand VWF prior to the current study received rVWF (vonicog alpha) initial prophylactic treatment at a dose range of 50 +/- 10 IU/kg, intravenous infusion, twice per week for a planned period of 12 months. Dose escalation to higher dose (up to 80 IU/kg per infusion) or frequency (up to 3 times a week) was based on medical indication and investigator judgment. During this prophylactic treatment period, any breakthrough bleeding episodes requiring replacement therapy with VWF concentrate was treated with rVWF with or without ADVATE (rFVIII); the dose was determined according to the bleeding type and severity, and was adjusted based on the participant's clinical response.</description>

          <title>Switch Participants</title>
          <description>Participants who had taken prophylactic treatment with pdVWF prior to current study and switched to prophylaxis with rVWF (vonicog alpha) during the study for a planned period of 12 months; received rVWF twice weekly at an initial prophylactic dose of +/- 10 percent (%) of VWF in the pdVWF weekly dose received prior to this study. Dosing with rVWF up to 80 IU/kg per infusion or at a frequency up to 3 times a week or once a week were allowed depending on the total weekly dose and the dosing regimen used in their previous pdVWF prophylaxis regimen and based on medical indication and investigator judgment. During this prophylactic treatment period, any breakthrough bleeding episodes requiring replacement therapy with VWF concentrate was treated with rVWF with or without ADVATE (rFVIII); the dose was determined according to the bleeding type and severity, and was adjusted based on the participant's clinical response.</description>
