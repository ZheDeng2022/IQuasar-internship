  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) add-on to&#xD;
      antidepressant medication in treating patients who do not relieve during standard&#xD;
      antidepressant treatment for 6 weeks at least. Meanwhile, secondary outcomes will include&#xD;
      changes in some biomarkers and on specifically local brain activity (functional Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging, fMRI) and white matter integrity (Diffusion Tensor Imaging, DTI). The&#xD;
      hypothesis of this study is that NAC has positive effects on refractory major depressive&#xD;
      disorder patients with increased inflammatory activity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It's a double-blind randomised placebo controlled antidepressant augmentation study with&#xD;
      12-week treatment and 8-week follow up. Its purpose is to investigate antidepressant efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of NAC in patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD) defined as&#xD;
      insufficient response to 1 or more antidepressants given for at least 6 weeks and in an&#xD;
      adequate dose, displaying increased peripheral inflammatory activity and moderate to severe&#xD;
      depression. Apart from studying the effects of NAC on depression severity, the secondary&#xD;
      outcomes are to examine a range of biomarkers related to potentially important underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms such as oxidative stress and inflammatory activity and to evaluate the effects on&#xD;
      brain functioning (fMRI) and on white matter integrity (DTI). Scale assessments are performed&#xD;
      in the week preceding initiation of treatment, during the treatment period, at the end of the&#xD;
      treatment period and at 8-week follow up. Neuro-imaging is performed before the treatment&#xD;
      starts and in week 12, before the study medication is terminated. Collection of blood and&#xD;
      morning urine only takes place at three time points, in the week preceding initiation of&#xD;
      treatment, closely before tapering off the study medication and at the end of 8-week follow&#xD;
      up. This study is hoped to show that NAC perform positive effects on those aspects mentioned&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
