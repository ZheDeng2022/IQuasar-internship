      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People are constantly exposed to unhealthy foods. Some studies of adults show that training&#xD;
      attention away from unhealthy foods might reduce overeating. Researchers want to see what&#xD;
      happens in the brain when teens train their attention away from food through a program on a&#xD;
      smartphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the relationship between eating patterns, body weight, and how the brain reacts to&#xD;
      different images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Right-handed females ages 12-17 who are overweight (Body Mass Index at or above the 85th&#xD;
      percentile for age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 6 visits over about 8 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Height, weight, blood pressure, and waist size measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      DXA scan. Participants will lie on a table while a very small dose of x-rays passes through&#xD;
      the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions about their general health, social and psychological functioning, and eating habits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents or guardians of minor participants will answer questions about their child s&#xD;
      functioning and demographic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before visits 2-6, participants will not eat or drink for about 12 hours. These visits will&#xD;
      include some or all of these procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood drawn&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI scan. Participants will lie on a stretcher that slides in and out of a metal cylinder in&#xD;
      a strong magnetic field. A device will be placed over the head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meals provided. Participants will fill out rating forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple thinking tasks&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cone containing magnetic field detectors placed onto the head&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to a 2-week smartphone program that involves looking at&#xD;
      pictures. Participants will complete short tasks and answer some questions about their eating&#xD;
      habits and mood on the smartphone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 30% of adolescents are overweight and 20% are obese, but the mechanisms that produce&#xD;
      excessive weight gain in youth remain incompletely elucidated. Some overweight youth appear&#xD;
      to have an attention bias (AB: a tendency to attend selectively to stimuli that have acquired&#xD;
      salience or meaning) toward highly palatable food that may lead to overeating. AB involves&#xD;
      distinct cognitive processes, (1) unconscious reactions (UCR), reflecting initial attention&#xD;
      capture evoked by salient stimuli, and (2) continued attention deployment (AD) to stimuli&#xD;
      relevant to current goals. These rapidly evolving processes are associated with unique&#xD;
      neurocircuitry best measured using high spatial resolution and temporal sensitivity.&#xD;
      Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a novel neuroimaging technology that has both excellent&#xD;
      temporal and good spatial resolution, thus is uniquely and ideally suited to study&#xD;
      neurocognitive mechanisms of AB. Reducing AB to palatable foods may help some overweight&#xD;
      youth curb their consumption of energy-dense options. Attention retraining (AR) programs can&#xD;
      be used to reduce AB and have been effective in reducing AB to unhealthy food in adults.&#xD;
      Although most AR studies involve computers in the laboratory, using smartphones in the&#xD;
      natural environment may be a particularly effective method to deliver AR to adolescents and&#xD;
      measure AB using ecological momentary assessment. The first aim of the proposed study is to&#xD;
      investigate, using MEG, the impact of a 2-week smartphone AR program on neural responses to&#xD;
      food cues in overweight adolescent (12-17 y/o) girls with and without loss of control (LOC)&#xD;
      eating, defined as a subjective experience of a lack of control over what or how much one is&#xD;
      eating. LOC is a distinct eating behavior phenotype in youth that is a risk factor for excess&#xD;
      weight gain and disordered eating, and is much more prevalent among girls (vs. boys).&#xD;
      Overweight youth who report LOC may be particularly susceptible to AB. Additionally, adults&#xD;
      with LOC demonstrate AB toward socially threatening cues, such as angry or disapproving&#xD;
      faces, and the AB to social threat may be relevant to the relationship between AB to food and&#xD;
      overweight. The second goal is to examine the effect of the 2-week AR program on AB, food&#xD;
      intake, and body composition. An exploratory aim is to examine whether AB to socially&#xD;
      threatening cues, moderates the effects of this novel intervention on AB to food cues, food&#xD;
      intake, and body composition. The proposed study is innovative because no study to date has&#xD;
      examined neurocircuitry of ABs to food using MEG, nor examined the impact of AR delivered in&#xD;
      the natural environment on neurocircuitry of AB in a group of youth prone to AB. These&#xD;
      studies may help further characterize phenomenology of distinct obesity subtypes and may&#xD;
      potentially identify an approach that could prevent undue weight gain in adolescent girls at&#xD;
      risk for obesity.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Volunteers will qualify if they meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age between 12 and 17 years (at the start of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Female sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. BMI at or above the 85th percentile for age and sex according to the Centers for&#xD;
             Disease Control US Standards (101).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Right handedness.&#xD;
&#xD;
             LOC sample only:&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Greater than or equal to 1 episodes of LOC eating during the past month prior to&#xD;
             assessment, assessed using a clinical diagnostic interview for eating disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
             No-LOC sample only:&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. No episodes of LOC eating during the past month prior to assessment, assessed using a&#xD;
             clinical diagnostic interview for eating disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals will be excluded (and provided treatment referrals as needed) for the following&#xD;
        reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. An obesity-related health comorbidity requiring medical treatment, such as&#xD;
             hypertension (defined by age-, sex-, and height-specific standards) or fasting&#xD;
             hyperglycemia consistent with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of other major illnesses: renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, most&#xD;
             endocrinologic (e.g., Cushing syndrome, untreated hyper- or hypothyroidism),&#xD;
             hematological problems or pulmonary disorders (other than asthma not requiring&#xD;
             continuous medication). Nonserious&#xD;
&#xD;
             medical illnesses, such as seasonal allergies, will be reviewed on a case-by-case&#xD;
             basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Regular use of any medication known to affect body weight or eating behavior (e.g.,&#xD;
             stimulants prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD).&#xD;
             Medication use for non-serious conditions (e.g., acne) will be considered on a&#xD;
             case-by-case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Current pregnancy or a history of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. A significant reduction in weight during the past three months, for any reason,&#xD;
             exceeding 5% of body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Presence in the child of any significant, full-threshold psychiatric disorder based on&#xD;
             DSM criteria (102), such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, alcohol or substance&#xD;
             abuse, anorexia or bulimia nervosa, or any other disorder that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigators, would impede competence or compliance or possibly hinder completion of&#xD;
             the study. These individuals will not be permitted to enroll in the current study and&#xD;
             will be referred for treatment. Individuals who present with other psychiatric&#xD;
             disorders, including subthreshold psychiatric disorders, will be permitted to enroll&#xD;
             in the study. If, based on the opinion of the investigators, a participant requires&#xD;
             treatment for his/her psychiatric symptoms, the individual will be referred for&#xD;
             treatment. Participants who develop any psychiatric disorder or significant&#xD;
             psychiatric symptoms at any follow-up assessment during the study will be excluded and&#xD;
             be provided with treatment referrals.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Current and regular substance use, including the use of alcohol and/or tobacco&#xD;
             products (including e-cigarettes).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. A history of significant or recent brain injury that may considerably influence&#xD;
             performance (i.e., any history of loss of consciousness greater than or equal to 30&#xD;
             minutes associated with a head injury, any history of memory loss or hospitalization&#xD;
             associated with a head injury, or greater than or equal to 2 concussions within last&#xD;
             year).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Current involvement in a weight loss program, participating in psychotherapy aimed at&#xD;
             weight loss or treatment of eating behavior (e.g., binge eating).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. All parents/guardians will be asked to indicate if their child has any food allergies.&#xD;
             To be conservative, children who report allergies to gluten, nuts, dairy, fruit, or&#xD;
             any other item in the array, will be excluded from the test meal portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. A condition under which MEG is contradicted (e.g., metal in the body, pregnancy,&#xD;
             claustrophobia, history of significant neurological insult or injury).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Non-English speaking participants will be excluded from the study as they may be&#xD;
             unable to complete questionnaires and follow the instructions which are only provided&#xD;
             in English.&#xD;
