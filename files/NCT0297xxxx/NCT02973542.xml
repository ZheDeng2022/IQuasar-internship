  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal pain remains the most deleterious symptom for patients with irritable bowel&#xD;
      syndrome (IBS) and is causing a significant alteration of their quality of life. The visceral&#xD;
      hypersensitivity seems to be one of the key mechanisms that could explain the abdominal pain&#xD;
      in these patients. Current treatments, mainly symptomatic, are of limited effectiveness,&#xD;
      especially in terms of relief of abdominal pain. The study will aim to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of ethosuximide on abdominal pain in patients with IBS, its tolerance and its&#xD;
      impact on patient quality of life, severity of symptoms related to IBS and the use of&#xD;
      analgesics / antispasmodic / regulators transit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by a combination of discomfort and / or&#xD;
      abdominal pain and bowel habits in the absence of identifiable organic pathology. This&#xD;
      condition is extremely common because it is the first cause of consultation in&#xD;
      gastroenterology and would cover 10-15% of the French. This chronic condition, although&#xD;
      functional, impact significantly on the quality of life of patients and causes considerable&#xD;
      health spending, making it a major public health problem. Especially as the currently used&#xD;
      treatments are of limited effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in IBS, visceral hypersensitivity (VHS)&#xD;
      seems to be a major factor causing pain in patients. VHS involves sensitization of colonic&#xD;
      nerve fibers, resulting in an increase of neuronal excitability. In several animal models of&#xD;
      chronic pain, this hyperexcitability was related to a change in the expression or activity of&#xD;
      ion channels, including calcium channel Cav3.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators especially shown the involvement of Cav3.2 channels in visceral pain in an&#xD;
      animal model of VHS. Furthermore, overexpression of these channels at the peripheral level&#xD;
      (dorsal root ganglion innervating the colon) has been demonstrated in this animal model and&#xD;
      pharmacological blockade, including ethosuximide, prevented the development of the VHS. Note&#xD;
      that Cav3.2 channels have been widely demonstrated as involved in nociceptive phenomena in&#xD;
      various animal models of chronic pain and that by blocking their ethosuximide induce an&#xD;
      analgesic effect in these models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, we have recently demonstrated the involvement of Cav3.2 channel in patients with&#xD;
      IBS, in a clinical case-control study. The Cav3.2 channels were overexpressed in the colonic&#xD;
      mucosa of patients with IBS compared to asymptomatic controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cav3.2 channels are therefore a potential pharmacological target and ethosuximide a&#xD;
      promising therapy to effectively treat the abdominal pain associated with IBS.&#xD;
