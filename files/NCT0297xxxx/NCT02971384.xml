      Aim of this study is to investigate efficacy and safety of Echinaforce Junior Tablets (250mg)&#xD;
      in comparison with Vitamin C tablets in the prevention of acute viral respiratory tract&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      200 children aged 4-12 years are recruited by pediatricians and general practitioners and are&#xD;
      allocated to preventive treatment with either Echinaforce Junior tablets or Vitamin C.&#xD;
      Children take 3 x 1 tablet per day over a period of 2 months followed by 1 week treatment&#xD;
      break and an intermediate study visit (V2). Thereafter children continue with preventive&#xD;
      Treatment for another 2 months, followed by exclusion visit (V3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents are required to contact a study coordinator at the occurrence of acute respiratory&#xD;
      Symptoms to initiate symptom recording via internet-based e-diary. On day 1 - 3 of episode&#xD;
      parents will sample nasal secretion, which will be analysed for common respiratory agents.&#xD;
