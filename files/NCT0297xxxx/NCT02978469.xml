  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long hours of daily sitting and lack of Physical Activity (PA) are risk factors for morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with movement disabilities, including adolescents with Cerebral Palsy (CP) tend to&#xD;
      lead a sedentary life styl and have have poor physical fitness. Adolescents with CP where&#xD;
      found to be inactive most of the day thus, they are in greater risk of disease than the&#xD;
      general population. In addition, over the years, people with disabilities experience physical&#xD;
      and functional deterioration. Reducing sedentary behavior and increasing daily activity can&#xD;
      reduce health risk factors among the adolescents with CP, reduce secondary impairments and&#xD;
      preserve function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions that included exercise alone has not resulted in physical activity and&#xD;
      participating in a structured training did not continue after cessation intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to establish effective programs aiming to promote an active&#xD;
      life style among adolescents and young adults with CP and to evaluate there outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives- Stage 1- Identifying barriers and facilitators for reducing sedentary&#xD;
      behaviors and increasing physical activity among adolescents and young adults with CP. As&#xD;
      well as, identifying mediators, needs and preferences for reducing sedentary behaviors and&#xD;
      increasing physical activity among adolescents and young adults with CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2- Based on stage 1- Establishing an intervention for reducing sedentary behaviors and&#xD;
      increasing physical activity among adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3- translating and developing questioners for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Translating the ASK-Performance and the ASK-Capability questionnaires to Hebrew and&#xD;
           validating the Hebrew translation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Developing a self-efficacy perception questioner for increasing physical activity and&#xD;
           reducing and sedentary behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Translating to Hebrew, adjusting and validating an activity diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 4- evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed intervention program on reducing&#xD;
      sedentary behaviors and increasing physical activity among adolescents and young adults with&#xD;
      CP.&#xD;

      Stage 1 focus group- Identifying barriers and facilitators for reducing sedentary behaviors&#xD;
      and increasing physical activity as well as, identifying mediators, needs and preferences for&#xD;
      reducing sedentary behaviors and increasing physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2- Based on stage 1- Establishing an intervention for reducing sedentary behaviors and&#xD;
      increasing physical activity among adolescents. The intervention group will receive&#xD;
      behavior-modification in group. The control group will get physical exercises.Stage 3-&#xD;
      translating and developing questioners for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Translating the ASK-Performance and the ASK-Capability questionnaires to Hebrew and&#xD;
           validating the Hebrew translation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Developing a self-efficacy perception questioner for increasing physical activity and&#xD;
           reducing and sedentary behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Translating to Hebrew, adjusting and validating an activity diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 4- evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed intervention program on reducing&#xD;
      sedentary behaviors and increasing physical activity among adolescents and young adults with&#xD;
      CP. The outcome measures will measure change from base line after intervention and 4-6 months&#xD;
      after intervention finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All partners of this project will obtain approval for experiments on human subjects from&#xD;
      their local committees. Each subject (or parents/guardians for the participation of minor&#xD;
      subjects) will be able to sign an informed voluntary consent form, consistent with the&#xD;
      Helsinki Declaration, after reading a detailed explanation and having an oral Q/A session&#xD;
      with the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Prospective focused direct mailing or personal contacts will be initiated with&#xD;
      the parents/guardians of children with CP who are ambulatory, who had been seen by&#xD;
      physiotherapists in social groups and schools.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Outcome measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Habitual Physical Activity (HPA).Physical activity is recorded using an &quot;ActivPAL3™&quot;&#xD;
           (PAL Technologies, Glasgow, UK) tri-axial accelerometer-based activity monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 6 min walk test (6minWT): This test measures the self-paced distance in meters walked in&#xD;
           6 minutes on a flat, firm surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 10 meter walk test (10MWT): This self-paced test measures gait speed, important for safe&#xD;
           community mobility (e.g., crossing streets in response to signals).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Timed Up-and-Go (TUG): This test measures mobility for those able to walk on their own&#xD;
           (assistive device permitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Functional Mobility Scale (FMS): The FMS uses three distances (5, 50 and 500m) which&#xD;
           represent typical distances walked by children at home, at school, and in the wider&#xD;
           community.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The Activities Scale for Kids (ASK) is a child self-report measure of physical&#xD;
           disability. It is designed for children five to 15 years of age who are experiencing&#xD;
           limitations in physical activity due to musculoskeletal disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory™ Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT)&#xD;
           measures abilities in the three functional domains of Daily Activities, Mobility and&#xD;
           Social/Cognitive. The PEDI-CAT's Responsibility domain measures the extent to which the&#xD;
           caregiver or child takes responsibility for managing complex, multi-step life tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Self efficiency questionnaire: for evaluating perception of self efficiency for engaging&#xD;
           in physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus group: Coding text and theorizing: In grounded theory research. Identifying anchors&#xD;
      that allow the key points of the data to be gathered. Collections of codes of similar content&#xD;
      that allows the data to be grouped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to determine the effects and&#xD;
      compare the two groups methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A correlation test will take place between the ASK Capability and the PEDI-CAT. A correlation&#xD;
      test will take place between the ASK PERFORMANCE and the results from the accelerometers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-way ANOVA test by separation the sample to severity groups, according to the GMFCS&#xD;
      levels, using the age as a co-variant.&#xD;

A variation is the time to walk 10 m as fast as possible.</description>

The rating is performed according to child/parent report of what the child does and is not by clinical observation.</description>
