  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a basic training to echocardiography, emergency physicians will have to answer simple&#xD;
      clinical questions about circulatory failure mechanisms. The objective of the study is to&#xD;
      assess the agreement between these answers and those of the expert physician in patients&#xD;
      admitted in the emergency department with a circulatory failure due to sepsis or not.&#xD;
      Emergency physicians will volunteer to take part in a basic training on echocardiography. The&#xD;
      training will include 4 hours of theory, 2 hours of interactive clinical cases and 6 hours of&#xD;
      tutored practice at patients' bedside (10 to 15 examinations). The objective of the practice&#xD;
      sessions will be to learn the technical grounds of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), the&#xD;
      different views and to identify the anatomical structures. The second part of the study will&#xD;
      start after the training. Each eligible patient will be successively assessed by two&#xD;
      investigators: one emergency physician recently trained and the expert physician. The&#xD;
      echocardiography will be performed as soon as possible in the emergency department before or&#xD;
      after the initiation of treatment without delaying it. The order of hemodynamic assessments&#xD;
      will be random depending on the availability of the investigators; both assessments will&#xD;
      however be performed within 30 minutes. Each investigator will independently read the&#xD;
      echocardiography in real time at patients' bedside. They will then answer a limited list of&#xD;
      standardized questions using two-choice answers or predefined choices. Finally investigators&#xD;
      will choose a therapeutic proposition among a predefined list based on the answers. Only the&#xD;
      results of the echocardiography performed by the expert physician will be used in patient&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
