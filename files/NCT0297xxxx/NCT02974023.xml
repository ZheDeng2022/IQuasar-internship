    <textblock>
      The current study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the device in the&#xD;
      common areas of the body affected by different causes of musculoskeletal pain in Vietnamese&#xD;
      population in real life situation.&#xD;

      PainGear [ActiPatch®] (BioElectronics Corporation, MD, USA) has been recently introduced as&#xD;
      an 'topical' analgesic for localized musculoskeletal pain. PainGear is a noninvasive, low&#xD;
      power, easy to use, pulsed shortwave therapy device for localized musculoskeletal pain. The&#xD;
      device does not produce heat or any sensation. There are two basic requirements to use the&#xD;
      device, switching it on via an on/off switch, and affixing the device over the target area of&#xD;
      the body. The area of treatment is confined to the area within the 11.5-cm diameter loop&#xD;
      antenna covering an area of 100 cm2, the antennae is circular, soft and flexible and can be&#xD;
      shaped to fit the area/location being treated as required. The device can be used up to 24 h&#xD;
      per day and is placed over the area of localized pain either using medical tape or a&#xD;
      specifically designed wrap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, patients with radiographic&#xD;
      evidence of knee OA (osteoarthritis) and persistent pain higher than 40mm on the visual&#xD;
      analog scale (VAS) were recruited. The trial consisted of 12 h daily treatment for 1 month in&#xD;
      60 knee OA patients. After 1 month, PainGear induced a significant reduction in VAS pain and&#xD;
      Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) scores compared with&#xD;
      placebo. Additionally, pain tolerance and physical health improved in PainGear -treated&#xD;
      patients. Twenty-six per cent of patients in the PainGear group stopped NSAID/analgesic&#xD;
      therapy. No adverse events were detected.&#xD;
