    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if VF001-DP improves wound healing in chronic&#xD;
      venous leg ulcers compared to standard care only.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective: The objective of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      VF001-DP as an adjunct to standard care (SC) in the treatment of chronic venous leg ulcers&#xD;
      (VLUs) compared to Placebo with SC over the course of the 12-week Treatment Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      dose-response study designed to evaluate VF-001-DP as an adjunct to SC, versus Placebo and SC&#xD;
      in the treatment of chronic VLUs. The SC therapy for VLUs is a moisture retentive ulcer&#xD;
      dressing and multi-layer compression therapy. Mepitel® and Coban2® have been chosen to be&#xD;
      used as SC in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have three (3) phases: Screening (2 weeks), Treatment Phase (12 weeks) and&#xD;
      Follow-Up (12 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients whose study ulcer does not exhibit more than 30% change (increase or decrease)&#xD;
      in ulcer size post-debridement between Screening Phase Visit (S1) and Treatment Phase Visit&#xD;
      (T1) and who continue to meet eligibility criteria at T1 will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      the Active Treatment group (VF001-DP low or high dose plus SC) or the Control Treatment group&#xD;
      (Placebo plus SC) in a ratio of 1:1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Eligible patients will be assigned to one of the following treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo and SC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VF001-DP (14 micrograms per treatment) and SC (low dose [LD])&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VF001-DP (140 micrograms per treatment) and SC (high dose [HD]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational product (IP), i.e., VF001-DP and placebo, will be supplied in 1 mL&#xD;
      syringes each containing 0.5 mL of either VF001-DP or Placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IP contains parts of normal vitronectin and Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) combined&#xD;
      in a single protein (vitronectin, amino acids 1-64 of the human sequence and IGF-I amino&#xD;
      acids 1-70 of the human sequence), 14 μg or 140 μg protein in 0.5 mL of Phosphate Buffered&#xD;
      Saline, pH 7.2. VF001-DP is manufactured utilizing an expression vector system in yeast to&#xD;
      Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and is not made with and does not include any products of&#xD;
      human or animal origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients: It is planned to recruit 168 patients (56 per treatment group) at 26&#xD;
      centres in USA for this study.&#xD;

             arms).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Presence of VLUs extending through the full thickness of the skin but not down to&#xD;
             muscle, tendon or bone. In the case of more than one ulcer, the largest ulcer&#xD;

             seconds in saphenous (great or small), calf perforators or the deep venous system.&#xD;
             Patients with prior venous surgery (i.e., varicose vein stripping, endovenous&#xD;
             ablation) may be included if they still demonstrate significant reflux in a remaining&#xD;
             venous segment and the ulcer continues to suffer poor healing because of venous&#xD;
             hypertension.&#xD;

             post-debridement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ulcer exhibits clinical signs and symptoms of infection at S1to T1 in which case&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. History of radiation at the ulcer site.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. As determined by medical history, presence of one or more medical conditions including&#xD;
             renal, hepatic, hematologic, active auto-immune or immune diseases that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Investigator, would make the patient an inappropriate candidate for&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Known history of having Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or with a history of&#xD;
             known infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;

             Dermagraft®) or other scaffold materials (e.g., Oasis®, Matristem®) within the last 30&#xD;
             days prior to S1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Ulcer which in the opinion of the Investigator might require negative pressure ulcer&#xD;
             therapy or hyperbaric oxygen during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         22. Any other medical or psychological condition (including relevant laboratory&#xD;
             abnormalities at screening) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may suggest a&#xD;
             new and/or insufficiently understood disease, may present an unreasonable risk to the&#xD;
             study patient as a result of his/her participation in this clinical trial, may make&#xD;
             patient's participation unreliable, or may interfere with study assessments. The&#xD;
             specific justification for patients excluded under this criterion will be noted in&#xD;
             study documents (chart notes, CRFs, etc).&#xD;
