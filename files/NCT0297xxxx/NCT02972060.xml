  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label non-comparative controlled randomized phase II study. The experimental&#xD;
      arm is the group receiving ODM-201. The group receiving androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is&#xD;
      included as an internal control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary trial objective is to demonstrate that ODM-201 produces prostate-specific antigen&#xD;
      (PSA) response rates at 24 weeks (defined as ≥80% reduction compared to baseline) that are in&#xD;
      the range of those achieved with 24 weeks of ADT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, this 1:1 randomized study will therefore require randomization of at least 250&#xD;
      patients, 125 to each arm.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ODM 201 will be administered as oral 300-mg tablets. The dose of study drug to be&#xD;
      administered is 600 milligrams (mg) (2 x 300-mg tablets) twice daily (bid) for a daily dose&#xD;
      of 1200 mg. It is recommended that ODM-201 be taken with food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who have clinical benefit at week 24 may continue to receive ODM-201 at the&#xD;
      discretion of the investigator until disease progression, objective or clinical, or&#xD;
      occurrence of an unacceptable toxicity. This includes those that will receive external beam&#xD;
      radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any anti-cancer therapy other than the study drug given as single agent will not be&#xD;
      considered part of the protocol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard treatment for this stage of the disease is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) by&#xD;
      means of Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) antagonist for 24 weeks or by LHRH&#xD;
      agonist therapy for 24 weeks with 4 weeks of anti-androgen to prevent flare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This includes leuprolide, goserelin, triptorelin, and degarelix. Beyond week 24, the&#xD;
      treatment will be left to the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary trial objective is to demonstrate that ODM-201 produces prostate-specific antigen&#xD;
      (PSA) response rates at 24 weeks (defined as ≥80% reduction compared to baseline) that are in&#xD;
      the range of those achieved with 24 weeks of ADT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the effects of ODM-201 compared to ADT in terms of patient-reported side&#xD;
           effects of hormonal therapy, based on the Hormonal treatment (HTR) symptom scale of&#xD;
           EORTC QLQ PR25 at 24 weeks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the effects of ODM-201 compared to ADT in terms of patient-reported side&#xD;
           effects of hormonal therapy, based on EORTC QLQ C30 and PR25 at 24 weeks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the effect of ODM-201 on PSA complete response at 24 weeks (defined as ≥ 90%&#xD;
           reduction from baseline);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the effect of ODM-201 on objective response rate at 24 weeks in patients&#xD;
           with RECIST 1.1 measurable disease at baseline;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the safety and tolerability of ODM-201 vs. ADT in subjects who have not&#xD;
           previously received hormone treatment for prostate cancer;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the effects of ODM-201 on androgen deprivations symptoms using the Aging&#xD;
           male symptoms (AMS) questionnaires;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the proportion of patients who opted to continue treatment with ODM-201&#xD;
           beyond the protocolized 24 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the PSA response assessed at 24 weeks. PSA response is defined as a ≥&#xD;
      80% decline in PSA measurement taken at week 24 relative to the measurement taken at&#xD;
      baseline, in the ODM-201 study arm. The ADT arm is used as an internal control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in hormone-treatment related symptoms scale of the EORTC QLQ-PR25 at 24 weeks&#xD;
           compared to baseline in the ODM-201 study arm. A 10-point difference is regarded as a&#xD;
           clinically meaningful benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective response rate at 24 weeks in patients with RECIST 1.1 measurable disease at&#xD;
           baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PSA response at 24 weeks defined as a ≥90% decline in PSA compared to baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety according to National Cancer Institute - Common terminology for adverse events&#xD;
           (NCI-CTC) version 4.0&#xD;
