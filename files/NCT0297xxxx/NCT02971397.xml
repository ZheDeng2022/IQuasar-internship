    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects of cytarabine and daunorubicin&#xD;
      hydrochloride and to see how well they work in treating patients with newly diagnosed acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine and daunorubicin&#xD;
      hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing&#xD;
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading, and may be&#xD;
      safer for the heart.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety (at 3 months) and feasibility of administering daunorubicin&#xD;
      hydrochloride (daunorubicin) as continuous infusion under the proposed treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety (at 6 months) of administering daunorubicin as continuous infusion&#xD;
      under the proposed treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess treatment outcomes (including complete remission [CR] and complete remission&#xD;
      with incomplete recovery [CRi]) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) under the&#xD;
      proposed treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare the concordance between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiogram&#xD;
      (ECHO) in identifying cardiac toxicity, ie a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction&#xD;
      (LVEF) of &gt;= 10% and ejection fraction (EF) =&lt; 50% compared to baseline LVEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive cytarabine intravenously (IV) continuously over 24 hours on days&#xD;
      1-7 and daunorubicin hydrochloride IV continuously over 24 hours on days 1-3 in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo bone marrow aspirate&#xD;
      and biopsy on day 14. Patients with bone marrow cellularity &gt;= 10% and &gt; 5% leukemic blasts,&#xD;
      may receive a second induction of cytarabine IV continuously over 24 hours on days 1-5 and&#xD;
      daunorubicin hydrochloride IV continuously over 24 hours on days 1-2 in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION: Patients achieving remission receive cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours&#xD;
      on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with core-binding factor (CBF) AML may&#xD;
      receive 4 courses of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for a minimum of 30 days, at 3&#xD;
      and 6 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.&#xD;
