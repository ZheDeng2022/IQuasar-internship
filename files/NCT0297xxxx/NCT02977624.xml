      Objectives - To evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention program based on&#xD;
      tele-rehabilitation in stroke survivors. The aim of the intervention is to improve the&#xD;
      transition from rehabilitation units to community dwelling and facilitate involvement in life&#xD;
      roles in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working hypothesis - The tele-rehabilitation based program for stroke survivors will be&#xD;
      effective in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improving function in activities of daily living, participation in occupations and&#xD;
           health related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reducing the need for outpatient clinic and rehabilitation services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The intervention achievements will be maintained in 6 months follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology - Participants: Stroke survivors will be selected from patients who are referred&#xD;
      to the outpatient or home-based rehabilitation unit of Maccabi health services. The&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned into two groups: The treatment group (N=30) will&#xD;
      receive the intervention program in addition to standard care, and control group- standard&#xD;
      care only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory (MPAI-4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stroke impact Scale (SIS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale short version&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: The intervention program includes 20 video chat sessions over 10 weeks between an&#xD;
      occupational therapist and the participant, in the presence of the primary care giver. The&#xD;
      virtual meetings will be conducted using The Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational&#xD;
      Performance approach. The meetings will focus on problem solving for daily life situations&#xD;
      and on the ability to implement the discussed strategies for a variety of activities.&#xD;
      Participants will be evaluated at baseline, after the intervention, and after 6 months.&#xD;
