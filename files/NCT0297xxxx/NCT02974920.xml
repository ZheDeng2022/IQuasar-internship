  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic valve replacement with a biological prosthesis is the most common valve surgery&#xD;
      performed with about 1000 operations performed in Denmark each year. Further, the&#xD;
      introduction of percutaneous stent valves will increase these types of replacements in the&#xD;
      years to come. A biological valve is a foreign body prone to cause thrombus formation at&#xD;
      least until the valve is covered with recipient endothelium. There are no conclusive studies&#xD;
      of anticoagulation and the investigators have shown stroke to be a common complication.&#xD;
      Guidelines have variably recommended aspirin or rivaroxaban for anticoagulation, and&#xD;
      currently aspirin is the most common recommendation. In a register study, the investigators&#xD;
      have shown that proper anticoagulation with warfarin is likely to be superior. There is a&#xD;
      clear need for a large randomised study of aspirin versus anticoagulation for biological&#xD;
      aortic valve replacement. This protocol describes a randomised study where 1000 patients will&#xD;
      be randomised to receive either rivaroxaban or aspirin for 6 months following aortic valve&#xD;
      replacement with a biological prosthesis. The primary efficacy endpoint is a combined event&#xD;
      of all-cause mortality and hospitalisation for either acute myocardial infarction or stroke.&#xD;
      This study has the power to settle a discussion of appropriate anticoagulation for this&#xD;
      operation&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a comparison of aspirin and rivaroxaban for the postoperative treatment after&#xD;
      biological aortic valve replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific Background Guidelines have over the years recommended anticoagulation or aspirin&#xD;
      after surgical replacement of the aortic valve with a prosthesis. There are no proper&#xD;
      randomized trials. Rivaroxaban is an anticoagulant approved for several indications. The&#xD;
      investigators are conducting a study to compare Aspirin versus Rivaroxaban for prevention of&#xD;
      thrombosis during 6 months after aortic valve replacement with a biological prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a substudy CT scans for a subgroup of patients to detect partially immobilized valves due&#xD;
      to thrombosis is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial drugs The trial drugs are 100 mg Aspirin daily or 10 mg Rivaroxaban daily. Patients are&#xD;
      provided with either 180 tablets of 10 mg rivaroxaban or 180 tablets of 100 mg aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is planned as a multicenter, randomized, open label, parallel group study.&#xD;
      Patients are allocated to aspirin or rivaroxaban to be treated for 6 months. Treatment after&#xD;
      this period is not trial driven and left to the discretion of the investigator. As indicated&#xD;
      below the study is planned to include 1000 patients. The steering committee may review&#xD;
      recruitment rate and overall event rate (blinded by treatment) and may increase the sample&#xD;
      size to up to 2000 patients. Another important aspect of this study is that follow-up is&#xD;
      mainly by registers. This is a group of patients who will in all cases receive treatment&#xD;
      similar to that tested in the trial and where there is systematic follow-up in cardiology&#xD;
      clinics. Therefore systematic follow-up only directed by the trial is kept to a minimum and&#xD;
      most information during follow-up is obtained from registers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation For all patients that have provided informed consent a web-based case record&#xD;
      form is completed with demographic data, data regarding the heart disease, comorbidity,&#xD;
      medication and time of study start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation is performed by a computerized algorithm with a varying block size and&#xD;
      stratification by operating center. The specific treatment of each patient is open and&#xD;
      provided by the computer when the patients is randomised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are considered enrolled in the study when they have signed the informed consent. All&#xD;
      patients that have signed the consent will be accounted for when the study is reported. In&#xD;
      terms of the primary intention to treat analysis patients are part of this analysis when they&#xD;
      take the first tablet of either aspirin or rivaroxaban. An analysis including all patients&#xD;
      that have provided informed consent will be a sensitivity analysis. The earliest time of&#xD;
      study start is postoperatively after removal of temporary pacemaker electrodes. This is&#xD;
      anticipated to be a few days after the operation. Study can start up to 2 weeks later when&#xD;
      anticoagulation in the intermediate period has only been low molecular weight heparin and/or&#xD;
      aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Study staff contacts patients after 3 and 6 months by telephone to ensure&#xD;
      compliance and to obtain reports of events including adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study end The study ends after 6 months. The final contact to study staff is by telephone.&#xD;
      There are no guidelines indicating that further anticoagulation should be necessary for these&#xD;
      patients as directed by the valve operation and there is no recommended further treatment of&#xD;
      the patients or further follow-up by direct control. Follow-up in registers will continue&#xD;
      after study end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a preplanned analysis of outcome by treatment allocation at 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary comparison is a log-rank test of time to selected outcome. Supportive analyses&#xD;
      will use Cox proportional hazard models. For an analysis of superiority of either drug a 2&#xD;
      sided p-value of 0.05 will be used. The conclusion of superiority is based on the main&#xD;
      endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A statistical analysis plan will be prepared prior to study closure. The main analyses will&#xD;
      be made according to the intention to treat principle where all patients that have taken at&#xD;
      least one tablet will be examined in the main analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition analyses will be made where patients are censored when they stop study&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to nationwide registered were employed. A total of 2345 patients treated with aspirin&#xD;
      and 4509 treated with warfarin after operation were identified. Analysis was performed&#xD;
      between 30 days and 180 days to avoid conditioning on the future. It should be noted that&#xD;
      this procedure most likely underestimates the power of the study. The 30-180 day primary&#xD;
      event rate in the aspirin group was 7.5% and the event rate in the warfarin group was 3.2%.&#xD;
      Based on these observations the CPOWER function of the R-HMisc package was used to calculate&#xD;
      a power of 81% based on 500 simulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Management A Data Safety and Monitoring Board with statistical, cardiological and&#xD;
      surgical expertise will follow the study. Formal interim analyses are not planned. This&#xD;
      committee is composed of members otherwise independent of the study. They can recommend the&#xD;
      steering committee to discontinue the study, but it is the only body which during the course&#xD;
      of the study received unblinded results grouped by treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for the individual patient the investigator may discontinue study treatment if bleeding is&#xD;
      observed or otherwise indicated. There are no trial specific rules on how to handle side&#xD;
      effects during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT substudy A CT substudy of 580 patients will be conducted to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      postprocedural medical regime on leaflet motion in the aortic bioprosthesis. These patients&#xD;
      follow the normal course of the trial and further have a CT scan of the aortic valve&#xD;
      performed after 3 and 12 months. Patients are consecutively invited to this substudy until&#xD;
      the required sample size is met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end-point • The proportion of patients with at least one prosthetic leaflet with &gt;50%&#xD;
      motion reduction as assessed by cardiac 4DCT-scan (total N = 580).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end-points • The proportion of prosthetic leaflets with &gt;50% motion reduction as&#xD;
      assessed by cardiac 4DCTscan (total N = 1740). • The proportion of patients with at least one&#xD;
      prosthetic leaflet with thickening as assessed by cardiac 4DCT-scan (total N = 580). • The&#xD;
      proportion of prosthetic leaflets with thickening as assessed by cardiac 4DCT-scan (total N =&#xD;
      1740). • Aortic transvalvular mean pressure gradient and effective orifice area (cm2) as&#xD;
      determined by transthoracic echocardiography. • Functional NYHA class. • Death, first&#xD;
      thromboembolic event (DTE), and safety endpoints will be assessed in the main study and&#xD;
      analysed in the CT substudy with regards to occurrence of the leaflet abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions • Leaflet thickening: Hypoattentuating leaflet thickening or focal&#xD;
      hypoattenuating abnormality attached to the prosthetic leaflet or diffuse thickening of the&#xD;
      prosthetic valve leaflet identifiable on at least two reconstructed planes (typically&#xD;
      double-oblique axial and multiplanar reformatted reconstructions). • Reduced motion: Reduced&#xD;
      systolic leaflet excursion is classified as: (I) normal, (II) mildly reduced (&lt;50%), (III)&#xD;
      moderate to severely reduced (&gt;50%), and (IV) immobile. Reduced systolic leaflet excursion is&#xD;
      considered significant when it is &gt; 50% or immobile. Quantitative assessment of leaflet&#xD;
      motion is performed with a blood pool inversion volume rendered cine reconstruction&#xD;
      throughout the cardiac cycle evaluating the bioprosthetic leaflets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of reduced aortic bioprosthetic leaflet motion is expected to occur in&#xD;
      approximately 10% of patients.(15) Equal number of patients is warranted in both treatment&#xD;
      groups. A 65% reduction during rivaroxaban of primary endpoint requires inclusion of 580&#xD;
      patients in order to demonstrate superiority. Taking into account an estimated loss at&#xD;
      follow-up of 18% of patients, the total sample size (N) needed to demonstrate superiority&#xD;
      would be 580 randomized patients. The primary endpoint will be analysed using an exact Fisher&#xD;
      test or a Χ2 test, as required. Supporting analyses will include logistic regression with&#xD;
      inclusion of covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation (Power 0.8, Alpha 0.05)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Probability of event in Group A: 0.10 • Probability of event in Group B: 0.035 •&#xD;
           Proportion of sample in Group A: 0.50 • Evaluable subjects needed in Group A: 238 •&#xD;
           Drop-out: 0.18&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  N = 580&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimation of dropout rate • A 10% loss at follow-up or death at 3 months is expected in this&#xD;
      elderly patient population. • In approx. 8% of cases, an inconclusive cardiac 4DCT can be&#xD;
      expected.&#xD;
