  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects have a type of a lymph node cancer called Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) or&#xD;
      lymphoproliferative disease (LPD), which affects their immunity, blood production, and can&#xD;
      involve multiple other organs in the body. Their disease has come back or has not gone away&#xD;
      after treatment. The experimental treatment plan consists of an antibody therapy called&#xD;
      &quot;Nivolumab&quot; that helps the subjects' T-cells control the tumor, and special immune system&#xD;
      cells called EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, also a new therapy whose side effects are&#xD;
      well studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients with NHL or LPD are infected with the virus that causes infectious&#xD;
      mononucleosis (called Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV) before or at the time of their diagnosis.&#xD;
      The cancer cells that are infected by EBV are able to hide from the body's immune system and&#xD;
      escape destruction. Investigators want to see if special white blood cells, called T cells,&#xD;
      that have been trained to kill cells infected by EBV can survive in the blood and affect the&#xD;
      tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have used this sort of therapy to treat a different type of cancer that occurs&#xD;
      after bone marrow or solid organ transplant called post-transplant lymphoma with good&#xD;
      success. These cells are called EBV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (EBVSTs), and are&#xD;
      effective in treating these diseases. These EBVSTs are experimental and not yet approved by&#xD;
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sometimes it is not possible to grow these cells; or they may not last very long in the body&#xD;
      after being given into the vein thereby having only limited time to fight the tumor. With&#xD;
      this study, investigators aim to increase the duration of time that the T cells can last in&#xD;
      the body and can effectively fight the cancer by using nivolumab. Nivolumab is FDA approved&#xD;
      for treatment of other kinds of cancer like lung cancer and a skin cancer called Melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out if EBVST cells in combination with nivolumab are&#xD;
      safe, to learn what the side effects are, and to see whether this therapy may help patients&#xD;
      with EBV related lymphoma or LPD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will draw blood from the subject to make EBV-specific cytotoxic&#xD;
      T-lymphocytes (EBVSTs) in the lab. Investigators will make the cells by first growing a&#xD;
      special type of cells called dendritic cells (DCs) or monocytes to stimulate the T cells.&#xD;
      Then they will add specially produced mixtures of proteins that included the LMP, EBNA1, and&#xD;
      BARF proteins. These are used to stimulate T cells. As the T cells grow, investigators add&#xD;
      some of the subject's cells expressing these proteins to stimulate them. They also add a cell&#xD;
      called K562 that has had new genes put inside it so it expresses proteins that stimulate the&#xD;
      immune system to encourage the T cells to grow. This stimulation trains the EBVSTs to kill&#xD;
      cells with EBV proteins on their surface. These cells will be grown and frozen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cells grown in the lab will be thawed and injected into the subject's vein over 2-10&#xD;
      minutes. Initially, one dose of the drug nivolumab is given one day before the EBVST cells&#xD;
      are infused (on day 0) and then every 2 weeks for a total of four doses of nivolumab.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive two infusions of the EBVST cells. The first infusion will be given on&#xD;
      Day 1 and a second infusion of T cells on Day 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If eligible, subjects may receive up to three additional doses of the T cells 6-12 weeks&#xD;
      apart and each additional T cell infusion would be preceded by one dose of nivolumab a day&#xD;
      prior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have medical and blood tests at predetermined time points. Investigators will&#xD;
      follow subjects closely after treatment for any side effects for at least for 1 year after&#xD;
      the subject's last infusion.&#xD;
