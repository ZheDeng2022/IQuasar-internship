  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators of this study want to see if shortening the total treatment time for brain&#xD;
      tumors is safe.The treatment for participant's brain tumors is laser surgery (Laser&#xD;
      Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT)) followed by radiation with chemotherapy. For&#xD;
      participants, the total time of treatment from surgery to the end of radiation and&#xD;
      chemotherapy is about l 0 weeks long. This study asks whether it is safe to shorten the total&#xD;
      treatment to 7 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To shorten the total treatment time, investigators want to see if it is safe to start&#xD;
      radiation with chemotherapy within 5 days after surgery. Usually patients start their&#xD;
      radiation with chemotherapy about 21-28 days after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shortening the total time of treatment may allow investigators to kill the cancer cells more&#xD;
      effectively.&#xD;

      Primary Objective To determine the safety and feasibility of reducing the time interval&#xD;
      between LITT and the start of chemoradiation to ≤ 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint (binary) for safety/feasibility will be defined as the occurrence of one&#xD;
      or more of the following within each patient during a window of observation from the&#xD;
      completion LITT to the end of radiation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wound dehiscence, grade 3 {CTCAE v4.0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seizures, grade 3 (CTCAE v4.0) in patients without a prior history of seizures and on&#xD;
           adequate anti-seizure medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cerebral edema, grade 4 (CTCAE v4.0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Failure to complete of 60 Grays (Gy) of radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s) To estimate the proportion of patients requiring adjustments in&#xD;
      radiation plans post-LITT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint: Requirement of an adjustment in the radiation plan to account for&#xD;
      post-LITT tissue distortion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This study will be a 2-stage, single-institution safety and feasibility trial.&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated by a neuro-oncology team consisting of a neurosurgeon trained in&#xD;
      LITT, radiation oncologist and medical oncologist prior to surgery. Evaluable patients will&#xD;
      have a histologic diagnosis of high-grade glioma, complete LITT, and are candidates for&#xD;
      standard concurrent radiation (60 Gy) and temozolomide as determined by the treating&#xD;
      physician. Concurrent chemoradiation will begin within 7 days of the LITT procedure.&#xD;
