  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SNX-5422 is a prodrug of SNX-2112, a potent, highly selective, small molecule inhibitor of&#xD;
      the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). Hsp90 inhibitors may overcome&#xD;
      ibrutinib resistance in Mantle cell lymphomas and this study will investigate whether the&#xD;
      addition of SNX-5422 to an established dose of ibrutinib will provide clinical response in&#xD;
      subjects who have residual disease, but have not progressed on ibrutinib after 18 months of&#xD;
      monotherapy, and/or prevents or delays disease progression of subjects with CLL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most prevalent leukemia in adults and is not&#xD;
      considered curable outside of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Significant advances have&#xD;
      been made in the therapy, notably with the introduction of the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK)&#xD;
      inhibitor ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While response to ibrutinib has been high with therapy well-tolerated overall, some patients&#xD;
      have relapsed while others have been taken off therapy for toxicity or other reasons. In&#xD;
      addition, although remissions are durable in many patients, very few patients achieve a&#xD;
      complete response (CR), and minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity on single agent&#xD;
      ibrutinib has not been reported. Since it is known that for chemoimmunotherapy as well as&#xD;
      targeted therapies such as venetoclax that attainment of a CR is associated with longer&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS), it is likely that deepening responses associated with&#xD;
      ibrutinib will result in more durable remissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relapse in CLL can be mediated by at least two separate mechanisms. One is by mutations in&#xD;
      BTK, the other is through a variety of mutations in the immediate downstream target of BTK,&#xD;
      PLCγ2. SNX-5422 is a prodrug of SNX-2112, a potent, highly selective, small molecule&#xD;
      inhibitor of the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). Hsp90 inhibitors may&#xD;
      overcome ibrutinib resistance in Mantle cell lymphomas and this study will investigate&#xD;
      whether the addition of SNX-5422 to an established dose of ibrutinib will provide clinical&#xD;
      response in subjects who have residual disease, but have not progressed on ibrutinib after 18&#xD;
      months of monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive SNX-5422 (56 mg/m2) in the morning once every other day for 21 days (11&#xD;
      doses), followed by a 7-day drug-free period. Subjects will continue to receive daily oral&#xD;
      ibrutinib at their established dose level in the afternoon&#xD;
