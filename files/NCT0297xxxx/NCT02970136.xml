  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the best way to increase screening for&#xD;
      cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, HIV, and Hepatitis C among under screened Hispanic,&#xD;
      Haitian and African-American individuals in Hialeah, South Dade, and Little Haiti. The&#xD;
      investigator will compare home testing led by a community health worker (CHW) versus clinic&#xD;
      testing guided by a CHW. Community Health Workers are people who have undergone several weeks&#xD;
      of community outreach and health education training. During the study period the participant&#xD;
      will continue to receive all of their regular medical care from their regular health care&#xD;
      providers. If the participant does not have a health care provider, the Community Health&#xD;
      Workers would be able to help in referring the participant for care at a local health care&#xD;
      clinic located in their community.&#xD;
