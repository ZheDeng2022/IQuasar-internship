  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the last two decades, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has been widely reported as an&#xD;
      effective method to avoid the need of endotracheal intubation (ETI) and improve survival in&#xD;
      the acute care setting. Given the risks associated with either premature NIV discontinuation&#xD;
      or delays in NIV interruption, evaluating readiness to weaning from NIV is a critical&#xD;
      challenge in patients with Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to date, bedside measurements used to predict NIV outcomes are extremely limited. NIV&#xD;
      weaning as well as decision of ETI are mainly supported by clinical and physiologic&#xD;
      parameters. More sophisticated techniques used to predict weaning outcome during spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing trials have never achieved a bedside broad-spectrum use due to their invasiveness,&#xD;
      the inconsistent results in demonstrating reproducible outcomes, the requirements of&#xD;
      additional trainee personnel and complicated equipment, and the difficult application in&#xD;
      awake and non-intubated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, ultrasound has been used for the rapid assessment of diaphragm function in acutely&#xD;
      ill patients. The advantages of the ultrasound in detecting diaphragm dysfunction as compared&#xD;
      with other techniques are the less invasiveness, the avoidance of radiation hazards and the&#xD;
      bedside feasibility. Direct imaging of changes in diaphragm thickening (DT) during&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing may provide the assessment of both the muscle and the respiratory pump&#xD;
      functioning. Indeed, DT has been correlated with the diaphragm strength and the muscle&#xD;
      shortening. The volume of diaphragm muscle mass remains constant while it contracts.&#xD;
      Consequently, as the muscle shortens it thickens itself and measurements of changes in such a&#xD;
      thickening (DT) are inversely related to changes in diaphragm length. Studies in patients&#xD;
      with diaphragm paralysis have confirmed the absence of DT. Moreover, since the diaphragm is&#xD;
      the major muscle of inspiration, the presence of diaphragm shortening and contraction may&#xD;
      predict successful extubation in patients who are invasively ventilated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to assess whether DT as measured by ultrasound may predict&#xD;
      NIV outcome in patients with de-novo ARF admitted to the Emergency Department (ED).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All consecutive patients with de-novo ARF requiring NIV treatment while they will be admitted&#xD;
      to the Emergency Department at Gemelli's Hospital, Rome-Italy will be included into the&#xD;
      present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present protocol will be approved by the local Ethics Committee and informed consent will&#xD;
      be obtained by the all study participants or their next of kin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will be ventilated in the ED over a maximum of 48 hours, by using 2 types of&#xD;
      different ventilators (Evita XL, Drager or Infinity C500, Drager).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients NIV will be delivered through either a facial mask with an inflatable soft&#xD;
      cushion seal (Gibeck, Upplands, Sweden; Vitalsigns, Towota, NJ, USA) or to a clear,&#xD;
      latex-free helmet (CaStar, Starmed, Mirandola, Italy), according to the clinical decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure support ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) will be used with&#xD;
      all interfaces. Pressure support ventilation will be started at 10 cmH2O and increased with&#xD;
      progressive stepwise increments of 2-3 cmH2O, to obtain an exhaled tidal volume of 6 mL/kg, a&#xD;
      respiratory rate (RR) &lt; 25 breaths/min, patient comfort and disappearance of both accessory&#xD;
      muscle activity and/or paradoxical abdominal motion. PEEP will be increased with stepwise&#xD;
      increments of 2-3 cmH2O up to 12 cmH2O to ensure peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of ≥90%&#xD;
      with the lowest possible FiO2. When the helmet will be used, part of the volume delivered to&#xD;
      the system will be used to distend the helmet without reaching the patient. PEEP levels will&#xD;
      be increased with stepwise increments of 2-3 cmH2O up to 15-18 cmH2O to ensure peripheral&#xD;
      oxygen saturation (SpO2) of ≥90% with the lowest possible FiO2 during NIV delivered through&#xD;
      the helmet. Ventilator settings will be then adjusted according to SpO2 and measurements of&#xD;
      arterial blood gases. The flow trigger will be set at 3 L/s, checking out the absence of&#xD;
      auto-triggering phenomena.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study group will be managed according to the standard of care with respect of medical&#xD;
      management of ARF (i.e, antibiotic, antiviral, or antifungal agents; bronchodilators;&#xD;
      diuretics; frequent respiratory treatments and chest physiotherapy), timing of medical&#xD;
      interventions (i.e placement of central and arterial catheters and frequency of blood&#xD;
      withdrawals, and cultures) and other aspects of emergency support (fluid administration,&#xD;
      correction of electrolytes abnormalities, nutrition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will be kept with the head of the bed at 30-45 degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for intubation and NIV discontinuation Pre-determined criteria for immediate ETI&#xD;
      will include the inability to maintain a PaO2 /FIO2 &gt; 140 during NIV, the onset of seizures&#xD;
      or coma (Glasgow coma score &lt; 8), hemodynamic instability (systolic blood pressure &lt; 80 mmHg&#xD;
      despite adequate fluid resuscitation and/or electrocardiographic signs of ischemia or&#xD;
      arrhythmias), intolerance of the interface, inability to manage copious secretions, inability&#xD;
      to alleviate dyspnea, or the need for an emergency surgical procedure. After intubation, all&#xD;
      patients will be ventilated with the same ventilation protocol, according to the&#xD;
      low-tidal-volume protective ventilatory strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for NIV weaning NIV will be maintained over the next 48 hours until oxygenation and&#xD;
      clinical status will improve. NIV will be progressively reduced in accordance with the degree&#xD;
      of clinical improvement and discontinued if the patient will be able to maintain a&#xD;
      respiratory rate &lt; than 30 breaths/min and a PaO2 &gt; 75 mmHg with a FiO2 of 0.5 without&#xD;
      ventilatory support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions and Measurements The Simplified Acute Physiologic Score (SAPS II) will be&#xD;
      calculated on admission to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all study group, the duration of mechanical ventilation and the ED stay, as well as the&#xD;
      hospital outcome will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first 12 hours from the enrollment into the study, the arterial blood gas levels&#xD;
      will be determined at baseline, at 1 hour, at 4 and 12 hours. Following this period, the&#xD;
      parameters will be measured at 12 hour intervals until the 96th hour from the patient&#xD;
      admission and/or his discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvement in gas exchange will be defined as the ability to increase PaO2/FiO2 above 200 or&#xD;
      an increase in this ratio of more than 100 from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early NIV success will be defined as the improvement in clinical status and gas exchange&#xD;
      within 1 hour of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIV success will be defined as the improvement in clinical status and gas exchange within the&#xD;
      first 48 hours of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sustained NIV success will be defined as the ability to maintain the defined improvement in&#xD;
      clinical status and gas exchange over the next 48 hours after the end of the time needed to&#xD;
      define NIV success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIV failure will be defined as the need of ETI at any point of the study period and/or&#xD;
      failure to reach an improvement in clinical status and gas exchange within 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored for the development of infections or other complications. Sepsis,&#xD;
      severe sepsis, and septic shock will be defined according to recent consensus guidelines.&#xD;
      Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) will be defined according to the Berlin&#xD;
      definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diaphragm thickness (DT) will be measured using a 7-10 MHz linear ultrasound probe set to B&#xD;
      mode (Vividier, General Electrics). Both the right and left diaphragm will be imaged at the&#xD;
      apposition point of the diaphragm and the rib cage on the midaxillary line, between the 8th&#xD;
      and the 10th intercostal spaces. DT will be measured at either the end-expiration or the&#xD;
      end-inspiration. The percent change in DT between end-expiration and end-inspiration (ΔDT%)&#xD;
      will be calculated as [(DTend-inspiration-DTend-expiration/DTend-expiration)×100]. The ΔDT%&#xD;
      for each patient will represent the mean of three to five breaths. During the first 12 hours&#xD;
      from the enrollment into the study, the DTF measurements will be determined at baseline, at 1&#xD;
      hour, at 4 and 12 hours. Following this period, the measurements will be performed at 12 hour&#xD;
      intervals until the 96th hour from the patient admission and/or his discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training the ultrasound operator to identify the diaphragm and measure its thickness will&#xD;
      take from three to five sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be performed by 2 different and appropriately trained operators who are&#xD;
      routinely involved in the management of the patients.&#xD;
