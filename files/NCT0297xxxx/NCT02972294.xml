  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fractures of the upper end of the femur, called commonly &quot;Hip fractures&quot; are very common,&#xD;
      with an incidence of approximately 1.6 million cases per year worldwide. This high incidence&#xD;
      is anticipated to grow rapidly in the next decades, driven by population aging. Anemia is&#xD;
      very frequent on admission for hip fracture, concerning up to 45% of the patients, with a&#xD;
      mean hemoglobin level of 12.5±0.2 g/dl. This high prevalence of anemia together with blood&#xD;
      losses, secondary to the fracture itself and surgery are responsible for a high rate of blood&#xD;
      transfusion (approximately 40-50% of the patients). However, both anemia and blood&#xD;
      transfusion are associated with poor outcome, including increased mortality, length of stay,&#xD;
      infection rate etc. In addition, blood is a scarce and expensive resource and its use should&#xD;
      be limited as much as possible. There is therefore a need to treat this anemia and/or to&#xD;
      prevent the decrease in hemoglobin. For this purpose, intravenous iron has been proposed.&#xD;
      Some non-randomized, mainly retrospective, studies have shown that perioperative intravenous&#xD;
      iron was able to reduce blood transfusion (i.e. the number of patients transfused and the&#xD;
      number of units per patient). Another way to reduce blood transfusion would be to reduce&#xD;
      perioperative bleeding. Tranexamic acid has proven to be efficient for this purpose both in&#xD;
      trauma patients and in elective surgery patients.The interest for perioperative blood&#xD;
      management has recently increased thanks to better recognition of the adverse effects of&#xD;
      blood transfusion, better understanding of iron metabolism, new intravenous iron drugs and a&#xD;
      renewed interest in former medications (i.e. tranexamic acid). HiFIT study therefore propose&#xD;
      a 2X2 factorial design for this study in order to answer questions vis-à-vis the interest of&#xD;
      iron and tranexamic acid to reduce blood transfusion in hip fracture patients.&#xD;

      Fractures of the upper end of the femur, called commonly &quot;Hip fractures&quot;are very common, with&#xD;
      an incidence of approximately 1.6 million cases per year worldwide. This high incidence is&#xD;
      anticipated to grow rapidly in the next decades, driven by population aging. Anemia is very&#xD;

      Some non-randomized, mainly retrospective, studies have shown that perioperative intravenous&#xD;
      iron was able to reduce blood transfusion (i.e. the number of patients transfused and the&#xD;
      number of units per patient). Indeed, a pooled analysis of 5 studies including 1,361 patients&#xD;
      suggests that intravenous iron could reduce perioperative transfusion in hip fracture&#xD;
      patients. However, there is no definitive data. Another way to reduce blood transfusion would&#xD;
      be to reduce perioperative bleeding. Tranexamic acid has proven to be efficient for this&#xD;
      purpose both in trauma patients and in elective surgery patients. However, there are only two&#xD;
      randomized studies investigating the interest of tranexamic acid in hip fractures, and they&#xD;
      are not conclusive probably owing to a lack of power. In addition, use of intravenous&#xD;
      tranexamic acid could be limited in this population of frail patients and topical use of&#xD;
      tranexamic acid, notably to prevent the intraoperative bleeding, appear to be an accurate and&#xD;
      sure alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although hip fracture is a very frequent pathology, with a high burden of care, few data are&#xD;
      available that focus on the management of perioperative anemia in this context. The interest&#xD;
      for perioperative blood management has recently increased thanks to better recognition of the&#xD;
      adverse effects of blood transfusion, better understanding of iron metabolism, new&#xD;
      intravenous iron drugs and a renewed interest in former medications (i.e. tranexamic acid).&#xD;
      hiFIT study therefore propose a 2X2 factorial design for this study in order to answer&#xD;
      questions vis-à-vis the interest of iron and tranexamic acid to reduce blood transfusion in&#xD;
      hip fracture patients.&#xD;
