      Background: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of disorders characterized by chronic&#xD;
      inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract with remissions and relapses. The two most common&#xD;
      subtypes are Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). In 2012, the burden-of-illness&#xD;
      report from the Crohn's and Colitis Canada estimated that the direct medical costs of IBD in&#xD;
      Canada were over one billion dollars, primarily funded through the Canadian public healthcare&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many life style-related factors may play an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD and can&#xD;
      contribute to trigger disease relapse, but several of these factors are poorly understood.&#xD;
      These factors may include sleep disturbances. Data on sleep disturbance in children with IBD&#xD;
      are limited. Sleep deprivation has been shown to cause reactivation of colitis in animal&#xD;
      studies but similar data are lacking in humans especially in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: In children with IBD, high scores for a sleep disturbance screener will be&#xD;
      positively associated with IBD relapse Objective: To develop a non-invasive non-costly tool&#xD;
      to screen for relapses in pediatric IBD patients through examining the association between&#xD;
      sleep disturbances and disease relapse in children with IBD Methods: This study will&#xD;
      incorporate an observational prospective design. Participants: Participants will be 90&#xD;
      children (ages 8-17 years ) under the care of the Pediatric IBD Program at the Children's&#xD;
      Hospital, Winnipeg. All participants will have an established diagnosis of IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures: Sleep disturbances will be assessed using a sleep diary. Patients will be asked&#xD;
      complete a daily sleep diary in the week preceding their clinic appointment. The sleep diary&#xD;
      will provide information about latency to fall asleep, number of awakenings, duration of&#xD;
      awakenings, total sleep time, sleep quality, and sleep efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mucosal inflammation will be assessed by measuring fecal calprotectin and clinical disease&#xD;
      activity will be measured Pediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI) for CD and&#xD;
      pediatric ulcerative colitis activity index (PUCAI) for UC at clinic visits&#xD;
      Anxiety/Depression: As anxiety and depression are often comorbid with disturbed sleep, levels&#xD;
      of symptoms in both domains will be assessed at clinic visit using the Child and Parent&#xD;
      Report Versions of the Spence Anxiety Scale and the Child Depression Inventory (v. 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: Upon obtaining informed consent, each participant will complete 7 days of sleep&#xD;
      diary recording in the week prior to their clinic appointment. During the clinic visit, the&#xD;
      PCDAI or PUCAI, Spence Anxiety Scales, Child Depression Inventory will be completed. Fecal&#xD;
      samples will be collected for fecal calprotectin measurement as a surrogate marker for&#xD;
      mucosal inflammation. Other investigations will include blood samples for serum hemoglobin,&#xD;
      serum albumin, and inflammatory markers. Stool samples for infection screen will also be&#xD;
      collected to exclude any possibility for gastrointestinal infection on top of IBD.A second&#xD;
      clinic visit will be scheduled 3 months later and the whole process will be repeated in the&#xD;
      second visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regression analysis will be performed to examine the association between sleep disturbances&#xD;
      and disease activity, characteristics and patients' demographics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Cut-off score of a sleep screener that is associated with disease relapse&#xD;
      (as diagnosed by fecal calprotectin value of &gt;100 microgram/gram of stools) in children with&#xD;
      IBD Secondary outcomes: 1. Correlation between sleep disturbance scores and clinical disease&#xD;
      activity indices (PCDAI and PUCAI). 2. Identification of which sleep component (sleep&#xD;
      duration, latency, fatigue, subjective quality) is the best at detecting a disease relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.Identification of whether sleep disturbance more accurately predicts relapse for CD than&#xD;
      for UC.&#xD;

      Hypothesis: In children with IBD, high scores for a sleep disturbance screener will be&#xD;
      positively associated with IBD relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Design and Specific Objective: This is a single centre pediatric observational&#xD;
      prospective study to develop a non-invasive non-costly tool to screen for relapses in&#xD;
      pediatric IBD patients through examining the association between sleep disturbances and&#xD;
      disease relapse in children with IBD. The outcomes are&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Cut-off score of a sleep screener in relation to disease relapse (as&#xD;
      diagnosed by fecal calprotectin value of &gt;100 microgram/gram of stools) in children with IBD&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Correlation between sleep disturbance scores and clinical disease activity indices&#xD;
           (PCDAI and PUCAI), after controlling for symptoms of anxiety and depression&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identification of which sleep component such as sleep duration and sleep latency is the&#xD;
           best at detecting a disease relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identification of whether sleep disturbance more accurately predicts relapse for CD than&#xD;
           for UC, after controlling for symptoms of anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Identifying any differences in intestinal microbiom between those with sleep&#xD;
           disturbances versus those without.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Methods and Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 Design: Observational prospective study 2. Inclusion Criteria 2.1. Children aged 8 -17&#xD;
      years under the care of the Pediatric IBD Program at the Children's Hospital, Winnipeg and&#xD;
      with an established diagnosis of IBD according to the North American Society of Pediatric&#xD;
      Gastroenterology (NASPGHAN) 3. Exclusion Criteria 3.1. Children with IBD and known cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction or global developmental delay 3.2. Children with IBD and concurrent&#xD;
      gastrointestinal infection 4 Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4.1. A standardized sleep diary will assess sleep in the past week. Scores will be&#xD;
           averaged over the 7-day recording period. The sleep diary will provide information about&#xD;
           latency to fall asleep, number of awakenings, duration of awakenings, total sleep time,&#xD;
           sleep quality, and sleep efficiency. To complement the sleep diary, the Children's&#xD;
           Report of Sleep Patterns, a 62-item questionnaire, will assess self-reported sleep&#xD;
           patterns, sleep hygiene, and sleep disturbance in children ages 8-17 years. It has&#xD;
           acceptable reliability and validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4.2. Disease relapse will be measured using fecal calprorectin (F Cal) and the PCDAI for&#xD;
           CD and PUCAI for UC.The quantum blue single point of care test (ALPCO) will be used&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4.3. The disease phenotype, duration, base-line characteristics, patient demographics,&#xD;
           smoking habits, medications, and initiation of new medications or other treatments for&#xD;
           IBD during the course of the study will be obtained by chart review using an information&#xD;
           form&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4.4. The Spence Children's Anxiety Scale will be used to assess anxiety symptoms (e.g.,&#xD;
           panic attacks, social phobia, fear of physical injuries, generalized anxiety). With&#xD;
           clinical cut-offs, the scale has demonstrated high internal consistency and good&#xD;
           test-retest reliability over a six-month period. Evidence of convergent and divergent&#xD;
           validity has been reported. As parent and youth report can differ, both self-report and&#xD;
           parent-report versions of the SCAS will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4.5. The Child Depression Inventory -II (short-form) is a 12-item scale of depressive&#xD;
           symptoms for youth aged 7 to 17 years. It represents one of the most widely used&#xD;
           measures of depression in this age group, has excellent reliability, concurrent,&#xD;
           construct, and predictive validity. Both self-report and parent-report will be&#xD;
           collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5. Study procedure: Families with children aged 8 -17 years, who are under the care of&#xD;
           the Pediatric IBD Program at the Children's Hospital, Winnipeg, and who have an&#xD;
           established diagnosis of IBD will be approached via letters to inform them about the&#xD;
           study and study procedures. The letters will give the option to patients and their care&#xD;
           givers to declare their lack of interest in participation if they do not want to be&#xD;
           approached or participate in the study. Patients and parents/guardians/care givers will&#xD;
           choose whether or not to provide &quot;permission to be contacted via phone&quot;. This will occur&#xD;
           through a phone number provided in the letter, and they will be instructed to call&#xD;
           within 1 week of receiving the letter to declare if they decline to be approached. If&#xD;
           lack of interest is not declared, the Research Assistant will call the potential&#xD;
           participants to explain the study procedure, obtain a verbal consent for participation&#xD;
           and ask participants to complete a sleep diary to assess sleep disturbances for one week&#xD;
           prior to the clinic visit. During the clinic visit, verbal consent will be confirmed and&#xD;
           informed assent/consent will be obtained by the children/parents (guardians) and the&#xD;
           completed sleep diary will be collected. During the same visit, fecal samples will be&#xD;
           collected for FCAL measurement as a surrogate marker for mucosal inflammation. A fecal&#xD;
           sample will be laso sent for microbiome analysis. Other investigations will include&#xD;
           blood samples for serum hemoglobin, serum albumin, and inflammatory markers (CRP and&#xD;
           ESR) and if participants have diarrhea, stool samples for infection screen will be&#xD;
           collected to exclude any possibility for gastrointestinal infection. In addition,&#xD;
           participants and their parents will complete the Spence Child Anxiety Scale, the Child&#xD;
           Depression Inventory (parent and child report), and the Children's Report of Sleep&#xD;
           Patterns (CRSP)(child report). It is expected that administration of these measures&#xD;
           during clinic will take 45 minutes. The Research Assistant will help participants who&#xD;
           need any clarification on how to respond to any question. Children will also be&#xD;
           clinically assessed and clinical disease activity will be measured using PCDAI for CD&#xD;
           and PUCAI for UC. Each participant will have all measures repeated at a second elective&#xD;
           clinic visit 3 months later during the course of the study period (9 months of&#xD;
           recruitment). Patients are normally instructed to call our office if they start&#xD;
           developing symptoms of relapse such as diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Patients then will&#xD;
           be asked over the phone to complete a sleep diary and to bring a stool sample for fecal&#xD;
           calprotectin. Stool samples for infection screen will be also collected and an emergency&#xD;
           clinic visit for clinical assessment of the disease and routine blood tests including&#xD;
           blood samples for measuring inflammatory markers will be planned within a week of having&#xD;
           symptoms of relapse. Completed sleep diary will be collected during the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5. Analysis and sample size To determine whether sleep disturbance is associated with&#xD;
           disease relapse, logistic regression analysis will be conducted. Logistic regression&#xD;
           will be used as the goal of the analysis is to predict the category of outcome for&#xD;
           individual patients (relapsed, not relapsed). As symptoms of anxiety and depression are&#xD;
           often comorbid with sleep disturbance, we will use these as covariates in the logistic&#xD;
           regression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the diagnostic performance of the sleep measures, or the level of sleep&#xD;
      disturbance associated with disease relapse, ROC will be analyzed using MedCalc. MedCalc is a&#xD;
      reliable and valid method of assessing the diagnostic validity of laboratory tests. ROC curve&#xD;
      analysis methodology will be used to plot curves representing the true positive (TPR) and&#xD;
      false positive rates (FPR) for sleep at different cut-off points. ROC curves will be used in&#xD;
      this investigation to determine an optimal cutoff level for the sleep measures and to&#xD;
      contrast the relative adequacy of measures to discriminate between participants who relapsed&#xD;
      versus those who did not. The MedCalc program assumes an underlying bi-normal distribution&#xD;
      and produces a non-parametric estimation of the area under the curve. Results from the PCDAI&#xD;
      and PUCAI will be the reference standard for the test. Information pertaining to test,&#xD;
      specificity, positive predictive value (PPV, and negative predictive value (NPV will be&#xD;
      obtained. Such an analysis will produce a range of sensitivity and specificity values&#xD;
      associated with different cut-off points for each of the sleep variables and the MedCalc&#xD;
      program chooses a cutoff point that maximizes both sensitivity and specificity. Using a&#xD;
      corrected z-test, analogous to a paired t-test, results will show whether there is a&#xD;
      statistically significant difference between the sleep predictors in terms of the overall&#xD;
      accuracy of measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on existing studies of sleep disturbances in IBD, sleep disturbances are assumed to be&#xD;
      prevalent in 80% of patients with active IBD compared to 40% of those in remission. To&#xD;
      achieve an acceptable power of .80 with alpha = .05, a sample of 90 patients will be&#xD;
      recruited. This number is highly feasible to recruit within the proposed clinic's patient&#xD;
      flow and where research participation rates exceed 80% in the current and past research&#xD;
      projects in the pediatric IBD program. Currently the IBD program cares for over 150 children&#xD;
      with IBD with over 130 patients &gt; 8 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analyses of the variables will be performed comparing disease type (CD/UC) and&#xD;
      disease status (inactive (F Cal &lt; 100 microgram/gram stools /active (F Cal &gt; 100&#xD;
      microgram/gram of stool)). Comparisons of disease subtypes and active/inactive subgroups will&#xD;
      be performed using two-tailed t-tests for continuous variables, and chi-square/Fisher exact&#xD;
      tests of association for categorical variables.&#xD;
