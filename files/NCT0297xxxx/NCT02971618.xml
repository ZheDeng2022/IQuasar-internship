      The study will retrospectively collect clinical variables and socio-demographic data from&#xD;
      medical records of patients with T2DM initiating treatment with dapagliflozin after the&#xD;
      previous failure/inefficiency of other treatment options (defined as non-achievement of&#xD;
      target Hb1Ac) and according to the officially approved indication as per instruction for the&#xD;
      use of medicinal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the best available data regarding clinical variables and patient&#xD;
      socio-demographic profiled will be collected from the patient medical records at up to 40&#xD;
      major Russian outpatient clinics/centers specialized in the treatment and management of T2DM&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 2 time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline data: baseline data are defined as data available within 3 months prior to the&#xD;
           first dose of dapagliflozin. In case of presence of multiple data values within baseline&#xD;
           period the most recent pre-dose value will be selected&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up data: any post-baseline data will be considered as follow-up but the primary&#xD;
           analysis will be focused on data available at 6 plus/minus 3 months after the initiation&#xD;
           of dapagliflozin. In case of discontinuation dapagliflozin, data will be collected at&#xD;
           routine visit within 3-month time frame after the last dose&#xD;

      Objectives and Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin) change from baseline to follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate percentage (%) of patients with reduction of HbA1c by 0.5% or more from&#xD;
           baseline to follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate percentage (%) of patients reaching the therapeutic glycemic response (HbA1c&#xD;
           &lt;7.0%) from baseline to follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe change of fasting blood glucose from baseline to follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate change of body weight from baseline to follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate percentage (%) of patients with body weight reduction by at least 5% from&#xD;
           baseline to follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate percentage (%) of patients with reduction of HbA1c by 0.5% or more and body&#xD;
           weight reduction by at least 5% from baseline to follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe change of systolic and diastolic blood pressure from baseline to follow-up&#xD;
           (systolic and diastolic, in mmHg)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will retrospectively collect clinical variables and socio-demographic data from&#xD;
      medical records of patients with T2DM initiating treatment with dapagliflozin after the&#xD;
      previous failure/inefficiency of other treatment options (defined as non-achievement of&#xD;
      target Hb1Ac) and according to the officially approved indication as per instruction for the&#xD;
      use of medicinal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the best available data regarding clinical variables and patient&#xD;
      socio-demographic profiled will be collected from the patient medical records at up to 40&#xD;
      major Russian outpatient clinics/centers specialized in the treatment and management of T2DM&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 2 time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline data: baseline data are defined as data available within 3 months prior to the&#xD;
           first dose of dapagliflozin. In case of presence of multiple data values within baseline&#xD;
           period the most recent pre-dose value will be selected&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up data: any post-baseline data will be considered as follow-up but the primary&#xD;
           analysis will be focused on data available at 6 plus/minus 3 months after the initiation&#xD;
           of dapagliflozin. In case of discontinuation dapagliflozin, data will be collected at&#xD;
           routine visit within 3-month time frame after the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Source(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating investigators should be physicians-endocrinologists working in approximately 12&#xD;
      outpatient clinics specialized in management of patients with T2DM in Moscow. There is no&#xD;
      current legislation on EMR in Russia, so, paper medical records will be utilized, and data&#xD;
      collection using electronic CRFs will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T2DM patients previously uncontrolled on standard therapy (mono-, double therapy with OADs:&#xD;
      metformin, SU or DPP-4 inhibitors or on insulin) initiating treatment with dapagliflozin as&#xD;
      monotherapy, combination with OADs or as add-on to insulin with available data on Hb1c within&#xD;
      3 months prior to the first dose of dapagliflozin. All consecutive patients at the clinic in&#xD;
      inclusion period who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients initiating treatment with dapagliflozin as monotherapy, combination with OADs&#xD;
      or as add-on to insulin will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date of birth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level of education&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level of income&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ethnicity/race&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Living conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Working conditions All documented macro- and microvascular T2DM complications and&#xD;
           concomitant medications (antidiabetic drugs, statins, ACE inhibitors, sartans,&#xD;
           beta-blockers, calcium channel antagonists) will be collected for whole course of&#xD;
           dapagliflozin administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hb1Ac&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting glucose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Estimations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximate sample size is 850 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological methods mainly will be used to represent the study data. A descriptive&#xD;
      analysis approach will be used to analyse study objectives. Descriptive statistics will be&#xD;
      used to analyse the study population, baseline data and clinical outcomes. The descriptive&#xD;
      statistics will include mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum, range, number&#xD;
      of valid cases for continuous variables, number, percentage, and distribution for categorical&#xD;
      variables. The percentage will be given with the relevant two-sided 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only available data will be analyzed; no missing values imputation will be applied. Only&#xD;
      patients with available data on HbA1c both within 3 months prior to the first dose of&#xD;
      dapagliflozin and at 6±3 months after the initiation of dapagliflozin will be included in the&#xD;
      main analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All other baseline, effectiveness parameters will be tabulated, assessed in subgroups where&#xD;
      available..&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the association between achievement of the HbA1C goals and patient&#xD;
      characteristics, the multivariate logistic regression model was developed. A binary&#xD;
      categorical attribute-HbA1C within/outside &lt; 7% at 6±3 months after the initiation of&#xD;
      dapagliflozin -serves as a dependable variable in this model&#xD;
