    <textblock>
      Exenatide once weekly (Bydureon) was approved in January 2012 by FDA in USA for the treatment&#xD;
      of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Evidence from clinical trials suggested that Bydureon improves&#xD;
      glucose control with low risk of hypoglycemia. Bydureon does not require a dose titration as&#xD;
      necessary for other glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, and appears to have other advantages,&#xD;
      such as reducing insulin resistance, reducing weight, and improving blood pressure and lipid&#xD;
      profiles. However, the degree to which these advantages of Bydureon lead to improve outcomes&#xD;
      in customary clinical care is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of Bydureon relative&#xD;
      to basal insulin initiated as first-ever injectable therapeutic regimens used in customary&#xD;
      clinical care. Patients who initiated treatment with Bydureon or basal insulin between July&#xD;
      2011 and March 2015 will be recruited into the study cohorts from Optum's database of&#xD;
      electronic health records. The two treatment cohorts will be matched by propensity score&#xD;
      method.Clinical outcomes of HbA1c, weight, and gastrointestinal symptoms and hypoglycemia are&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;

      Background: In January 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a once-weekly form&#xD;
      of exenatide, Bydureon, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Evidence from clinical&#xD;
      trials suggested that Bydureon improves glucose control with low risk of hypoglycemia.&#xD;
      Bydureon does not require a dose titration as necessary for other glucagon-like peptide-1&#xD;
      receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), and appears to have other advantages, such as reducing insulin&#xD;
      resistance, preventing weight gain, and improving blood pressure and lipid profiles. However,&#xD;
      the degree to which these advantages of Bydureon lead to improve outcomes in customary&#xD;
      clinical care is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of Bydureon&#xD;
      relative to basal insulin initiated as first-ever injectable therapeutic regimens used in&#xD;
      customary clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific study objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To quantify the effectiveness of Bydureon initiation relative to initiation of basal&#xD;
           insulin, on improving:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight (body mass index (BMI))&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HbA1c simultaneous to reduction in weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure and lipid profiles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To monitor the tolerability of Bydureon initiation relative to initiation basal insulin,&#xD;
           on the occurrence of :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypoglycemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in the markers for renal disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR),&#xD;
           serum creatinine, and albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR), and the stability of liver&#xD;
           function test (AST, ALT) and standard blood counts (white blood cell, red blood cell,&#xD;
           Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, Platelet)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine these measures of effectiveness and tolerability within potentially&#xD;
           vulnerable subgroups of Bydureon and basal insulin initiators:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type 2 diabetes patients with renal impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elderly Type 2 diabetes patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type 2 diabetes patients who are a minority race&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type 2 diabetes patients within strata of HBA1c Design: This retrospective cohort study&#xD;
           will be conducted using Optum's electronic health record data from July 2011 through&#xD;
           March 2015 and identified injectable-naive Type 2 diabetes patients who initiated either&#xD;
           Bydureon or basal insulin during the accrual period, January 2012 and January 2015.&#xD;
           Injectable-naive Type 2 diabetes patients will be identified. Propensity score methods&#xD;
           will be used to match initiators of Bydureon to basal insulin initiators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be selected from the electronic health recrod data included&#xD;
      patients with Type 2 diabetes who initiated Bydureon or basal insulin. Eligible patients had:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Received care for at least 6 months prior to the date of study drug initiation (cohort&#xD;
           entry) with at least one outpatient clinic visit in the 6 months prior to cohort entry&#xD;
           (baseline period);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least one diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (ICD-9 250.X0 or 250.X2) prior to and&#xD;
           including the date of the qualifying drug initiation, no prior diagnosis (inclusive of&#xD;
           the index date) of type 1 diabetes mellitus (250.X1 or 250.X3), and no diagnosis of&#xD;
           gestational diabetes within the previous 6 months (inclusive of the index date); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No evidence of prior injectable antidiabetic treatment, specifically no dispensing of&#xD;
           GLP-1RA or any insulin drug during the 6-month baseline period. Outcomes and Analysis:&#xD;
           To measure the effectiveness of Bydureon relative to basal insulin are changes in HbA1c&#xD;
           and body weight, as well as changes in HbA1c and simultaneous reduction in weight.&#xD;
           Changes in BMI, lipid profiles, and blood pressure will be examined. These variables are&#xD;
           part of the clinical and laboratory data in the electronic health records. Each outcome&#xD;
           will be evaluated for completeness, multiply imputed, and reported across standardized&#xD;
           time intervals. HbA1c, weight and BMI are summarized in baseline and quarterly (3-month&#xD;
           intervals) in the first year following drug initiation. Lipid measurements and blood&#xD;
           pressure are summarized in baseline and bi-annually (6-month intervals) in the first&#xD;
           year following drug initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess drug tolerability, the incidence of hypoglycemia, and gastrointestinal symptoms&#xD;
      (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation) will be assessed. These outcomes are&#xD;
      ascertained using an ICD-9 algorithm applied to the structured fields and by extracting&#xD;
      mentions of hypoglycemia using a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm developed by&#xD;
      Optum and applied to the free text clinical notes available in the data. In addition the&#xD;
      stability of renal function evaluated by change in eGFR, or albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR);&#xD;
      the change in serum hepatic enzymes [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine&#xD;
      aminotransferase (ALT)], and hematologic measures [red blood cells counts (RBC), white blood&#xD;
      cell counts (WBC), platelets (PLT), hemoglobin (Hgb) and hematocrit (Hct) will be evaluated.&#xD;
      Each of these laboratory values will be evaluated for completeness, multiply imputed, and&#xD;
      reported across standardized time intervals. eGFR and ACR will be summarized in baseline and&#xD;
      quarterly (3-month intervals) in the first year following drug initiation. Hepatic enzymes&#xD;
      and hematologic measures are summarized in baseline and semi-annually (6-month intervals) in&#xD;
      the first year following drug initiation.&#xD;

        This cohort study compares injectable-naive exenatide once-weekly and basal insulin&#xD;
        initiators. The study cohorts were drawn from an Optum's Electronic Health Records database&#xD;
        that integrates records from many medical groups and hospitals in the United States&#xD;
        representing over 25,000 physicians and over 25 million patients in ordinary clinical&#xD;
        practice. The Electronic Health Records captures clinical, operational, and financial&#xD;
        information that physicians record at the time of care. This information includes&#xD;
        diagnoses, procedures, medications (prescribed and administered), clinical measures&#xD;
        (biometric and laboratory values), and clinical notes (e.g., physician, pathology, and&#xD;
        radiology notes).&#xD;
