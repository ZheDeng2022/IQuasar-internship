      Aim: To investigate the impact of antioxidants (acetyl-L-carnitine, N-acetyl-L-cysteine and&#xD;
      a-lipoic acid) on embryo development and subsequently the clinical outcome. Including clinics&#xD;
      using low oxygen and ambient air during embryo culture. Analysed with time-lapse system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study media: G-TL with antioxidants. Control media: Same media without antioxidants. Type of&#xD;
      study: Study comparing blastocyst development on the same cohort of oocytes using two&#xD;
      different media, G-TL versus G-TL supplemented with antioxidants. Statistics based on an&#xD;
      absolute increase in Good Quality Blastocysts on day 5 of 7%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Multicentre prospective randomized sibling trial. Single blastocyst transfer.&#xD;
      Superiority study Primary Endpoint: Good Quality Blastocysts on day 5 per allocated normally&#xD;
      fertilized oocyte.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: Comparative embryo sibling study with 128 patients included.&#xD;

      Study objective: Study comparing blastocyst development on the same cohort of oocytes using&#xD;
      two different media, G-TL versus G-TL supplemented with antioxidants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Percentage of good quality blastocysts (GQB) per fertilized oocyte on day&#xD;
      5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Embryo development day 3, 5 and 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Embryo quality day 3, 5 and 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total blastocyst formation (day 5 and day 6)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Utilization rate (embryos available for transfer and cryopreservation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implantation rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical pregnancy rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setup: Prospective embryo sibling, superiority study&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS Intervention New type of embryo culture media used for in vitro culture&#xD;
      of human IVF embryos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis The planning and the power analysis was made together with a statistician,&#xD;
      Nils-Gunnar Pehrsson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From retrospective data using simulation, the intra individual SD for the difference in % GQB&#xD;
      between the two media strategies was estimated to 32%. In order to find a difference in 8% in&#xD;
      GQB between the two media with power 80% with paired T-test 128 couples will be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Couples will be enrolled in the study after fertilization check (day 1). A&#xD;
      minimum of 6 zygotes is required for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratified randomization of the zygotes by couple will be performed. For each couple the&#xD;
      zygotes will be numbered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These zygotes for each couple will then be block (by two) randomized to the two media types;&#xD;
      A (Traditional culture media = Control) and B (Antioxidant media = intervention). In both&#xD;
      groups traditional culture will be performed. Allocation will be performed in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      according to a unique randomization list for each couple.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding To minimize possible bias for the primary outcome (GQE D5) the embryologist&#xD;
      performing the morphological evaluation on day 5/6 will not know which group the embryos&#xD;
      belong to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the physician and the couple will be blinded to which group they have been allocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVF treatment procedure A traditional IVF treatment will be performed including ovarian&#xD;
      stimulation and oocyte pick-up using the standard methods at the clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embryo assessment and timing of assessment according to Alpha/ESHRE consensus criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morphological scoring Blastocyst morphology will be scored according to Consensus Scoring&#xD;
      system for blastocysts (Istanbul Consensus workshop on embryo assessment) and the morphology&#xD;
      will be documented with individual photos of each blastocyst. Blastocyst scoring will be&#xD;
      performed under an inverted microscope on day 5 and day 6. A good quality blastocyst is&#xD;
      defined as at least Grade 2:2:2 according to Istanbul Consensus grading system. (Balaban et&#xD;
      al., 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOCUMENTATION All patients participating in the study will be documented on a computerized&#xD;
      CRF. This document will be related to patients' records with all relevant clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory data from the specific IVF cycle. Through the journal system (WinIVF) used at&#xD;
      Fertilitetscentrum, it will be possible to generate a complete list of all the variables&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have been asked to participate in the study but did not fulfill the criteria for&#xD;
      randomization will also be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Both an Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population and a Per Protocol (PP)&#xD;
      population will be defined. Primary efficacy variable in this superiority study will be&#xD;
      difference in %GQB between the two media types for each couple. Primary statistical analysis&#xD;
      will be two-sided paired T-test regarding the mean of difference in %GQB between Standard&#xD;
      culture media and Antioxidant media on the ITT population. A two sided 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval for the mean difference in %GOB between the two media will be calculated. All&#xD;
      significance tests will be two-sided and conducted at the 5% significance level.&#xD;
