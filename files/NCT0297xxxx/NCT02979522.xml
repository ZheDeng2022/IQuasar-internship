    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity, as&#xD;
      well as confirm the recommended dose of brentuximab vedotin (ADCETRIS) in combination with a&#xD;
      multiagent chemotherapy regimen, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), vinblastine, and dacarbazine, in&#xD;
      pediatric participants with advanced stage newly diagnosed classical CD30+ Hodgkin Lymphoma&#xD;
      (HL).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called brentuximab vedotin. Brentuximab vedotin is&#xD;
      being tested to treat pediatric participants who have advanced stage, newly diagnosed,&#xD;
      classical CD30+ HL. This study will assess the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity,&#xD;
      as well as recommended dose of brentuximab vedotin in combination with a multiagent&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen that is based on a current standard of care (SOC) first-line treatment&#xD;
      regimen for newly diagnosed HL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll at least 55 evaluable participants. The study will be conducted in 2&#xD;
      phases, Phase 1 and Phase 2. Phase 1 study will enroll at least 6 participants to determine&#xD;
      the recommended dose. Once the recommended dose is identified additional participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled into phase 2 so that the total number of evaluable participants will be at least 55,&#xD;
      including participants treated at recommended dose in Phase 1. Participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      to the following initial dose cohort with an option to explore a reduced dose cohort at 36&#xD;
      mg/m^2 if needed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Brentuximab vedotin 48 mg/m^2 in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine, and&#xD;
      dacarbazine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants continue in follow-up to Sept 2021 and may continue in the optional long-term&#xD;
      follow-up of approximately 10 years up to Sept 2029.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States, Italy, Brazil and Japan. The&#xD;
      overall time to participate in this study is approximately 55 months, including the follow-up&#xD;
      period. Participants will be followed for a maximum of 30 days following the last dose of&#xD;
      protocol therapy for a follow-up assessment and will be followed for survival and disease&#xD;
      status every 12 weeks for 12 months, and then every 24 weeks until death or study closure or&#xD;
      for up to 2 years from the date of the last participant enrolled. All participants will have&#xD;
      an opportunity to participate in an optional long-term follow up, for at least 10 years from&#xD;
      their date of enrollment in the main study.&#xD;

    <description>Brentuximab vedotin 48 milligram per square meter (mg/m^2), intravenous infusion, once on Day 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle approximately 1 hour after administration of doxorubicin 25 mg/m^2, vinblastine 6 mg/m^2, and Dacarbazine 375 mg/m^2, intravenous infusion, once on Day 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles. If the first 6 participants complete the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period with 0 or 1 participant experiencing a DLT, 48 mg/m^2 will be established as the recommended dose for phase 2 study. If at any time more than 1 participant out of a maximum 6 DLT-evaluable participants experiences a DLT, brentuximab vedotin dose will be reduced to 36 mg/m^2. If 0 or 1 participant experiences a DLT among the 6 participants treated at 36 mg/m^2, 36 mg/m^2 will be established as recommended dose for phase 2 study. If more than 1 participant experiences a DLT in the first 6 participants treated at 36 mg/m^2, the study will be discontinued.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Participants with advanced stage newly diagnosed, classical CD30+ Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) were enrolled in this 2-phase study to receive brentuximab vedotin 48 milligram per square meter (mg/m^2) in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (A+AVD). Phase 2 included all participants treated in Phase 1 along with additional enrolled participants in Phase 2. As planned, 36 mg/m^2 group was omitted from the study since no participant received 36 mg/m^2.</pre_assignment_details>

Participants who did not have objective progressive disease (PD), did not die, were either still on study follow-up at time of analysis were removed from study prior to documentation of PD, PFS were censored on date of last adequate disease assessment before initiation of any non-protocol, alternative therapy. Participants who were on antitumor treatment, other than SCT, or radiotherapy, censoring was at last adequate disease assessment before initiation of such alternative treatment. If participant experienced disease progression per IRF/died after initiation of antitumor treatment, other than SCT, or radiotherapy, such participant were censored and not considered having PFS.
