  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enhancing children's sleep duration and/or timing may represent a novel approach for weight&#xD;
      regulation and prevention of T2DM. The proposed study will assess how experimental changes in&#xD;
      children's sleep duration and timing affect weight regulation and T2DM risk. Sixty African&#xD;
      American children ages 8-11 years old who sleep approximately 9.5 hours or less each night&#xD;
      will be enrolled into a 4-arm randomized controlled pilot to compare three experimental&#xD;
      manipulations in children's sleep to a &quot;typical sleep&quot; (TYP) control. Experimental arms will&#xD;
      include: 1) increase in time in bed (TIB) by 90 minutes/night; 2) increase in TIB by 45&#xD;
      minutes/night; or 3) consistent (CON) sleep schedule (but no change in TIB). At baseline, 2-&#xD;
      and 4-week follow-up, participants be weighed and measured for height, have body fat assessed&#xD;
      (bod pod), and their blood drawn (following an overnight fast). The pilot will provide&#xD;
      important data on the potential role of sleep in combating disparities in cardiometabolic&#xD;
      risk. Primary aims are: 1) to determine the effects of changes in sleep on changes in glucose&#xD;
      regulation and 2) to determine the effect of changes in sleep on additional measures of&#xD;
      glucose regulation and adiposity.&#xD;

      Eligible families who provide consent/assent will be enrolled into a five week study. All&#xD;
      families will complete assessments at baseline, two weeks and four weeks. Each assessment&#xD;
      lasts one week and children will be asked to wear an actigraph on their wrist (to measure&#xD;
      sleep) and an accelerometer on their hip (to measure physical activity). At the end of the&#xD;
      week families will be scheduled for a visit at the research center first thing in the morning&#xD;
      approximately one hour after waking and following an overnight fast. During this visit,&#xD;
      actigraphs and accelerometers will be downloaded and data will be reviewed with families.&#xD;
      Children will be weighed and measured for height and have their body composition assessed. To&#xD;
      measure glucose regulation, children will first have 5 ml of blood drawn in a fasted state.&#xD;
      They will then ingest a glucose solution (1.75 g/kg; maximum of 75 g) over 2 minutes, and&#xD;
      blood will be drawn (1.5 ml) 120 min after the child consumes the solution. At week 4, 5 ml&#xD;
      blood will be drawn fasting; OGTT will not be administered (see note below). Research staff&#xD;
      will also complete one-day dietary recalls with participants at each center-based assessment&#xD;
      to obtain information on all foods consumed over the previous 24-hour period. In addition, at&#xD;
      the baseline assessment only, parents will complete questionnaires on basic demographic&#xD;
      information and child sleep. It is anticipated that the total time for each assessment will&#xD;
      take approximately 2.5-3 hours (1 hour at 4 weeks). Following eligibility confirmation at the&#xD;
      baseline assessment, families will be randomized to one of four protocols: 1) Enhance TIB by&#xD;
      90 min/night; 2) Enhance TIB by 45 min/night; 3) Regularize Sleep Schedule; or 4) Typical&#xD;
      Sleep Schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous glucose monitoring In a voluntary subset of randomly selected children&#xD;
      (approximately n = 4/group) 72-hour continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) will be performed. If&#xD;
      the child and family agree to participate in CGM, they will come to the Center for an&#xD;
      additional visit during which a disposable subcutaneous glucose-sensing device connected to a&#xD;
      battery-operated recorder will be inserted subcutaneously (a thin tube under the surface of&#xD;
      the skin). This sensor measures glucose every ten seconds and records an average value every&#xD;
      five minutes.&#xD;
