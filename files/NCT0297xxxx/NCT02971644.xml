    <textblock>
      To investigate whether implantation of cobalt alloy pedicle screws is effective in treating&#xD;
      severe kyphosis deformity in spinal tuberculosis, and to determine the factors that are&#xD;
      likely to have influenced the curative effects.&#xD;

      History and current related studies The incidence of spinal tuberculosis has continually&#xD;
      increased in recent years; this disease commonly occurs in the lumbar spine, lumbar&#xD;
      vertebrae, thoracic vertebrae, and cervical vertebrae. The majority of spinal tuberculosis&#xD;
      patients present with kyphosis deformity in corresponding segments. In spinal tuberculosis&#xD;
      patients with severe kyphotic deformity, the key to successful treatment is the individual&#xD;
      patient's response to tuberculosis drugs and the implementation of rational fixation&#xD;
      approaches at an appropriate time; good curative effects have been shown using anterior or&#xD;
      posterior fixation, followed by posterior debridement and bone graft fusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery via the posterior or anterior approach will be respectively performed in 16 of 32&#xD;
      patients with tuberculosis of the lumbar spine. The spinal cord function of these 32 patients&#xD;
      has been assessed as Frankel grade C (n = 7), D (n = 14) and E (n = 11). The primary outcome&#xD;
      measure of this study will be the Cobb angle at the thoracic spine segments preoperatively&#xD;
      versus 2 years postoperatively, which will be used to evaluate the postoperative change in&#xD;
      the thoracic spine curvature. The primary causes of poor healing or recurrence of spinal&#xD;
      tuberculosis at the thoracic and lumbar segments are reportedly improper surgical timing,&#xD;
      poor debridement, improper selection of internal fixation methods, poor selection of bone&#xD;
      graft material or grafting position, irregular anti-tuberculosis bacilli chemotherapy, drug&#xD;
      tolerance, poor braking, and not using a brace after surgery. However, the factors that&#xD;
      influence curative effects require further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pedicle screws are commonly used to repair spine fracture, and therefore they should have&#xD;
      good biocompatibility. Cobalt alloy reportedly exhibits good anti-bending and&#xD;
      anti-compressive strength, strong impact toughness, good elastic modulus, small thermal&#xD;
      expansion coefficient, and good compatibility with the human body. However, few studies have&#xD;
      investigated the use of cobalt alloy pedicle screws for treatment of severe kyphosis&#xD;
      deformity in spinal tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events The investigators will record adverse events, including vertebral body&#xD;
      displacement, thoracic and lumbar back muscle injury, nonspecific low back pain, and screw&#xD;
      pull out or loosening. If severe adverse events occur, investigators will report details,&#xD;
      including the data of occurrence and measures taken to treat the adverse events, to the&#xD;
      principle investigator and the institutional review board within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection, management, analysis and open-access Data collection: Case report forms with&#xD;
      demographic data, disease diagnosis, accompanying diseases, drug allergy history, and adverse&#xD;
      events will be collected, processed using Epidata software (Epidata Association, Odense,&#xD;
      Denmark), collated, and then recorded electronically by data managers using a double-data&#xD;
      entry strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management: The locked electronic database will be accessible and locked only by the&#xD;
      project manager, and will not be altered. All data regarding this trial will be preserved by&#xD;
      the Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: The electronic database will be statistically analyzed by a professional&#xD;
      statistician who will create an outcome analysis report that will be submitted to the lead&#xD;
      researchers. An independent data monitoring committee will supervise the mange the trial&#xD;
      data, ensuring a scientific and stringent trial to yield accurate and complete data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data open access: Anonymized trial data will be published at www.figshare.com.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS 19.0 software, and&#xD;
      will follow the intention-to-treat principle. Normally distributed measurement data will be&#xD;
      expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and minimums and maximums. Non-normally distributed&#xD;
      measurement data will be expressed as lower quartile (q1), and median and upper quartile&#xD;
      (q3). The Wilcoxon matched pairs test will be performed for comparison of the Cobb angle&#xD;
      preoperatively versus 2 years postoperatively. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be&#xD;
      performed for comparison of pre- and post-operative Frankel grade, and McNemar's chi-squared&#xD;
      test will be used to analyze the incidence of adverse reactions. Multiple logistic regression&#xD;
      analysis will be performed to analyze the factors that influence curative effects, with&#xD;
      calculation of regression coefficients, odd ratios and 95% confidence interval. The&#xD;
      significance level will be α = 0.05.&#xD;
