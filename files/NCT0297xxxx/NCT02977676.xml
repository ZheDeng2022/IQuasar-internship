      The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of ventilator-associated events (VAE).&#xD;
      To analyze the patients profile, morbidity and mortality compared to patients who did not&#xD;
      develope VAE. The preventability of VAE will be assessed by comparing the percentage of&#xD;
      adherence to the bundle of preventive measures among patients who developed and did not&#xD;
      develope VAE.&#xD;

      This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data, approved by the Research&#xD;
      Ethics Committee of Hospital Sao Domingos. The need for informed consent was waived.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included were all patients admitted to a surgical (13 beds) and medical (32 beds) of a&#xD;
      tertiary hospital over a 3-year period (February 2013 to January 2016), aged above 18 years&#xD;
      and submitted to mechanical ventilation for at least 4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At admission and daily the following data were collected: head of bed elevation, daily&#xD;
      interruption of sedation, gastric ulcer prevention, Thromboembolism prophylaxis, aspiration&#xD;
      of subglottic secretions, oral care with chlorhexidine gluconate and monitoring of&#xD;
      endotracheal tube cuff pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of VAE, Ventilator-associated condition (VAC), Infectious condition associated&#xD;
      to mechanical ventilation (IVAC) and ventilator-associated pneumonia possible and probable&#xD;
      followed definition criteria of the National Healthcare Safety Network / Center for Disease&#xD;
      Control and Prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percentage of adherence to the bundle of preventive measures of VAE prevention was&#xD;
      registered.&#xD;
