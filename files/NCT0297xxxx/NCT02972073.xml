      The purposes of this study include 1) determine clinical utility of clinical observation of&#xD;
      aberrant movement patterns during functional trunk and pelvic movements in asymptomatic&#xD;
      individuals and patients with non-specific low back pain, 2) characterize trunk neuromuscular&#xD;
      control in asymptomatic individuals and patients with non-specific low back pain, and 3)&#xD;
      determine the appropriate physical therapy intervention that addresses trunk neuromuscular&#xD;
      control deficits in patients with non-specific low back pain.&#xD;

      This study will use a sample of convenience between the ages of 21 - 65. Patients with&#xD;
      non-specific low back pain (NSLBP) will be recruited by advertisement in 2 Mahidol university&#xD;
      physical therapy clinics and participating clinics and hospitals. Asymptomatic participants&#xD;
      will be also recruited by flyers posted in 2 Mahidol university physical therapy clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based upon power analysis for change in kinematic pattern in patients with NSLBP after an&#xD;
      8-week core stabilization exercise program, a total required sample size is 29 patients with&#xD;
      NSLBP to detect a medium effect size (Cohen's d) of .48 at level (α) of .05 and power (1-β)&#xD;
      of .80. Fifteen percent drop-out rate is used as a conservative sample size calculation.&#xD;
      Therefore, 34 patients with NSLBP (29 X 15% drop-out) and 34 age-, sex-, and BMI-matched&#xD;
      asymptomatic participants will be included for each independent intervention study (core&#xD;
      stabilization exercise approach, movement system impairment approach, neuromuscular&#xD;
      activation using suspension, and kinematic linkage imbalance approach). Each intervention&#xD;
      will be separately collected and analyzed. The total of 272 participants will be recruited to&#xD;
      fulfill this study project (4 independent intervention studies). However, sample size for&#xD;
      asymptomatic participants can be decreased if participant from one intervention study is&#xD;
      matched with patients with NSLBP in other intervention studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with NSLBP who are interested in participation will undergo a screening process&#xD;
      using inclusion-exclusion criteria checklist and receive brief information regarding the&#xD;
      study. If they meet all inclusion criteria, the consent process and biomechanical testing&#xD;
      will be scheduled. On date of consent and biomechanical testing, both asymptomatic&#xD;
      participants and participants with NSLBP will be provided a consent form. To ensure they&#xD;
      understand the study, they will be simply asked regarding the study (i.e. objectives,&#xD;
      benefits, etc.) before signing the consent form. After the participants provide a written&#xD;
      informed consent, they will undergo a standardized physical therapy examination performed by&#xD;
      an experienced physical therapist (PT-A). For patients with NSLBP, they will also complete 3&#xD;
      clinical outcome measures including 1) numeric pain rating scale (Thai version), 2) Oswestry&#xD;
      disability index (Thai version), and 3) general health status questionnaire (Thai version).&#xD;
      This pre-biomechanical data collection process will last approximately 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For biomechanical testing, body landmarks will be identified and marked with a skin pen for 4&#xD;
      motion sensors and 16 pairs of surface electromyography (EMG) electrodes in lower back and&#xD;
      abdominal areas. Any hair in the area around the sensors and electrodes will be shaved.&#xD;
      Before placing surface EMG electrodes, the skin will be lightly abraded using abrasive paper&#xD;
      and cleaned using cotton with alcohol to lower the skin impedance. Electrodes will be aligned&#xD;
      parallel to the muscle fibers. This process will take approximately 30 minutes. Then,&#xD;
      participants will proceed to the biomechanical testing which includes 1) trunk muscle&#xD;
      strength test, 2) functional trunk and pelvic movement tests, and 3) core control tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trunk muscle strength test Strength test Participants will wear a climbing harness connecting&#xD;
      with a tension load cell and sit in a testing apparatus in a neutral trunk position with&#xD;
      pelvic securely locked. This apparatus intends to reduce compensation from lower extremities&#xD;
      during sub-maximal (15% of body weight) and maximal voluntary isometric contractions.&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to use their trunk gradually pulling the load cell (isometric&#xD;
      contraction in neutral trunk position) for 10 seconds in forward, backward, and 2 side&#xD;
      bending directions. Participants will be given 2 practice trials in each direction to adjust&#xD;
      the force and reduce a learning effect. Visual feedback of force to sub-maximal target will&#xD;
      be provided. Two trials of sub-maximal voluntary isometric contractions will be collected in&#xD;
      each direction. Only 1 trial of maximal voluntary isometric contraction will be collected to&#xD;
      avoid muscle fatigue (in both asymptomatic participants and patients with NSLBP) and pain&#xD;
      exacerbation (in patients with NSLBP). The intention of collecting maximal contraction data&#xD;
      is to use for EMG standardization. Participants will rest in between each trial to minimize&#xD;
      fatigue. Pain and rating perceived exertion (RPE) will be monitored and recorded at the end&#xD;
      of trunk strength test. This protocol will take approximately 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional trunk and pelvic movement tests Participants will stand on a drawing paper with&#xD;
      feet shoulder width apart in front of the motion transmitter. The foot print will be drawn&#xD;
      using a marker. This foot print will be used for post-test positioning. The participants will&#xD;
      stand in a natural stance facing away from the transmitter with arms down by sides.&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to stand up straight and maintain that position for&#xD;
      digitization. After the completion of digitization, participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      perform functional movements including 1) active forward bend and return to upright position,&#xD;
      2) right and left straight leg raise tests, 3) right and left hip abduction with knee flexion&#xD;
      tests, 4) quadruped backward rock test, 5) prone with right and left knee flexion tests, 6)&#xD;
      prone with right and left hip internal/external rotation tests, and 7) prone with right and&#xD;
      left hip extension tests. Participants will perform 2 trials of 3 consecutive repetitions of&#xD;
      each functional movement tests. Two physical therapists (PT-B and PT-C), who are blinded to&#xD;
      the group membership, will simultaneously observe and independently rate aberrant movement&#xD;
      patterns during biomechanical data collection. This protocol will take approximately 30&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core control tasks Participants will sit on an unstable chair with feet supported. The chair&#xD;
      is mounted on a half ball that makes the chair unstable and tilt. Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to balance the chair without tipping the chair in any direction. The participants&#xD;
      will maintain upright seated balance with crossing both arms in front of their chest. The&#xD;
      participants will have an opportunity to get familiar with the balance testing protocol prior&#xD;
      to the data collection to minimize the learning effect. This core control tasks aim to&#xD;
      investigate the performances that represent static and dynamic stabilities of the trunk. For&#xD;
      static stability, the participants will perform 3 trials of 60-second seated balance tests&#xD;
      with their eyes open, and 3 trials of 60-second seated balance tests with their eyes closed.&#xD;
      The participants will be given a 1-minute rest period between trials to avoid muscle fatigue.&#xD;
      For dynamic stability, the participants will be instructed to perform a dynamic stability&#xD;
      using lumbar spine (without trunk leaning to tilt an unstable chair as far as they can) in 8&#xD;
      different directions (forward, backward, right, left, right diagonal, and left diagonal). The&#xD;
      participants will be given 1 practice trial to reduce possibility of learning effect, and 3&#xD;
      real trials with 1-minute rest period between trials. Pain and RPE will be recorded at the&#xD;
      completion of core control task. This protocol will take approximately 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with NSLBP will be assigned to one of different physical therapy interventions&#xD;
      according to participating clinics and hospitals, while asymptomatic participants will be&#xD;
      encouraged to maintain usual daily activities and avoid participating in activities that&#xD;
      involve trunk muscle exercise. After completion of an 8-week physical therapy intervention,&#xD;
      both asymptomatic participants and patients with NSLBP will undergo the standardized physical&#xD;
      therapy examination and biomechanical data collection again. For patients with NSLBP, they&#xD;
      will also complete clinical outcome measures for post physical therapy intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical therapy intervention Patients with NSLBP will be treated with a standard physical&#xD;
      therapy intervention based upon different treatment concepts. In general, these interventions&#xD;
      include strengthening exercise, endurance exercise, stretching exercise, patient education,&#xD;
      patient ergonomics, and home exercise program. There is no reported adverse effect of those&#xD;
      physical therapy interventions. Therefore, those physical therapy interventions are safe for&#xD;
      treating patients with NSLBP. Each patient will be treated 1-2 times per week for 60 minutes&#xD;
      each session for 8 weeks by experienced physical therapists. Patients will be given a home&#xD;
      exercise log for exercise compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Statistical analyses will be performed using statistical package for the social science&#xD;
      (SPSS) software (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0., New York, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objective 1 is to determine inter-rater reliability and diagnostic accuracy of clinical&#xD;
      observation of aberrant movement patterns during functional trunk and pelvic movements in&#xD;
      patients with NSLBP. Agreement on the presence/absence of aberrant movement patterns between&#xD;
      physical therapists (PT-B and PT-C) will be determined using separate kappa statistics.&#xD;
      Diagnostic accuracy will be determined using accuracy statistics which include sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity, and likelihood ratio. Significance level will be held at .05 for all analysis.&#xD;
      Confidence intervals will also be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objective 2 is to characterize neuromuscular control in asymptomatic participants and&#xD;
      patients with NSLBP during functional activities. Each variable will be analyzed separately.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics (i.e. mean and standard deviation) will be performed and statistical&#xD;
      assumptions (i.e. normal distribution, homogeneity of variance, etc.) related to specific&#xD;
      statistical tests will be performed. Statistical transformation will be performed if&#xD;
      appropriate. Then, statistical test (i.e. independent t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, etc.) that&#xD;
      appropriate to the data will be performed to determine the difference between asymptomatic&#xD;
      participants and patients with NSLBP. Significance level will be held at .05 for all&#xD;
      analyses. Post-hoc power analysis will also be performed to determine statistical power and&#xD;
      effect size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objective 3 is to determine the appropriate physical therapy intervention that&#xD;
      addresses neuromuscular control deficits in patients with NSLBP. First, the effects of each&#xD;
      physical therapy intervention on trunk neuromuscular control and clinical outcomes will be&#xD;
      determined. Prior to utilization of statistical tests, descriptive statistics will be&#xD;
      performed and statistical assumptions will be tested. Transformation will be performed if the&#xD;
      data are not normally distributed. Appropriate statistical tests will be performed to&#xD;
      determine the effects of each physical therapy intervention on neuromuscular control and&#xD;
      clinical outcome. Significance level will be held at .05 for all analyses. Post-hoc power&#xD;
      analysis will be performed. In addition, this study objective will determine the ability of&#xD;
      physical therapy intervention on matched- and unmatched-intervention patients based upon each&#xD;
      intervention criteria. Each patient with NSLBP will be classified based upon clinical&#xD;
      criteria of each physical therapy intervention. Pre-post difference for matched and unmatched&#xD;
      groups will be compared using appropriate statistical tests. Significance level will be held&#xD;
      at .05 for all analyses. Post-hoc power analysis will also be performed.&#xD;
