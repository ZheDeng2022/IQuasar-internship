      A Phase 3, Global, Multicenter, Open-Label Study to Investigate the Efficacy of&#xD;
      Elbasvir/Grazoprevir Fixed-Dose Combination for 8 Weeks in Treatment-Naïve, HCV GT1b-Infected&#xD;
      Patients, with non-severe fibrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of Elbasvir/Grazoprevir Fixed-Dose Combination for 8 Weeks in&#xD;
           Treatment-Naïve, HCV GT1b-Infected Patients, with non- severe fibrosis as measured by&#xD;
           the proportion of subjects with sustained viral response 12 weeks after cessation of&#xD;
           treatment (SVR 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of EBV/GZR treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the proportion of subjects who attain SVR at 4 and 24 weeks after cessation&#xD;
           of treatment (SVR4 and SVR24)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the proportion of subjects with virologic failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the kinetics of circulating HCV RNA during treatment and after cessation of&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the emergence of viral resistance to EBV/GZR during treatment and after&#xD;
           cessation of treatment&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred twenty treatment-naïve subjects with chronic HCV GT1b infection without cirrhosis&#xD;
      will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be one treatment group with EBV/GZR (50/100 mg) once daily without regards to food&#xD;
      for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EBV/GZR is manufactured as a 50/100 mg tablet for oral administration. Subjects will take 1&#xD;
      tablet daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening assessments will be completed within 28 days of the Day 1 visit. The screening&#xD;
      window can be extended to 42 days for subjects requiring a liver biopsy, or extenuating&#xD;
      circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will complete the following study visits: Screening, Day 1, and on-treatment&#xD;
      visits at the end of week 2, week 4 and week 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-treatment visits will occur at Weeks 4, 12, and 24 after last dose of study drug. All&#xD;
      subjects will complete the posttreatment Week 4 and 12 visits. Subjects who achieve SVR12&#xD;
      (HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at posttreatment Week12) will complete the posttreatment Week 24 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening assessments will include physical examination, medical history, height, weight,&#xD;
      vital signs, adverse events related to screening procedures, concomitant medications, safety&#xD;
      laboratory tests (including hematology, chemistry, and coagulation), HCV RNA, serology (HCV,&#xD;
      HBV), serology and/or antigen testing for HIV, HCV genotyping, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c),&#xD;
      assessment of the absence of cirrhosis or severe fibrosis (including Fibrotest® and&#xD;
      Fibroscan®), serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) (females of child-bearing potential&#xD;
      only), urinalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On-treatment assessments include adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications, study&#xD;
      medication dispensation and pill count, physical examination, weight, vital signs, safety&#xD;
      laboratory tests, HCV RNA, and urine pregnancy tests (females of child bearing potential&#xD;
      only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-treatment assessments include AEs, concomitant medications, vital signs, safety&#xD;
      laboratory tests (including hematology, chemistry, and coagulation), HCV RNA, and urine&#xD;
      pregnancy tests (females of child-bearing potential only).&#xD;
