  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The success of anti-CTLA4 therapy has inaugurated a paradigm shift in oncology where drugs&#xD;
      target the immune system rather than cancer cells in order to stimulate the anti-tumor immune&#xD;
      response. In situ immunization is a strategy where immunomodulatory products such as&#xD;
      pathogens are injected into one tumor site in order to trigger a systemic anti-tumor immune&#xD;
      response. Of importance, pre-clinical rationale has demonstrated that combination of&#xD;
      anti-CTLA4 therapy together with intra-tumoral (IT) oncolytic virus can overcome primary&#xD;
      resistance to systemic anti-CTLA4 therapy. Pexastimogene Devacirepvec (Pexa-Vec) is one of&#xD;
      the new vaccinia oncolytic viruses genetically modified to express GM-CSF. This new and&#xD;
      innovative oncolytic virotherapy should therefore synergize with anti-CTLA4 therapy via&#xD;
      virus-induced tumor cell death &amp; tumor-antigen release, GM-CSF-induced&#xD;
      recruitment/maturation/activation of antigen presenting cells, and anti-CTLA4-induced Treg&#xD;
      blockade/depletion. Intra-tumoral delivery of immunostimulating agents should, therefore,&#xD;
      provide lower toxicity of mAb targeting immune checkpoints. Of note, IT injections of&#xD;
      GM-CSF-encoding oncolytic viruses have already been shown to induce immune-mediated tumor&#xD;
      responses on local (injected) and distant (not injected) tumor sites. In solid injectable&#xD;
      refractory/relapsing metastatic tumors, we make the hypothesis that the addition of Pexa-Vec&#xD;
      to IT ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4 Ab) will overcome primary/secondary resistance to standard&#xD;
      therapy and/or immunotherapy with a better in situ tumor antigen specific T-cell priming. Our&#xD;
      proposal is to conduct a 2-part Phase I clinical trial in order to define the feasibility,&#xD;
      the safety and the anti-tumor effects of intra-tumoral injections of ipilimumab in&#xD;
      combination with the oncolytic virus Pexa-Vec. Dose escalation step will define the MTD and&#xD;
      RP2D of that in situ immunization strategy. Expansion part will assess the anti-tumor effect&#xD;
      of the combination.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study is a proof of concept, open label, multicentric, 2-parts, Phase I dose escalation&#xD;
      trial. In dose selection part (any histological types except HCC), patients will be treated&#xD;
      with an IT boost injection with Pexa-Vec (fixed dose of 1x109 pfu / injection ) alone at Week&#xD;
      1 followed by IT injections of Pexa-Vec + ipilimumab (up to 4 dose levels) at Weeks 3, 5 and&#xD;
      9. The dose escalation part will follow a classical 3+3 design. 3 to 6 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled at each DL (Dose Level) depending of the number of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)&#xD;
      observed. At the end of each DL cohort, a teleconference (Dose escalation meeting) will be&#xD;
      organized with the sponsor, in order to select the dose for the next cohort. In Expansion&#xD;
      cohorts ( up to 3 cohorts) patients will be treated with an IT boost injection with Pexa-Vec&#xD;
      alone (fixed dose of 1x109 pfu / injection) at Week 1 followed by IT injections of Pexa-Vec +&#xD;
      ipilimumab (RP2D) at Weeks 3, 5 and 9. In both parts, the treatment with both IMPs should be&#xD;
      continued as per protocol until Withdrawal of consent, Disease progression as per irRC&#xD;
      (immune related response criteria), General or specific changes in the patient's condition&#xD;
      that render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the&#xD;
      investigator, Pregnancy or Unacceptable adverse events(s) including DLTs.&#xD;

    <description>DLT is defined as the occurrence of any of the following events evaluated as related to study drugs and occurring during the first 5 weeks (Part A) of investigative treatment(s): any Grade ≥ 4 treatment related toxicity, any Grade≥ 3 treatment related toxicity lasting more than 7 days (except for flu-like symptoms that respond to standard therapies.), any Grade ≥ 3 treatment related acute immune related AE involving major end organs, Grade ≥ 3 injection site reaction, Any other study drug related toxicity considered significant enough to be qualified as DLT in the opinion of the investigators after discussion with the sponsor. Indeed, as a principle in this Phase I study, any toxicity that the investigator or the sponsor determines to be dose-limiting, regardless of the grade, may be considered as a DLT.</description>
