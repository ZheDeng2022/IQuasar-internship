      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of nanoparticle albumin-bound&#xD;
      rapamycin when given together with temozolomide and irinotecan hydrochloride in treating&#xD;
      pediatric patients with solid tumors that have come back after a period of time during which&#xD;
      the tumor could not be detected or has not responded to treatment. Nanoparticle albumin-bound&#xD;
      rapamycin may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Chemotherapy drugs, such as temozolomide and irinotecan hydrochloride, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving nanoparticle albumin-bound&#xD;
      rapamycin, temozolomide, and irinotecan hydrochloride may cause the cancer to stop growing or&#xD;
      shrink for a period of time, and may lessen the symptoms that are caused by the cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin (ABI-009) administered as an intravenous infusion over&#xD;
      30 minutes on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle, in combination with temozolomide and irinotecan&#xD;
      hydrochloride (irinotecan) (administered on days 1-5) in pediatric patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      refractory solid tumors, including central nervous system (CNS) tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define and describe the toxicities of single-agent ABI-009 administered as an&#xD;
      intravenous infusion over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle in pediatric patients&#xD;
      with recurrent or refractory solid tumors, including CNS tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To define and describe the toxicities of ABI-009 administered as an intravenous infusion&#xD;
      over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle in combination with temozolomide and&#xD;
      irinotecan (administered on days 1-5) in pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory&#xD;
      solid tumors, including CNS tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of ABI-009 in pediatric patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      refractory solid tumors, including CNS tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of ABI-009 in combination with temozolomide&#xD;
      and irinotecan within the confines of a phase 1 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the biologic activity of ABI-009 by examining S6K1 and 4E-BP1 expression status&#xD;
      in archival tumor tissue from solid tumor pediatric patients using immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on&#xD;
      days 1 and 8 beginning on cycle 1. Patients also receive temozolomide orally (PO) and&#xD;
      irinotecan hydrochloride PO on days 1-5 beginning on cycle 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days&#xD;
      for up to 35 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
