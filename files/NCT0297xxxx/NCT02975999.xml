      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Vasopressin following the Fontan operation&#xD;
      will decrease chest tube output and duration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pilot and subsequently a multicenter, randomized, double blinded clinical trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the use of vasopressin following the Fontan operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase one of the study will be a single center pilot study and will be conducted at Advocate&#xD;
      Children's Hospital, Oak Lawn IL. This will be a randomized and double blinded. Ten patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled with five patients as control group and five receiving Vasopressin.&#xD;
      Vasopressin levels will be obtained just prior to initiation of Vasopressin and 48 hours&#xD;
      later in the pilot study. Safety and effect size will be evaluated after this pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multicenter study will be phase two and will be conducted in the cardiac operating rooms&#xD;
      and cardiac intensive care unit (CVICU) of 7 pediatric cardiovascular programs in the United&#xD;
      States. The investigators will be enrolling 12 subjects undergoing the Fontan operation from&#xD;
      each participating institution. Six patients will be randomly assigned to receive Vasopressin&#xD;
      while six will receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 84 patients undergoing the Fontan operation will be included in the study and&#xD;
      randomized to one of the two treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will include 42 subjects who will receive the treatment drug (Vasopressin) for 48&#xD;
      hours following the Fontan operation. Group 2 will include 42 subjects who will receive&#xD;
      placebo (normal saline) and will serve as a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug administration protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vasopressin at a dose of 0.4 mU/kg/min will be started on subjects in the study group while&#xD;
      coming off cardiopulmonary bypass. The dose of Vasopressin will not be titrated. Study drug&#xD;
      drip will infuse for 48 hours after which will be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placebo group will be receiving normal saline at the same rate of the vasopressin group.&#xD;
      The treating physician will be blinded.&#xD;
