  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monkeypox is a febrile rash illness caused by the monkeypox virus. Its natural occurrence in&#xD;
      the DRC puts healthcare and frontline workers at high risk of acquiring monkeypox virus&#xD;
      infections that can prevent them from performing work duties, compromise the overall&#xD;
      healthcare delivery in an already fragile system, and can result in death (case fatality&#xD;
      estimates are approximately 10%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label prospective cohort study in up to 1,600 eligible healthcare workers at&#xD;
      risk of monkeypox infection through their daily work. The study will document monkeypox&#xD;
      exposure and infection in participants while concurrently evaluating the immunogenicity and&#xD;
      safety of the vaccine, IMVAMUNE® (also known as MVA-BN, JYNNEOS, IMVANEX), in healthcare&#xD;
      personnel in the DRC. Participation in the study is voluntary and open to male and female&#xD;
      healthcare personnel ages 18 years and older in Tshuapa Province in The Democratic Republic&#xD;
      of Congo who are at risk of monkeypox virus infection through their daily work or laboratory&#xD;
      personnel performing diagnostic testing for monkeypox virus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Orthopoxvirus infections produce antibody responses that are cross-protective against other&#xD;
      viruses within the genus. It is this property of orthopoxviruses that allows a vaccine for&#xD;
      vaccinia virus against smallpox to be used to provide protection against monkeypox. Studies&#xD;
      performed during and in the immediate aftermath of smallpox eradication demonstrated that&#xD;
      smallpox vaccination (with a first generation vaccine) could confer protection against&#xD;
      infection with monkeypox virus. Newer, third generation vaccines such as IMVAMUNE, an&#xD;
      attenuated (replication deficient) strain of vaccinia virus may offer an alternative safer&#xD;
      source of vaccine-derived protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical presentation of monkeypox infection is similar to smallpox, although it is less&#xD;
      transmissible human-to-human than smallpox and less deadly (case fatality estimates for&#xD;
      monkeypox are approximately 10%). Naturally-occurring human monkeypox is largely restricted&#xD;
      to remote regions of the Congo Basin forest in Central Africa. This study is the first&#xD;
      rigorous evaluation of IMVAMUNE in a region where natural Orthopoxvirus transmission occurs&#xD;
      at appreciable and predictable rates. Healthcare and frontline workers in the DRC are&#xD;
      currently at high risk of acquiring monkeypox virus infection that prevents them from&#xD;
      performing work duties, compromises healthcare delivery in an already fragile system, and can&#xD;
      result in death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open-label prospective cohort study in up to 1,600 healthcare personnel at risk of&#xD;
      monkeypox infection through their daily work will document monkeypox virus exposure and&#xD;
      infection in vaccinated participants while concurrently evaluating the immunogenicity and&#xD;
      safety of IMVAMUNE vaccine. Study participation is voluntary and open to male and female&#xD;
      healthcare personnel ages 18 years and older in Tshuapa Province in the DRC. Participants&#xD;
      will receive two subcutaneous doses of IMVAMUNE vaccine on days 0 and 28. Blood samples will&#xD;
      be obtained on days 0, 14, 28, 42, 180, 365, 545, and 730 for immunogenicity analysis. After&#xD;
      each vaccination participants will be observed for at least thirty minutes. They will&#xD;
      maintain an adverse event diary to record systemic and local adverse events for 7 days after&#xD;
      each immunization. They will also record exposure to the monkeypox virus in an exposure diary&#xD;
      that is reviewed at each follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the proportion of participants who after being vaccinated 1) develop&#xD;
      suspected or confirmed monkeypox infection, and 2) experience exposure to monkeypox virus.&#xD;
      The study will also evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of IMVAMUNE.&#xD;
