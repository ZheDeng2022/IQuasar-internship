  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is present in 1 in 7 of the population and confers a high risk&#xD;
      of cardiovascular disease. The pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease in CKD is poorly&#xD;
      understood because CKD is always accompanied by confounding factors including the underlying&#xD;
      disease process (e.g. diabetes mellitus, systemic vasculitis) and the consequences of CKD&#xD;
      including hypertension, anaemia and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nephrectomy in kidney donors causes a 30% reduction in renal function providing an ideal&#xD;
      study population to measure prospectively the effects of reduced kidney function on the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CRIB-Donor study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT01028703) demonstrated adverse effects&#xD;
      on cardiovascular structure and function at 12 months compared to controls including an&#xD;
      increase in left ventricular mass. This proposal will measure the changes in cardiovascular&#xD;
      structure and function, cardiovascular age and biochemical changes at 5 years providing&#xD;
      information on the long term effects of reduced renal function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A reduction in renal function at one year in kidney donors is associated with adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular structural and functional changes. Increases in LV mass and perhaps fibrosis&#xD;
      along with increased arterial stiffness are associated with adverse changes in prognostic&#xD;
      imaging biomarkers and may in the long term contribute to the development of clinical disease&#xD;
      such as heart failure and arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to follow this valuable and well characterised cohort of subjects to&#xD;
      investigate the further natural history of these cardiovascular effects and determine whether&#xD;
      such changes tend to regress, stabilise or worsen over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reduction in GFR occurring after surgical uni-nephrectomy in donors is associated with&#xD;
      long term adverse cardiac and vascular effects which include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A sustained increased in left ventricular mass, impaired left ventricular systolic and&#xD;
           diastolic function and increased left ventricular interstitial fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduced aortic distensibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Increased systolic but not diastolic blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Increases in oxidative stress, inflammation and collagen turnover&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Cardiovascular ageing as evidenced by adverse effects on telomere length and DNA damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to follow up all 124 patients who originally took part in the CRIB-DONOR study at 5&#xD;
      years and eventually 10 years post nephrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics and sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the effect sizes and variances from our previous work (change in LV mass 7g, SD of&#xD;
      change 10g) we calculate that by studying 50 subjects in each group we will have 93% power to&#xD;
      detect a difference in LV mass of 7g with an alpha value of 0.05. Due to the nature of a&#xD;
      follow up study some drop out can be expected. A minimum of 34 patients is required in each&#xD;
      group in order to achieve an 80% power. This effect is clinically important; a fall in LV&#xD;
      mass index of one SD has been shown to be associated with a 38% reduction in cardiovascular&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With respect to telomere shortening, assuming mean and SD of base pair length of 5500 and 530&#xD;
      the study will be able to detect a difference of 0.612 SD, i.e. 324 base pairs. A sample size&#xD;
      of 50 patients per group would provide a 85% power to detect a difference.&#xD;
