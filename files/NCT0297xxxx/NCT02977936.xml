    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate at 3 months the effect of a supplementation with extracts&#xD;
      of Curcuma longa, Boswellia serrata and Porphyra umbilicalis on the acceptability of pain for&#xD;
      patients suffering from gonarthritic pain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For this study, 126 patients are going to be included. They will have a supplementation of&#xD;
      Cartimotil Fort®, from 1 to 4 capsules per day during 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      on the one hand, during the two visits (inclusion and follow-up), the investigator completes&#xD;
      the questionnaire about neuropathic pain (DN4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      on the other hand, patients complete the Osteoarthritis Symptom Inventory Scale (OASIS) 4&#xD;
      times : just after the inclusion visit, at day 30, at day 60 and just before the follow-up&#xD;
      visit (day 90). He completes the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGII), the Minimal&#xD;
      Clinically Important Improvement (MCII) and the Acceptable Symptomatic Statement (PASS) 6&#xD;
      times : just after the inclusion visit, at day 10, at day 20, at day 30, at day 60 and just&#xD;
      before the follow-up visit (day 90).&#xD;
