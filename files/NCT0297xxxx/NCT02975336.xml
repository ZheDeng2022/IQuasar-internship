    <description>The 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) was a standardized survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well-being. These eight subscales were summarized as relating to either physical health or mental health. Physical component summary (PCS) was based primarily on physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health scales and mental component summary (MCS) encompasses vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health scales. Score from mental health, role emotional, social functioning, and vitality domains were averaged to calculate MCS. Total score range for MCS was 0 - 100 (100 = highest level of mental functioning). Score from physical function, role physical, bodily pain, and general health domains were averaged to calculate PCS. Total score range for PCS was 0-100 (100 = highest level of physical functioning).</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is a generic measure of health status that provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value. The EQ-5D-5L profile defines health in terms of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression. Each dimension has five levels: 1: no problems, 2: slight problems, 3: moderate problems, 4: severe problems, and 5: extreme problems. Responses were used to generate a weighted summary index (EQ-5D index), which ranges from 0 (dead) to 1.00 (perfect health). A higher score indicates better health and positive changes from baseline indicate improvement of health.</description>

    <description>The Lupus QoL assessment is a 34 item questionnaire across 8 domains that is designed to find out how systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) affects a participant's life. Domains include physical health, pain, planning, intimate relationships, burden to others, emotional health, body image, and fatigue. Participants indicate their responses on a 5-point Likert response format, where 4=never, 3=occasionally, 2= a good bit of the time, 1=most of the time, and 0=worst of the time. Summary scores can be calculated for all 8 domains. A LupusQoL score for each domain was reported on a 0 to 100 scale, with greater values indicating better health related QoL.</description>

        <description>SRI-4 response was defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 4-point reduction in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) total score, no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) A and no more than 1 new BILAG B domain score, no worsening (less than 10 percent increase) from baseline in Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PGA) and no treatment failure. SLEDAI-2K assessment consists of 24 items with total score of 0(no symptoms) to 105 (presence of all defined symptoms) with higher scores representing increased disease activity. BILAG Index: assessing clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory parameters related to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) divided into 9 organ systems. For each organ system A=severe disease, B=moderate disease, C=mild stable disease, D=inactive, but previously active, E=inactive and never affected. The PGA assess disease activity on a visual analogue scale =from 0(very well) to 100(very poor).</description>

        <title>DBPC Period: Number of Participants With Response Based on Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder Index 6 (SRI-6) at Week 52</title>
        <description>SRI-6 response was defined as &gt;= 6-point reduction in SLEDAI-2K total score, no new BILAG A and no more than 1 new BILAG B domain score and no worsening (less than 10 percent increase) from baseline in Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PGA) and treatment failure. SLEDAI-2K assessment consists of 24 items with total score of 0 (no symptoms) to 105 (presence of all defined symptoms) with higher scores representing increased disease activity. BILAG Index: assessing clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory parameters related to SLE, divided into 9 organ systems. For each organ system :A=severe disease, B=moderate disease, C=mild stable disease, D=inactive, but previously active, E=inactive and never affected. The PGA assess disease activity on a visual analogue scale =from 0(very well) to 100(very poor).</description>

        <population>The mITT analysis set included all randomized participants who had received at least one dose of IMP (Evobrutinib or placebo) and have at least one Baseline and one post Baseline disease assessment among the following: SFI, SLEDAI 2K, PGA, BILAG 2004, CLASI. Here, &quot;overall number of participants analyzed&quot; signifies those participants who achieved SLEDAI-2K total score &gt;= 10 at screening (High Disease Activity [HDA] participants).</population>

        <description>Adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, which does not necessarily have causal relationship with treatment. A serious AE was defined as an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged in participant hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. TEAEs: events between first dose of study drug that were absent before treatment/that worsened relative to pre-treatment state up to 56 weeks. TEAEs included both serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs.

        <description>BILAG Index: assessing clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory parameters related to SLE, divided into 9 organ systems. For each organ system based on alphabetic score: A=severe disease, B=moderate disease, C=mild stable disease, D=inactive, but previously active, E=inactive and never affected. BILAG evaluated by scoring each of a list of signs and symptoms as: improving (1); same (2); worse (3); new (4); not present (0); not done (ND). Total BILAG score is sum of scores of 9 domains where A=12, B=8, C=1, D=0, and E=0. Total score ranges from 0 to 108 with a higher score indicating greater lupus activity. Time to first severe flare, where a severe flare is defined as at least one BILAG A (Severe disease activity) score in any organ system due to items that are new or worse, compared to the BILAG evaluation at the previous visit, during the 52-Week Treatment. It was measured using Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates.</description>

        <description>SRI-6 response was defined as &gt;= 6-point reduction in SLEDAI-2K total score, no new BILAG A and no more than 1 new BILAG B domain score and no worsening (less than 10 percent increase) from baseline in Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PGA) and treatment failure. SLEDAI-2K assessment consists of 24 items with total score of 0 (no symptoms) to 105 (presence of all defined symptoms) with higher scores representing increased disease activity. BILAG Index: assessing clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory parameters related to SLE, divided into 9 organ systems. For each organ system :A=severe disease, B=moderate disease, C=mild stable disease, D=inactive, but previously active, E=inactive and never affected.

        <description>BILAG Index: assessing clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory parameters related to SLE, divided into 9 organ systems. For each organ system based on alphabetic score: A=severe disease, B=moderate disease, C=mild stable disease, D=inactive, but previously active, E=inactive and never affected. BILAG evaluated by scoring each of a list of signs and symptoms as: improving (1); same (2); worse (3); new (4); not present (0); not done (ND). Total BILAG score is sum of scores of 9 domains where A=12, B=8, C=1, D=0, and E=0. Total score ranges from 0 to 108 with a higher score indicating greater lupus activity. A Moderate to Severe (BILAG A or 2B) flare is defined as at least one BILAG A (severe disease activity) grade or two BILAG B (moderate disease activity) grade in any organ system due to items that are new or worse, compared to the BILAG evaluation at the previous visit, during the 52 week treatment.

        <title>DBPC Period: Number of Participants With British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) 2004 Flare-Free Status During the 52-Week Treatment Period</title>
        <description>A participant has a flare-free status if no flare has been reported during the 52-week treatment period. Participants who discontinued treatment prior to Week 52, without having a flare are counted as not being flare free at Week 52. A flare was defined as either 1 or more new BILAG-2004 A (severe disease activity) or 2 or more new BILAG-2004 B (moderate disease activity) items compared to the previous visit. BILAG Index: assessing clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory parameters related to SLE, divided into 9 organ systems. For each organ system based on alphabetic score: A=severe disease, B=moderate disease, C=mild stable disease, D=inactive, but previously active, E=inactive and never affected.</description>

          <title>DBPC Period: Number of Participants With British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) 2004 Flare-Free Status During the 52-Week Treatment Period</title>
          <description>A participant has a flare-free status if no flare has been reported during the 52-week treatment period. Participants who discontinued treatment prior to Week 52, without having a flare are counted as not being flare free at Week 52. A flare was defined as either 1 or more new BILAG-2004 A (severe disease activity) or 2 or more new BILAG-2004 B (moderate disease activity) items compared to the previous visit. BILAG Index: assessing clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory parameters related to SLE, divided into 9 organ systems. For each organ system based on alphabetic score: A=severe disease, B=moderate disease, C=mild stable disease, D=inactive, but previously active, E=inactive and never affected.</description>
          <population>The mITT analysis set included all randomized participants who had received at least one dose of IMP (Evobrutinib or placebo) and have at least one Baseline and one post Baseline disease assessment among the following: SFI, SLEDAI 2K, PGA, BILAG 2004, CLASI.</population>

        <title>DBPC Period: Annualized Flare Rate</title>
        <description>A flare was defined as either 1 or more new BILAG-2004 A (severe disease activity) or 2 or more new BILAG-2004 B (moderate disease activity) items compared to the previous visit. The occurrence of a new flare was checked for each available visit versus the previous available visit up to Week 52. If no new flares occurred, the number of flares was set to 0. Otherwise all flares were counted leading to the maximum number of flares of 13. The annualized flare rate was calculated as the number of flares divided by the flare exposure time in days multiplied with 365.25 (1 year). The flare exposure time is the time up to Week 52 (date of BILAG-2004 assessment at Week 52) or up to the date of last available BILAG 2004 assessment.</description>

        <description>Low disease activity is defined as SLEDAI-2K score &lt;=2. SLEDAI-2K is an activity index that measures disease activity and records feature of active lupus as present or not present. SLEDAI-2K uses a weighted checklist to assign a numerical score based on the presence or absence of 24 symptoms at the time of assessment or during the previous 30 days. Each symptom present is assigned between 1 and 8 points based on its usual clinical importance, yielding a total score that ranges from 0 points (no symptoms) to 105 points (presence of all defined symptoms).</description>

        <title>DBPC Period: Number of Participants With Low Disease Activity Status, Defined by Clinical Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index-2000 (SLEDAI-2K) Score of Less Than or Equal (&lt;= ) 2 at Week 52</title>
        <description>Low disease activity is defined as SLEDAI-2K score &lt;=2. SLEDAI-2K is an activity index that measures disease activity and records feature of active lupus as present or not present. SLEDAI-2K uses a weighted checklist to assign a numerical score based on the presence or absence of 24 symptoms at the time of assessment or during the previous 30 days. Each symptom present is assigned between 1 and 8 points based on its usual clinical importance, yielding a total score that ranges from 0 points (no symptoms) to 105 points (presence of all defined symptoms). Clinical SLEDAI-2K score is equal to the SLEDAI-2K score from electronic case report form (eCRF) excluding the components 'Increased Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) Binding' and 'Low Complement'.</description>

        <description>CLASI is an validated measurement instrument for lupus erythematosus developed for use in clinical studies that consists of separate scores for the activity of the disease (CLASI-A). The CLASI activity score is calculated on the basis of erythema, scale/hyperkeratosis, mucous membrane involvement, acute hair loss and non-scarring alopecia. The CLASI activity score ranges from 0-70, with higher scores indicating more severe skin disease. Severity categories based on the CLASI activity score are as follows: mild (0-9), moderate (10-20), and severe (21-70).</description>

        <population>The mITT analysis set included all randomized participants who had received at least 1 dose of IMP (Evobrutinib or placebo) and have at least 1 Baseline and 1 post Baseline disease assessment among the following: SFI, SLEDAI 2K, PGA, BILAG 2004, CLASI. Here, &quot;Overall Number of Participants Analyzed&quot; signifies those participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure and &quot;Number Analyzed&quot; signified those participants who were evaluable for the specified category at given time points.</population>

        <description>BILAG 2004 disease activity Index: assessing clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory parameters related to SLE, divided into 9 organ systems. For each organ system based on alphabetic score: A=severe disease, B=moderate disease, C=mild stable disease, D=inactive, but previously active, E=inactive and never affected. BILAG evaluated by scoring each of a list of signs and symptoms as: improving (1); same (2); worse (3); new (4); not present (0); not done (ND). Total BILAG score is sum of scores of 9 domains where A=12, B=8, C=1, D=0, and E=0. Total score ranges from 0 to 108 with a higher score indicating greater lupus activity.</description>

        <title>DBPC Period: Change From Baseline in Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36v2) Physical Component Summary Score and Mental Component Summary Scores at Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40 and 52</title>
        <description>The 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) was a standardized survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well-being. These eight subscales were summarized as relating to either physical health or mental health. Physical component summary (PCS) was based primarily on physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health scales and mental component summary (MCS) encompasses vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health scales. Score from mental health, role emotional, social functioning, and vitality domains were averaged to calculate MCS. Total score range for MCS was 0 - 100 (100 = highest level of mental functioning). Score from physical function, role physical, bodily pain, and general health domains were averaged to calculate PCS. Total score range for PCS was 0-100 (100 = highest level of physical functioning).</description>

        <title>DBPC Period: Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life 5-dimensions (EQ-5D-5L) Health Outcome Questionnaire at Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40 and 52</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is a generic measure of health status that provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value. The EQ-5D-5L profile defines health in terms of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression. Each dimension has five levels: 1: no problems, 2: slight problems, 3: moderate problems, 4: severe problems, and 5: extreme problems. Responses were used to generate a weighted summary index (EQ-5D index), which ranges from 0 (dead) to 1.00 (perfect health). A higher score indicates better health and positive changes from baseline indicate improvement of health.</description>

        <title>DBPC Period: Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life 5-dimensions (EQ-5D-5L) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40 and 52</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is a generic measure of health status that provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value. The EQ-5D-5L profile defines health in terms of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression. Each dimension has five levels: 1: no problems, 2: slight problems, 3: moderate problems, 4: severe problems, and 5: extreme problems. The responses were used to derive overall score using a visual analog scale (VAS) that ranged from 0 to 100 millimeter (mm), where 0 was the worst health you can imagine and 100 was the best health you can imagine.</description>

        <title>DBPC Period: Change From Baseline in Lupus Quality of Life (LupusQoL) Questionnaire Score at Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40 and 52</title>
        <description>The Lupus QoL assessment is a 34 item questionnaire across 8 domains that is designed to find out how systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) affects a participant's life. Domains include physical health, pain, planning, intimate relationships, burden to others, emotional health, body image, and fatigue. Participants indicate their responses on a 5-point Likert response format, where 4=never, 3=occasionally, 2= a good bit of the time, 1=most of the time, and 0=worst of the time. Summary scores can be calculated for all 8 domains. A LupusQoL score for each domain was reported on a 0 to 100 scale, with greater values indicating better health related QoL.</description>

        <title>DBPC Period: Number of Participants With Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Scale Score of Any Improvement, no Change and Any Worsening</title>
        <description>The PGIC is a self-rated scale that asks the participant to describe the change in activity limitations, symptoms, emotions, and overall quality of life (QoL) related to the participants painful condition on the following scale: 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved), 3 (minimally improved), 4 (no change), 5 (minimally worse), 6 (much worse) and 7 (very much worse). Number of participants in the PGIC categories of any improvement (that is PGIC scale score 1, 2 or 3), no change (that is PGIC scale score 4) and any worsening (that is PGIC scale score 5, 6 or 7) are reported.</description>

          <title>DBPC Period: Number of Participants With Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Scale Score of Any Improvement, no Change and Any Worsening</title>
          <description>The PGIC is a self-rated scale that asks the participant to describe the change in activity limitations, symptoms, emotions, and overall quality of life (QoL) related to the participants painful condition on the following scale: 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved), 3 (minimally improved), 4 (no change), 5 (minimally worse), 6 (much worse) and 7 (very much worse). Number of participants in the PGIC categories of any improvement (that is PGIC scale score 1, 2 or 3), no change (that is PGIC scale score 4) and any worsening (that is PGIC scale score 5, 6 or 7) are reported.</description>

        <description>The FACIT-Fatigue score was calculated according to a 13-item questionnaire that assess self reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. It uses a 5-point Likert-type scale (0 = not at all; 1 = a little bit; 2 = somewhat; 3 = quite a bit; 4 = very much). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse possible score) to 52 (best score). A higher score reflected an improvement in the participant's health status.</description>

        <title>DBPC Period: Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Prednisone Equivalent Corticosteroid (CS) Dose by &gt;=25% to a Dose of &lt;=7.5 Milligram Per Day (mg/Day), With no BILAG A or 2B Flare in Disease Activity at Week 52</title>
        <description>BILAG A or 2B flare is defined as at least one BILAG A grade or two BILAG B grade in any organ system due to items that are new or worse, compared to the BILAG evaluation at the previous visit, during the 52 week treatment period. BILAG Index: assessing clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory parameters related to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), divided into 9 organ systems. For each organ system based on alphabetic score: A=severe disease, B=moderate disease, C=mild stable disease, D=inactive, but previously active, E=inactive and never affected.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
        <population>The mITT analysis set included all randomized participants who had received at least one dose of IMP (Evobrutinib or placebo) and have at least one Baseline and one post Baseline disease assessment among the following: SFI, SLEDAI 2K, PGA, BILAG 2004, CLASI. Here, &quot;Overall Number of Participants Analyzed&quot; signifies those participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <description>SRI-4 response was defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 4-point reduction in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) total score, no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) A and no more than 1 new BILAG B domain score, no worsening (less than 10 percent increase) from baseline in Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PGA) and no treatment failure. SLEDAI-2K assessment consists of 24 items with total score of 0(no symptoms) to 105 (presence of all defined symptoms) with higher scores representing increased disease activity. BILAG Index: assessing clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory parameters related to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), divided into 9 organ systems. For each organ system A=severe disease, B=moderate disease, C=mild stable disease, D=inactive, but previously active, E=inactive and never affected. The PGA assess disease activity on a visual analogue scale =from 0(very well) to 100(very poor).</description>
