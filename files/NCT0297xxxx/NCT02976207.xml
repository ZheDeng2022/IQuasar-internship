      Long follow up on patients with obstructive sleep apnea that undergo diagnosis and surgical&#xD;

      Drug induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) is increasingly performed procedure, offering dynamic&#xD;
      upper airway evaluation during artificial sleep before surgical treatment for patients with&#xD;
      obstructed&#xD;
&#xD;
      .)OSA(sleep apnea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim: To evaluate the value of DISE for tailoring the proper treatment for patients with&#xD;
           snoring and OSA DISE is a safe procedure, easily practicable, valid and reliable. We&#xD;
           consider it a fundamental clinical procedure that is essential before choosing the&#xD;
           surgical treatment. Our results so far suggest that a multilevel collapse is&#xD;
           significantly associated with higher apnea hypopnea index values. We think that the&#xD;
           weight did not play a significant role in RDI (Respiratory Disturbance Index) reduction.&#xD;
           Our results till now show tailored surgery based on DISE may leverage sleep surgeries&#xD;
           outcome significantly presenting 70% success rate based&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  on our experience We therefore want to evaluate the patients in a long follow up period&#xD;
