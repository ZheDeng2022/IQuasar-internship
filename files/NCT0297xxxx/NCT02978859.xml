  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate Sitravatinib, an oral small molecular receptor&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for the treatment of advanced liposarcoma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcomas are a group of cancers which arise from connective tissue and bone, of which more&#xD;
      than 50 subtypes exist. Approximately 12,000 people are diagnosed with sarcoma annually in&#xD;
      the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liposarcoma is one of the more common types of soft tissue sarcoma. The primary treatment for&#xD;
      liposarcoma is surgery when possible. When liposarcoma is not amenable to surgery, various&#xD;
      systemic treatments, including chemotherapy, are used. However, the effectiveness of existing&#xD;
      treatments for liposarcoma is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sitravatinib is an oral, targeted drug which inhibits receptor tyrosine kinases. Receptor&#xD;
      tyrosine kinases are proteins on the surface of the liposarcoma cell which play a role in&#xD;
      cancer growth. In laboratory work, Sitravatinib effectively suppressed the growth of&#xD;
      liposarcoma models. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      Sitravatinib in patients with liposarcoma which cannot be removed by surgery.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stage 1, histologically confirmed well-differentiated or de-differentiated&#xD;
             liposarcoma. If stage 1 of the Simon II stage design fails to meet its endpoint for&#xD;
             liposarcoma patients, an additional 16 patients will be enrolled, composed of 4 each&#xD;
             of MPNST, synovial sarcoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and alveolar soft part sarcoma&#xD;
             (otherwise, an additional 16 patients with well-differentiated or de-differentiated&#xD;
             liposarcoma would be enrolled). Pathology review occurs at the center enrolling the&#xD;
             patient on this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease must be locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic. Disease which may be&#xD;
             resected but with an associated level of morbidity deemed unacceptable by the treating&#xD;
             clinician is considered eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease by RECIST criteria version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must evidence of disease progression, either clinically or&#xD;
             radiographically,within the 8 weeks prior to study enrollment, as determined by the&#xD;
             principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have been treated with at least one prior systemic regimen for sarcoma.&#xD;
             Adjuvant systemic therapy qualifies as prior therapy for the purposes of this study.&#xD;
             There is no upper limit on previous lines of therapy received. A prior line of&#xD;
             systemic therapy may include prior investigational agents received as part of other&#xD;
             clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be age 18 years or older. Because no dosing or adverse event data are&#xD;
             currently available for MGCD516 in patients less than 18 years of age, children are&#xD;
             excluded from the present study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must demonstrate an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance&#xD;
             status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must demonstrate normal organ and marrow function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must demonstrate adequately controlled blood pressure at the time of study&#xD;
             entry, as defined by a blood pressure â‰¤ 150/100 mmHg at study screening on at least&#xD;
             one of two screenings conducted at least 24 hours apart. If blood pressure meets these&#xD;
             guidelines on initial measurement, no subsequent measurement for screening is needed.&#xD;
             Blood pressure may be assessed by automated or manual methods by an appropriately&#xD;
             trained clinician or nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal left ventricular systolic function, as demonstrated by a&#xD;
             transthoracic echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan showing a normal&#xD;
             left ventricular ejection fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential and all men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received treatment with any chemotherapy, immunotherapy,&#xD;
             radiotherapy or an investigational agent for malignancy within the 28 days preceding&#xD;
             study registration. Patients may not have received treatment with nitrosureas or&#xD;
             mitomycin within the 42 days prior to study registration. Patients may not have&#xD;
             received treatment with a small molecule targeted agent (including off-label or&#xD;
             investigational use) within 14 days preceding study registration, provided this&#xD;
             represents at least 7 half-lives for that agent. Toxic effects from any prior therapy&#xD;
             (except alopecia) must have resolved to grade 1 or less according to NCI CTCAE v4.0 or&#xD;
             to the patient's baseline by the time of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agent for any purpose&#xD;
             concurrently. Patients may not require ongoing treatment with (a) gastric pH modifying&#xD;
             medications including proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers (patients may switch to&#xD;
             antacids), (b) medications which are known to be sensitive substrates or substrates&#xD;
             with a narrow therapeutic index for the P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein&#xD;
             (BCRP) transporters and/or (c) medications known to cause corrected QT Interval (QTc)&#xD;
             prolongation with risk of Torasades. Please see Appendix 1 for a list of such&#xD;
             prohibited concomitant medications at study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with brain metastases which are symptomatic may not be enrolled. Those&#xD;
             subjects with untreated brain metastases â‰¤ 1 cm may who are asymptomatic and for whom&#xD;
             there are no plans for surgery, radiation or corticosteroid use may be considered&#xD;
             eligible at the discretion of the principal investigator. Subjects with brain&#xD;
             metastases that have been treated and are stable for at least 1 month are eligible if&#xD;
             they are asymptomatic and not receiving corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have a history of allergic reaction or hypersensitivity to&#xD;
             microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel PH302) or polysorbate 80 (Tween 80), which are&#xD;
             components of the drug product MGCD516.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or&#xD;
             uncontrolled psychiatric illness that would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
             in the opinion of the principal investigator. Additionally, patients must be free of&#xD;
             any impairment in the ability to swallow and absorb the oral study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be pregnant or nursing. Pregnant women are excluded from this study&#xD;
             because the teratogenic effects of MGCD516 have not been adequately studied. A&#xD;
             negative pregnancy test must be documented 7 days or less prior to registration.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events to nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with MGCD516, breastfeeding must be discontinued&#xD;
             prior to registration for this clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have known HIV infection. HIV-positive patients on combination.&#xD;
