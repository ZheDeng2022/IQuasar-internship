      In this single-center, open-label, no control, prospective clinical trial, a total of 20&#xD;
      resistant or refractory CD19+ B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled. CD19 CAR T cells will be administered by i.v. injection as a using a &quot;split dose&quot;&#xD;
      (total dose of 5x10^6/kg-5x10^7/kg) approach to dosing:10% on day 0, 30% on day 1 and 60% on&#xD;
      day 2. The purpose of current study is to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of CD19&#xD;
      CAR T cells in patients with chemotherapy resistant or refractory CD19+ ALL.&#xD;

      In this single-center, open-label, nonrandomized, no control, prospective clinical trial, a&#xD;
      total of 20 resistant or refractory CD19+ B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled. Patients will be diagnosed according to morphologic, immunologic,&#xD;
      cytogenetic and molecular(MICM) criteria, including bone marrow morphology, immunophenotype,&#xD;
      cytogenetic and molecular examination. CD19 CAR T cells transduced with a lentiviral vector&#xD;
      to express anti-CD19 scFv TCRζ:4-1BB,administered by i.v. injection as a using a &quot;split dose&quot;&#xD;
      (total dose of 5x10^6/kg-5x10^7/kg) approach to dosing:10% on day 0, 30% on day 1 and 60% on&#xD;
      day 2. This protocol will be given to subjects with unmet medical needs for which there are&#xD;
      no effective therapies known at this time. Side effects of CD19 CAR T cells therapy will be&#xD;
      monitored. The purpose of current study is to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      CD19 CAR T cells therapy in patients with chemotherapy resistant or refractory CD19+ ALL.&#xD;
