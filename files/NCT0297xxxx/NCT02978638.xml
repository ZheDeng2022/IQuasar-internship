      This study aims to improve continence and voiding of patients with spinal cord injury using&#xD;
      electrical stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Finetech Vocare Bladder System is an implantable sacral nerve stimulator for improving&#xD;
      bladder and bowel function in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). It has been&#xD;
      commercially available in Britain and other countries since 1982, and has been used in&#xD;
      thousands of patients with SCI to improve bladder, bowel and sexual function. It received FDA&#xD;
      approval in 1998 under Humanitarian Device Exemption H980005 and H980008 for providing&#xD;
      urination on demand and to aid in bowel evacuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical stimulation to produce bladder contraction and improve bladder voiding after&#xD;
      spinal cord injury has usually been combined with cutting of sensory nerves to reduce reflex&#xD;
      contraction of the bladder, which improves continence. However, cutting these nerves has&#xD;
      undesirable side effects. This study will not cut any sensory nerve. This study is testing&#xD;
      the use of the stimulator for inhibiting bladder contraction by stimulating sensory nerves to&#xD;
      improve continence after spinal cord injury, and for blocking sphincter contraction to&#xD;
      improve voiding.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human subjects will be recruited at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System from people with&#xD;
      clinically complete spinal cord injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the selection criteria described below will be screened to identify those&#xD;
      whose reflex bladder contractions are inhibited by neuromodulation using low levels of&#xD;
      electrical stimulation via electrodes on the skin over the dorsal genital nerve. Serial&#xD;
      filling cystometries will be performed in the clinical urodynamic laboratory in the Spinal&#xD;
      Cord Injury Service of the VA Palo Alto. Bladder capacity and compliance will be recorded for&#xD;
      each cytometrogram. Subjects whose reflex bladder contractions are significantly inhibited by&#xD;
      this neuromodulation will be offered enrollment in the trial. Subjects whose reflex bladder&#xD;
      contractions are not significantly inhibited by this neuromodulation, or who do not wish to&#xD;
      participate in the study, will be able to continue with their usual form of bladder&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening, selected subjects will be offered surgical implantation of a Vocare Bladder&#xD;
      System in the FDA-approved manner, but without posterior rhizotomy. Because posterior&#xD;
      rhizotomy is not performed, the afferent axons in the sacral nerves are intact and can be&#xD;
      stimulated after surgery via the electrodes connected to the implanted stimulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Vocare Bladder System will be implanted in the FDA-approved manner but without posterior&#xD;
      rhizotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After implantation, subjects will be evaluated in the urodynamic laboratory. Stimulation will&#xD;
      applied to S34 sacral nerves bilaterally, and the effects on bladder capacity and continence&#xD;
      and voiding will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continence of urine will be documented by bladder diaries. These diaries will be completed&#xD;
      initially as an inpatient in the SCI Service and then at home while applying neuromodulation&#xD;
      via the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that sacral neuromodulation by this method will be associated with a&#xD;
      significant increase in bladder capacity and continence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that this neuromodulation will not be associated with an increase in bladder&#xD;
      capacity or continence. If so, subjects will still be able to use conventional methods of&#xD;
      managing continence and should have no loss of function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants whose bladder capacity and continence are improved by neuromodulation using the&#xD;
      implanted stimulator will be offered the opportunity to continue to use the stimulator for&#xD;
      the duration of the study and will be reviewed at three-month intervals. At the end of the&#xD;
      study they will be reviewed again with their usual clinician and if there are no&#xD;
      contra-indications to continued use of the stimulator will be offered the opportunity to&#xD;
      continue its use under continued clinical follow-up from their usual clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants whose bladder capacity and continence are not improved by neuromodulation using&#xD;
      the implanted stimulator, or who do not wish to continue using the implanted stimulator, will&#xD;
      be reviewed with their usual clinician and offered the bladder management they were using&#xD;
      prior to the study. The implanted stimulator will be switched off, but will not be removed&#xD;
      unless the participant wishes it to be removed or the investigators or the participant's&#xD;
      usual clinician consider it in the participant's interest to be removed. It is usually&#xD;
      simpler and safer for the participant to leave the stimulator implanted but inactive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be provided with appropriate documentation regarding safety and&#xD;
      electromagnetic compatibility of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigation is justified because the potential benefits are greater than the potential&#xD;
      risks, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential benefit of the research to the subjects are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improved bladder capacity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Improved continence&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential benefits of the research to others are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence that bladder capacity and continence after spinal cord injury can be improved by&#xD;
      electrical stimulation without cutting nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits to subjects and&#xD;
      others because of&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The high prevalence and severity of clinical complications caused by bladder&#xD;
           complications after spinal cord injury&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The paucity of methods of restoring continence after spinal cord injury that are safe,&#xD;
           effective and without undesirable side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is primarily aimed at demonstrating safety, feasibility and proof of concept. It&#xD;
      may also produce statistically and clinically significant evidence of efficacy that can be&#xD;
      used to plan future clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the technique of reducing reflex bladder contraction by implanted stimulation of the S34&#xD;
      nerve bilaterally is successful, it will open the door to more effective use of&#xD;
      neuromodulation for continence after spinal cord injury.&#xD;
