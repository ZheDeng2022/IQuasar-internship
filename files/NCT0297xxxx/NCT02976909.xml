    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumor in China. In Asian countries,&#xD;
      esophageal squamous carcinoma is the main pathological type of esophageal carcinoma.&#xD;
      Prognosis of esophageal squamous carcinoma is usually poor and surgery is the only radical&#xD;
      treatment. However, the optimal therapy pattern for local advanced esophageal carcinoma is&#xD;
      still unclear. Part of the patients that clinical staging as T4 and presents multiple lymph&#xD;
      node metastasis and esophageal carcinoma with large diameters are initially diagnosed as&#xD;
      boundary resectable, which means patients may be able to undergo R0 resection. However, for&#xD;
      patients who are diagnosed as boundary resectable esophageal carcinoma, there are still no&#xD;
      sufficient studies implicate that how to improve R0 resection rate by neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy. DDP in combination with 5-FU and docetaxel regimen(DCF) was reported as&#xD;
      effective neoadjuvant chemotherapy in treating esophageal squamous carcinoma. However,&#xD;
      studies also showed that the DCF regimen caused severe adverse reaction. The mechanism of&#xD;
      paclitaxel is similar to docetaxel while with less adverse events than docetaxel. Based on&#xD;
      the research situation mentioned above, the investigators decided to conduct a phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial to further explore the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel in combination with&#xD;
      DDP and 5-FU (TPF) regimen in treating locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
