  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well pembrolizumab and enobosarm work in&#xD;
      treating patients with androgen receptor positive triple negative breast cancer that has&#xD;
      spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies,&#xD;
      such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere&#xD;
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Androgen can cause the growth of breast&#xD;
      cancer cells. Hormone therapy using enobosarm may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of&#xD;
      androgen by the tumor cells. Giving pembrolizumab and enobosarm may work better than&#xD;
      pembrolizumab alone in treating patients with androgen receptor positive triple negative&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety/tolerability of the combination regimen. II. To determine the&#xD;
      response rate (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR] via Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1) of the combination of pembrolizumab with enobosarm&#xD;
      (GTx-024) in patients with advanced androgen receptor (AR) positive (+) triple negative&#xD;
      breast cancer (TNBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate clinical outcomes by RECIST 1.1 including clinical benefit rate (CBR) at 24&#xD;
      weeks, progression free-survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), event free survival&#xD;
      (EFS), time-to-treatment failure (TTF); and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the role of immune-related response criteria (irRECIST). III. To evaluate the&#xD;
      association of AR by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the association of an AR gene expression signature and clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate genomic and phenotypic status of breast tumor. III. To evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      the combination therapy on peripheral blood circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating&#xD;
      tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the effect of combination therapy on tumor-derived exosomes (TEX) and TEX&#xD;
      associated immune biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Immune correlatives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Va. To evaluate pre-treatment programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and tumor infiltrating&#xD;
      lymphocytes (TILs) as a predictor of response to combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vb. To evaluate specific TIL subsets (e.g. CD4, CD8, regulatory T cell [Treg] distribution)&#xD;
      and other immunological correlatives (e.g. T cell receptor [TCR] repertoire analysis) as&#xD;
      possible predictors of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vc. To evaluate change in TILs as a result of the combination therapy. Vd. To evaluate&#xD;
      peripheral blood, immune biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and enobosarm&#xD;
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 35 cycles&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days, every 3&#xD;
      months, and bi-annually.&#xD;
