  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 25 million Americans struggle with alcohol or drug problems annually. Abuse of&#xD;
      alcohol and drugs is costly to our nation, exacting more than $428 billion in costs related&#xD;
      to crime, lost work productivity and health care. While effective treatments exist, over half&#xD;
      of those who enter treatment for substance use disorders drop out early in treatment and&#xD;
      return to alcohol or drug abuse. Psychological stress is a causal factor in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of substance use disorder (SUD) and relapse risk. Low-income women report high levels of&#xD;
      stress in SUD residential treatment stemming from significant economic and family stressors&#xD;
      in addition to challenges of adjusting to residential treatment demands. Unmanaged stress,&#xD;
      especially in early stages of residential treatment, is a major concern because it can&#xD;
      increase dropout. Dropout from residential treatment places women at risk of substance use&#xD;
      relapse. A gap in knowledge persists regarding the use of mindfulness-based interventions&#xD;
      with racially/ethnically diverse low-income women with SUDs, especially regarding the&#xD;
      efficacy of adapted (Mindfulness-based interventions) MBIs for preventing residential dropout&#xD;
      and decreasing relapse. We have fully adapted, developed, and pilot tested a novel MBI,&#xD;
      Moment-by-Moment in Women's Recovery: Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention for Women&#xD;
      (MBRP-W), that supports the needs of women in residential treatment. This MBI integrates&#xD;
      relapse prevention, addresses literacy level, and is relevant to issues surrounding&#xD;
      treatment- and relapse-related stressors of disadvantaged women. The current project has&#xD;
      three specific aims: (1) to test the efficacy of MBRP-W on residential treatment retention&#xD;
      and substance use relapse in racially/ethnically diverse low-income women; (2) to determine&#xD;
      the mechanisms of change underlying the MBRP-W program; and (3) to explore neural changes&#xD;
      associated with program effects. A rationale for MBRP-W is the need for self-initiated stress&#xD;
      management skills in women with SUDs during the early stressful periods of residential&#xD;
      treatment that increase risk of dropout and relapse.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  This randomized clinical trial will deliver two interventions as add-ons to residential&#xD;
           substance use disorder (SUD) treatment: (1) Moment-by-Moment in women's Recovery:&#xD;
           Mindfulness-Based Approach to Relapse Prevention (MBRP-W) and (2) Brain and Recovery&#xD;
           (B&amp;R) which serves as an active psychoeducational attention control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants (N=165) who meet study eligibility criteria based on intake assessment will&#xD;
           be recruited and complete baseline assessments during weeks 3-6 after entry into a&#xD;
           residential treatment program. Participants will be randomly assigned to interventions&#xD;
           using Urn randomization. All participants (MBRP-W and B&amp;R) will receive SUD treatment as&#xD;
           normally provided by the treatment program. Fifteen participants from each intervention&#xD;
           group (N=30) will be selected to participate in a brain imaging (MRI and fMRI) substudy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be adult females who have been admitted to a residential treatment&#xD;
           center in an urban area of California and who are diagnosed with a SUD based on clinical&#xD;
           intake Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-V)&#xD;
           diagnostic assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MBRP-W is delivered in 12 bi-weekly 80-minute group sessions with SUD clinical&#xD;
           populations. Facilitators will have previous experience in MBSR facilitation and will be&#xD;
           trained in MBRP-W. Each session has a central theme and is divided into five segments&#xD;
           consisting of (a) a welcome meditation or other mindfulness practice, (b) a review of&#xD;
           session objectives, (c) a brief didactic psycho-educational presentation and discussion&#xD;
           based on the session's theme, (d) experiential and formal meditation or other practices,&#xD;
           and (e) readings and practice assignments for the next class.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B&amp;R is delivered in 12 bi-weekly 80-minute group sessions with SUD clinical populations.&#xD;
           Facilitators will be trained in B&amp;R. The B&amp;R group will receive didactic education on&#xD;
           the neurobiology of addiction. B&amp;R contains no information on behavior change, relapse&#xD;
           prevention, stress reduction, or mindfulness-based or relapse-related content. The&#xD;
           intervention was developed over three years with a population similar to that of the&#xD;
           current study (i.e., racially/ethnically diverse and low-income women in SUD treatment)&#xD;
           with input and review from focus group participants, care providers in SUD treatment,&#xD;
           and three experts on the neurobiology of addiction. Topics include: (1) brain structure&#xD;
           and function related to addiction, (2) effects of various types of substance use on the&#xD;
           brain, and (3) rewarding effects of substance use and how these rewarding effects can&#xD;
           lead to addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are three data collection points, 1) baseline, 2) immediate post-intervention, and&#xD;
           3) 8-months post-intervention completion. Data will be collected in-person by research&#xD;
           interviewers via computer-assisted interviews, which includes administration of an&#xD;
           alcohol Breathalyzer test to assess alcohol use and collection of a urine sample to&#xD;
           assess drug use. Interviews will be conducted at the treatment program (for those who&#xD;
           remain in residential treatment) or at convenient locations for participants no longer&#xD;
           in treatment. Baseline interview will occur prior to randomization, post-intervention&#xD;
           interview will occur within 1-2 weeks of the last group session, and the follow-up&#xD;
           interview will occur at an 8-months post-intervention completion window. Brain imaging&#xD;
           for a subsample of participants will be completed at baseline and immediate&#xD;
           post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of intervention program class sessions attended will be collected for all&#xD;
           enrolled participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant Satisfaction Surveys measuring acceptability, credibility, and perceived&#xD;
           utility of the study arms will be administered to both groups at two class sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Applied Mindfulness Practice Scale (AMPS) measuring the participant's application of&#xD;
           mindfulness skills to address life challenges, will be administered to the MBRP-W&#xD;
           participants at four class sessions as well as at follow-up. Mindfulness practice effort&#xD;
           will also be assessed at these same four class sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An in-treatment clinical record review of services will be collected weekly for the&#xD;
           duration of residential treatment.&#xD;
