    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to understand the potential of mobile computing&#xD;
      technology to improve chronic disease self-management, quality of life, and health outcomes&#xD;
      of older adults to prevent or alleviate future disabilities. Thus, the study will design,&#xD;
      develop, and test an intervention to motivate and train seniors to use the technology, and&#xD;
      conduct a trial to evaluate its effect. This innovative intervention will deploy young&#xD;
      generation (age 18 to 30) volunteers to provide mobile technology training, access, and&#xD;
      support to older adults (aged 55 and above) with type 2 diabetes in Taiwan. Hence, a&#xD;
      secondary purpose of the study is to understand the effects of the volunteering experience on&#xD;
      the values, characters, and health awareness in the young generation. This program, called&#xD;
      the Intergenerational Mobile Technology Opportunities Program (IMTOP), will help older adults&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes acquire skills to use the Internet, World Wide Web (WWW), applications&#xD;
      (or &quot;apps&quot;), and basic computing via mobile tablet devices. These skills will give&#xD;
      participants access to resources and tools to improve health and mental health, reduce social&#xD;
      isolation, and increase social engagement, as well as meet their individual life goals. The&#xD;
      course will use young volunteers to deliver the tablet training. The training course will be&#xD;
      offered as small-group sessions over an 8-week period (for up to 16 hours of training) at a&#xD;
      hospital site, plus young volunteers' technical support and problem solving for up to 4 weeks&#xD;
      after the training sessions are completed. Using college students to serve as volunteer&#xD;
      trainers for teaching mobile technology, the research also aims to understand not only how&#xD;
      the intergenerational interactions help the older adults learn the technology and improve&#xD;
      health, but also how the tutoring experiences make impact on the young adults' skills and&#xD;
      perspectives that will help them in their future careers and in the development of their&#xD;
      characters. This research study will recruit three hundred fifty (350) patients from the&#xD;
      collaborating hospitals, including two hundred fifty (250) patients from Taipei Tzu Chi&#xD;
      Hospital and one hundred (100) patients from Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital. An estimate of 140&#xD;
      students in colleges and universities in Taiwan (100 volunteers in Taipei hospital and 40&#xD;
      volunteers in Hualien hospital) between the age of 18 and 30 will be recruited to serve as&#xD;
      volunteer instructors to teach older adults to use tablets and to provide technical support&#xD;
      services. Moreover, another group of 140 young adults, also age 18 to 30, will be recruited&#xD;
      from universities to serve as the comparison group to the volunteers in intervention group.&#xD;
      The course objectives are to guide older patients with Type 2 diabetes to use technology to&#xD;
      obtain diabetes-related medical information, learn to record and control their physiological&#xD;
      data via technology, promote intergenerational communication, enhance the convenience in&#xD;
      life, and improve social life and mental health through technology tools such as the&#xD;
      Internet, social media, online health education resources, instructional videos and so on. It&#xD;
      is hoped to further slow down degradation, promote health and prolong life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research design is a randomized waitlist control trial. Patients will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the immediate intervention group or 4-month waitlist control group. The former&#xD;
      will immediately join the tablet computer courses, while the later will wait for four (4)&#xD;
      months before starting their courses. The follow-up period for patients will be one (1) year&#xD;
      after the start of courses. Patient assessments will include baseline and follow-up&#xD;
      assessments of health behaviors, functional status, health conditions, and social&#xD;
      interactions and engagements, plus technology use and acceptance. Baseline assessment will be&#xD;
      conducted at recruitment for all patients, and for waitlist control group again at the&#xD;
      beginning of the course. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at four (4) months, eight&#xD;
      (8) months, and twelve (12) months after the start date of the courses. Young volunteers will&#xD;
      also be assessed to understand their experiences in the volunteering services and any impact&#xD;
      from this experience. The assessments will be conducted at the baseline, during the courses,&#xD;
      and two (2) months and four (4) months after the beginning of the courses. In addition, a&#xD;
      group of 140 young adults will be recruited from universities to serve as the comparison&#xD;
      group and will be asked to complete the assessment survey at baseline, two (2) months, and&#xD;
      four (4) months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For older adults:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet inclusion criteria will be referred by doctors in the metabolism and&#xD;
      endocrinology department of the two hospitals to recruiters and will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      immediate intervention group and waitlist control group. The aim of the comparison is to&#xD;
      assess the potential effects of mobile technology program with intergenerational interaction&#xD;
      on patients' technology use, self-efficacy, self-management behavior, and social engagement,&#xD;
      and whether it results in less social isolation and health care utilization, improved health&#xD;
      and mental health status, and greater quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tzu Chi diabetes health educators will recruit patients with type 2 diabetes and screen&#xD;
           them for eligibility. The health educators will complete a patient contact card for each&#xD;
           patient that they screen for eligibility. If eligible, the health educators will explain&#xD;
           the study to the patients and ask for their interest to participate. Interested patients&#xD;
           will be referred to an IMTOP study recruiter. The recruiter will collect all patient&#xD;
           contact cards and completed screeners from the health educators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The study recruiters on site in the hospital will obtain the informed consent from the&#xD;
           eligible and interested patients. When the patients sign the study consent, the&#xD;
           recruiter will write on the patient contact card the patient ID next to Study&#xD;
           Participation Status - Enrolled, and complete the patient contact card.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The recruiter will then conduct the baseline interview. Baseline interview can be done&#xD;
           face to face or via telephone if patient prefers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient's study group (immediate intervention or wait list control group) will be&#xD;
           randomly assigned at the study's Qualtrics database after baseline interview is&#xD;
           complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. All recruitment paper, if any, will be sent to the project manager to file on a locked&#xD;
           cabinet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The patients who are randomized to the immediate intervention group will be assigned to&#xD;
           the training course as soon as a course is available. The patients randomized to the&#xD;
           waitlist control group will need to wait for six months to serve as no intervention&#xD;
           control, and then assigned to the training course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is a 12-week program which consists of 8-week training sessions followed by&#xD;
      4-week consultation service for technical support. Both will be provided by the young&#xD;
      volunteers. The themes of the 8-week training session are designed based on the objectives of&#xD;
      IMTOP: 1) teach skills of tablet use, 2) introduce online community communication to decrease&#xD;
      social isolation and obtain social support from family and friends, young volunteers, health&#xD;
      care providers, and diabetes peers who have similar condition/interest/ or disease), 3) teach&#xD;
      diabetes self-management knowledge and skills based on the evidence-based Chronic Disease&#xD;
      Self-Management Program; and 4) teach mobile technology application to healthcare access and&#xD;
      daily needs (i.e., online appointment, online refill, appointment reminder, online health&#xD;
      information, online training videos, and virtual classes such as e-newspaper, e-books,&#xD;
      related sites, apps).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the enrolled older adults will be invited to use a diabetes self-management&#xD;
      behavior tracking app developed by the research team. The app is designed to encourage&#xD;
      diabetes patients to regularly record their diet, physical activity, water consumption,&#xD;
      medication adherence, blood sugar readings, and blood pressure readings. The data will be&#xD;
      used for our research analysis to understand to what extent the older adults use the app and&#xD;
      whether regular recording has impact on the outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 4-week consultation service post the 8-week training course is intended as additional&#xD;
      support for the older adults who encounter technical issues when using the tablet on their&#xD;
      own. To receive the technical support, the older adults shall call the study hotline or post&#xD;
      their questions on the study website to explain the technical issues. The research staff will&#xD;
      find a study volunteer to address the technical issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the training sessions in the classroom, the research team may audiotape, videotape, or&#xD;
      take photos to record classroom interactions between older adults and young volunteers. The&#xD;
      recordings will be no more than half of the 8 sessions and each time we may videotape up to&#xD;
      90-min per session. The purposes are for quality improvement of the IMTOP program, for&#xD;
      research analyses at the aggregate level, and for dissemination of the program. The&#xD;
      participants have the rights to decide whether to be taped or photographed. They may indicate&#xD;
      their decision on the consent form or by telling the recorder/photographer at the time of the&#xD;
      taping/photo shooting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accrual and baseline data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      University of Southern California (USC) research team will prepare enrollment packages&#xD;
      (including an information sheet, the screener, the patient contact card, the consent form,&#xD;
      HIPPA form and a 40-minute baseline survey). Health educators employed by two Tzu Chi&#xD;
      Hospitals will help enroll and consent eligible patients. Participating patients will be&#xD;
      asked to sign the HIPPA authorization form to release their medical records in hospitals.&#xD;
      Consenting patients will be invited to take baseline survey through an interview with a study&#xD;
      interviewer, either in-person or by phone based on patient's preference. When baseline survey&#xD;
      is completed, patients will be randomly assigned to intervention group and wait-list control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up survey: For immediate intervention patients, 4-month, 8-month, and 12-month&#xD;
      follow-up surveys will be administered via telephone by part-time interviewers employed for&#xD;
      the study by the hospitals. For wait-list control group patients, 4-month, 8-month, 12-month,&#xD;
      and 16-month follow-up surveys will be administered via telephone by the part-time&#xD;
      interviewers. Study data will be obtained from patients' self-report on study assessments,&#xD;
      study tracking records such as the training course attendance, and patients' medical records&#xD;
      pertaining to diabetes care and healthcare utilizations in Taipei and Hualien Tzu Chi&#xD;
      Hospitals. Self-report data collected from patients include demographic characteristics,&#xD;
      physical health and mental health status, self-management behaviors, health care utilization,&#xD;
      health literacy, self-efficacy, social engagement, and quality of life. The study assessments&#xD;
      and study tracking records will be conducted exclusively for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For young volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accrual and baseline data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMTOP research staff and employees (such as diabetes health educators) of the Taipei and&#xD;
      Hualien Tzu Chi Hospitals will distribute young volunteer recruitment flyers to officer of&#xD;
      student affairs and faculty at various universities nearby the study sties. The IMTOP&#xD;
      research staff will also arrange meetings at university campuses to introduce the study and&#xD;
      call for volunteers. The study information and the call for volunteers will be disseminated&#xD;
      campus wide two months prior to each IMTOP training term starts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Young adults who are interested in participating in the study as volunteer instructors for&#xD;
      the training course will sign up at the study website IMTOP.usc.edu. The sign-up section of&#xD;
      the website will explicitly show the language that enrollment in the study means a volunteer&#xD;
      is not only serving as an instructor but also as a research participant. To complete the sign&#xD;
      up will require acknowledgment of the dual roles. There will be a study hotline number shown&#xD;
      on the recruitment flyer for interested young adults to get more information about the study&#xD;
      and for sign-up. The research staff will contact those young adults who meet the study&#xD;
      inclusion criteria for an interview to clarify the job responsibilities and the expectations.&#xD;
      Those who agree to meet the expectations will be invited to attend the two-day training&#xD;
      workshop (described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the training workshop, the young adults will be asked to consent for their&#xD;
      study participation and to complete the study baseline. Then they will be accepted for the&#xD;
      study enrollment as young volunteers. The target recruitment is 140 volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      USC research team will prepare the enrollment package (including the recruitment flyer, the&#xD;
      sign-up form, the consent form, and a 40-minute self-administered baseline survey). The&#xD;
      sign-up and the consent form will be available via the study website IMTOP.usc.edu. The&#xD;
      self-administered surveys will be available on qualtrics website via a web link in the study&#xD;
      website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orientation workshop:&#xD;
&#xD;
      USC research team will provide two orientation workshops for enrolled volunteers to learn&#xD;
      skills and knowledge for delivering the intervention service. The topics of orientation&#xD;
      workshops include young volunteers' role and responsibilities in the IMTOP research project,&#xD;
      knowledge of aging process, motivational interviewing skills, problem solving skills,&#xD;
      empathy, communication with older adults, and introduction of the 8-week training curriculum&#xD;
      and the 4-week technical support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteering services:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the orientation workshop is successfully completed, young volunteers will be assigned&#xD;
      to be one of about 4 instructing volunteers to provide the tablet training for a group of&#xD;
      approximately 10 older adults with type 2 diabetes. The training course is 2 hours per&#xD;
      session and 1 session per week for 8 weeks long. In each session, there is a prepared course&#xD;
      material for the volunteers to deliver to the older adults, such as use of web browsers,&#xD;
      application of social media, and online supporting materials for the older adults to learn&#xD;
      mobile technology for their self-management to improve health and quality of life. After the&#xD;
      8-week training period, the young volunteers will provide 4-week technical support for the&#xD;
      diabetes outpatients via phone or mobile device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the tablet training sessions in the classroom, the research team may audiotape,&#xD;
      videotape, or take photos to record classroom interactions between older adults and young&#xD;
      volunteers. The recordings will be no more than half of the 8 sessions and each time we may&#xD;
      videotape up to 120-min per session. The purposes are for quality improvement of the IMTOP&#xD;
      program, for research analyses at the aggregate level, and for dissemination of the program.&#xD;
      The participants have the rights to decide whether to be taped or photographed. They may&#xD;
      indicate their decision on the consent form or by telling the recorder/photographer at the&#xD;
      time of the taping/photo shooting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and follow-up survey:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrolled young volunteers will be asked to complete the self-administered online surveys&#xD;
      at baseline and at 2-month and 4-month follow up. That is, the baseline will be completed&#xD;
      prior to the intervention. The 2-month follow-up will be completed immediately after the&#xD;
      8-week training course. The 4-month follow-up will be completed one month after the 4-week&#xD;
      technical support period. The survey will collect data about demographic characteristics,&#xD;
      level of empathy, citizenship behavior, time management skills, altruism value, purpose of&#xD;
      life, and career development. In addition, the young volunteers will be asked to take turn in&#xD;
      recording the class log, including the class attendance, materials taught, Q&amp;A, any&#xD;
      difficulty or questions in delivering the curriculum, and other relevant observations or&#xD;
      issues. Additionally, once a month for a total of three times, once in week 4 and once in&#xD;
      week 8 during the 8-week course, plus once in the end of the 4-week technical support, they&#xD;
      will be asked to write a short reflection of their volunteering experience. These study&#xD;
      assessments and study tracking records will be conducted exclusively for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For young adult comparison group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of 140 young adults similar to the young volunteers will be recruited from&#xD;
      universities through information meetings held by the research staff in collaboration with&#xD;
      officer of student affairs and faculty at various universities. They will not be randomized,&#xD;
      but instead they will be deliberately recruited to be the comparison group that matches with&#xD;
      the young volunteer group on the bases of age range, college attendance and major, and&#xD;
      location of the schools. These young adults will be informed to serve as the comparison group&#xD;
      for the study. Once consented, they will be directed to answer the same self-administered&#xD;
      online surveys at baseline and at 2-month and 4-month follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Storage and Confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All questionnaires completed electronically via the web-based survey company qualtrics,&#xD;
           license available through the USC Information Technology Services&#xD;
           (http://www.usc.edu/its/qualtrics/), will be kept in the secure website of qualtrics and&#xD;
           then downloaded into a centralized database located in the USC School of Social Work.&#xD;
           The following links show privacy, acceptable use, and security statements provided by&#xD;
           qualtrics:&#xD;
&#xD;
           http://www.qualtrics.com/privacy-statement/&#xD;
           http://www.qualtrics.com/acceptable-use-statement/&#xD;
           http://www.qualtrics.com/security-statement/&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data collected on the study website IMTOP.usc.edu will be stored in secure and password&#xD;
           protected website at Amazon Cloud Drive, and then downloaded into a centralized database&#xD;
           located in the USC School of Social Work.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A password protected secure computer file linking identifying information and the&#xD;
           subject study ID will be securely maintained under control of Dr. Wu and the study Data&#xD;
           Analyst in the School of Social Work.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. All study data files will only contain subject IDs, not identifying information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Analysis and publication of the data will employ procedures making it impossible to&#xD;
           identify individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. After completion of the study, identifiable data such as video tapes will be destroyed,&#xD;
           but the remaining data will be retained at the researchers discretion and may be used in&#xD;
           future research studies. ..&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. All study investigators and staff have already or will complete the USC IRB and required&#xD;
           HIPAA certification course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hardcopy study data will be kept in the secure location in the USC School of Social Work or&#xD;
      in a designated locked cabinet in the collaborating Tzu Chi hospitals for a period of 5 years&#xD;
      following study completion, after which it will be destroyed. Study tracking data will also&#xD;
      be kept on a secure, password protected, web-site maintained by the School of Social Work&#xD;
      within the Hamovitch Research Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no anticipated risks to subjects' participation in this study. The tablet training&#xD;
      program takes place in Taipei or Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital. Subjects' participation in the&#xD;
      program may involve normal risks in transportation to attend the training sessions. Frequency&#xD;
      and intensity of training sessions might cause them certain level of anxiety and discomfort,&#xD;
      such as soreness in eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the study subjects will also participate in the study surveys, some of the survey&#xD;
      questions may make them uncomfortable or concerned, but they can choose not to answer any&#xD;
      questions they do not wish to answer. Participating in research may involve a loss of&#xD;
      privacy, but all of the information the subjects provide will be kept confidential. The&#xD;
      possibility of a breach of privacy to occur is very low but will exist as long as we hold the&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be advised that they are free not to use the technology and not to&#xD;
      answer any questions that make them uncomfortable. However, in previous studies of depressed&#xD;
      patients, distress resulting from interviews and questionnaires has been minimal. Subjects&#xD;
      may experience inconvenience and time costs associated with using technology and completing&#xD;
      study interviews; however, all interventions and interviews are completely voluntary and will&#xD;
      be conducted at the participant' convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technology intervention does not expose patients to additional or unusual medications or&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although all efforts will be made to protect patient confidentiality, those patients who&#xD;
      experience critical clinical events (e.g., hypoglycemia) during the study training sessions&#xD;
      or those who are likely victims of abuse may experience loss of confidentiality as study&#xD;
      staff will be required to report these events to the subject's physician for appropriate&#xD;
      safety measures to be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk Classification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks of this study are consistent with the HHS/FDA Regulations definition of minimal&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protection Against Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study PIs and the project manger who has a gerontology and public health background will&#xD;
      train the study recruiters, interviewers, and young volunteers to handle distressed or&#xD;
      potentially at risk patients during recruitment, intervention, and assessment. The&#xD;
      recruiters, interviewers, and young volunteers will request permission from distressed&#xD;
      subjects to notify their physician so that they may be assessed and treated as necessary. In&#xD;
      the case of emergengy, the recruiters, interviewers, and young volunteers will inform the&#xD;
      patient of the immediate need to notify the patient's physician, even without his or her&#xD;
      permission, so that these providers may take appropriate action to ensure patient safety.&#xD;
      This will involve using usual clinic channels to have the patient urgently evaluated and and&#xD;
      appropriate disposition arranged (including possible transport to Emergency Department in&#xD;
      Taipei and Hualien Tzu Chi Hospitals). The study principal investigator in the local site&#xD;
      will be available by cellular phone and will also be notified of emergency patients in order&#xD;
      to to ensure timely assessment and treatment by a physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All assessment data will be entered into a centralized database located in the USC School of&#xD;
      Social Work. Study patients will be identified by a unique study code number, the identity of&#xD;
      which will be known only to the study personnel with direct responsibility for providing&#xD;
      patient data. The database will be password protected against non-project personnel and&#xD;
      backed up weekly. This removes patient-identifiable data from the files. The data manager and&#xD;
      biostatistician will create a series of databases in Excel and SAS, so that they can analyze&#xD;
      the initial data as it comes in to ensure proper patient recruitment, track progress of the&#xD;
      study, and perform data checks and cleaning. All baseline and follow-up data, including&#xD;
      responses to the screener questionnaire, will be entered on qualtrics web-based survey system&#xD;
      through tablets or other computer devices onsite. The data will be identified by the&#xD;
      patient's study ID code. This data will be transmitted either wirelessly, through third or&#xD;
      forth generation mobile telecommunications, or through the local network connection in real&#xD;
      time to the qualtrics server as data is entered by recruiters on the computer devices, which&#xD;
      has been loaded with the requisite software and encryption system. The transmitted data will&#xD;
      be encrypted using HIPAA-compliant encryption and password protected. If there is poor&#xD;
      wireless connection or mobile telecommunication transmission is not possible, recruiters will&#xD;
      enter baseline and follow-up data on paper forms. All forms will be checked for completeness&#xD;
      by the qualtric systems or, if paper, by the study coordinator before being sent to the&#xD;
      project manager. The project manager will review and double-check all of the forms to be sure&#xD;
      they are completed and readable. For data on paper forms, data will be entered singly using&#xD;
      SAS (SAS Institute Inc., SAS Campus Drive, Cary, NC) full screen editor (FSEDIT) into SAS&#xD;
      database system with back-up copy and hard copy kept in secure locked file cabinet in the&#xD;
      SSW. For data on the qualtrics server, data would be downloaded onto local sites into the SAS&#xD;
      database system with back-up copy password-protected. Accuracy of data entry will be ensured&#xD;
      by an internal program with FSEDIT for range and logic check, and by a comparison between&#xD;
      printouts and the handwritten data forms. To assist in monitoring the study, periodic reports&#xD;
      will be generated using graphs and tables summarizing the status of subject recruitment and&#xD;
      data collection. Missing data will be routinely rectified. SAS will also be used to analyze&#xD;
      the data and generate all statistical reports. Data on the qualtrics server and the project&#xD;
      website will be destroyed at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Benefits to the Subject and/or Society:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct benefits to patients who participate IMTOP study include learning: 1) skills of tablet&#xD;
      use, 2) online community communication with family and friends, young volunteers, health care&#xD;
      providers, and diabetes peers who have similar condition/interest/ or disease, 3) diabetes&#xD;
      self-management knowledge and skills; and 4) mobile technology application to health access&#xD;
      and daily needs (i.e., online appointment, online refill, appointment reminder, online health&#xD;
      information, online training videos, and virtual classes such as e-newspaper, e-books,&#xD;
      related sites, apps) at no or minimal out-of-pocket cost (e.g., transportation cost to attend&#xD;
      the training course). There is a potential of improving the flow of communication between&#xD;
      these patients and their health educators as well as physicians through using mobile&#xD;
      technology. Self-management knowledge and behaviors will improve among them. Those patients&#xD;
      in the waitlist control group may also experience benefits due to the raised levels of&#xD;
      awareness of self-management, and later experience the potential benefits associated with the&#xD;
      tablet training intervention. The potential benefit to society is that IMTOP intervention is&#xD;
      likely to create an approach to improve self-management behaviors, health outcomes, and&#xD;
      quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition, with improvement in&#xD;
      self-monitoring behavior among older diabetes patients and raised levels of health awareness&#xD;
      among young volunteers, medical expenses of diabetes care by the government might decrease,&#xD;
      which benefits the society as a whole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternatives to Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Refusal to participate will not negatively impact older adults' diabetes care or their access&#xD;
      to usually available health services. If patients are interested in learning more about&#xD;
      diabetes self-management skills, but do not wish to participate in the study, written&#xD;
      educational materials in Chinese will be available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Refusal to participate among young adults, either in the volunteering group or in the&#xD;
      comparison group, also will not have any negative impact on the younger adults. They can&#xD;
      request to receive a copy of written educational materials in Chinese for future diabetes&#xD;
      prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk/Benefit Relationship:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential benefits to participants are greater than the risks associated with&#xD;
      participation. The physical, psychological, social, and legal risks to patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes are minimal. IMTOP study aims to improve their health outcomes and quality of life.&#xD;
      In addition, the intergenerational interactions could be a motivator for them to learn the&#xD;
      technology to enhance their skills of self-management, which may result in improved health&#xD;
      and decreased cost of medical care as a whole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For young volunteers, the risk is negligible but the focus of intergenerational interactions&#xD;
      could potentially improve their communication with and empathy for older adults, increase&#xD;
      awareness of self-care and disease prevention, build health-focused values of life style, and&#xD;
      shape future career choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For young adults in the comparison group, although both risk and benefit are minimal, they&#xD;
      may feel a sense of pride through their contribution to research.&#xD;
