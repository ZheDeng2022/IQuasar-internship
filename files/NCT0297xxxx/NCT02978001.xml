      The pathophysiological mechanisms explaining the association between psoriasis and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes are largely unknown but it has been hypothesized that systemic inflammation found in&#xD;
      both psoriasis and type 2 diabetes might play a role. In a recent study hyperinsulinaemic&#xD;
      euglycaemic clamps were performed and it showed that normal glucose-tolerant patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe psoriasis had lower whole-body insulin sensitivity during insulin&#xD;
      stimulation compared to healthy matched controls. Thus, the increased risk of type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      in patients with psoriasis appears to include defects in the glucose metabolism linked to&#xD;
      psoriasis itself. However, the methods applied did not allow a detailed characterization of&#xD;
      the metabolism in patients with psoriasis. Tracer technique combined with indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry has never been applied to study hepatic and whole body insulin sensitivity, and&#xD;
      glucose and fat oxidation, during basal conditions or during insulin stimulation in patients&#xD;
      with psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate hepatic and whole body insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      glucose and fat oxidation during both basal and insulin-stimulated conditions in patients&#xD;
      with psoriasis.&#xD;

      Background Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease characterized by&#xD;
      uncontrolled proliferation of keratinocytes, activated dendritic cells, release of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines and recruitment of T-cells to the skin. The prevalence of&#xD;
      psoriasis is 2-3% worldwide, with similar frequencies in men and women. Psoriasis has been&#xD;
      associated with components of the metabolic syndrome, in particular obesity and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes, and patients with psoriasis are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      Obesity is twice as prevalent in patients with psoriasis and patients are at increased risk&#xD;
      of developing cardiovascular disease compared to the general population. These co-morbidities&#xD;
      are important to recognize or preferably prevent and treat as they might lead to increased&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 2 diabetes is a complex metabolic disorder that develops as a consequence of genetic and&#xD;
      environmental factors such as inadequate physical activity and obesity. The incidence of type&#xD;
      2 diabetes is increasing worldwide and there is a general agreement that it is caused mainly&#xD;
      by the adoption to westernized, sedentary lifestyle. Patients with type 2 diabetes are&#xD;
      characterized by decreased peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity, beta cell dysfunction&#xD;
      and impaired glucose and fat oxidation. Muscle insulin resistance has been proposed to&#xD;
      account for as much as 85-90% of the impairment of the peripheral insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      (expressed as the total body glucose disposal) in patients with type 2 diabetes during&#xD;
      insulin stimulation. Multiple intramyocellular defects have been demonstrated, including&#xD;
      impaired glucose transport and phosphorylation, reduced glycogen synthesis, and decreased&#xD;
      glucose oxidation as well as proximal defects in the insulin signal transduction system.&#xD;
      Similar to psoriasis, systemic inflammation occurs in patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiological mechanisms explaining the association between psoriasis and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes are largely unknown but it has been hypothesized that systemic inflammation found in&#xD;
      both psoriasis and type 2 diabetes might play a role. In a recent study hyperinsulinaemic&#xD;
      euglycaemic clamps were made and it showed that normal glucose-tolerant patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe psoriasis had lower whole-body insulin sensitivity during insulin&#xD;
      stimulation compared to healthy matched controls. Thus, the increased risk of type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      in patients with psoriasis appears to include defects in the glucose metabolism linked to&#xD;
      psoriasis itself. However, the methods applied did not allow a detailed characterization of&#xD;
      the metabolism in patients with psoriasis. Tracer technique combined with indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry has never been applied to study hepatic and whole body insulin sensitivity, and&#xD;
      glucose and fat oxidation, during basal conditions or during insulin stimulation in patients&#xD;
      with psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to experimental day 1 and 2 the participants will meet in the morning following a 10&#xD;
      hour fast (including liquids, medication, and tobacco). No alcohol consumption or vigorous&#xD;
      physical activities will be permitted 48 hours before the examination, and all participants&#xD;
      will be requested to eat carbohydrate-rich diet the previous two days. All experiments will&#xD;
      be carried out in the Center for Diabetes Research, Gentofte Hospital, University of&#xD;
      Copenhagen, Hellerup, Denmark where the necessary equipment is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental day 1: An intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), and a fibro scan of the&#xD;
      liver will be performed and the second experimental day will be scheduled. Time spent during&#xD;
      experimental day 1 is approximately 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) will be performed to determine beta cell function.&#xD;
      A glucose bolus of 0.3 g/kg body weight will be infused over 1 min at t=0 min. Plasma samples&#xD;
      for glucose, C-peptide, insulin and glucagon will be collected at t = -10, - 5, 0, 2, 4, 6,&#xD;
      8, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition is determined prior to Day 2 by DXA scan (Lunar Prodigy Advance GE&#xD;
      Healthcare).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibro scan will be performed using a Fibroscan 501® (EchoSensTM, Paris, France) to asses&#xD;
      fibrosis status and steatosis grade of the liver (23). Hepatic elasticity and thus fibrosis&#xD;
      status (expressed as kPa) will be assessed by measuring the transmission speed of the&#xD;
      ultrasound based on the principle that the transmission speed of vibrations passing through&#xD;
      liver tissue increases when hepatic fibrosis is present. Hepatic steatosis will be assessed&#xD;
      by a controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) (expressed as decibel per meter (dB/m)) based on&#xD;
      the fact that fat affects ultrasound propagation. A success rate of ≥60% and a ratio of the&#xD;
      interquartile range of liver stiffness to the median ≤30% will be considered reliable and&#xD;
      used for the final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental day 2: Hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp (HEC) combined with stable isotope&#xD;
      infusion, muscle and fat biopsies and indirect calorimetry. Time spent during experimental&#xD;
      day 1 is approximately 7 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following emptying of the urine bladder, the participants will be placed recumbently in a&#xD;
      bed. Two cannulas will be inserted in the cubital veins: one for collection of arterialized&#xD;
      blood samples and one in the contralateral vein for infusions. The forearm from which blood&#xD;
      samples are drawn will be wrapped in a heating blanket (50°C) throughout the experiment.&#xD;
      Immediately after taking background samples, a primed constant infusion of [6,6-D2]glucose&#xD;
      (D2-glucose) (priming bolus of 40 µmol/kg; continuous infusion rate of 0.4 µmol· min·kg-1)&#xD;
      and [1,1,2,3,3,-D5] glycerol (D5-glycerol) (priming bolus of 1.5 µmol/kg; continuous infusion&#xD;
      rate 0.1 µmol· min·kg-1) will be started (t=0 min) and maintained for 360 min to determine&#xD;
      glucose and glycerol kinetics in the basal and insulin-stimulated state, however the&#xD;
      continuous infusion rates will be changed during insulin infusion. The first steady-state&#xD;
      period will be defined as the last 30 min of the 120-min basal period, when the tracer&#xD;
      equilibria of [D2]glucose and [D5]glycerol are expected; the low grade insulin infusion (10&#xD;
      mU/m2 per min) steady-state period will be defined as the last 30 min of the first insulin&#xD;
      clamp period (210-240 min), during which the infusion rate of D2-glucose will be increased to&#xD;
      0.56 µmol· min·kg-1, and the infusion rate of D5-glycerol will be reduced to 0.05 µmol·&#xD;
      min·kg-1. The high grade insulin infusion (40 mU/m2 per min) steady-state period will be&#xD;
      defined as the last 30 min of the second insulin clamp period (330-360 min), during which the&#xD;
      infusion rate of D2-glucose will be increased to 1.0 µmol· min·kg-1, and the infusion rate of&#xD;
      D5-glycerol will be reduced to 0.025 µmol· min·kg-1. Following the basal steady-state period&#xD;
      at the time point 120 min, a continuous insulin infusion will be initiated and fixed at 10&#xD;
      mU/m2 per min, the infusion rate. At the time point 240 min the continuous insulin infusion&#xD;
      will be primed and raised to 40 mU/m2 per min until the time point 360 min. A variable&#xD;
      infusion of unlabelled glucose (180 g/l) will be used to maintain euglycemia during insulin&#xD;
      infusion. Plasma glucose concentrations will be monitored bedside every 5 min during clamp&#xD;
      using the glucose oxidase method (Yellow Springs Instrument Model 2300 STAT plus analyser,&#xD;
      Yellow Springs, Ohio, USA). The target plasma glucose concentration will be 5 mM. Blood&#xD;
      samples for measuring plasma glucose and glycerol enrichments will be drawn at baseline (0&#xD;
      min) and in the first steady state period (90, 100, 110 and 120 min) and during the&#xD;
      insulin-stimulated steady state period (330, 340, 350 and 360 min). All isotopes will be&#xD;
      purchased from Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories (Andover, MA). Blood samples for measuring&#xD;
      plasma glycerol and lactate will be drawn at baseline and in the first (90 to 120 min),&#xD;
      second (210 to 240 min) and third (330-360 min) steady-state period. Samples for determining&#xD;
      plasma insulin, C-peptide and glucagon will be drawn at (0, 60, 90, 100, 110, 120, 135, 150,&#xD;
      165, 180, 195, 210, 220, 230, 240, 255, 270, 285, 300, 315, 330, 340, 350, 360 min). Blood&#xD;
      samples for determining FFAs, HbA1c, total-, High Density Lipoprotein (HDL)- -, Low Density&#xD;
      Lipoprotein (LDL)- and Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL)-cholesterol, and triglycerides&#xD;
      will be drawn at baseline, and blood samples for measuring FFAs in the insulin-stimulated&#xD;
      state will be drawn at 240 and 360 min. Urine samples will be collected at 0, 120, 240 and&#xD;
      360 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indirect calorimetry will be performed during basal (90-120 min), low (210-240 min) and high&#xD;
      grade (330-360 min) insulin-stimulated steady-state to determine oxygen consumption (V02) and&#xD;
      carbon dioxide production (VC02). A flow-through canopy gas analyser will be used, as&#xD;
      described by (25). The average gas exchange over the three 30-min steady-state periods (basal&#xD;
      and insulin-stimulated) will be used to calculate rates of glucose and fat oxidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle and fat biopsies will be performed in the end of the basal (t=120 min) and high grade&#xD;
      insulin-stimulated (t=360 min) steady-state periods. Muscle and fat biopsies will be obtained&#xD;
      under local anaesthesia, from musculi vastus lateralis and subcutaneous abdominal fat using a&#xD;
      modified Bergström's needle (including suction) at 120 (basal) and 360 min (high grade&#xD;
      insulin-stimulated). Biopsies will be frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80ºC for later&#xD;
      analysis. The total amount of extracted tissue will amount to 400-600 mg.&#xD;
