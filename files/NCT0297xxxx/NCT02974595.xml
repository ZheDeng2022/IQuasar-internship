      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some diseases cause chronic inflammation with intermittent flares in the body. These are&#xD;
      called autoinflammatory diseases. They can cause fevers, rashes, ulcers, and other problems.&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn more about the causes and effects of these diseases. They hope this&#xD;
      will improve how the disease is managed in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand the underlying immune dysregulation&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the genetic cause&#xD;
&#xD;
      To translate our findings into novel treatments that improve patients disease outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with known NOMID/CAPS, DIRA, CANDLE, SAVI, NLRC4-MAS, Still's Disease, and with&#xD;
      other yet undifferentiated autoinflammatory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unaffected relatives of participants with a known or undifferentiated autoinflammatory&#xD;
      disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adult volunteers at least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with blood sample and medical history. They may provide copies&#xD;
      of their medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled participants will be evaluated at the NIH for 2-5 days. All participants will have a&#xD;
      detailed medical history, physical exam, blood tests, and other evaluations depending on the&#xD;
      extent of their autoinflammatory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may also expect the following assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical tests that help assess organ damage and function such as hearing, vision,&#xD;
           memory, and learning tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Imaging studies to characterize organ involvement of the inflammatory disease including:&#xD;
           X-rays, CT scans, special MRIs, and bone scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Laboratory evaluations including clinical markers of disease activity, research samples&#xD;
           for genetic studies, blood samples for cytokine/biomarker assessment, and gene&#xD;
           expression profiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Questionnaires to assess disease activity and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If indicated, other procedures may be administered that include: a lumbar puncture if&#xD;
           CNS inflammation is suspected, a skin biopsy if skin inflammation is present, and/or&#xD;
           gastrointestinal and pulmonary procedures if they are clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may return for a single follow-up visit or for long-term follow-up visits&#xD;
      depending on their disease and willingness to return. Long-term follow-up may occur for up to&#xD;
      15 years on this protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autoinflammatory diseases are a group of immune dysregulatory diseases that are characterized&#xD;
      by recurrent episodes of systemic as well as organ-specific inflammation that can involve the&#xD;
      skin, eyes, joints, bones, muscles, lungs, serosal surfaces, inner ear, brain, and other&#xD;
      organs. The prominent role of IL-1 in the pathogenesis of these disorders first became&#xD;
      evident through the discovery of mutations in the gene NLRP3 and IL1RN. Since then, we have&#xD;
      identified additional mutations that cause autoinflammatory diseases, including mutations in&#xD;
      proteasome components and STING1 that suggest a role of increased type I IFN signaling as a&#xD;
      contributor to the disease pathogenesis of autoinflammatory diseases and in NLRC4 and CDC42&#xD;
      that suggest a role of IL-18 in some autoinflammatory diseases. In this natural history&#xD;
      study, we seek to comprehensively evaluate people with autoinflammatory diseases that include&#xD;
      clinical, genetic, immunologic, andendocrinologic characterizations. Other rare diseases not&#xD;
      mediated by IL-1, IL-18 or type I IFN and presumed to be autoinflammatory diseases with&#xD;
      unknown genetic causes may also be eligible under this protocol. In addition, we intend to&#xD;
      evaluate long-term outcomes and biomarkers over time in selected diseases. We plan to follow&#xD;
      most participants for the duration of this study (15 years). Relatives who do not have&#xD;
      autoinflammatory diseases as well as healthy volunteers will also be recruited to serve as&#xD;
      controls for biomarker, genetic, and other molecular analyses.&#xD;
