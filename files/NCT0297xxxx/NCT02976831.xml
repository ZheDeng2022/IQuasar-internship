  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plaque psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder, affecting 1-3% of the&#xD;
      population in Europe and the United States of America (USA) and represents one of the most&#xD;
      prevalent immune inflammatory diseases. AZD0284 is a potent selective inverse agonist of&#xD;
      RORg, which is being developed for the management of psoriasis. The current Phase 1 study&#xD;
      investigates the safety, tolerability, food effect, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      (PD) properties of single and repeated doses of AZD0284. The study will be conducted in&#xD;
      healthy subjects. The study will be divided into 2 parts: Part 1 (SAD) and Part 2 (MAD), with&#xD;
      Part 1 being split into 2 sub-parts: 1A (fasting) and 1B (fed). The results from this study&#xD;
      will form the basis for decisions on future studies. The study will help to identify&#xD;
      appropriate, well-tolerated doses that can be administered in subsequent studies in patients&#xD;
      with psoriasis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plaque psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder. There are 2 key&#xD;
      abnormalities in psoriasis, hyper proliferation of keratinocytes and an inflammatory cell&#xD;
      infiltrate, which includes; dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, natural killer (NK) T cells,&#xD;
      mast cells, T cells and neutrophils. There is strong evidence that T cells have an important&#xD;
      role in psoriasis, including the fact that T-cell targeted agents are effective in psoriasis&#xD;
      therapy. This study is the first time AZD0284 will be given to humans. The current Phase 1&#xD;
      study investigates the safety, tolerability, food effect, pharmacokinetic (PK) and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of single and repeated doses of AZD0284. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in healthy subjects to avoid interference from disease processes or other drugs.&#xD;
      The study will be divided into 2 parts: Part 1 (SAD) and Part 2 (MAD), with Part 1 being&#xD;
      split into 2 sub-parts: 1A (fasting) and 1B (fed). The secondary and safety pharmacology of&#xD;
      AZD0284 has been investigated using both in vitro and in vivo models. Screening of AZD0284 in&#xD;
      a diverse set of in vitro radiolig and binding, enzyme, functional and electrophysiological&#xD;
      assays including cardiac ion channels did not identify any off-target activities likely to be&#xD;
      relevant in or near the therapeutic exposure range. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are&#xD;
      defined such that the selected subjects will be free of any significant illness when included&#xD;
      in the study. The selected starting dose for the SAD part (Part 1A) of the study is 4.0 mg&#xD;
      AZD0284 (oral solution). The maximum allowed exposure based on the toxicology studies is 127&#xD;
      μmol*h/L (total AUC(0-24,ss)) or 7.35 μmol/L (total Cmax). In Part 1A (SAD study), 6 dose&#xD;
      levels and in Part 2 (MAD study), 3 dose levels are planned. In either part, up to 2&#xD;
      additional doses may be added if needed. The results from this study will form the basis for&#xD;
      decisions on future studies. The study will help to identify appropriate, well-tolerated&#xD;
      doses that can be administered in subsequent studies in patients with psoriasis.&#xD;

                  assay (IGRA) (i.e. QuantiFERON TB-Gold) the test may be repeated if the initial&#xD;
                  test result is indeterminate. Subjects who have resided in regions where&#xD;
                  tuberculosis or mycosis are endemic during 90 days before screening or who intend&#xD;
