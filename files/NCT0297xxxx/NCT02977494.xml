  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myeloma patients with renal impairment need a rapid and effective reduction of tumor burden&#xD;
      to enable renal recovery, which is correlated with prognosis of the patients. However,&#xD;
      effective combination regimens are often hampered by necessary dose reductions or increased&#xD;
      toxicity in renally impaired patients. The well known positive effects on renal impairment by&#xD;
      Bortezomib combined with Daratumumab, which, as all monoclonal Antibody, is not renally&#xD;
      excreted or metabolized and as so far known should not add significant toxicity but efficacy,&#xD;
      makes the proposed combination of Daratumumab, Bortezomib and Dexamethasone highly attractive&#xD;
      for renally impaired MM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current clinical trials with Daratumumab patients with renal function impairment (GFR&#xD;
      ≤ 20 ml/min) were so far excluded. Consequently questions about efficacy, safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of Daratumumab in combination with Bortezomib and Dexamethasone in patients&#xD;
      with relapsed and refractory MM and severe renal impairment are still unanswered. This trial&#xD;
      will answer these questions for a patient group, who has still an unmet need for novel and&#xD;
      effective treatment options&#xD;

             respectively), or hepatitis C (anti-HCV antibody positive or HCV RNA quantitation&#xD;
             positive).&#xD;
&#xD;

             systemic infection, uncontrolled diabetes, acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary&#xD;
             disease) that is likely to interfere with the study procedures or results, or that in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator, would constitute a hazard for the participating in&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Subject has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to corticosteroids,&#xD;

             products.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Subject is known or suspected of not being able to comply with the study protocol (eg.&#xD;
             because of alcoholism, drug dependency, or psychological disorder). Subject has any&#xD;
             condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in&#xD;
             the best interest of the subject (eg, compromise the well-being) or that could&#xD;
             prevent, limit or confound the protocol-specified assessments. Subject is taking any&#xD;
             prohibited medication&#xD;
