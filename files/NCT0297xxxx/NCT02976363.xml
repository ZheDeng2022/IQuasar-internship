      Objective: The purpose of this research was to study the Maximal Respiratory Pressures (MRP)&#xD;
      after exposure to breast radiation therapy in women. Methods: Prospective observational study&#xD;
      performed at the Hospital de cancer Alfred in Campo Grande/MS. The sample of this study&#xD;
      consisted of women (N = 16) divided into two groups: women exposed to breast radiotherapy&#xD;
      after underwent quadrantectomy surgery (n = 8); and women with no history of cancer (n = 8).&#xD;
      We evaluated the strength of respiratory muscles through the Maximal Inspiratory Pressure&#xD;
      (MIP) and Maximal Expiratory Pressure (MEP) using the handset called manovacuometer. The&#xD;
      examination was performed before the first session and after the twenty-fifth session related&#xD;
      to the last day of the radiation treatment; evaluation of anthropometric data of weight and&#xD;
      height to detect the body mass index (BMI); evaluation of clinical respiratory symptoms of&#xD;
      dyspnea using the Medical Research Council (MRC) Dyspnea Scale and characterization of cough&#xD;
      with Common Pulmonary Toxicity Criteria, in the classification of clinical pneumonitis.&#xD;

      Study design and sample The research consisted of an observational prospective study with&#xD;
      control group. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of&#xD;
      Mato Grosso do Sul (UFMS) with the number 46913415.7.0000.002. All participants signed an&#xD;
      informed consent form after being informed about the design and objectives of the study&#xD;
      according to Resolution 466/12 of the National Council of Health Ministry of Health (CNS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quadrantectomy group participants were selected consecutively among patients who&#xD;
      initiated radiotherapy. While the control group was selected during routine exams of he image&#xD;
      sector from Hospital de Cancer Alfred Abr찾o.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research site The execution of the research took place in the Radiotherapy sector of Hospital&#xD;
      de Cancer Alfred Abr찾o in Campo Grande - Mato Grosso do Sul state, from December 2015 to&#xD;
      February 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy Protocol The Quadrantectomy Group sample performed adjuvant radiotherapy with a&#xD;
      linear accelerator, whose the total dosage was 5000 centigray (cGy), the daily dose 200 cGy&#xD;
      distributed into twenty-five sessions, totaling 25 days of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES Evaluation of maximal respiratory pressures (MRP) Quantification of MIP and MEP&#xD;
      was performed with the portable device called manometer, Wika brand with pressure scale&#xD;
      ranging from -150 to 150 centimeters of water (0 to -150 to (0 to -150 for MIP; 0 to 150 for&#xD;
      MEP). The mouthpiece attached to the device had a hole of 2 mm in diameter, in order to&#xD;
      function as a relief valve of the facial muscles. During the measurement of maximal&#xD;
      respiratory pressures, the survey participants remained in seated position with the trunk in&#xD;
      a 90 째 angle with the lower limbs. A forced expiration was requested until reaching the&#xD;
      residual volume (RV) for the measurement of MIP, followed by a maximal inspiratory effort&#xD;
      against the occluded airway (Maneuver Muller), this maneuver kept for up to 2 seconds. While&#xD;
      the evaluation of MEP, a maximum inspiration was requested to Total Lung Capacity (TLC),&#xD;
      followed by a maximal expiratory effort against the occluded airway (Muller maneuver),&#xD;
      maintained for up to 2 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from Maximal Respiratory Pressures were collected at two phases in the sample of&#xD;
      quadrantectomy group: before the first session of radiotherapy and after the twenty-fifth&#xD;
      session corresponding to the last day of the radiotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the MRP was performed according to the Brazilian Guidelines for Pulmonary&#xD;
      Function Tests. The results were analyzed according to the predictive values of Neder&#xD;
      regression equations (1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complementary evaluation Anthropometric data evaluated to detect the body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
      were: weight and height. Evaluation of dyspnea and cough symptoms with modified Dyspnea&#xD;
      Medical Research Council scale (MRC) with the Common Pulmonary Toxicity Common Criteria scale&#xD;
      (CTC Version 2.0) was performed to classify the clinic pneumonitis according to the Common&#xD;
      Toxicity Criteria (CTC Version 2.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics The variables classified as dependent were the maximal respiratory pressures.&#xD;
      While the independent variables were sex, age, weight, height, BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison data analysis between the control group and quadrantectomy in relation to the&#xD;
      variables: age, height, weight, BMI, MIP and MEP, was performed using the student's t test.&#xD;
      The comparison between the moments before and after the radiotherapy in relation to MIP and&#xD;
      MEP was performed using the student's t test paired, considering a 5% significance level. The&#xD;
      other results of this study were presented in the form of descriptive statistics or in tables&#xD;
      and graphics. Statistical analysis was performed using the sigma plot version 12.5&#xD;
      statistical program.&#xD;
