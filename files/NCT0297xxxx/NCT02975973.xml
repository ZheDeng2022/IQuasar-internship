    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairments in schizophrenia are the most debilitating aspect of the illness and&#xD;
      poorly treated by current medications. This study investigates transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) - a safe, noninvasive weak electrical current delivery to stimulate brain&#xD;
      function - as a novel therapeutic for cognition in schizophrenia. Integrating&#xD;
      neurostimulation, electrophysiology and neuroimaging, this project aims to study tDCS effects&#xD;
      on cognition by verifying therapeutic target engagement, evaluating the tolerability of tDCS&#xD;
      sessions, and optimizing treatment parameters.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive deficits are a strong predictor of functional outcome in schizophrenia, yet poorly&#xD;
      remediated by current treatments. Disturbances in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)&#xD;
      function underlie core impairments such as in cognitive control and thus represent a critical&#xD;
      target for novel therapeutics. Initial studies indicate transcranial direct-current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) may be effective in reducing symptoms due to DLPFC dysfunction. While tDCS&#xD;
      potentially represents an exciting, novel therapeutic advance, a number of basic questions&#xD;
      should be addressed prior to conducting larger-scale clinical trials, including: verifying&#xD;
      therapeutic target engagement, optimizing treatment parameters, and evaluating for meaningful&#xD;
      clinical effects. Recent studies employing tDCS to enhance prefrontal cortical function in&#xD;
      schizophrenia applied stimulating electrodes over the left frontal scalp region, putatively&#xD;
      targeting the left DLPFC. However, explicit confirmation of such target engagement is&#xD;
      lacking. Further, EEG studies have demonstrated close links of frontal cortical gamma&#xD;
      oscillations to cognitive control processes but modulation of this critical physiologic&#xD;
      process has not been investigated. Accordingly, the primary aim of this study is to employ&#xD;
      multimodal imaging to explicitly test for the assumed DLPFC engagement (fMRI) and modulation&#xD;
      of frontal gamma activity (EEG) by tDCS. This study will also investigate the optimization of&#xD;
      tDCS application parameters. Analogous to dose-finding investigations in drug studies, we&#xD;
      will conduct a parametric investigation of optimal current strengths. Also, while there is&#xD;
      extensive evidence for tolerability of single session tDCS, confirmation of feasibility of&#xD;
      multisession optimized protocols in schizophrenia is lacking and so will be explicitly&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, a successful outcome of this study would provide tDCS the sound mechanistic and&#xD;
      methodologic basis for more definitive testing in large-scale clinical trials as a highly&#xD;
      innovative therapeutic intervention for cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The reason we have fewer subjects randomized than enrolled is that some participants did not meet criteria to be randomized. These subjects were consented and completed many assessments, but were ultimately not randomized due to how they scored on some assessments. For instance, some peoples MCCB score was too high to be randomized into the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The primary reasons for ineligibility were not meeting the early psychosis criterion (&lt; 5 years of treatment), not taking any medication, and drug use. There were also many who did not even enter screening due to the assessment that they would highly likely not meet the threshold of requirement cognitive impairment (MATRICS score 40).</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB).&#xD;
Intended to provide a relatively brief evaluation of key cognitive domains that are relevant to schizophrenia and related disorders, the battery is appropriate for use as an outcome measure for clinical trials of cognition-enhancing drugs, when studying cognitive remediation, to measure cognitive change, and as a cognitive reference point for nonintervention studies of schizophrenia and other severe psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
Higher scores are better.</description>
