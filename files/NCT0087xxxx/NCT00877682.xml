    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if using cryotherapy to treat only the&#xD;
      part of the prostate that contains cancer is an effective treatment for prostate cancer. The&#xD;
      safety of this treatment will also be studied. Researchers also want to learn if treating&#xD;
      only the part of the prostate with cancer causes less impact on your quality of life than&#xD;
      other types of therapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cryotherapy (also called cryoablation) is an FDA approved treatment for prostate cancer. It&#xD;
      involves placing multiple needles within the prostate and freezing the prostate, which will&#xD;
      destroy both the cancerous and normal prostate tissue in a very controlled manner. It is&#xD;
      possible to treat less than the whole prostate by only freezing the area of the prostate&#xD;
      known to contain the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, cryotherapy will be performed in a way similar to whole prostate cryotherapy,&#xD;
      except the entire prostate will not be frozen. For this study, only that portion of the&#xD;
      prostate with the most prostate cancer and the upper half of the opposite side of location of&#xD;
      the cancer in the prostate will be treated. All areas of cancer may not be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cryotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cryotherapy is performed under general anesthetic in the operating room. An ultrasound probe&#xD;
      is inserted into the rectum to monitor the tissue freezing. A urethral warmer is inserted&#xD;
      into the bladder through the penis to maintain the health of the urethra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality-of-Life Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will complete quality-of-life questionnaires before the prostate biopsy, and then at 3,&#xD;
      6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months after cryotherapy. The questionnaires will ask about your&#xD;
      general health and your urinary, bowel, and sexual functions. The questionnaire should take&#xD;
      about 15 minutes to complete each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital Rectal Exams and PCA3 Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before your cryotherapy and again before the biopsies at Months 6, 18 and 36 you will have a&#xD;
      digital rectal exam (feeling the prostate through your anus) to check the status of the&#xD;
      disease. You will also have digital rectal exams at Months 48 and 60 to check the status of&#xD;
      the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine will be collected after each digital rectal exam. This sample will be tested for PCA3,&#xD;
      which has been associated with prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate Biopsies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have additional prostate biopsies at 6, 18, and 36 months after cryotherapy. About&#xD;
      12 biopsies samples will be collected each time from the same locations as during the&#xD;
      screening biopsy. If you have rising PSA levels or your doctor thinks it is necessary, you&#xD;
      and your doctor will discuss the need additional biopsies at Months 48 and 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Cryotherapy is FDA approved for the destruction of tissue,&#xD;
      including prostate tissue. For the treatment of prostate cancer, it is commonly used to treat&#xD;
      the entire prostate gland. This study is investigational because only a part of the prostate&#xD;
      gland will be treated, instead of the entire gland. Partial organ treatment with cryotherapy&#xD;
      is common for treatment of kidney, liver, and skin lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 100 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically identified adenocarcinoma of the prostate by minimum 6 core prostate&#xD;
             biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Serum PSA &lt;/= 10 ng/mL before prostate biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Less than 50% of samples from one side of the prostate positive for prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. No greater than 50% of a single core total length occupied by prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. No dominant Gleason 4 component. (e.g.; 4+X is not allowed, but X+4 is eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. No Gleason 5 component (primary, secondary or tertiary).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects may have contralateral positive prostate biopsy in a single core within the&#xD;
             eligibility biopsy so long as the involvement of this core is 2mm or less and no&#xD;
             Gleason 4 or Gleason 5 pattern exists. This is considered to be Non-Dominant&#xD;
             (Contralateral) Tumor Burden and is not exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. In the case that the confirmatory biopsy fails to sample the tumor again, patients&#xD;
             will be allowed to continue into the therapeutic phase using the laterality&#xD;
             information obtained during the eligibility biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Medical History or Concurrent Disease which in the investigators mind places the&#xD;
             patient at significant preoperative risk or for which the investigator does not feel&#xD;
             this therapy is appropriate. Investigator believes subject is unwilling or unable to&#xD;
             comply with study protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. AUASI (American Urologic Association Symptom Index) score &gt;/=20&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Active urinary tract infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Active treatment with anticoagulant/anti-platelet agent that cannot be safely stopped&#xD;
             at the time of prostate biopsy and cryotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Medical or surgical castration initiated before or after the eligibility biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient is unable to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients will undergo base line bone scan prior to cryoablation to evaluate for&#xD;
             regions of abnormal uptake before therapeutic intervention. Metastatic disease by bone&#xD;
             scintigraphy is exclusionary. Bone scans performed within 12 months prior to study&#xD;
             entry will be used for study base line purposes and will not need to be repeated,&#xD;
             unless clinically indicated.&#xD;
