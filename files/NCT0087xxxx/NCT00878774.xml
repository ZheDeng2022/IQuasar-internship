  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 36 million Americans suffer from seasonal allergies and that ragweed is&#xD;
      the primary cause of autumn allergies, 87% of patients with ragweed allergy suffer&#xD;
      rhinoconjunctivitis. ToleroMune Ragweed is a novel, synthetic, allergen-derived peptide&#xD;
      desensitising vaccine, currently being developed for the treatment of ragweed allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple&#xD;
      ascending doses of ToleroMune Ragweed in subjects in subjects with a documented history of&#xD;
      allergic rhinoconjunctivitis on exposure to ragweed pollen. The efficacy of ToleroMune&#xD;
      Ragweed will also be explored in these subjects using the Late Phase Skin Response, Early&#xD;
      Phase Skin Response and Conjunctival Provocation Test.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of escalating multiple doses of ToleroMune Ragweed in subjects&#xD;
      with a documented history of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis on exposure to ragweed pollen. The&#xD;
      efficacy of ToleroMune Ragweed will also be explored in these subjects using the LPSR, EPSR,&#xD;
      CPT and levels of ragweed specific IgE. A single centre will be initiated first, with a&#xD;
      second centre included as a backup, if needed, to enable recruitment numbers to be met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 3 study periods. In Period 1, Screening will be performed up to a&#xD;
      maximum of 8 weeks before randomisation and may consist of one or two visits to the clinic,&#xD;
      at the Investigator's discretion. Baseline Challenge will consist of a single visit 1 to 4&#xD;
      weeks before randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 2 (Treatment Period) will consist of 4 visits (Visits 3A-3D) two weeks apart (14±2&#xD;
      days). Subjects who comply with the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assigned to one of 5&#xD;
      dose groups. The first dose group will receive 4 administrations of ToleroMune Ragweed.&#xD;
      Successive dose groups will increasing doses given as 4 administrations of ToleroMune&#xD;
      Ragweed, provided the first administration of the previous dose was safe and well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Period 3, Post-treatment Challenge will take place 19-25 weeks after the first&#xD;
      administration in the Treatment Period and will be timed to be outside the Ragweed season.&#xD;
      However in the event that the Ragweed season lasts beyond 26th October 2009, the PTC will&#xD;
      take place 22-28 weeks after the first administration in the Treatment Period. Assessments&#xD;
      performed will be identical to those at the Baseline Challenge. Follow-up will be conducted&#xD;
      3-10 days after PTC.&#xD;
