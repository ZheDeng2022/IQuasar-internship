  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this randomized clinical trial is to determine whether immunizing children in&#xD;
      Hutterite colonies with inactivated influenza vaccine can prevent influenza and its&#xD;
      complications in other colony members. Furthermore, the study will assess the indirect&#xD;
      benefit to Hutterites at high risk of complications. The study is a blinded, cluster&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial among Hutterite colonies to test the hypothesis that high&#xD;
      immunization rates (&gt;70%) of healthy children with inactivated influenza vaccine reduces&#xD;
      transmission of influenza to other colony members. Randomization of these homogeneous,&#xD;
      moderately sized colonies where there is regular spread facilitated by a communal lifestyle,&#xD;
      but limited re-introduction because of relative isolation from outside community, represents&#xD;
      a unique opportunity to test the hypothesis of indirect benefit under close to ideal&#xD;
      conditions. The primary outcome will be laboratory-confirmed influenza. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      include influenza-like illness, otitis media, physician visits, antimicrobial prescriptions,&#xD;
      absenteeism, lower respiratory tract infection, hospitalizations, and death.&#xD;

      Colonies will be enrolled in September 2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy Hutterite Children will be vaccinated in October, in each year of the study (2008,&#xD;
      2009, &amp; 2010)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza Surveillance phase will begin around December-January of each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All study outcomes will be collected during the Surveillance phase of the study from Dec&#xD;
           to June for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcomes will be collected when research nurses visit the colonies. A research nurse&#xD;
           will visit enrolled colonies twice a week during the surveillance phase and review study&#xD;
           diaries and obtain swabs from participants with symptoms of influenza.&#xD;

             analysis, Hutterites at high risk for influenza complications within this category&#xD;
