  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been four previous Total Therapy (TT1 through IIIB) studies for multiple myeloma&#xD;
      at the MIRT from 1989 to present. Results have shown that participants treated on these&#xD;
      studies had better outcomes (meaning they have lived longer and had better responses to&#xD;
      treatment) when compared to individuals treated with standard chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Past studies conducted at the MIRT have shown that participants presenting to MIRT who have&#xD;
      already received treatment for myeloma tend to have shorter remissions (disappearance of&#xD;
      signs and symptoms of myeloma) and do not survive as long as participants who come to MIRT&#xD;
      with untreated myeloma. Researchers at MIRT think that one reason for this is may be that the&#xD;
      myeloma cells re-grow in the time when participants are not receiving treatment because they&#xD;
      are recovering from high-dose chemotherapy. In this study, participants will receive several&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs previously shown to be effective in myeloma, but in lower doses and in&#xD;
      shorter cycles. It is hoped that by giving the drugs in this way, myeloma cells will not have&#xD;
      time to re-grow between cycles, therefore resulting in longer remissions. This study is being&#xD;
      done in an attempt to improve the remission rate and the survival time for participants with&#xD;
      high-risk myeloma.&#xD;

      -  To find out if giving multi-agent chemotherapy in lower and more frequent doses to make&#xD;
           the timely delivery of chemotherapy cycles possible, will result in better myeloma&#xD;
           responses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To find out if changing the way the drugs are given during the transplant phase will&#xD;
           also result in fewer side effects, while still being effective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To find out if giving treatment between transplants (called &quot;inter-therapy&quot;) will&#xD;
           prevent the myeloma from re-growing between transplants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To find out if long-term maintenance therapy will result in longer remissions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To find out what the effects (good and bad) of this overall treatment will be&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn more about the biology and genetics of multiple myeloma by performing imaging&#xD;
           tests and collecting blood, bone marrow aspirate and biopsies, and biopsies of lesions&#xD;
           seen on MRI or PET scans. Bone marrow aspirates and biopsies are tissue sample collected&#xD;
           from the bone cavity.&#xD;
