  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) is very high in elite swimmers, reaching&#xD;
      80% in certain studies. Repeated Chlorine-derivatives exposure may be a major causative&#xD;
      factor for its development. Asthma diagnosis is generally made on the basis of clinical&#xD;
      characteristics. The demonstration of a variable bronchial obstruction through positive&#xD;
      expiratory flow reversibility to a bronchodilator, spontaneous variations of airway&#xD;
      obstruction or a positive provocation test (methacholine, eucapnic voluntary hyperpnoea…) is&#xD;
      necessary to avoid false diagnosis. Currently asthma treatment in swimmers is the same as in&#xD;
      the general population. A short-acting bronchodilator is often prescribed to avoid occasional&#xD;
      symptoms, combined with an inhaled corticosteroid or an antagonist of Leukotriene if asthma&#xD;
      symptoms are persistent. Previous studies have shown a reduced efficiency for asthma&#xD;
      medication in elite athletes compared with non-athletes. The specific response to different&#xD;
      medications remains to be studied in athletes. The effects of a short-acting bronchodilator&#xD;
      in swimmers with AHR, especially when asymptomatic, on pulmonary function and performance&#xD;
      have not yet been studied. Moreover, the significance of a positive bronchial provocation&#xD;
      test remains to be studied in asymptomatic swimmers with AHR.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that swimmers with a positive bronchial provocation challenge have not&#xD;
      necessarily an exercise-induced bronchoconstriction during swimming and the use of a&#xD;
      bronchodilator will be unnecessary. Chlorine-derivatives exposure may be responsible for a&#xD;
      weakness of the epithelium layer but warm and humid atmosphere of the swimming-pools may be&#xD;
      protective for the development of a bronchoconstriction. Thus we also hypothesis that during&#xD;
      a field test outside the swimming pool, swimmers will develop an exercise-induced asthma, and&#xD;
      will need to take a bronchodilator in prevention.&#xD;
