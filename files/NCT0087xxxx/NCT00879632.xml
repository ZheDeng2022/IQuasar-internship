      There is sound evidence that quetiapine is effective in the treatment of manic and depressive&#xD;
      episodes associated with Bipolar Disorder (BD) (Yatham et al 2006). However, even with the&#xD;
      development of effective new treatment options, not all patients respond to treatments&#xD;
      available. Biological markers have been investigated as predictors of response to treatment&#xD;
      and of remission of symptoms. This would explain in part the individual's differences in the&#xD;
      response to treatment, taking into account the genetic variability plus environmental factors&#xD;
      influencing specific biological markers. A potential biological marker of response to&#xD;
      treatment in BD would be the levels of neurotrophins, as they are, in fact, altered during&#xD;
      acute mood episodes (Cunha et al 2006). Among neurotrophins, the Brain-Derived Neurotrophic&#xD;
      Factor (BDNF) has been repeatedly and consistently reported to be associated with BD&#xD;
      physiopathology (Post 2007). Furthermore, medications that are known to be effective in BD,&#xD;
      like lithium and divalproex, increase BDNF levels.&#xD;

      There is sound evidence that quetiapine is effective in the treatment of manic and depressive&#xD;

      physiopathology (Post 2007). Furthermore, medications that are known to be effective in BD,&#xD;
      like lithium and divalproex, increase BDNF levels. Diverse sources of evidence provide&#xD;
      support to the alteration of BDNF in mood disorders:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with major depressive disorder showed lower levels of BDNF and the treatment&#xD;
           with antidepressants recovered those levels back to normal. (Gonul et al 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Studies with brain tissue (post-mortem) showed that BDNF levels were decreased only on&#xD;
           those who were not on antidepressants. (Karege et al 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The polymorphism of BDNF gene was associated with response to treatment with lithium&#xD;
           during maintenance phase. (Rybakowski et al. 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Our group showed that BDNF levels are decreased during mania and depression, but not&#xD;
           during remission (Cunha et al 2006, Machado-Vieira et al. 2007). Therefore, BDNF appear&#xD;
           to be involved in the mechanisms of acute mood episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment with mood stabilizers, such as lithium and divalproex, increase BDNF levels&#xD;
           (Frey et al. 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prediction of drug treatment response based on variation in genetic make up is a rapidly&#xD;
      growing area. However, few studies examined the association between single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphisms and drug response in bipolar disorder. The design of this study offers a unique&#xD;
      opportunity to examine genetic predictors of drug response. Interestingly, a single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphism at nucleotide196 (G/A) in the human BDNF gene at codon 66 (Val66Met)&#xD;
      have been reported to be associated with a predisposition to BD in family-based studies&#xD;
      (Rybakowski et al 2006, Green et al 2006). In humans, this polymorphism produces a valine -&#xD;
      to - methionine substitution in the proBDNF protein and reduces the trafficking and secretion&#xD;
      of BDNF protein. This is relevant because it has been estimated that 20-30% of the human&#xD;
      population is heterozygous for the Met polymorphism of BDNF. Furthermore, there are&#xD;
      consistent findings in BD regarding the association of Val66Met polymorphism of BDNF gene&#xD;
      with prefrontal cognitive impairment, which was recently confirmed in a large sample of&#xD;
      bipolar subjects (Rybakowski et al 2006). In addition, crosssectional studies showed that the&#xD;
      polymorphism of BDNF gene (Val66Met) was associated with response to lithium prophylaxis, but&#xD;
      findings were not universal (Rybakowski et al 2005, Masui et al 2006). However, there is a&#xD;
      need for prospective studies in order to confirm these findings. It is possible that a single&#xD;
      polymorphism of BDNF gene would have a negative impact of BDNF levels and, consequently, a&#xD;
      negative impact in the response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite consistent evidence of changes in BDNF levels during mood episodes and treatment, one&#xD;
      important aspect remains unknown: Whether the change in BDNF levels is required for treatment&#xD;
      response and whether the magnitude of change happens in portion with the response to&#xD;
      treatment and remission of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis for this project is that those patients who have a good response to treatment&#xD;
      are the same ones who show the greater increase in BDNF levels earlier in the course of&#xD;
      treatment, and who are less likely to present a polymorphism of BDNF gene. Given this&#xD;
      context, we aim to investigate BDNF levels prospectively in patients with BD, before, during&#xD;
      and after the treatment with quetiapine and compare measures with response to treatment, as&#xD;
      indicated by remission in symptoms. We also aim to investigate the polymorphism of BDNF gene&#xD;
      (Val66Met) and its correlation with BDNF serum levels and treatment response.&#xD;
