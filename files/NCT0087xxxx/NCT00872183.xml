      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Techniques that teach finger movements are commonly used to explore how humans learn to&#xD;
           move. Researchers have designed a simple, new method of learning finger movements, which&#xD;
           will be explored for the first time in this study. The method is based on how&#xD;
           individuals mimic other people's movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous studies have shown that a brain protein called brain-derived neurotrophic&#xD;
           factor (BDNF) may be important in movement and in learning. There are normal variations&#xD;
           in the gene for BDNF. As an optional component, this study will also look at whether&#xD;
           these gene variations are associated with differences in movement learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the new motor learning technique with a classic technique to test its&#xD;
           usefulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine whether genetic variations have an effect on motor learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 50, who are right-handed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will involve two visits to the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1: Medical and neurologic examination to determine whether the volunteer is&#xD;
           eligible to participate further in the study. This screening visit will take about 1&#xD;
           hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2: Volunteers will perform a motor learning task by interacting with a computer&#xD;
           program. In response to images on the computer monitor, volunteers will press buttons on&#xD;
           the keyboard as quickly and accurately as possible. The motor learning task will last up&#xD;
           to 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a volunteer agrees to genetic testing, researchers will also draw blood for study.&#xD;
           Genetic testing is not required to participate in the motor learning parts of the study.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Humans develop skilled movements such as using a spoon or dancing a waltz through a process&#xD;
      known as &quot;motor learning. Harnessing this innate process for its therapeutic potential is an&#xD;
      attractive strategy to help patients suffering from diseases of movement disorders, yet we do&#xD;
      not yet fully understand the normal phenomenon. This study will utilize new paradigms to&#xD;
      explore the physiology of motor learning. It will test the validity of a traditional motor&#xD;
      learning task that has been modified to invoke the mirror neuron system and odor&#xD;
      conditioning. Additionally, by taking advantage of the unique opportunity to assess motor&#xD;
      learning awareness immediately following the task, it will also explore this&#xD;
      behavioral-cognitive relationship. Thus, this work will lay the foundation for further&#xD;
      physiologic characterization of a novel motor learning technique and may support the&#xD;
      development of future therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will study up to one hundred fifty-two healthy, right-handed volunteers who are 18 to 50&#xD;
      years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase I of the study, volunteers will be seated in front of a computer monitor with their&#xD;
      right hands on a keyboard and respond to visual cues presented on the monitor by pressing the&#xD;
      associated, finger-specific keys as quickly and accurately as possible. Each volunteer will&#xD;
      be presented only the standard visuospatial or the novel mirror cues, defining the two&#xD;
      reaction time task paradigms and experimental groups. In phases II and III of the study, a&#xD;
      similar task will take place while subjects undergo magnetic resonance imaging scanning&#xD;
      either in the presence or absence of an odor. In addition to the motor learning tasks above,&#xD;
      volunteers will have the option to participate in genetic testing for normal genetic&#xD;
      variability that may affect motor learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes are motor learning and awareness, which will be measured by the&#xD;
      key-press reaction time and accuracy, respectively.&#xD;
