      The objective of the study is to demonstrate the bioequivalence (BE) of alprazolam 1 mg&#xD;
      tablet with Xanax® 1 mg tablet under fed conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a phase I, open, randomised, crossover, single dose pharmacokinetic study&#xD;
      performed in a single centre. The study consists of 2 treatment periods, during which the&#xD;
      study subjects will receive the test product and the reference product in a randomised order.&#xD;
      During both treatment periods, the study subjects will receive 1 mg of alprazolam as a single&#xD;
      oral dose administered after a high-calorie, high-fat meal. Following an overnight fast of at&#xD;
      least 10 hours, the study subjects will eat the standardised meal 30 minutes prior to&#xD;
      administration of the study treatments. Blood samples will be drawn during both treatment&#xD;
      periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study per subject will be approximately 5 weeks and at most 9 weeks&#xD;
      including a screening visit, 2 treatment periods with a wash-out between the study treatment&#xD;
      administrations and a post-treatment period.&#xD;
