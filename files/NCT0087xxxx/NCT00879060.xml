    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic cardiomyopathy and remains the&#xD;
      leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young people and an important cause of heart failure&#xD;
      symptoms and death at any age. In HCM, pathological remodeling of the left ventricle&#xD;
      involving myocardial fibrosis is likely a major contributor to cardiac dysfunction and also a&#xD;
      nidus for the generation of ventricular arrhythmias. Serum markers of collagen turnover have&#xD;
      been shown to reliably reflect the magnitude of myocardial fibrosis in a variety of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases. In addition, aldosterone antagonist drugs have been shown to&#xD;
      decrease fibrous tissue formation in the myocardium in certain pathologic cardiovascular&#xD;
      states in which aldosterone production is increased. In HCM, aldosterone production is&#xD;
      up-regulated and has been implicated in the formation of myocardial fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the specific aims of this proposal are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. assess serum markers of collagen turnover at baseline and correlate these findings with&#xD;
           a variety of clinical and morphologic disease parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. examine the effects of a 12-month treatment with the aldosterone antagonist&#xD;
           spironolactone on magnitude of fibrosis as measured by serum markers of collagen&#xD;
           turnover as well as changes in clinical and morphologic disease parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. explore the effects of a 12-month treatment with aldosterone antagonist spironolactone&#xD;
           on heart failure status, diastolic function, arrhythmic burden, and total LV mass and&#xD;
           quantity of fibrosis by CMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this proposal will offer important insights into the clinical significance of&#xD;
      myocardial fibrosis in this primary genetic cardiomyopathy. The demonstration that&#xD;
      spironolactone decreases fibrosis and improves clinical course would provide the rational for&#xD;
      a larger multicenter clinical trial evaluating this novel therapy for improving clinical&#xD;
      outcome in patients with HCM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited cardiac disease in the general&#xD;
      population. Myocardial fibrosis has become a prominent and clinically relevant&#xD;
      pathophysiologic component of this complex genetic disease, related to the risk for both&#xD;
      sudden death and heart failure. For example, left ventricular replacement fibrosis and&#xD;
      scarring has been implicated in triggering life threatening ventricular&#xD;
      tachycardia/fibrillation and most recently has become a novel risk marker for sudden death,&#xD;
      based on in vivo demonstration of extensive late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with&#xD;
      cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Extensive LGE identifies patients who benefit from&#xD;
      primary prevention of sudden death with the implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD), or&#xD;
      who evolve to the end-stage of this disease with systolic dysfunction and consideration for&#xD;
      heart transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mineralocorticoid aldosterone has been shown to be a mediator of myocardial fibrosis, and&#xD;
      blockade with spironolactone normalizes collagen content in HCM murine models. In addition,&#xD;
      aldosterone antagonists have favorable clinical effects in patients with a variety of&#xD;
      diseases associated with myocardial scarring such as congestive heart failure, systemic&#xD;
      hypertension, and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. However, it is uncertain whether&#xD;
      spironolactone would have similar effects on the clinical and phenotypic expression of a&#xD;
      genetic disease such as HCM. Therefore, we investigated whether mineralocorticoid receptor&#xD;
      blockade with spironolactone would reduce measures reflecting myocardial fibrosis, producing&#xD;
      favorable LV remodeling and ultimately leading to positive clinical effects for patients with&#xD;
      HCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general aim of this study is to explore the role of fibrosis in HCM by testing the&#xD;
      hypothesis that: the presence of magnitude of myocardial fibrosis bears clinical relevance&#xD;
      for patients with HCM, and that mineralocorticoid receptor blockade will reduce myocardial&#xD;
      fibrosis and thereby alter the natural history of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design: prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in a&#xD;
      consecutive HCM population at a single clinical center (Tufts Medical Center HCM&#xD;
      Institution).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures: HCM patients were recruited from Tufts Medical Center HCM Institution&#xD;
      population from November 2007 to June 2009. Enrolled patients were randomized into two arms;&#xD;
      treatment arm received 25mg at the start of study and then increased to target dose of 50mg&#xD;
      if serum potassium was &lt;5.5mmol/L and serum creatinine-baseline creatinine was &lt;0.5mg/dl.&#xD;
      This arm was then followed for 12 months. The control arm of the study received 25mg of&#xD;
      placebo over 12 months. There was an additional control arm of age and gender-matched&#xD;
      controls without HCM in the control arm to evaluate the serum markers of collagen turnover at&#xD;
      baseline. These controls had a one time blood draw of 15mL (3 teaspoons) to assess serum&#xD;
      biomarkers of interest and were not be followed for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome: examine the effects of a 12-month treatment with the aldosterone antagonist&#xD;
      spironolactone on magnitude of fibrosis as measured by serum markers of collagen turnover as&#xD;
      well as changes in clinical and morphologic disease parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes: explore the effects of a 12-month treatment with aldosterone antagonist&#xD;
      spironolactone on heart failure status, diastolic function, arrhythmic burden, and total LV&#xD;
      mass and quantity of fibrosis by CMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome: assess serum markers of collagen turnover at baseline and correlate these&#xD;
      findings with a variety of clinical and morphologic disease parameters&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>Subjects diagnosed with HCM, between the ages of 18-55 (male or female), who are not pregnant were recruited from the Tufts Medical Center Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Center. The last patient completed the study in August of 2012.</recruitment_details>

          <title>Spironolactone</title>
          <description>Experimental group includes individuals diagnosed with HCM between the ages of 18-55 (up to 50 for men). At time of randomization subjects randomized to experimental group will be initiated on 25mg of spironolactone. Serum potassium and creatinine levels will be drawn at baseline, weeks 1,4,5 and months 3,6,9, and 12. If at week 4, serum potassium is &lt;5.5 mmol/L and serum creatinine-baseline creatinine is &lt;0.5 mg/dl, the study drug will be increased to the target dose of 50mg once daily for 12 months of follow-up. If a subject experiences an increase in serum potassium or creatinine above these parameters at week 4, the study drug will be decreased in half from current dosage. If on 25mg daily, subject will be instructed to decrease to 25mg every other day. Subjects who experience hyperkalemia or increased creatinine levels on 25mg every other day will have the drug discontinued.</description>
