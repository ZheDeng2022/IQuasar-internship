  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the efficacy and safety of baclofen for alcohol dependence. 80 outpatient&#xD;
      subjects with DSM-IV alcohol dependence will be randomized to 10 mg three times a day (tid)&#xD;
      baclofen or tid placebo. An effort will be made to recruit 40 men and 40 women. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive BRENDA counseling over the 12 weeks of the trial. The Timeline Followback (TLFB)&#xD;
      method will be used to assess drinking patterns. The primary outcome is % heavy drinking&#xD;
      during the trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will explore the efficacy and tolerability of a 12-week regimen of 10 mg t.i.d.&#xD;
      baclofen vs. placebo in conjunction with behavioral therapy for reducing heavy drinking in 80&#xD;
      alcohol dependent individuals. Prior studies (Addolorato et al. 2000, 2002; Flannery et al.,&#xD;
      2004) have found that baclofen reduces self-reported anxiety and craving; therefore, the&#xD;
      proposed study also will assess baclofen's ability to reduce symptoms of these affective&#xD;
      states. Furthermore, in our pilot study (Flannery et al, 2004), women appeared to respond&#xD;
      more consistently than men, and therefore the study will also be balanced by gender.&#xD;
