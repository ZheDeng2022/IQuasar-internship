      The goal of this clinical research study is find the highest tolerable dose of BMTP-11 when&#xD;
      given to patients with prostate cancer that has spread. The safety of this drug will also be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMTP-11 is designed to use a protein to bind to cancer cells, move into the cancer cells, and&#xD;
      cause the cancer cells to die. This is the first study using BMTP-11 in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of BMTP-11 based on when you joined this study. Up to 2 dose levels of BMTP-11 will be&#xD;
      tested. Three (3) participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of&#xD;
      participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose&#xD;
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until&#xD;
      the highest tolerable dose of BMTP-11 is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle, you will receive BMTP-11 though a needle into your&#xD;
      vein over 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each dose of BMTP-11, you will receive saline (salt water) by vein for over 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 7 and 14 of Cycles 1 and 2, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs, height, and&#xD;
           weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have experienced any side&#xD;
           effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests. A portion of this blood&#xD;
           will also be used to check your heart health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected over 24 hours to test your kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 21 of Cycles 1 and 2, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs, height, and&#xD;
           weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have experienced any side&#xD;
           effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests. A portion of this blood&#xD;
           will also be used to check your heart health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to measure your prostatic specific antigen (PSA)&#xD;
           and testosterone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected over 24 hours to test your kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 2, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs, height, and&#xD;
           weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have experienced any side&#xD;
           effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests. A portion of this blood&#xD;
           will also be used to check your heart health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to measure your PSA and testosterone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be on active study for up to 9 weeks. You will be taken off study if you experience&#xD;
      intolerable side effects or the disease gets worse. Please note that even if the treatment&#xD;
      has a beneficial effect on the cancer, the treatment cannot be continued for more than two&#xD;
      cycles due to the very limited supply of drug available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 4 and 6 weeks after the last dose of study drug, you will have an end-of-study visit.&#xD;
      At this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs, height, and&#xD;
           weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have experienced any side&#xD;
           effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. This routine&#xD;
           blood draw will include measurement of your PSA and testosterone levels. A part of this&#xD;
           blood will also be used to see if your immune system reacted to BMTP-11 by forming an&#xD;
           antibody and to assess your heart's health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for 24 hours to test for protein in your urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have CT or MRI scans of your abdomen and pelvis to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3, 6, and 9 months after the last dose of study drug, you will be called or e-mailed and&#xD;
      asked how you are doing. This will only take a few minutes. You will be required to have&#xD;
      blood drawn (about 1 teaspoon) for routine testing. This can be done at your local doctor's&#xD;
      office and results faxed to MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. BMTP-11 is not FDA approved or commercially available. At&#xD;
      this time, BMTP-11 is only being used in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 22 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
