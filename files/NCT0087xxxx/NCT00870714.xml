  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients with high-risk prostate cancer who are scheduled to undergo radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy will receive four cycles of therapy with ketoconazole and docetaxel prior to&#xD;
      surgery resection. A cycle of therapy is defined as 21 days (three weeks). Pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      analysis will be performed with the first and second cycle of therapy. All patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated for toxicity, tumor response, and recurrence.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must meet at least one of the following high risk criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PSA &gt; 20&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Gleason score 8 or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Presence of pathological Gleason grade 4 or higher as the majority sum on biopsy&#xD;
                  core&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Greater than 50% of cores at time of biopsy positive for cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinical Stage T3 Disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must have PS of 0-1(ECOG) and medically deemed a surgical candidate for&#xD;
                  radical prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Age &gt; or = to 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with a pre-existing peripheral neuropathy of equal to or greater than&#xD;
                  grade two are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum Creatinine must be &lt; or equal to 2.0mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must currently not receiving any drug which is metabolized by cytochrome&#xD;
                  P450-3A4 including the statins, cyclosporin, terfenadine and erythromycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior to receiving any dose of docetaxel, patients should have absolute&#xD;
                  neutrophil counts &gt; 1,500, hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 g/dl and platelet counts &gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patients with bilirubin elevated above institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;

                  alkaline phosphatase may be up to 5 x ULN if transaminases are &lt; ULN. However,&#xD;
                  patients who have both transaminase elevation &gt; 1.5 x ULN and alkaline&#xD;
                  phosphatase &gt; 2.5 x ULN are not eligible for this study (due to decrease&#xD;
                  clearance of docetaxel and increased risk of toxicity).&#xD;

                  drugs formulated with polysorbate 80 are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  All patients must sign informed consent.&#xD;
