      1. BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pneumonia occurring outside of the hospital setting is regarded as community acquired&#xD;
           pneumonia. However, pneumonia occurring in non-hospital long-term care facilities&#xD;
           constituted a distinct type of pneumonia from CAP. Kollef et al has justified health&#xD;
           care associated pneumonia (HCAP) as a new category of pneumonia [1]. The HCAP patients&#xD;
           are associated with severe disease, higher mortality rate, and greater length of stay&#xD;
           and increased cost [1]. HCAP are often at risk for multi-drug resistant bacterial&#xD;
           pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Klebsiella&#xD;
           pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
           Health care facilities have not been defined in Taiwan. Respiratory care ward (RCW) is a&#xD;
           special unit to take care long-term ventilatory dependent patients in Taiwan. Some of&#xD;
           the patients get pneumonia and are referred back to medical centers. Besides,&#xD;
           community-acquired P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii or MRSA have been reported&#xD;
           [3-8]. Therefore, the core-organisms of HCAP in Taiwan might be multi-drug resistant and&#xD;
           the causes of inadequate initial antibiotics treatment. The common pathogens were also&#xD;
           unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Till now, there are no data about the pathogens of HCAP in Taiwan. We define the&#xD;
           health-care facilities and initiate a retrospective study to characterize the&#xD;
           microbiology and clinical outcome of Community acquired pneumonia and&#xD;
           Health-Care-Associated pneumonia in Taiwan. Further analysis will perform to confirm the&#xD;
           differences between CAP an HCAP in Taiwan.&#xD;

&#xD;
      All parameters required for the calculation of PSI (Pneumonia Severity Index, appendix) at&#xD;
      baseline will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of appropriateness of Empirical therapy Empirical antibiotic therapy is defined as&#xD;
      antibiotic given during the first 48 hours for pneumonia. The appropriateness of antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy will be analyzed only for cases with causative organism (probably and definite&#xD;
      organisms) identified. Inadequacy therapy is defined as administration of an antibiotic to&#xD;
      which the isolated pathogen was resistant according to the subsequent antimicrobial&#xD;
      susceptibility results or the absence of antimicrobial agents to cover the identified&#xD;
      pathogen(s). In addition, patients with aspiration pneumonia (Aspiration pneumonia are&#xD;
      defined as witnessed aspiration pneumonia and food or material noted in the upper or lower&#xD;
      airways) who had not received agents with anti-anaerobic coverage will be considered&#xD;
      inappropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of Treatment outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to collecting microbiological response, clinical response data will be used for&#xD;
      all patients. Success/favorable clinical response will be defined as all or most of&#xD;
      pretreatment signs and symptoms of the index infection have resolved or improved (e.g.: TPR&#xD;
      shift toward normal) and no additional antibiotic therapy or switching of regimen was&#xD;
      required. While failure will be defined as no apparent response to therapy; persistence or&#xD;
      progression of most/all pre-therapy signs and symptoms and additional antibiotic therapy or&#xD;
      switching of regimen was documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases will be classified as &quot;Indeterminate&quot; when no sufficient data is available to permit&#xD;
      evaluation of microbiological or clinical outcome or patient's underlying medical condition&#xD;
      is too complicated to precluded classification as a success or failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and analysis plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from all sites will be pooled and combined. Statistical analyses will be conducted with&#xD;
      the use of SAS software, version 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Data will also be&#xD;
      presented as mean +/-SD for continuous variables and proportions for categories variables.&#xD;
      The patient demographics and baseline characteristics will be tabulated. The distribution of&#xD;
      comorbidities, disease severity, causative organisms, clinical condition and outcomes will be&#xD;
      summarized and analyzed. To detect the significant differences between groups, Chi-square&#xD;
      tests or Fisher exact test for categorical variables, and the two-tailed t test or&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables will be employed, when appropriate. Statistical&#xD;
      significance will be established at alpha =0.05. Reported P values will be two-sided.&#xD;
