  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking increases CVD risk and worsens insulin resistance, but also contributes to&#xD;
      weight loss; smoking cessation reduces CVD risk and improves insulin sensitivity, but also&#xD;
      contributes to weight gain. The mechanisms that underlie these metabolic changes of cigarette&#xD;
      smoking and smoking cessation on insulin resistance, body composition, and fat distribution&#xD;
      are poorly understood.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, open cohort study of smokers who undergo a smoking cessation&#xD;
      program, and who subsequently may or may not resume smoking spontaneously. Eligible subjects&#xD;
      will be characterized at baseline with respect to their metabolic and CVD risk profiles, body&#xD;
      fat composition and distribution. Subjects will then undergo an intensive 8-week smoking&#xD;
      cessation program using bupropion plus cognitive behavioral counseling. Those who&#xD;
      successfully abstain will be reassessed. Since most individuals who quit smoking will&#xD;
      naturally resume smoking again over time, subjects will be assessed again after an additional&#xD;
      4 months of follow-up when a subset of subjects will be expected to have naturally resumed&#xD;
      smoking.&#xD;
