  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I, dose-escalation study using a 3 + 3 design to assess the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of orally administered GDC-0941 administered QD.&#xD;
      This study will include patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, NHL, or&#xD;
      multiple myeloma (MM) (expansion stage only) for which standard therapy either does not exist&#xD;
      or has proven ineffective or intolerable.&#xD;
