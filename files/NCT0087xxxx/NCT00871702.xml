      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if there is significant toxicity associated with the administration of&#xD;
           CD34-TK75 transduced donor lymphocytes after allogeneic BMT for relapsed hematologic&#xD;
           malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if the patient develops any evidence of anti-leukemic effect from the&#xD;
           administration of CD34-TK75 transduced donor lymphocytes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if ganciclovir administration to patients who develop Graft versus Host&#xD;
           Disease (GVHD)results in clinical improvement after infusions of CD34-TK75 transduced&#xD;
           lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-Study Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose is to perform PET imaging of CD34-TK transduced allogeneic donor T cells&#xD;
      in patients who have relapsed hematologic malignancies after allogeneic hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation (SCT). At this time the limited amount of cGMP quality virus produced by&#xD;
      the NGVL will likely permit the imaging of only 3 patients. Consequently our current&#xD;
      objective will be to establish that the TK-expressing cells can be detected by 18FHBG-PET in&#xD;
      patient organs relevant for performing additional studies that are currently in the planning&#xD;
      stages and for which we are working to produce additional virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate objective will be to use the TK substrate 18FHBG to locate the donor T cells&#xD;
      within the recipient as they exert anti-leukemic effects, and the T cells can then be&#xD;
      eliminated in response to in vivo administration of ganciclovir, before morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality from GvHD occurs. We will use the imaging strategy to define patterns of T cell&#xD;
      trafficking in humans pre and post-DLI infusion, and to determine where the cells reside&#xD;
      while they mediate GVL in contrast to GvHD. We expect to obtain in vivo PET imaging markers&#xD;
      predictive of GvHD before clinical symptoms occur.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of to determine the safety of the administration of lymphocytes,&#xD;
      collected from the bone marrow donor. Donor lymphocytes are often administered in the case of&#xD;
      a relapsed cancer after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, in the hope to reduce the&#xD;
      amount or size of the relapsed cancer. In this study, we will look for a decrease of the size&#xD;
      of the relapsed cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By inserting genetic material (DNA) into the cells (lymphocytes) collected from the donor,&#xD;
      these cells will be genetically modified and made very sensitive to the killing effects of a&#xD;
      drug called ganciclovir, routinely used in the clinic after bone marrow transplantation to&#xD;
      treat virus infections in transplant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is to determine, if administration of the drug ganciclovir to the&#xD;
      recipient, after intravenous infusion of the genetically modified cells (lymphocytes) into&#xD;
      the recipient, will reduce or even eliminate a life threatening complication of allogeneic&#xD;
      transplantation, called graft versus host disease (GvHD). The drug ganciclovir will kill the&#xD;
      infused genetically modified donor cells (lymphocytes) so they cannot cause GvHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the overall purpose of this research study is to determine, if administration of&#xD;
      a seven day course of the drug ganciclovir to the donor lymphocyte recipient will either&#xD;
      decrease the severity of GvHD, or will decrease the number of cases with life-threatening&#xD;
      GvHD after donor lymphocyte infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also determine if insertion of a small piece of DNA (a small piece of genetic&#xD;
      material), makes these donor lymphocytes opened up and sensitive to the killing effects of&#xD;
      the drug ganciclovir, but at the same time does not harm the lymphocytes' ability to reduce&#xD;
      the amount or size of the cancer in the recipient. The DNA to be inserted into the donor&#xD;
      lymphocytes is transported into these cells by a type of virus called &quot;retrovirus vector&quot;.&#xD;
      This retrovirus vector is made so the virus cannot divide (cannot make more of itself), and&#xD;
      cannot make cells or the recipient sick. Retroviruses do, however, allow for the gene (DNA)&#xD;
      they are carrying, to be permanently inserted into the genetic material of the donor&#xD;
      lymphocytes. Therefore, this inserted DNA will persist in the donor lymphocytes for the life&#xD;
      of the lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, this study will also determine if the administration of genetically manipulated&#xD;
      donor lymphocytes is well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this subproject is to see if an imaging procedure called 18FHBG-PET/CT can help&#xD;
      us see if the lymphocytes you received have gone to the sites in the body where the&#xD;
      anti-cancer effects are taking place.&#xD;
