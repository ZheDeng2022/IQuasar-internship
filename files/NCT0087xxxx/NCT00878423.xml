  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AT13387/0001 is a dose-finding study of an experimental anticancer agent. In accordance with&#xD;
      the protocol increasing doses of AT13387 are given to patients with advanced cancer who do&#xD;
      not have alternative treatment options. The preferred dose of AT13387 will be identified&#xD;
      according to the side effects experienced at different dose levels.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increasing doses of AT13387 will be administered to groups of 3 to 6 patients at each dose&#xD;
      level. The pharmacokinetic profile of AT13387 following a one hour intravenous infusion will&#xD;
      be determined and the effect of AT13387 on predefined biomarkers in blood plasma and&#xD;
      circulating white blood cells will be established. Patients will be closely monitored for the&#xD;
      development of side effects which would preclude further dose escalation.&#xD;

    <description>Two dosing schedules will be evaluated; twice or once weekly dosing, on three weeks out of four. The starting dose for the once weekly schedule was 10mg/m2/dose, given as one hour intravenous (IV) infusions on Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15 and 18 of a twenty-eight day cycle. The starting dose for the twice weekly schedule, given as one hour intravenous (IV) infusions on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a twenty-eight day cycle, will be 150mg/m2/dose</description>

&#xD;
          -  Histological or cytological evidence of a metastatic solid tumor including lymphoma,&#xD;
             which is refractory to standard therapy. The following tumor types are of particular&#xD;
             interest as they may be more likely to respond to HSP90 inhibition and all efforts&#xD;
             should be made to recruit patients into the study with these diagnoses. Only patients&#xD;
             with these diagnoses and others thought to be responsive to HSP90 inhibitors are to be&#xD;
             enrolled following the identification of MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Metastatic breast cancer which is HER2 positive either by FISH or 3+&#xD;
                  immunohistochemistry staining,&#xD;

                  depletion,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Be pregnant or lactating (women of childbearing potential must have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 7 days prior to enrolment). Male and female patients of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must use appropriate birth control (barrier methods, oral&#xD;
             contraceptives and/or intrauterine devices) during the entire duration of the study,&#xD;
             or the patient must be surgically sterile (with documentation in the patient's medical&#xD;

             aminotransferase (AST) or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≥ 2.5 times the ULRR (unless due&#xD;
             to the presence of liver metastases when ALT and/or AST may be up to five times the&#xD;
             upper limits of reference range). Patients with an isolated increase in ALP ≤ 5 times&#xD;
             ULRR in the absence of liver metastases but with known bone metastases are eligible&#xD;
