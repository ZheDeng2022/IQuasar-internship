  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of capecitabine in&#xD;
      patients who have undergone a total gastrectomy.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the pharmacokinetics (PK) of capecitabine in patients who have undergone a&#xD;
           total gastrectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the pharmacokinetic profile of capecitabine administered to patients with&#xD;
           gastric cancer pre- and post-gastrectomy and to compare this to historical data of&#xD;
           capecitabine PK values in patients with other cancer types.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To ensure equivalent capecitabine exposure when compared to PK data from the same&#xD;
           patients prior to gastrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a clinical trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of capecitabine in patients&#xD;
      who have undergone a total gastrectomy. The study also aims to establish the toxicity profile&#xD;
      of capecitabine in these patients, to identify any dose limiting toxicities (DLT), and to&#xD;
      ensure equivalent capecitabine exposure when compared to PK data from the same patients prior&#xD;
      to gastrectomy. Screening tests will consist of demographic details, complete medical&#xD;
      history, physical exam, vital signs, tumour serum markers, haematology and biochemistry&#xD;
      tests. There will also be an ECG, chest X-Ray or CT thorax, CT abdomen and a serum or urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential). Haematology and Biochemistry will be&#xD;
      repeated prior to each study drug administration. All patients will receive 6 cycles of oral&#xD;
      capecitabine chemotherapy at a dose of 625 mg/m2, administered twice daily at 12 hourly&#xD;
      intervals for 21 consecutive days. Total proposed duration of therapy is 3 cycles&#xD;
      pre-operatively and 3 cycles post-operatively. Capecitabine and its metabolites (DFCR, DFUR&#xD;
      and 5-FU) plasma levels will be measured during the 1st and 4th cycles in all patients.&#xD;
      Treatment should continue for 6 cycles unless there is evidence of disease progression, or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
