      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tissue in the laboratory from women receiving&#xD;
      doxorubicin and trastuzumab for breast cancer may help doctors learn more about changes that&#xD;
      occur in DNA and identify biomarkers for increased risk of cardiac effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying side effects involving the heart in women with&#xD;
      breast cancer receiving doxorubicin and trastuzumab.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if polymorphisms in genes (e.g., CYBA, RAC2, NCF4, MRP1, MRP2, GTSP and&#xD;
           CBR3) in women with breast cancer treated with doxorubicin hydrochloride increase the&#xD;
           relative risk of developing ≥ NCI grade 1 cardiotoxicity. (Primary study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether pre-treatment levels of biomarkers (e.g., neuregulin, IGF-1,&#xD;
           cardiotrophin-1, IL-6, VEGF, hepatocyte growth factor, and heparin binding EGF) in these&#xD;
           patients, correlate with relative risk of developing ≥ NCI grade 1 cardiotoxicity to&#xD;
           this regimen. (Primary study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether decreased heart rate variability and increased plasma levels of&#xD;
           norepinephrine at 3 weeks after completion of this regimen correlate with relative risk&#xD;
           of developing ≥ NCI grade 1 cardiotoxicity in these patients. (Primary study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether decrease in endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) number at 3 weeks&#xD;
           after completion of this regimen can be detected, and if so whether decreased EPC number&#xD;
           correlates with ≥ NCI grade 1 cardiotoxicity. (Primary study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether baseline physical fitness level of these patients, assessed by a&#xD;
           questionnaire and 6 minute walk distance, correlates with relative risk of developing ≥&#xD;
           NCI grade 1 cardiotoxicity to this regimen. (Primary study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether activity level of these patients during treatment, assessed by&#xD;
           questionnaire, correlates with relative risk of developing ≥ NCI grade 1 cardiotoxicity&#xD;
           to this regimen. (Primary study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether drop in functional capacity of these patients, measured by 6 minute&#xD;
           walk distance at the end of treatment with this regimen, correlates with ≥ NCI grade 1&#xD;
           cardiotoxicity. (Primary study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether MRI can detect changes in diastolic heart function in these&#xD;
           patients 48 hours after administration of this regimen. (Sub-study A)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if a greater decrease in diastolic dysfunction in these patients at 48&#xD;
           hours is predictive of greater decrease in systolic function at 3 weeks after treatment&#xD;
           with this regimen. (Sub-study A)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether levels of certain biomarkers of cardiac myocyte damage, B-type&#xD;
           natriuretic peptide and the sarcomere protein troponin T at 48 hours after the initial&#xD;
           exposure to these drugs correlate with relative risk of developing ≥ NCI grade1&#xD;
           cardiotoxicity. (Sub-study A)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether trastuzumab given concurrently with doxorubicin hydrochloride&#xD;
           decreases heart rate variability and increases plasma levels of norepinephrine in these&#xD;
           patients, and if so, whether these changes correlate with relative risk of developing&#xD;
           NCI grade ≥ 1 cardiotoxicity. (Sub-study B)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether EPC number obtained from patients treated with trastuzumab have&#xD;
           decreased migration into microvascular structures in an ex vivo assay and whether these&#xD;
           changes correlate with ≥ NCI grade 1 cardiotoxicity. (Sub-study B)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether levels of certain biomarkers in these patients , including&#xD;
           neuregulin, IGF-1, cardiotrophin-1, IL-6, VEGF, hepatocyte growth factor and heparin&#xD;
           binding EGF, change after exposure to trastuzumab. (Sub-study B)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary study: Patients make an initial visit (before beginning doxorubicin&#xD;
           hydrochloride treatment) and a visit 3 weeks after the 4th course of doxorubicin&#xD;
           hydrochloride (approximately 12 weeks after the initial visit). During these visits,&#xD;
           blood samples are also collected for measuring serum levels of neuregulin-1, IGF-1,&#xD;
           cardiotropin-1, IL-6, VEGF, hepatocyte growth factor, and plasma norepinephrine and&#xD;
           endothelial progenitor cells (EPC). Heart-rate variability (HRV) is measured and, if&#xD;
           necessary, a transthoracic echocardiogram is performed. Patients complete baseline&#xD;
           health and activity level questionnaire and suitable patients complete a 6-minute walk&#xD;
           test. Patients undergo blood collection for genotype analysis for single nucleotide&#xD;
           polymorphism sites during the initial visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete a questionnaire assessing physical activity at the beginning of the 2nd,&#xD;
      3rd, and 4th courses of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sub-study A (MRI)*: In addition to the assessments performed in the primary study,&#xD;
           patients undergo some extra tests. During initial visit, patients have an additional&#xD;
           blood sample collected during initial visit for measurement of B-type natriuretic&#xD;
           peptide (BNP) and troponin T and undergo cardiac MRI. Approximately 48 hours after the&#xD;
           first dose of doxorubicin hydrochloride, patients undergo an additional visit, during&#xD;
           which blood samples are collected for BNP and troponin T and an cardiac MRI is&#xD;
           performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Patients who enroll in sub-study A must also be enrolled in the primary study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sub-study B (trastuzumab)*: In addition to the assessments performed in the primary&#xD;
           study, patients undergo some extra tests. Patients undergo an additional visit after the&#xD;
           third treatment of trastuzumab (approximately 6 months after the first dose of&#xD;
           doxorubicin hydrochloride), during which patients have blood samples collected and&#xD;
           analyzed as in Primary study visit 2. HRV is measured and, if necessary, a transthoracic&#xD;
           echocardiogram is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Patients who enroll in sub-study B must also be enrolled in the primary study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years .&#xD;
