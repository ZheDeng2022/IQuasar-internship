  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TBS) is a type of repetitive transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) method that reduces the excitability of a small region of brain&#xD;
      for less than one hour. Since dystonia and spasticity may be associated with increased&#xD;
      excitability of motor cortex, we expect that by reducing the excitability of motor cortex&#xD;
      with TBS we will temporarily improve these symptoms and hopefully open avenues in the future&#xD;
      for the use of TBS as a new, non-invasive therapeutic intervention to aid in physical therapy&#xD;
      and symptom amelioration of dystonia and spasticity. We will test for motor improvement&#xD;
      during the hour immediately following TBS using tests of muscle function and quality of limb&#xD;
      movement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Testing will occur at three identical visits, with escalating stimulation intensity at each&#xD;
      visit. Initial screening will be performed by telephone or in clinic and final screening will&#xD;
      be performed and informed consent will be signed at the start of the first study visit.&#xD;
      Initial set-up and calibration of the magnetic stimulation device will require 10-20 minutes.&#xD;
      Theta-burst stimulation requires 40 seconds. Hand and arm function will be tested immediately&#xD;
      before and during the one hour following the TBS. Therefore, each visit should occupy 90-120&#xD;
      minutes. Each visit will be at least 2 days after the previous visit and a telephone call&#xD;
      will be placed one week after the third visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing of limb function will be performed according to standard clinical rating scales,&#xD;
      including the modified Ashworth spasticity scale and the Barry-Albright Dystonia rating&#xD;
      scale. Electrophysiological testing of hand function will involve moving finger muscles&#xD;
      against resistance while surface electromyographic signals (EMG) are monitored for the&#xD;
      ability to activate one finger at a time while minimizing muscle co-contraction and overflow.&#xD;
      Testing of arm function will involve measurement of the ability to relax the biceps and&#xD;
      triceps and the resistance of the elbow to passive movement by the examiner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing of cortical function will occur both before and after theta-burst stimulation, and&#xD;
      will involve a standard protocol using suprathreshold single and paired-pulse magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation with measurement of the induced motor evoked potential (MEP) in the hand and arm&#xD;
      muscles. The resting MEP threshold and input-output curve will be measured for the first&#xD;
      dorsal interosseus muscle. Paired-pulse inhibition of the MEP will be tested using a&#xD;
      subthreshold pulse (80% of resting motor threshold) followed by a suprathreshold pulse at&#xD;
      2.5msec interval. Paired-pulse facilitation will be tested using a 12msec interval. Silent&#xD;
      period duration in response to a pulse at 120% of resting motor threshold will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theta-burst stimulation will be performed according to the standard protocols developed by&#xD;
      Rothwell and co-workers with NIH and European consortium safety guidelines stringently&#xD;
      enforced. Active motor threshold and resting motor threshold will be determined by&#xD;
      single-pulse stimulation while monitoring electromyographic (EMG) activity at the first&#xD;
      dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscle according to standard published protocols using commercially&#xD;
      available surface EMG electrodes (DelSys Inc.). Stimulation will be performed using the&#xD;
      commercially-available Magstim Rapid 2 (Magstim, Inc., Wales UK) with a standard figure-eight&#xD;
      coil held by a member of the research team. Biphasic stimulation pulses will be given&#xD;
      according to the standard included driver software. Single pulse, paired pulse, and&#xD;
      theta-burst rapid stimulation protocols are directly available through standard user options&#xD;
      on this device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Threshold determination and stimulation location will be performed using each subject's most&#xD;
      affected hand, or the non-dominant hand if both hands are affected. The location of lowest&#xD;
      threshold for stimulation of the FDI will be determined by gradual movement of the&#xD;
      stimulation coil over the surface of the contralateral scalp, in the region of the standard&#xD;
      &quot;C3&quot; or &quot;C4&quot; electrode position (determined by international 10-20 EEG electrode placement&#xD;
      convention). The handle of the stimulation coil will be pointed backward and 45 degrees from&#xD;
      the sagittal plane so as to be approximately perpendicular to the rolandic fissure. The&#xD;
      location of minimum threshold will be marked with a washable non-permanent marker on the&#xD;
      subject's scalp in order to ensure consistency of stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For assessment of active motor threshold, subjects will be asked to contract the FDI muscle&#xD;
      against resistance while being given biofeedback to maintain average integrated EMG at 20% of&#xD;
      maximal voluntary isometric EMG. For assessment of resting motor threshold, EMG of the FDI&#xD;
      must be less than 5% of maximal prior to stimulation. Single-pulses at increasing intensity&#xD;
      will be used to determine the intensity at which 5 out of 10 pulses evoke an EMG response&#xD;
      greater than 200mV (active threshold) or 50mV (resting threshold) above baseline. (Active&#xD;
      motor threshold is virtually always less than the resting motor threshold. If this is not the&#xD;
      case in a subject, then stimulation will be adjusted so that intensity never exceeds 80% of&#xD;
      the resting motor threshold.) Thresholds will be assessed both before and after theta-burst&#xD;
      stimulation, and these thresholds will be used for the cortical excitability testing as&#xD;
      described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulation intensity for theta burst will be set at 60% active motor threshold (visit 1),&#xD;
      80% active motor threshold (visit 2), and 80% resting motor threshold (visit 3). All&#xD;
      stimulation is subthreshold, and thus not expected to produce muscle activity. To ensure this&#xD;
      is the case, muscle activity will be continuously monitored from the FDI and stimulation will&#xD;
      be aborted if any muscle activity during the TBS is detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Set-up of theta-burst stimulation will involve the same Magstim Rapid 2 device in which the&#xD;
      handle of the stimulation coil (same standard figure-eight coil) will be pointed backward and&#xD;
      45 degrees from the sagittal plane so as to be approximately perpendicular to the rolandic&#xD;
      fissure. We will use a continuous (cTBS) pattern of delivery for magnetic stimulation and&#xD;
      pulses will occur in sets of three at 20msec intervals (50hz burst rate), with each burst of&#xD;
      three pulses separated by 200msec (5hz inter-burst rate). Thus there are 15 pulses per&#xD;
      second, divided into 5 bursts of three pulses. Each burst of three pulses will be the same.&#xD;
      Stimulation will continue for 40 seconds, for a total of 600 pulses. The subject will be&#xD;
      instructed to maintain all muscles relaxed, and relaxation relevant to stimulation will be&#xD;
      monitored using EMG of the FDI muscle. After the initial TBS treatment, single and&#xD;
      paired-pulse magnetic stimulation will be performed again to test cortical function and MEP&#xD;
      threshold. These pulses will be applied in the same manner as before TBS treatment (described&#xD;
      in previous paragraph).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stimulation pulses can produce a loud clicking noise, and subjects will be provided with&#xD;
      earplugs or sound isolating ear cuffs if the sound intensity becomes uncomfortable or exceeds&#xD;
      normal speech volume.&#xD;
