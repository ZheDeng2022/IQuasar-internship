  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase II, multicenter study. Eligible patients will receive CP-751,871&#xD;
      in monotherapy (20 mg/kg IV infusion on Day 1 of 3-week cycles). Tumor check-up will be&#xD;
      performed every 6-8 weeks. Treatment will be continued until disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicities according to the patient or the investigator.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CP-751,871 will be administered as an open-label intravenous solution. All patients will be&#xD;
      treated every 3 weeks until disease progression(by RECIST criteria) or unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
      death or discontinuation from the study for any other reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since, head and neck tumors are easily accessible for iterative biopsy, this study will offer&#xD;
      the opportunity to get tumor biopsies before and after CP-751,871. Our study will allow&#xD;
      translational research with biopsies at crucial timing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) at baseline before any treatment, (ii) during the treatment with CP-751,871 (day 1,&#xD;
      second cycle two hours after the injection of CP-751,871).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) for patients with stable disease or partial response, a new biopsy will be performed at&#xD;
      the time of disease progression to try to understand the mechanisms of tumor resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline samples will allow an investigation of molecular profiles that reflect an&#xD;
      inherent inter-patient variability and which will be predictive of response. Although the&#xD;
      number of patients included is low, these data may contribute to understand the mechanisms of&#xD;
      response and non-response to CP-751,871. Understanding the mechanisms of response to&#xD;
      CP-751,871 will help in the rational design of further clinical trials in head and neck&#xD;
      cancer using CP-751,871.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The on-treatment samples will help to dynamically monitor the molecular response to&#xD;
      CP-751,871.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of involved pathways before and after administration of CP-751,871 could be&#xD;
      performed using IHC, DNA sequence analysis and RNA expression profiling. Plasma samples could&#xD;
      be also stored for further analysis.&#xD;
