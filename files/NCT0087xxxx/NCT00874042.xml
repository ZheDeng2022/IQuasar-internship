    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation/de-escalation study of ARQ 197 administered orally in&#xD;
      combination with gemcitabine. The study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ARQ 197 when administered&#xD;
      in combination with gemcitabine to patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrollment of an initial cohort of 3 or 6 patients will follow the traditional &quot;3 + 3&quot; dose&#xD;
      escalation scheme. These patients will be treated with ARQ 197 and gemcitabine. ARQ 197 will&#xD;
      be administered by mouth BID continuously. Gemcitabine will be administered by intravenous&#xD;
      infusion over 30 minutes once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks followed by a week of rest. The&#xD;
      dosing schedules of ARQ 197 and gemcitabine will be as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARQ 197 will be administered per the following cohorts, starting from week 1 of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort------ARQ 197 (mg BID)&#xD;
&#xD;
      0-----------120, continuously&#xD;
&#xD;
      1-----------240, continuously&#xD;
&#xD;
      A-----------120 (repeated treatments of 2 weeks followed by a 1 week pause)&#xD;
&#xD;
      B-----------240 (repeated treatments of 2 weeks followed by a 1 week pause)&#xD;
&#xD;
      C-----------360 (repeated treatments of 2 weeks followed by a 1 week pause)&#xD;
&#xD;
      D-----------360 (repeated treatments of 3 weeks followed by a 1 week pause)&#xD;
&#xD;
      E-----------360, continuously&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of DLT, intermediate dosing cohorts will be explored, administering ARQ 197 for 5&#xD;
      days instead of 7 during the weeks of ARQ 197 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cohorts 0 and 1, gemcitabine is administered at the dose of 1000mg/sqm from week 1 of&#xD;
      treatment, 4 weeks in a row for the first month, then for 3 consecutive weeks followed by a&#xD;
      week of pause. For all other cohorts, gemcitabine will be administered starting from week 2&#xD;
      of treatment at the dose of 1000mg/sqm, for 3 consecutive weeks followed by a week of pause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional treatment cohorts may be enrolled to explore intermediate, higher or lower doses&#xD;
      of ARQ 197, as indicated by the tolerability, safety profile, and pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a safe and recommended dose level is determined, an Expanded Cohort of up to 60 patients&#xD;
      with non-resectable cholangiocarcinoma (10 patients), breast carcinoma (10 patients), ovarian&#xD;
      carcinoma (10 patients), endometrial carcinoma and carcinoma of the cervix (10 patients in&#xD;
      total, at least five with endometrial carcinoma). Each group of 10 patients may enroll up to&#xD;
      three patients who received at least 5-week gemcitabine treatment. The cohort will also&#xD;
      include up to 20 patients with pancreatic carcinoma (up to five out of 20 patients may have&#xD;
      received at least 5-week gemcitabine treatment).&#xD;
