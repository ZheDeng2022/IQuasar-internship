    <measure>Number of Participants Reported Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Start of the Study up to Day 36</time_frame>
    <description>AEs are defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during study, having been absent at baseline, or, if present at baseline, appears to worsen. Serious adverse events are any untoward medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require (or prolong) hospitalization, cause persistent or significant disability/incapacity, result in congenital anomalies or birth defects, or are other conditions which in judgment of investigators represent significant hazards.</description>

    <description>AUC 0-infinity was defined as the area under the plasma concentration time curve from time zero to infinity = AUC 0-tlast + C last /λ z, where λz is the apparent elimination rate constant estimated by linear regression analysis of the terminal portion of the log-linear plasma concentration-time curve. Penciclovir (active metabolite from famciclovir) and 6-deoxypenciclovir (first intermediate metabolite from famciclovir) were determined by using LC/MS/MS method.

    <time_frame>Pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 10 hours Post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>T½ was defined as the apparent terminal elimination half-life= ln 2/ λz. Penciclovir (active metabolite from famciclovir) and 6-deoxypenciclovir (first intermediate metabolite from famciclovir) were determined by using LC/MS/MS method. The limit of quantification was 0.15 µg/mL For both compounds. Calculations were done in WinNonlin 5.0.1, using non-compartmental methods.</description>

    <measure>Apparent Oral Clearance of Penciclovir From Plasma (CL/F) of Penciclovir (Active Metabolite From Famciclovir)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 10 hours Post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>CL/F was defined as the apparent oral clearance of penciclovir from plasma = dose of famciclovir*0.7884/AUC 0-inf, where 0.7884 is the ratio of the molecular weight of penciclovir (253.3 g/mol) to famciclovir (321.3 g/mol). F is the bioavailability of penciclovir after oral administration of famciclovir. Penciclovir (active metabolite from famciclovir) and 6-deoxypenciclovir (first intermediate metabolite from famciclovir) were determined by using LC/MS/MS method. The limit of quantification was 0.15 µg/mL for both compounds. Calculations were done in WinNonlin 5.0.1, using non-compartmental methods.</description>

        <description>AEs are defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during study, having been absent at baseline, or, if present at baseline, appears to worsen. Serious adverse events are any untoward medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require (or prolong) hospitalization, cause persistent or significant disability/incapacity, result in congenital anomalies or birth defects, or are other conditions which in judgment of investigators represent significant hazards.</description>

          <title>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time 0 to Infinity (AUC 0-infinity) of Penciclovir (Active Metabolite From Famciclovir) and 6-deoxypenciclovir (First Intermediate Metabolite From Famciclovir)</title>
          <description>AUC 0-infinity was defined as the area under the plasma concentration time curve from time zero to infinity = AUC 0-tlast + C last /λ z, where λz is the apparent elimination rate constant estimated by linear regression analysis of the terminal portion of the log-linear plasma concentration-time curve. Penciclovir (active metabolite from famciclovir) and 6-deoxypenciclovir (first intermediate metabolite from famciclovir) were determined by using LC/MS/MS method. The limit of quantification was 0.15 µg/mL for both compounds. Calculations were done in WinNonlin 5.0.1, using non-compartmental methods.</description>

        <title>Apparent Oral Clearance of Penciclovir From Plasma (CL/F) of Penciclovir (Active Metabolite From Famciclovir)</title>
        <description>CL/F was defined as the apparent oral clearance of penciclovir from plasma = dose of famciclovir*0.7884/AUC 0-inf, where 0.7884 is the ratio of the molecular weight of penciclovir (253.3 g/mol) to famciclovir (321.3 g/mol). F is the bioavailability of penciclovir after oral administration of famciclovir. Penciclovir (active metabolite from famciclovir) and 6-deoxypenciclovir (first intermediate metabolite from famciclovir) were determined by using LC/MS/MS method. The limit of quantification was 0.15 µg/mL for both compounds. Calculations were done in WinNonlin 5.0.1, using non-compartmental methods.</description>
