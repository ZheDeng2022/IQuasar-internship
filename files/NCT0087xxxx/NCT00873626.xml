      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of 5 days versus 10 days treatment&#xD;
      duration in uncomplicated acute pyelonephritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute pyelonephritis is a common disease and the treatment duration is not found on&#xD;
      scientific evidence. If a short treatment is equal to standard duration, it will possible to&#xD;
      shortening antibiotherapy with ecologic and economic advantage.&#xD;

      1. State of the issue and objective of the research The acute pyelonephritis (AP) represent&#xD;
           the most frequent COMMUNAUTARY bacterial infection. Currently, usual recommended&#xD;
           duration of antibiotherapy for this disease is from 10 to 21 days. The duration of&#xD;
           treatment is not based on scientific evidence. Shortening duration of antibiotherapy&#xD;
           would improve patient's life quality of and compliance and reduce side effects, duration&#xD;
           of hospitalization, cost of treatment and probably limit bacterial resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main objective of this study is to compare the rates of clinical and microbiological&#xD;
           cure at 30 ± 5 days after the end of antibiotherapy in uncomplicated AP of young women,&#xD;
           according to the duration of antibiotic treatment: 5 days versus 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. People involved Patients with uncomplicated AP, will be offered to participate to the&#xD;
           study after consultation in emergency room service or health service, in absence of&#xD;
           non-inclusion criteria (immunodepression known, severe sepsis, allergy to antibiotics,&#xD;
           pregnancy, lactation ...). In presence of abscesses, obstruction on the urinary tract,&#xD;
           or infection on stranger material device requiring, in most cases, a medical-surgical&#xD;
           treatment, they will not be eligible under the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methods of observation or investigation restraint Non-inferiority multicenter trial,&#xD;
           randomized in 2 parallel groups evaluating antibiotic treatment (5d vs 10d) in the&#xD;
           uncomplicated AP.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recruitment and follow-up: The management of the patient will initially be provided by&#xD;
           emergency room department or the hospital clinic. After signing the consent and&#xD;
           inclusion (J0), the patient will receive an initial assessment, the initiation of&#xD;
           antibiotic therapy and care. Then it will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Either in a hospital service who will follow.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Either by ambulatory monitoring and regularly contacted (phone with voice server)&#xD;
                to ensure proper development.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomisation will take place in J0. Finally, in all cases, a final visit will be set at&#xD;
           J30 ± 5Day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Origin and nature of the data collected - Reasons for them Data for the study duration&#xD;
           of treatment of pyelonephritis are from information provided by patients. The nature of&#xD;
           the data include: name, surname, date of birth, medical data (medical history, history&#xD;
           of the disease, symptoms of infection) and telephone numbers of the patient. The&#xD;
           collection of these numbers is essential for monitoring the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Method for data flow These data will be confidential and only, the physician&#xD;
           investigator, the scientific coordinator doctor, the doctor treating the patient and the&#xD;
           clinical research fellow, will have access to this information. These data will be&#xD;
           computerized and protected by a personal access code.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Duration and modalities of the research The duration of the research will be a maximum&#xD;
           of 24 months (the duration is 12 months for inclusion and follow-up of 310 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research will multicenter (26 centers at most) and led by principal investigator (Pr. Louis&#xD;
      Bernard) and the scientific coordinator (Dr. AURELIEN DINH) At the end of the study, all data&#xD;
      will be destroyed.&#xD;
