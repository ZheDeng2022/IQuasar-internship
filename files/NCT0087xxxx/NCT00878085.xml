      The investigators will study motor recovery after robot-assisted therapy after stroke. A&#xD;
      small clinical trial will be conducted to quantify the central nervous system changes&#xD;
      associated with robotic or standard training, and identify trends across high and low&#xD;
      responders in terms of patterns of change in cortical activity and type of white matter&#xD;
      connectivity.The investigators hypothesize that robot training will lead to larger&#xD;
      improvements as compared to standard occupational therapy. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      high responders to the robot training will have reduced compensatory activation in the&#xD;
      bilateral area and will connectivity in the motor tracts.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Robot-assisted therapy is on the cutting edge of stroke rehabilitation and is a therapy&#xD;
      method that promises to improve the lives of persons with disabilities due to stroke.&#xD;
      Preliminary studies using these tools provide mixed evidence for their effectiveness and&#xD;
      reveal limitations. For example, inconsistent carryover of motor gains to real life&#xD;
      activities of daily living (ADLs) is seen. Therefore, it is still not clear what treatment&#xD;
      strategies maximize functional outcomes on ADLs. There is a need to study the stroke recovery&#xD;
      process and to understand how to optimize robot-assisted therapies in order to enhance&#xD;
      patient rehabilitation and improve functional outcomes. Imaging techniques such as functional&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) can assist us in&#xD;
      understanding the stroke recovery process, in determining who may benefit from robot-assisted&#xD;
      training, and in defining how training induced functional cortical changes occur after robot&#xD;
      training. We propose to conduct an interventional study plus control to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of four weeks of robot-assisted practice of tasks with skilled functional tasks&#xD;
      that involve reaching and grasping activities similar to real activities. We will examine the&#xD;
      process of recovery for low-to-moderate functioning stroke survivors with chronic disability.&#xD;
      We will assess the ability of active-assisted reaching and grasping training to effect&#xD;
      immediate gains and long-term functional improvements. Further, using fMRI and DTI, we plan&#xD;
      to associate changes seen in motor impairment levels and functional task performance levels&#xD;
      with white matter injuries and connectivity and changes in oxygen utilization in the motor&#xD;
      cortex as well as other areas of the brain. Our short-term aims are to, i) assess short-term&#xD;
      functional gains after practice of skilled reaching and grasping tasks; ii) assess&#xD;
      maintenance of these improvements; iii) quantify the neuronal changes associated with&#xD;
      short-term gains, and iv) identify trends across high and low responders in terms of patterns&#xD;
      of change in cortical activity and type of white matter connectivity. In the long-term, we&#xD;
      hope to improve understanding of the process of ADL functional recovery after stroke and&#xD;
      optimize robot-training strategies leading to cerebral plasticity. We also hope to determine&#xD;
      how lesion characteristics affect changes seen in function, white matter connectivity, and&#xD;
      cortical activity. By, accomplishing these aims, we hope to improve upper extremity function&#xD;
      after stroke and reduce disability.&#xD;
