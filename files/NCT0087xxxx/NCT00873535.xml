  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol and nicotine dependence are often co-morbid, with 85% of alcoholics also smoking.&#xD;
      However, very little research has been conducted into the nature of this co-occurrence. Thus,&#xD;
      the main aim of this study is to assess differences in alcohol and tobacco consumption and&#xD;
      cue-induced craving in treatment-seeking smokers after two weeks treatment of varenicline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Two weeks of varenicline treatment will significantly decrease cue-induced tobacco&#xD;
           craving compared to placebo (Due to the actions of varenicline on alpha-4-beta-2&#xD;
           receptors and its downstream effect on dopamine release).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Varenicline will decrease cue-induced alcohol craving compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The impact of Varenicline on cue-induced alcohol craving will be greater in heavy&#xD;
           drinkers compared to social drinkers.&#xD;

      The relationship between alcohol and tobacco dependence needs to be addressed as such&#xD;
      populations are generally excluded from clinical trials involving smoking cessation&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy. Furthermore, the effect of Varenicline(Pfizer Pharmaceuticals)treatment on&#xD;
      tobacco cue-induced craving has not been empirically measured, nor has the effect of&#xD;
      varenicline on alcohol consumption. In addition to being an effective aid in smoking&#xD;
      cessation, preliminary evidence has shown that Varenicline can decrease alcohol consumption&#xD;
      in animal models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Varenicline is a partial agonist of the α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. This drug's&#xD;
      partial agonist effect allows for the activation of this receptor at a lesser degree than&#xD;
      nicotine while simultaneously preventing nicotine binding due to the drugs high affinity&#xD;
      (i.e.: antagonist effect) for this receptor subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Varenicline has recently been approved in Canada as an aid for smoking cessation. This study&#xD;
      will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized study. It will assess differences in&#xD;
      alcohol and tobacco consumption and cue-induced craving in treatment-seeking smokers after&#xD;
      two weeks of treatment with either varenicline or placebo.Ultimately This study may help to&#xD;
      further understand the association between smoking and drinking alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of two study groups composed of 40 subjects each being randomized to&#xD;
      receive either placebo or varenicline (0.5mg once daily for days 1-3, 0.5mg twice daily for&#xD;
      days 4-7 followed by 1mg twice daily for days 8-14). One group will be heavy smokers and&#xD;
      heavy drinkers while the other will be heavy smokers and social drinkers. Upon entering the&#xD;
      study, subjects will undergo baseline cognitive and craving measures for both tobacco and&#xD;
      alcohol associated cue presentations prior to randomization to varenicline or placebo.&#xD;
      Subjects will be provided a 1-week supply of study medications and directions for use. During&#xD;
      this period, subjects will be requested to complete a diary outlining their cigarette and&#xD;
      alcohol craving and consumption each day and outline any adverse effects. Upon completion of&#xD;
      this 1-week period, subjects will attend the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH)&#xD;
      where their old pill bottles and daily diaries will be collected and they will be supplied&#xD;
      with study medication (1mg varenicline taken twice daily or placebo) and daily diary for an&#xD;
      additional week. At this visit, subjects will complete the symptom checklist. At the end of&#xD;
      the second week of treatment, subjects will be requested to return to CAMH where craving for&#xD;
      tobacco and alcohol and cue-reactivity will be assessed in a similar manner as to study day&#xD;
      After study completion, all subjects will be given the option to continue with varenicline in&#xD;
      a 12-week treatment plan through the Nicotine Dependence Clinic.&#xD;
