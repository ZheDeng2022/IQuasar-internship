  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With over one million operations a year, cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass is one&#xD;
      of the most common major surgical procedures worldwide (1). Acute kidney injury is a common&#xD;
      and serious postoperative complication of cardiopulmonary bypass and may affect 25% to 50% of&#xD;
      patients (2-4). Acute kidney injury carries significant costs (4) and is independently&#xD;
      associated with increased morbidity and mortality (2,3). Even minimal increments in plasma&#xD;
      creatinine are associated with an increase in mortality (5,6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple causes of cardiopulmonary bypass-associated acute kidney injury have been proposed,&#xD;
      including ischemia-reperfusion, generation of reactive oxygen species, hemolysis and&#xD;
      activation of inflammatory pathways (7-10). To date, no simple, safe and effective&#xD;
      intervention to prevent cardiopulmonary bypass-associated acute kidney injury in a broad&#xD;
      patient population has been found (11-14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary acidity may enhance the generation and toxicity of reactive oxygen species induced by&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass (10,15). Activation of complement during cardiac surgery (16) may also&#xD;
      participate in kidney injury. Urinary alkalinization may protect from kidney injury induced&#xD;
      by oxidant substances, iron-mediated free radical pathways, complement activation and tubular&#xD;
      hemoglobin cast formation (9,17,18). Of note, increasing urinary pH - in combination with&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine (19,20) or without (21) - has recently been reported to attenuate acute&#xD;
      kidney injury in patients undergoing contrast-media infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pilot double-blind, randomized controlled trial the investigators found sodium&#xD;
      bicarbonate to be efficacious, safe, inexpensive and easy to administer. These findings now&#xD;
      need to be confirmed or refuted by further clinical investigations in other geographic and&#xD;
      institutional settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, the investigators hypothesized that urinary alkalinization might protect kidney&#xD;
      function in patients at increased risk of acute kidney injury undergoing cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass needs to be confirmed in an international multicenter, double-blind, randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial of intravenous sodium bicarbonate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal impairment following cardiopulmonary bypass is common. While most of these patients do&#xD;
      not require either short or long term renal replacement, the mortality of patients with acute&#xD;
      renal failure is substantially greater than those who do not develop renal dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pilot double-blind, randomized controlled trial we found sodium bicarbonate to be&#xD;
      efficacious, safe, inexpensive and easy to administer. These findings now need to be&#xD;
      confirmed or refuted by further clinical investigations in other geographic and institutional&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that sodium bicarbonate affects the cardiovascular, respiratory and immune&#xD;
      systems and may be of benefit to patients undergoing cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design - overview and rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to receive sodium bicarbonate from the induction of anaesthesia&#xD;
      until 24 hours postoperatively, or a placebo (sodium chloride).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum creatinine is the most commonly used clinical indicator of renal function along with&#xD;
      urine output. Both will be measured for several days postoperatively - the time period during&#xD;
      which renal impairment is most likely to develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation The randomisation will be based on random numbers generated by computer. Once&#xD;
      consent is obtained, the allocation of either treatment with sodium bicarbonate or placebo&#xD;
      will be organised by an independent person (clinical trials pharmacist) who will dispense the&#xD;
      coded and blinded infusion bags (shrink-wrapped in extra black plastic bags). This will be&#xD;
      delivered to the anaesthetic staff looking after the patient in theatre, and the ICU nurse&#xD;
      caring for the patient postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 ml samples of heparinised blood and urine will be taken from the arterial line or urine&#xD;
      catheter. Samples will be taken immediately after the preoperative insertion of the&#xD;
      arterial/urine catheter, at 6, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours after commencement of&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass. Immediately following collection, the preoperative, 6 and 24 hour&#xD;
      blood and urine will be centrifuged at low speed to separate the plasma from the cellular&#xD;
      components. Urine and plasma will be stored in aliquots at -70 degrees prior to batch&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following variables will be obtained:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Code for patient, gender and age. Date and time of admission to ICU Operative procedure and&#xD;
      date and time on and off cardiopulmonary bypass Preoperative assessment of left ventricular&#xD;
      function, Comorbidities, Pre-, intra- and post-operative medication, Markers of renal&#xD;
      function as described above, Doses of frusemide administered (or rate of frusemide infusion)&#xD;
      Use of inotropes or vasopressors Cardiac output whenever measured for clinical purposes in&#xD;
      the first 24 hours postoperatively Requirement of renal replacement therapy Urine output in&#xD;
      each 6 hour period during the presence of urine catheter Acid base status and electrolytes at&#xD;
      baseline, 6 and 24 hours after commencement of cardiopulmonary bypass, Time of intubation and&#xD;
      extubation, Date and time of arrival on and discharge from ICU and hospital, death Resources&#xD;
      required The principle of the study has been discussed with the involved cardiac&#xD;
      anaesthetists, cardiac surgeons, intensivists and intensive care nurses, who have offered&#xD;
      their co-operation. ICU research nurse to allocate patients and collect clinical data.&#xD;
      Pharmacy will be required to prepare drug and placebo infusion bags. Clinical pathology will&#xD;
      be required to perform 24 hour creatinine clearance estimation (in addition to those tests&#xD;
      clinically indicated) Protocol violations All protocol violations will be recorded. It will&#xD;
      then be decided whether the nature of such violation had been such that the patient should be&#xD;
      excluded from primary data analysis. Such evaluation will be blinded to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treating clinician will have the right to withdraw the patient from the study if he or&#xD;
      she believes that continued participation is jeopardising the patient's well being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Issues&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium bicarbonate used in this study is considered to be very safe as has been demonstrated&#xD;
      by its widespread clinical use in the management of critically ill patients with metabolic&#xD;
      acidosis. We consider the potential benefit of this treatment theoretically significant.&#xD;
      Given the balance of benefits and risks, we consider it ethical to proceed and seek informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indemnity&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigator-initiated study and, accordingly, no commercial sponsor's indemnity&#xD;
      has been provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained from the patient prior to the operation by one of the&#xD;
      investigators or the ICU research nurse. The clinical care of a patient who does not consent&#xD;
      for any reason will not be affected.&#xD;
