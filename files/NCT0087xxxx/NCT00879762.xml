  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to compare the ability of a new investigational smallpox&#xD;
      vaccine called IMVAMUNE® to produce a strong immune response against smallpox disease if&#xD;
      given as one single, higher dose compared with two lower doses given one month apart. Another&#xD;
      purpose of the study is to see how quickly someone might be protected against smallpox.&#xD;
      Volunteers will be vaccinia-naïve adults age 18 and older (born after 1971) divided into 2&#xD;
      groups. Volunteers in Group A will receive a high dose of vaccine given in 2 shots on day 0&#xD;
      followed by a placebo (inactive substance) shot on day 28. Group B will receive the standard&#xD;
      dose of vaccine and placebo given in 2 shots on day 0 followed by a standard dose shot on Day&#xD;
      28. Study participation will include 10 planned study visits over approximately 7 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the fact that the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared smallpox to be&#xD;
      eradicated, a new threat exists due to the potential use of variola virus as an agent for&#xD;
      biological warfare and/or bio-terrorism. As a consequence, there is an urgent need for a safe&#xD;
      and efficacious vaccine to protect the public against smallpox. To date, the majority of&#xD;
      clinical studies with Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) have studied a prime-boost vaccination&#xD;
      regimen, with a dose of up to 1×10^8 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) of MVA&#xD;
      administered on Days 0 and 28. While this vaccination regimen induces a robust immune&#xD;
      response that is protective in a variety of animal models and is appropriate for a&#xD;
      pre-smallpox release scenario, in the event of a confirmed release of smallpox, a more rapid&#xD;
      vaccination regimen that provides a protective immune response would be desirable. Ideally,&#xD;
      at least short-term protection could be obtained with a single dose of vaccine. While a&#xD;
      single dose of MVA at 1×10^8 TCID50, does induce an immune response in the majority of&#xD;
      recipients, it is possible that a higher dose of MVA could provide a more rapid and/or&#xD;
      stronger immune response relative to a single, standard 1×10^8 TCID50 dose of MVA. The goal&#xD;
      of this study is to examine the kinetics and magnitude of the immune response of a single&#xD;
      high dose of MVA (5×10^8 TCID50) relative to both a single and prime/boost regimen using the&#xD;
      standard doses (1×10^8 TCID50) of MVA. This study will complement a current, ongoing study,&#xD;
      DMID Protocol 06-0012, which is examining the immune response to compressed prime/boost&#xD;
      dosing regimens of MVA administered at (1×10^8 TCID50). Upon the completion of these studies,&#xD;
      clinical data will be generated which will inform policy makers about different options for&#xD;
      post-event utilization of available smallpox vaccines. The study is designed as a randomized,&#xD;
      non-placebo controlled, double blinded study containing two arms: Group A (N=45) will receive&#xD;
      a single high dose of IMVAMUNE® (5x10^8 TCID50, consisting of two 0.5 mL injections) vaccine&#xD;
      on Day 0 and a single saline placebo dose (single 0.5 mL injection) on Day 28 to match the&#xD;
      two dose regimen of Group B. Group B (N=45) will receive a standard two dose regimen of&#xD;
      IMVAMUNE® (1x10^8 TCID50) vaccine on Day 0 (consisting of 0.5 mL injection of vaccine and 0.5&#xD;
      mL injection of saline placebo) and Day 28 (single 0.5 mL injection of vaccine). Safety will&#xD;
      be measured by assessment of adverse events for 28 days following the last vaccination (56&#xD;
      days following the initial vaccination for those subjects that fail to receive the second&#xD;
      dose) and for serious adverse events at six months post the final vaccination, and&#xD;
      reactogenicity to the vaccines for 15 days following each vaccination. Immunogenicity testing&#xD;
      will include antibody testing [enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and plaque reduction&#xD;
      neutralizing antibody titers (PRNT)] and cellular immune responses [(INF-gamma enzyme linked&#xD;
      immunospot (ELISPOT)] following each vaccination and at six months post the final&#xD;
      vaccination. In addition, ELISA responses, using MVA VR-1508 as the target antigen and PRNT&#xD;
      using vaccinia WR (Western Reserve) as the target antigen will be explored. Participants will&#xD;
      include 90 healthy, vaccinia-naïve adults, aged 18 and older (born after 1971). Study&#xD;
      duration will be approximately 13 months (7 months/subject).&#xD;
