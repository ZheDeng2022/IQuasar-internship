      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe patient quality of life (QOL) related to bladder, bowel, and sexual&#xD;
           function, as well as mental and physical health, in patients who received neoadjuvant&#xD;
           investigational therapies prior to radical prostatectomy (RP) for high risk clinically&#xD;
           localized prostate cancer (HRCLPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify medical and demographic variables that are related with quality of life,&#xD;
           e.g., hormonal or non-hormonal neoadjuvant treatment, time since surgery, disease&#xD;
           recurrence, subsequent treatment, age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To describe treatment satisfaction expressed by patients who have received neoadjuvant&#xD;
      investigational therapies prior to radical prostatectomy for high risk clinically localized&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;

      Regardless of the survival benefit that a proposed treatment affords a patient, if it results&#xD;
      in a poor QOL, it may not be considered a reasonable option. To assess this critical issue,&#xD;
      QOL surveys have been developed to determine the post-therapy impact of a given treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In prostate cancer, one of the most widely used validated survey instruments is the Expanded&#xD;
      Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) .8 It contains 4 primary domains that elicit details&#xD;
      regarding urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal function. The EPIC questionnaire has been&#xD;
      widely applied, although it has not been administered to patients undergoing neoadjuvant&#xD;
      investigational therapies prior to radical prostatectomy for HRCLPC. Obtaining this&#xD;
      information will be important for counseling patients considering similar trials in the&#xD;
      future since it will reflect long-term outcomes for functional recovery and mental health-two&#xD;
      key concerns of patients deciding whether to enter clinical trials. Furthermore, researchers&#xD;
      will be able to stratify these outcomes based on the specific treatment arm to possibly&#xD;
      determine how to optimize outcomes while reducing negative impacts of a given therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross-sectional descriptive study of the QOL of prostatectomy patients who have&#xD;
      received neoadjuvant treatment. Anticipated 131 patients will receive a brief survey by to&#xD;
      complete and return by mail to M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
