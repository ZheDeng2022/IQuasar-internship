    <textblock>
      Patient Controlled Epidural Analgesia is a widely used and effective means of adult pain&#xD;
      management. However, Parturient Controlled Epidural Analgesia (PCEA) is a relatively new&#xD;
      approach to pain control for the women in labor. With the recent acquisition of new PCEA&#xD;
      technology at Baystate Medical Center it is now possible to make this patient controlled&#xD;
      technology available on the Labor and Delivery unit. This study is designed to determine&#xD;
      whether there is a difference in analgesia, side effects, or analgesic duration in patients&#xD;
      who receive a bupivacaine and fentanyl PCEA for management of labor pain. The present study&#xD;
      hypothesizes that an analgesic protocol that includes a basal infusion rate in addition to a&#xD;
      bolus dose controlled by the patient will have a longer analgesic duration than a pump&#xD;
      protocol that does not have a basal infusion added to a bolus dose controlled by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:The study population will consist of 100 adult obstetrical patients greater than 36&#xD;
      weeks gestation who request labor analgesia. Patients greater than 5 cm cervical dilation,&#xD;
      patients who have received intravenous opioid agonists, or patients with a contraindication&#xD;
      to fentanyl will be excluded. Patients with pre-eclampsia are also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the following PCEA treatment protocols will be started in a randomized, double blind&#xD;
      fashion.PCEA solution: Bupivacaine 0.0625% with fentanyl 2 mcg/ml Group 1: Basal Infusion: 0&#xD;
      ml/hr; Bolus 10 ml q 30min prn (10ml demand dose with 30min lockout) Group 2: Basal Infusion:&#xD;
      10 ml/h; Bolus 5 ml q 30min prn (5ml demand dose with 30min lockout) If the patient does not&#xD;
      obtain relief within 30 minutes, the epidural catheter will be dosed with a local anesthetic&#xD;
      and the study will be concluded. The patients without pain relief within 30 minutes are&#xD;
      considered to have failed epidurals and are dropped from the study and the analysis.&#xD;
      Following achievement of satisfactory analgesia, the patient will be evaluated every 30&#xD;
      minutes until they request additional analgesics. The study will &quot;end&quot; at this point, and the&#xD;
      patient will be treated at the discretion of the anesthesiologist.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patient Controlled Epidural Analgesia is a widely used and effective means of adult pain&#xD;
      management. However, Parturient Controlled Epidural Analgesia (PCEA) is a relatively new&#xD;
      approach to pain control for the women in labor. With the recent acquisition of new PCEA&#xD;
      technology at Baystate Medical Center it is now possible to make this patient controlled&#xD;
      technology available on the Labor and Delivery unit. Several studies have been conducted to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of Parturient Controlled Epidural Analgesia on different outcomes&#xD;
      ranging from the dose of local anesthetic used, incidence of motor block, quality of&#xD;
      analgesia, obstetric and safety outcomes, and number of patients who received anesthetic&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have previously shown that epidural fentanyl (given in a 10 ml volume) is a useful means&#xD;
      of achieving analgesia in laboring patients receiving epidural analgesia. Furthermore, we&#xD;
      have shown that adding a bupivacaine and fentanyl infusion increases the analgesic period.&#xD;
      This increased analgesic duration was achieved without any clinically detectable motor block.&#xD;
      This study is designed to determine whether there is a difference in analgesia, side effects,&#xD;
      or analgesic duration in patients who receive a bupivacaine and fentanyl PCEA for management&#xD;
      of labor pain. The present study hypothesizes that an analgesic protocol that includes a&#xD;
      basal infusion rate in addition to a bolus dose controlled by the patient will have a longer&#xD;
      analgesic duration than a pump protocol that does not have a basal infusion added to a bolus&#xD;
      dose controlled by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of 100 adult obstetrical patients greater than 36 weeks&#xD;
      gestation who request labor analgesia. Patients greater than 5 cm cervical dilation, patients&#xD;
      who have received intravenous opioid agonists, or patients with a contraindication to&#xD;
      fentanyl will be excluded. Patients with pre-eclampsia are also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening process occurs when the patient requests labor analgesia. The study is then&#xD;
      explained to the patient as well as the option of receiving labor analgesia without&#xD;
      participating in the study protocol. The epidural catheters will be placed in the usual&#xD;
      fashion in the L2-3 interspace. The catheter will be injected with 3ml lidocaine 1.5% with&#xD;
      epinephrine 1:200,000 &quot;test dose&quot; (as is the usual practice at Baystate following insertion&#xD;
      of all epidural catheters) to rule out placement of an intravenous catheter. All catheters&#xD;
      will be placed in 5 cm. Following customary test dosing, patients will be given Fentanyl 100&#xD;
      mcg in 10 ml volume. After the woman is comfortable from the epidural, we will again approach&#xD;
      the patient. If the patient then agrees to participate in the study and signs the consent&#xD;
      form, study procedures are initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the following PCEA treatment protocols will be started in a randomized, double blind&#xD;
      fashion. A random number table for 60 patients is generated in Excel using the Randbetween&#xD;
      function. This function randomly generates 60 numbers either 1 or 2. When a series is&#xD;
      generated that contains 30 1's and 30 2's, this series is selected as the random code for the&#xD;
      study. A patient is assigned to group 1 or 2 based on the next available number. This&#xD;
      patients name is then entered next to this number on the rand code table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCEA solution: Bupivacaine 0.0625% with fentanyl 2 mcg/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Basal Infusion: 0 ml/hr; Bolus 10 ml q 30min prn (10ml demand dose with 30min&#xD;
      lockout) Group 2: Basal Infusion: 10 ml/h; Bolus 5 ml q 30min prn (5ml demand dose with 30min&#xD;
      lockout)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pump will be programmed by one investigator while evaluations will be done by another&#xD;
      investigator who is unaware of the PCEA protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient does not obtain relief within 30 minutes, the epidural catheter will be dosed&#xD;
      with a local anesthetic and the study will be concluded. The patients without pain relief&#xD;
      within 30 minutes are considered to have failed epidurals and are dropped from the study and&#xD;
      the analysis. Following achievement of satisfactory analgesia, the patient will be evaluated&#xD;
      every 30 minutes until they request additional analgesics. The study will &quot;end&quot; at this&#xD;
      point, and the patient will be treated at the discretion of the anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of delivery, need for instrumented delivery, time of delivery, and neonatal APGAR&#xD;
      scores will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of discomfort, presence of side effects (motor block, sedation, pruritis, and&#xD;
      hypotension) will be evaluated at baseline, 10, 20, 30 minutes and every 30 minutes&#xD;
      thereafter. Pain will be evaluated using a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) with 0&#xD;
      representing no pain and 100 representing the worst possible pain. We will track several PCEA&#xD;
      parameters including volumes infused till study termination, Bolus Demands, Bolus Deliveries,&#xD;
      time to first bolus etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All other aspects of the patients' care will conform to usual standards.&#xD;
