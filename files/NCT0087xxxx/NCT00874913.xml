    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common disease, with a prevalence evaluated&#xD;
      between 5 - 7% in the general population. OSAS is characterized by recurrent episodes of&#xD;
      partial or complete upper airway obstruction during sleep, which are nearly systematically&#xD;
      associated with a desaturation-reoxygenation sequence, an admitted detrimental stimulus for&#xD;
      the cardiovascular system. It has now been demonstrated that OSAS per se is able to generate&#xD;
      hypertension, atherosclerosis and autonomic dysfunction (high sympathic tone and increase in&#xD;
      baseline heart rate), all conditions possibly interacting with ocular vascular regulation.&#xD;
      OSAS has major consequences on the ocular level since it is associated with a higher&#xD;
      frequency of optic neuropathies, such as glaucoma and nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy&#xD;
      (NAION), both with functional severe prognosis. Most of vascular changes associated with OSAS&#xD;
      have been studied at the level of macrovasculature. In terms of physiopathology, the main&#xD;
      effects on the vascular system in OSAS are sympathetic hyperactivity, oxidative stress,&#xD;
      development of endothelial dysfunction, systemic inflammation and metabolic alterations such&#xD;
      as the appearance of insulin resistance. All these mechanisms can affect the microcirculation&#xD;
      of the eye, especially the optic nerve and choroid. Our hypothesis is that the eye&#xD;
      microvasculature is affected by OSAS, and these lesions may be detected via a reduced&#xD;
      autoregulation of blood flow in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to demonstrate, quantify, and analyze the vascular modifications of the eye&#xD;
      associated with OSAS trough a comparative clinical study on glaucoma patients and OSAS&#xD;
      patients and matched healthy subjects for the regulation of the eye blood flow using confocal&#xD;
      laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). The regulation of the ocular blood flow will be assessed using&#xD;
      several stimuli and measured using a new confocal LDF.&#xD;

      JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) is an under diagnosed&#xD;
      disease affecting 5% of the general population. This disease is associated with an increase&#xD;
      in the risk for cardiovascular disease (high blood pressure, coronary disease, and stroke).&#xD;
      Two optic neuropathies are associated with OSA: glaucoma and nonarteritic anterior ischemic&#xD;
      optic neuropathy (NAION). Glaucoma is a frequent progressive optical neuropathy in&#xD;
      industrialized countries and one of the leading causes of blindness in the world. Normal&#xD;
      tension glaucoma, a vascular form of glaucoma, is the form most frequently associated with&#xD;
      OSAS. In addition, in nonglaucomatous OSA patients, there is a diffuse reduction in optic&#xD;
      nerve layer thickness correlated with OSA severity, strongly suggesting optic nerve&#xD;
      involvement in these patients. Moreover, recent studies have shown that 90% of patients&#xD;
      presenting NAION have OSA. These clinical and epidemiological data suggest a causal relation&#xD;
      between OSA and the onset of optic neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: This physiopathological study aims to demonstrate, quantify, and analyze the&#xD;
      vascular modifications associated with OSA through:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - A comparative study on glaucoma patients and OSAS patients, with or without NAION, and&#xD;
      healthy subjects matched for age, sex, and body mass index: the eye vascular modifications&#xD;
      will be quantified using confocal laser Doppler flowmetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL SCHEDULE The aim of this study is to characterize ocular blood flow (choroid and&#xD;
      optic nerve) regulation in patients in 4 populations: (1) glaucoma patients (2) OSA patients&#xD;
      without clinical evidence of optic nerve disease, (3) OSA patients with NAION, (4) matched&#xD;
      healthy subjects . OSA patients of group 2 and 3 will be studied 3-6 months after nCPAP&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment and screening visit: each subject will undergo a general examination. The&#xD;
           ocular examination includes visual acuity, intraocular pressure, biomicroscopy and&#xD;
           fundus examination, visual field (Humphrey 24/2 SITA-STANDARD) and measurement of the&#xD;
           thickness of the optic nerve fiber layer using optical coherence tomography (OCT 3&#xD;
           Zeiss). In order to assess the cardiovascular phenotype, the cardiovascular examination&#xD;
           will be completed, by an electrocardiogram, an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and&#xD;
           echocardiography. A blood sample will be also analyzed: lipid analysis, hemogram,&#xD;
           ionogram, glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides. A polysomnography will be performed for&#xD;
           all subjects for the diagnosis of OSA, and the calculation of a respiratory disturbance&#xD;
           index (RDI, sleep apnea defined as a RDI &gt;15 per hour).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Baseline measurements of blood flow of the optic nerve head:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients are asked to abstain from alcohol and caffeine for at least 12 h before the LDF&#xD;
           measurements. Systolic (BPsyst) and diastolic (BPdiast) blood pressures are determined&#xD;
           (DINAMAP®, Critikon, inc. Tampa, Florida, USA) during LDF measurements and immediately&#xD;
           after, intraocular pressure (IOP) of the fellow eye is measured by applanation&#xD;
           tonometry: using the Tonopen XL. The mean ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) is calculated&#xD;
           according to the formula: OPP sitting position = (95/140 x MAP) - IOP in which mean&#xD;
           arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated as: MAP = BPdiast + 1/3 (BPsyst - BPdiast).&#xD;
&#xD;
           A newly developed compact laser Doppler flowmeter (LDF) allows the measurement of blood&#xD;
           flow at the level of the neuroretinal rim of the optic nerve. This system delivers a&#xD;
           laser beam from a diode laser (670 nm) to a discrete site at the optic nerve head. The&#xD;
           scattered light is collected by an optical fiber with the image of its aperture&#xD;
           (approximately 150 µm in diameter) focused onto the illuminated site. This fiber guides&#xD;
           the scattered light to a photodetector. An area of the fundus (30° in diameter) is&#xD;
           illuminated in red-free light for observation of the fundus and positioning of the laser&#xD;
           beam. This instrument detects the light scattered by the red blood cells (RBCs) within&#xD;
           an annulus centered on the illumination site of the laser. This flowmeter consists of a&#xD;
           self-aligned confocal system, a fundus illumination (green light) and CCD based&#xD;
           observation unit, a target fixation system and a CCD camera to observe the pupil. This&#xD;
           CCD allows monitoring of the position of the probing laser beam at the pupil to insure&#xD;
           constant entrance point in successive measurements of ONH blood flow. The Doppler signal&#xD;
           is digitized and a dedicated software operating on a portable computer calculates the&#xD;
           relative velocity (VEL), volume (VOL) and flow of the red blood cells in the eye&#xD;
           microcirculation. Synchronization of these parameters with the heart pulse allows&#xD;
           determination of the flow pulsatility. For the investigation of the effect of increased&#xD;
           retinal activity on optic nerve blood flow, a system for delivering visual stimuli&#xD;
           (flicker) has been adapted to the fundus camera-based instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The baseline measurements consist on 3 measurements of the optic nerve blood flow in a&#xD;
           resting condition every one minute during 3 minutes (time of measurement 30 sec).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ocular blood flow reactivity: gas inhalation, isometric exercise and flicker&#xD;
           stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All these experiments will be performed in the 4 groups (glaucoma patients,OSA patients,&#xD;
           patients with OSA+NAION, healthy subjects). A resting period of at least 20 minutes in a&#xD;
           sitting position is scheduled for each subject before the study and 30 minutes between&#xD;
           experiment. Stable baseline conditions are established, which are ensured by repeated&#xD;
           measurements of blood pressure. Other conditions such as abstinence from coffee, alcohol&#xD;
           drinking, smoking, refrain from heavy meal, exercise, etc, all of which may affect the&#xD;
           measurement of blood flow are prohibited. Adequate dilatation of the patient's pupil is&#xD;
           necessary using a muscarinic antagonist (i.e. tropicamide).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The gas experiment&#xD;
&#xD;
           - experimental setting : this experiment will be performed in a randomized, double&#xD;
           masked, three way cross-over design. Three inhalation periods of different mixtures of&#xD;
           oxygen and carbon dioxide are scheduled. Three LDF measurements of 30 seconds are&#xD;
           performed before inhalation, 5 and 10 minutes during the inhalation, and then after&#xD;
           resting period of 10 minutes. The following gas mixtures are administered for 10 minutes&#xD;
           each: 100% O2, Bactal (92%O2 +8%CO2), and air (21,8%O2 +78,2%N2). All gases are&#xD;
           delivered through a partially expanded reservoir bag at atmospheric pressure using a two&#xD;
           valves system to prevent re-breathing. Transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension (TINA&#xD;
           PtcCO2 monitoring system, Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark), MAP and IOP are monitored at&#xD;
           5', 10' and at the end of the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The isometric exercise (handgripping)&#xD;
&#xD;
           - experimental setting: this consists on handgripping during 3 minutes. Measurements of&#xD;
           blood flow is performed each minute during a 30 sec period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The flicker experiment&#xD;
&#xD;
           - experimental setting: The stimulus is a pure green luminance flicker generated by an&#xD;
           array of ultrabright light-emitting diodes with dominant wavelengths at 524 nm and&#xD;
           located in the plane of the light source of the fundus camera. The diodes are&#xD;
           synchronously square-wave modulated at 15 Hz between 0 and 10 lux. The stimulus is&#xD;
           delivered to the eye in Maxwellian view through the fundus illumination's optical system&#xD;
           of the camera (Topcon Optical, Tokyo, Japan) and it uniformly illuminates a 25° diameter&#xD;
           area that included both the fovea and the optic disc. Blood flow is measured at baseline&#xD;
           before the flicker stimulation, and then during the 2 min period of flicker stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Similar experiments will be also performed for the OSA group of patients after 3 to 6&#xD;
           months of nCPAP treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDIED POPULATION :&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical project will include OSA patients with the following inclusion criteria: OSA&#xD;
      defined by a respiratory-disturbance index &gt; 15/hour (number of episode of partial (hypopnea)&#xD;
      or complete (apnea) upper airway obstruction), age between 18 and 80 years, affiliation to&#xD;
      the health care system. The exclusion criteria are: ocular disease (including cataract or&#xD;
      retinal disease, ametropia &gt; 3 diopters, optic neuropathy other than NAION in group 2),&#xD;
      uncontrolled high blood pressure, cardiovascular treatment (vasoconstrictors, vasodilatators,&#xD;
      beta and alpha agonists or antagonists, nitric derived medication), corticosteroids,&#xD;
      theophylline, sildenafil, immunosuppressors, neuroleptics, non steroid anti inflammatory,&#xD;
      oestroprogestative treatment, hypnotics (benzodiazepines), local treatment for ocular&#xD;
      hypertension or glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glaucoma was defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were eligible if they had glaucomatous optic nerve head appearance indicative of&#xD;
      glaucoma in addition to corresponding visual field loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual field abnormalitie(s) compatible with glaucomatous damages in accordance to the&#xD;
      European guidelines :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unless one of the following criteria, observed on 2 consecutive automated visual fields (one&#xD;
      of these will be the baseline automated visual field: Humphrey 30.2 SITA-Standard strategy):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Glaucoma Hemifield Test (GHT) outside normal limits. or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A cluster of 3 or more nonedge points in a location typical for glaucoma, all of which&#xD;
           are depressed on the pattern deviation plot at a p &lt; 5% level and 1 of which is&#xD;
           depressed at a p &lt; 1% level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      or&#xD;
&#xD;
      - A Pattern Standard Deviation (PSD) that occurs in less than 5% of normal fields&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control subjects will be matched with OSA patients for body mass index, gender and age, and&#xD;
      will undergo complete overnight polysomnography to discard OSA. Other inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are similar to that of OSA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIN CRITERIA OF EVALUATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Normalized data during the experiment&#xD;
      will be calculated according to baseline data. Changes in blood flow parameters (reflected&#xD;
      the vascular reactivity) and correlations will be calculated with nonparametric tests&#xD;
      (Friedman and Wilcoxon tests for paired comparisons) using the SPSS 12.0 software. Comparison&#xD;
      of OSA group and healthy subjects group will be done using non parametric test (Mann Whitney&#xD;
      and Chi 2 test). A two-tailed approach test will determine significance, which is set as&#xD;
      p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensitivity (the minimum statistically significant LDF parameters change (S) that can be&#xD;
      detected) will be calculated using the formula : S = (t * SD) / ((square root)n * P mean) *&#xD;
      100, where P mean is the mean value of all measurements, SD the SD of the difference between&#xD;
      paired measurement for all subjects, and t the two-tailed value of the t distribution at a&#xD;
      0.05 significance level for n-1-1 degree of freedom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRATEGY OF ANALYSIS The clinical experiment aims to compare the vascular regulation of the&#xD;
      optic nerve in OSA patients with that of a healthy group of human subjects. Subsequently, a&#xD;
      group of OSA patients with NAION will be analyzed in order to compare the ocular blood flow&#xD;
      ant its regulation in eyes with ischemic neuropathy (NAION) with eyes of OSA patients without&#xD;
      optic nerve disease. All these comparisons will allow to characterize the optic nerve blood&#xD;
      flow in healthy eyes, in eyes of OSA patients and in eyes of OSA patients at the time of&#xD;
      acute ischemic attack (NAION).The glaucoma patients will be compared with healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL ASPECTS This study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
      for research involving human subjects and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from the subjects after explanation of the study. The study protocol&#xD;
      was approved by the local Institutional Review Board (Comité de Protection des Personnes,&#xD;
      Sud-Est V), declared to the French authorities (insurance : N° contract : 124706 Société&#xD;
      Hospitalière d'Assurances Mutuelles Lyon, France).&#xD;
