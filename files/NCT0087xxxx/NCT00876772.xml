  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is an adult neurodegenerative disease that is caused by a&#xD;
      selective degeneration of the motor nerve cells in the cortex and myelon. As a result of&#xD;
      motor neurodegeneration, a progredient paralysis of the extremities and of the speaking,&#xD;
      swallowing, and breathing musculature develops. ALS leads to death by respiratory&#xD;
      insufficiency in a mean course of 3-5 years. More than 80% of ALS patients present with a&#xD;
      clinically significant and undesirable weight loss. The cause of weight loss is&#xD;
      heterogeneous. Fundamentally, the investigators must distinguish malnutrition, cachexia and&#xD;
      loss of appetite. Loss of weight is an independent prognosis factor in ALS. Effective&#xD;
      treatment of undesirable weight loss is an important therapy goal for ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers propose an investigational therapy of ALS with oral administration of&#xD;
      Olanzapine. The rationale for this study is based on the weight-increasing effect of OLN. The&#xD;
      clinical trial aims to employ OLN-induced weight gain or weight stabilization as a&#xD;
      symptomatic therapy for the loss of appetite. An undesired weight loss of at least 10% of the&#xD;
      body weight should be reduced through the weight-increasing effect of OLN. The hypothesis&#xD;
      states that the undesired weight loss in ALS patients during treatment with OLN 10mg in&#xD;
      combination with Riluzole (RIL) 100mg is at least 20 percentage points less than for&#xD;
      treatment with placebo in combination with 100 mg RIL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After randomization, there is a placebo-controlled parallel group treatment with 10 mg OLN in&#xD;
      combination with the standard treatment of Riluzole (100mg/day)(Group 1) in comparison to&#xD;
      treatment with placebo in combination with 100 mg RIL (Group 2). Study drug will be provided&#xD;
      as 5 mg tablets. OLN will be begun in an initial dosage of 5 mg/day for one week. The intake&#xD;
      will occur in the evening hours in the form of a capsule containing 5 mg OLN. The evening&#xD;
      dose of Riluzole can be taken together with the OLN medication. After one week (day 8), the&#xD;
      dose will be increase to 10 mg OLN/day, which will be taken in the form of two capsules at&#xD;
      the same timepoint in the evening hours. This dose will be continued for 51 weeks.&#xD;
