    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether disulfiram might be a safe and effective&#xD;
      treatment for cocaine and/or alcohol dependence in patients with HIV disease. This research&#xD;
      is designed to characterize the presence or absence of significant drug interactions between&#xD;
      disulfiram and HIV medications using standard clinical pharmacology techniques as well as&#xD;
      monitor any side effects that might occur when these medications are administered together.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine and alcohol abuse are strongly linked to HIV infection and transmission of the virus.&#xD;
      Disulfiram has long been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of alcohol and recent data&#xD;
      shows it to be effective in reducing cocaine abuse. Disulfiram and antiretroviral medications&#xD;
      (ARV) are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A and concomitant use of these drugs could&#xD;
      potentially produce adverse drug interactions underscoring the need to identify and&#xD;
      understand the clinical implications of these drug interactions in order to more effectively&#xD;
      treat individuals with both HIV disease and cocaine and/or alcohol use disorders. This will&#xD;
      be accomplished by conducting studies aimed at identifying whether pharmacokinetic or&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic drug interactions of importance occur between disulfiram and medications&#xD;
      frequently utilized in those with HIV/AIDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abuse of cocaine and/or alcohol has been shown to be a significant risk factor for HIV&#xD;
      infections as a result of high risk sexual and drug use behaviors occurring in the context of&#xD;
      use of these substances. Those with HIV infection and untreated cocaine and/or alcohol&#xD;
      dependence are also at a high risk of transmitting HIV to others. Moreover, those with HIV&#xD;
      disease and substance dependence often experience poor clinical outcomes as a result of&#xD;
      nonadherence to HIV treatment regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disulfiram (DIS) is an inhibitor of ALDH and has been reported to alter hepatic cytochrome&#xD;
      P450 enzyme function important to metabolism of many drugs frequently used in the treatment&#xD;
      of HIV/AIDS. Although approved for the treatment of alcohol dependence, DIS has been studied&#xD;
      as a treatment for cocaine addiction in recent years. DIS at the standard 250 mg daily dose&#xD;
      has been associated with significant reductions in cocaine use as well as alcohol use in&#xD;
      those with histories of concomitant cocaine-alcohol abuse. DIS 250 mg daily has been shown to&#xD;
      have a significant pharmacokinetic interaction with cocaine resulting in delayed cocaine&#xD;
      clearance. In order to more fully access possible use of DIS treatment for cocaine and/or&#xD;
      alcohol dependence in this population, it is important to determine if any excess risk is&#xD;
      conveyed as a result of drug interactions that might occur between DIS and the ARV&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be using a standard clinical pharmacology study design using a within-subject&#xD;
      design examining the two drug interaction studies between DIS (250 mg daily) and the&#xD;
      following medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, efavirenz 600 mg daily for 10 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Protease inhibitors atazanavir 400 mg daily for 8 days or ritonavir 200 mg daily for 8&#xD;
           days&#xD;
&#xD;
           Additional data will be collected and analyzed including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical data on effects of these medications alone and in combination on cardiac&#xD;
           conduction, hepatic function, and serum lipids will be obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The safety of co-administration of alcohol containing HIV preparations (ritonavir) with&#xD;
           DIS will be determined&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The effect of ARV on DIS function as determined by ALDH activity and DIS and metabolite&#xD;
           concentrations will be determined using a control sample within-subject design (DIS&#xD;
           doses of 62.5 mg and 250 mg daily) and between subjects design.&#xD;
