  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polymorphic light eruption (PLE) is a photodermatosis with an extremely high prevalence,&#xD;
      particularly among young women (up to 20%). The disease is characterized through itchy skin&#xD;
      lesions on sun-exposed body sites occurring after sun exposure mostly in spring and early&#xD;
      summer. Its etiopathogenesis is unknown but resistance to ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced&#xD;
      immunosuppression with subsequent immune reactions against skin photoneoantigens has been&#xD;
      suggested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phenomenon of UVR-induced immunosuppression (suppression of CHS) has been well known for&#xD;
      many years. Recent findings showed that regulatory T cells (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) (Tregs), a&#xD;
      subset of T helper cells, are crucial in UVR-induced immunosuppression. However, the&#xD;
      requirements for the maintenance of peripheral CD4+CD25+ T cells, important in suppression of&#xD;
      immune responses, are still incompletely understood. Recent work suggests that cutaneous&#xD;
      RANKL might be the physiologic missing link that couples UVR to immunosuppression. Epidermal&#xD;
      RANKL, expressed in keratinocytes of inflamed skin due to e.g. UVR exposure was shown to&#xD;
      control the number of Tregs via activation of dendritic cells, hereby mediating UVR-induced&#xD;
      immunosuppression (e.g. suppression of allergic contact hypersensitivity responses). In&#xD;
      addition to the suppression of local cutaneous hyperallergic responses, the development of&#xD;
      systemic autoimmunity is suppressed. A strong inducer of RANKL expression and of Tregs is&#xD;
      vitamin D3 that has been reported to have immunosuppressive effects. Interestingly, patients&#xD;
      with autoimmune disorders (e.g. lupus erythematosus) may exhibit reduced vitamin D3 blood&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized, double blinded left-right body side experimental comparison study was&#xD;
      designed to assess the preventive effect of the vitamin D3 analogue calcipotriol in patients&#xD;
      with PLE. The hypothesis is tested that treatment with a calcipotriol-containing cream can&#xD;
      prevent the UVR-induced development of PLE skin lesions. Better insight into the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of PLE may give clues to develop new therapeutic strategies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      PLE patients will be recruited through the Photodermatology Unit of the Department of&#xD;
      Dermatology, Medical University of Graz, Austria. Eligible patients will be identified&#xD;
      through diagnosis-related computer-assisted search in the electronic patient chart system of&#xD;
      the Unit. The diagnosis of PLE will be verified by patient's history, clinical symptoms,&#xD;
      histologic findings, laboratory studies and/or phototesting procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A calcipotriol-cream and a placebo cream are used in this study. Fifteen PLE patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled. On day 1, the individual minimal erythema dose (MED) is assessed on patients' skin&#xD;
      by exposure to a test ladder of solar-simulated UVR produced by a xenon arc source (Oriel&#xD;
      Corp. Darmstadt, Germany). From day 2 to 5, 0.5 individual MED exposures (increased by 0 to&#xD;
      30% per exposure, depending on the erythema response to a preceding dose) are given to a&#xD;
      total of four 10-by-10 cm skin test fields on symmetrically located, individual PLE&#xD;
      predilection sites on the trunk or extremities. These test fields are pretreated in a&#xD;
      randomized and double-blinded fashion either with the calcipotriol cream or the placebo cream&#xD;
      (twice a day) during 7 days before start of phototesting.&#xD;
