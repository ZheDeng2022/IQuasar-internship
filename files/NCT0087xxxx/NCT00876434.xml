      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uveitis is an inflammatory condition in which the patient's own immune system attacks&#xD;
           the eye, causing eye inflammation and vision loss. Patients with uveitis may be treated&#xD;
           with immunosuppressive medications to reduce the inflammation and prevent vision loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sirolimus is an immunosuppressive medication that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
           Administration (FDA) to prevent organ rejection following a kidney transplant.&#xD;
           Researchers think that sirolimus may affect the part of the immune system that may be an&#xD;
           important cause of uveitis, and may decrease the inflammation that causes uveitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In this study, sirolimus will be given as an injection under the outer layer of your&#xD;
           eye. The FDA has permitted the investigational use of sirolimus for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if subconjunctival injection of sirolimus is safe for treatment of uveitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To see if sirolimus is an effective treatment for uveitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients 18 years of age and older with active uveitis in one or both eyes. If a patient&#xD;
           has uveitis in both eyes, the one in which the inflammation is worse will be treated&#xD;
           during the study. The vision in the study eye must be at least 20/400.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have good liver function, and must be willing to practice sun protection&#xD;
           measures for 2 weeks following the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment with sirolimus in the study eye:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antibiotic and numbing eye drops will be given before the sirolimus injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 dose of sirolimus will be injected directly into the subconjunctiva (white part of the&#xD;
           eye).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antibiotic drops will be given for topical application 3 times per day for 2 days after&#xD;
           the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be followed for 16 weeks after sirolimus injection (initial visit and&#xD;
           follow-up visits in Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluations during the treatment period and follow-up visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination, including vital signs and body weight checks, and pregnancy test&#xD;
           for women who can become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full medical and ophthalmic history, involving questionnaires and discussion with&#xD;
           researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination, dilation, and photography, including measurements of retinal thickness&#xD;
           and fluorescent dye tests of blood flow in the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Because of the increased risk of skin cancer associated with sirolimus, patients ...&#xD;

      Objective: Uveitis refers to intraocular inflammatory diseases that are an important cause of&#xD;
      visual loss. Standard systemic immunosuppressive medications for uveitis can cause&#xD;
      significant adverse effects and many patients continue to experience disease flare-ups.&#xD;
      Sirolimus suppresses cytokine-driven T-cell proliferation and thus, inhibits the production,&#xD;
      signaling and activity of many growth factors relevant to uveitis. Subconjunctival sirolimus&#xD;
      administration could reduce or eliminate the need for topical and/or systemic&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs that could result in reduced morbidity. This protocol will&#xD;
      investigate subconjunctival sirolimus as a possible treatment for active anterior uveitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Five participants with active anterior uveitis will be initially accrued in&#xD;
      this study. Participants must require treatment for their uveitis with systemic and/or&#xD;
      topical anti-inflammatory medications at high frequency intervals [greater than or equal to&#xD;
      three times daily (T.I.D.)] or local steroid treatment (periocular steroid injections) is&#xD;
      contraindicated because of significant intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation with local&#xD;
      steroid treatments in the past (i.e., steroid responder), have at least a grade of 1+ for&#xD;
      anterior chamber cells and have visual acuity of at least 20/400 in the study eye. Up to&#xD;
      seven participants may be enrolled, as up to two participants may be accrued to replace&#xD;
      enrolled participants who withdraw from the study prior to receiving any study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a Phase I, non-randomized, prospective, uncontrolled single-center study to&#xD;
      evaluate subconjunctival sirolimus as a treatment for active anterior uveitis. All&#xD;
      participants will receive a single 30-microL (1,320 microg) subconjunctival sirolimus&#xD;
      injection in the study eye at baseline and will be followed for 16 weeks post-injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is the number of participants who experience at least a&#xD;
      2-step reduction in anterior chamber inflammation within four weeks post-injection. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include changes in visual acuity and anterior chamber inflammation grading, the&#xD;
      number of participants who experience a disease flare within the 16-week study duration and,&#xD;
      of the participants who experience a disease flare, the number of days to disease flare from&#xD;
      baseline. Secondary outcomes also include the presence or extent of cystoid macular edema.&#xD;

             or vaginal ring), intrauterine device, barrier methods with spermicide (diaphragm with&#xD;
             spermicide, condom and spermicide) or surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, tubal&#xD;
             ligation or vasectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants with a hysterectomy or vasectomy (or have a partner with a&#xD;
                  hysterectomy or vasectomy) are exempt from using two methods of contraception.&#xD;
                  However, female participants with a tubal ligation (or male participants who have&#xD;
                  a female partner with a tubal ligation) are not exempt, and are required to&#xD;
