  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical treatment of idiopathic Parkinson disease motor symptoms requires dopaminergic drugs,&#xD;
      with long term disabling side effects. (fluctuations, dyskinesia, ON/OFF phenomena). Use of&#xD;
      nicotine in Parkinson's disease has been suggested by the lowest prevalence of smokers among&#xD;
      Parkinsonian patients. However, controlled studies provided conflicting results. One of our&#xD;
      patients showed a substantial decrease of his parkinsonian symptoms under transdermal&#xD;
      nicotine-therapy. Currently, this patient has been treated since 8 years with an excellent&#xD;
      safety, especially on cardiovascular level. Otherwise, the investigators performed an open&#xD;
      pilot safety and feasibility study in 6 patients, which demonstrated the possibility of a&#xD;
      controlled study. In this study, all patients received daily doses during several months&#xD;
      until 105 mg/day and could, in parallel, decrease their L-Dopa and agonists doses, improving&#xD;
      their motor scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators now propose a phase II, controlled, single blind and randomised efficacy&#xD;
      study (n=40) in 2 parallel groups. (1 group transdermal nicotine-therapy / 1 control group&#xD;
      without additional therapy) The main objective is to verify the correlation between UPDRS&#xD;
      (score III) motor score and the administrated nicotine dose. This study will also allow the&#xD;
      evaluation of nicotine neuroprotective effect. The incrementation phase by weekly steps of 5&#xD;
      mg until 20 mg, then 10 mg to reach 90 mg/j or the maximal tolerated dose, will last on 11&#xD;
      weeks and will be followed by a 28 weeks phase at this stable dose. After this maximal dose&#xD;
      &quot;plateau phase&quot;, treatment will be progressively decreased by 15 mg weekly steps, over a de&#xD;
      6-week period followed by a five-week wash out phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into account results from the pilot study, a long-term high doses treatment, seems to&#xD;
      be liable to improve patients who deeply suffer from their disease. This is why the&#xD;
      investigators now propose this monocentric institutional project.&#xD;

      Experimental plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II controled study, in 40 patients, randomised in single blind, and in 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One group treated by transdermal nicotine-therapy (N= 20),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One group without additional therapy (N= 20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist in :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One phase of weekly incrementations of dose during 11 weeks,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Steps of 5 mg until 20 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Then steps of 10 mg until the dose of 90mg or the maximal tolerated dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One stable dose phase, (90 mg or maximal tolerated dose) during 28 weeks,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One phase of decrementing: treatment will be progressively decreased in a 6 weeks&#xD;
           period,&#xD;
