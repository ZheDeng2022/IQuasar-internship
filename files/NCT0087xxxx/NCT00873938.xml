    <textblock>
      With a change in malaria treatment policy to use combination antimalaria therapy, it is&#xD;
      envisaged that compliance to combination therapy would be less than that of monotherapy that&#xD;
      was being used for case management in Ghana. This is especially so as amodiaquine is&#xD;
      unpopular because of its side-effects and the combination therapy is not a single formulation&#xD;
      (fixed dose). Compliance may further be enhanced by community supervision through home visits&#xD;
      of combination antimalarial therapy in cases of uncomplicated malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study would assess compliance to Artesunate-Amodiaquine therapy. It would also assess&#xD;
      the effect of compliance to artesunate-amodiaquine therapy on clinical and parasitological&#xD;
      cure rates. This study targeting age groups above ten years, would complement a child&#xD;
      artesunate -amodiaquine efficacy study being undertaken by the same investigators in children&#xD;
      ten years and below at Kintampo District at the same time. The funding for the child study&#xD;
      has been approved by the Gates Malaria Partnership. Findings from both studies, involving all&#xD;
      age groups would be made available to the National Malaria Control Programme and other&#xD;
      stakeholders as practical information that may be beneficial to implementing policy change&#xD;
      process from antimalarial monotherapy to a combination therapy.&#xD;

      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine compliance to artesunate-amodiaquine therapy among patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      acute uncomplicated malaria in the Kintampo District Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine patients compliance to each of the two drugs (artesunate or amodiaquine )&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine reasons for differential compliance to either of the two drugs (artesunate&#xD;
           or amodiaquine).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine patients perception and acceptance of artesunate-amodiaquine therapy for&#xD;
           acute uncomplicated malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the effect of compliance of artesunate-amodiaquine therapy on clinical and&#xD;
           parasitological improvement in acute uncomplicated malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The study will be a pragmatic randomized control trial. Patients will be&#xD;
      recruited based on an inclusion criteria stated below. Baseline clinical symptoms of malaria&#xD;
      and presence of malaria parasite (Plasmodium falciparum) in the blood of eligible patients&#xD;
      reporting sick at the health facility would be determined. Study patients would be randomized&#xD;
      into one of two groups, intervention and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention refers to supervisory home visits by a trained community volunteer to ensure&#xD;
      that paticipants comply to treatment during the artesunate-amodiaquine therapy. Supervisory&#xD;
      home visits by a trained community volunteer form a major component of the Community Health&#xD;
      Planning and Services programme being implemented by the Ghana Health Service. The&#xD;
      intervention group would be supervised during artesunate-amodiaquine therapy and the control&#xD;
      group would not be supervised during artesunate-amodiaquine therapy. The primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures below will be determined and compared among the intervention and&#xD;
      control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome is compliance to artesunate-amodiaquine combination therapy. It is defined&#xD;
      as no artesunate or amodiaquine left on the fourth day after start of treatment of a malaria&#xD;
      episode. This would be assessed by the investigators direct observation of the blister&#xD;
      package of artesunate-Amodiaquine tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reasons for non-compliance would be determined by response of study participants.&#xD;
           Care-takers of children below 18 years will answer on behalf of their children with the&#xD;
           child's assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants' perception and acceptance of supervision: It would be assessed by&#xD;
           responses given by study participants in an indepth interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parasite clearance rates on day 14 and 28 i.e. the proportion of study participants in&#xD;
           each group with P. falciparum parasiteamia at day 14 and 28 determined by blood smear&#xD;
           microscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical cure rates by days 14 and 28 i.e. the proportion of study participants in each&#xD;
           group with symptoms of malaria on days 14 and 28 determined by a structured&#xD;
           questionnaire at these times.&#xD;
