  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the face of scant literature on the subject, the investigators aim to more clearly&#xD;
      identify effective treatments for adolescent bulimia nervosa (BN) through a treatment study&#xD;
      comparing two current treatments (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Adolescents, CBT-A and&#xD;
      Family Based Therapy for Bulimia Nervosa, FBT-BN) for the disorder in comparison with a&#xD;
      non-specific therapy, Supportive Psychotherapy for Adolescent Bulimia (SPT). Additionally,&#xD;
      the investigators hope to provide clinicians with information on treatment efficacy,&#xD;
      variables that might influence outcome, and processes that may affect treatment efficacy that&#xD;
      will guide them in their efforts to treat adolescent BN.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BN is a serious disorder that is characterized by extreme concerns about body weight and&#xD;
      shape, dieting, and the disinhibited eating behaviors of binging and purging. There are no&#xD;
      published randomized clinical trials of psychotherapy treatment for Bulimia Nervosa in&#xD;
      adolescents although it often onsets in this age group. There is evidence that some&#xD;
      treatments are effective, but none has been empirically tested. Because Bulimia Nervosa is a&#xD;
      serious medical and psychiatric illness it is important to learn efficacious ways to treat&#xD;
      this disorder, especially in its early stages. Treatments used in this study are the best&#xD;
      known treatments for adults with Bulimia Nervosa. The investigators hope to learn which of&#xD;
      two previously studied treatments might be superior to the other, in an effort to guide&#xD;
      clinicians in treatment choices. Successfully treating the disorder early on (even in those&#xD;
      adolescents with partial BN, characterized by binge eating and purging at least one time per&#xD;
      week over a 6 month period) may reduce the number of cases requiring treatment during&#xD;
      adulthood, leading to possible reduction in severity of associated psychopathology and lower&#xD;
      costs, as well as enable individuals to lead more productive lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the neglect of adolescent BN in the research literature and the need for information to&#xD;
      guide the clinical treatment of this disorder, this study's primary aim is to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of CBT-A to FBT-BN in decreasing binge eating and purging episodes in adolescents&#xD;
      with BN and partial BN (defined as binge eating and purging at least one time per week for&#xD;
      the past six months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last 1 and a half years and will consist of 6 months of&#xD;
      treatment and a follow-up session at 6 and 12 months post-treatment. All participants will&#xD;
      first undergo baseline assessments, which include interviews and questionnaires about&#xD;
      psychological history and BN symptoms, and an Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) interview.&#xD;
      All treatment assignments consist of 18 sessions of therapy over the course of 6 months.&#xD;

    <description>FBT helps parents to take an active role in guiding their child through eating disorder treatment. In this therapy, the parents are supported in helping their child stop bingeing, purging and engaging in other harmful weight-control behaviors. The way in which the eating disorder has impacted the family and the adolescent's development is also explored.</description>

                  worsening of their condition during treatment. The decision whether or not to&#xD;
                  allow these individuals to continue to participate in treatment will be made by&#xD;
                  the therapist in consultation with the treatment supervisor.&#xD;
