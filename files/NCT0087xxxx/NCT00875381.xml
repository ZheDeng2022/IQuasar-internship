  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate and define the mean number, degree of confluence,&#xD;
      and depth of penetration of melanocytes in chronically sun exposed skin of the head and neck&#xD;
      using Mart-1 immunostains on frozen sections. The study was conducted to confirm whether&#xD;
      similar results were found using permanent sections. The present study used hematoxaline and&#xD;
      eosin (H&amp;E) staining as well as Mart-1 staining, and included patients from both Mayo Clinic&#xD;
      Jacksonville and Rochester.&#xD;

      For each study participant we recorded their age, sex, state they lived in, tumor type, tumor&#xD;
      location, recent sun exposure (during the two weeks prior to the surgery), whether or not a&#xD;
      follicle was present on the slide, and if so the follicular extension (mm) from the granular&#xD;
      layer, presence of atypia, nesting, pagetoid spread. Two slides were obtained; one stained&#xD;
      with Mart-1; the other with H&amp;E. For both, melanocyte counts per high power field (400 X HPF&#xD;
      magnification) were obtained in three locations of the slide. The mean of the 3 counts was&#xD;
      used for analysis, though the individual counts were considered in some data summaries (see&#xD;
      below). Classification of photo-aging according to the Glogau scale was noted by the surgeon&#xD;
      as type1: &quot;no wrinkles&quot;; type II &quot;wrinkles in motion&quot;; type III &quot;wrinkles at rest&quot; and type&#xD;
      IV &quot;only wrinkles.&quot; Confluence was categorized by the number of adjacent melanocytes as none,&#xD;
      mild (2 side-by-side), moderate (3-6), or severe (7 or more).&#xD;

    <measure>The mean number of melanocytes per high power field for Mart-1 was 12.7 in FL and 11.2 in MN. Using H&amp;E, the means were 10.3 and 8.3 for FL and MN respectively.</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evidence of higher means in FL than in MN after adjusting for age and gender (p&lt;0.001 for H&amp;E, p=0.08 for Mart-1) and strong evidence of an increase in observed numbers of melanocytes with use of the Mart-1 stain compared to the H&amp;E stain (p&lt;0.001)</measure>

      The proposed dog-ears excised, that were to be discarded during reconstruction, were&#xD;
      evaluated for the presence of any visible lesions (i.e. ephelid, lentigo, seborrheic&#xD;
      keratosis, nevi). Dog-ears with any skin lesions were excluded. The specimens were inked by&#xD;
      the surgeon on the side to be cut by the histotechnician. The specimens were placed in&#xD;
      formalin bottles and submitted to the pathology department at Mayo Clinic Rochester for&#xD;
      processing. The tissue was cut (4 microns) along its long access and stained with routine H&amp;&#xD;
      E and Mart-1 (MelanA) immunostains.&#xD;
