    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate quality of patient-controlled peroral analgesia after&#xD;
      cesarian section using the combination of tramadol and acetaminophen. Research hypothesis is&#xD;
      that the combination reduces pain at leg rising more than tramadol alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Caesarean section rate is growing in western countries (from 9% by 1980, to 12% by 1990 up to&#xD;
      22-24% in 2002)1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain after Caesarean section involves 2 components, somatic pain from the wound and visceral&#xD;
      pain from uterine contractions2. Different mechanisms underlie somatic and visceral pain&#xD;
      transmission, at spinal and supraspinal levels, supporting different sensitivity to&#xD;
      analgetics2. Pain at rest is usually well controlled by parenteral opioids, while pain&#xD;
      induced by movements is less responsive to opioids, requesting higher doses with an increase&#xD;
      of side effects3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond the concern of short term recovery, postoperative pain management has an impact on the&#xD;
      risk of developing residual pain after surgery4. Following Caesarean section 18% of patients&#xD;
      still suffer from pain 3 months after surgery. 12% still complain after 10 months and for 6%&#xD;
      pain is a significant problem, interfering with quality of life and being present daily or&#xD;
      almost daily5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central sensitization, clinically expressed as hyperalgesia and allodynia, not only&#xD;
      contributes to postoperative pain perception, but also is associated with the presence of&#xD;
      chronic pain state6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aside from tissue damage, the most striking risk factor for developing residual pain seems to&#xD;
      be the level of immediate postoperative pain7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From all published data, it is clear that opioids alone do not completely relieve pain after&#xD;
      Caesarean section. Achieving effective acute pain control and minimizing side effects, is&#xD;
      best possible by the combination of several analgetics acting through different mechanisms&#xD;
      (so called balanced analgesia).8-11&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tramadol is an effective postoperative analgetic, combining mainly µ-opioid and monoaminerg&#xD;
      actions with good clinical effect in treating somatic and visceral pain12,13. The&#xD;
      postoperative use of tramadol after Caesarean is insufficiently evaluated. Studies evaluate a&#xD;
      short period of 614 or 815 hours postoperatively. Metaanalysis sum up a mix of&#xD;
      non-gynaecological and gynaecological data together. Edwards et al. 2002 used data from 7&#xD;
      unpublished randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trials assessing tramadol and&#xD;
      acetaminophen with dental, gynaecological and orthopaedic patients15. Moore et al. 199616&#xD;
      used 18 primary trials for data collection, from which only one had been published (Sunshine&#xD;
      et al. 1992)14. Thus clear statement of tramadol after Caesarean section is not possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NSAID´s, widely used as additives for postoperative pain management, have the inconvenient of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal side-effects, increased risk for bleeding and of being secreted in breast&#xD;
      milk11. The product prescription of diclofenac, ibuprofen and ketoprufen clearly&#xD;
      contraindicates its use by breast feeding women. There is little experience with the use of&#xD;
      COXII-Inhibitors by breast feeding women as well. Therefore these drugs are not recommended&#xD;
      for postoperative use after Caesarean Section11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adding acetaminophen to weak opioids increases the analgetic potency of the opioid&#xD;
      component16 and is widely used in obstetrics 14,17. According to the product information&#xD;
      acetaminophen is recommended for breast feeding women as no neonatal side-effects have been&#xD;
      observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory studies with rats have shown that acetaminophen is able to prevent hyperalgesia&#xD;
      and block spinal sensitisation induced by NMDA and Substance P18. The same has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in a laboratory setting with tramadol, that is able to prevent and reverse&#xD;
      hyperalgesic behaviour in rats19. Furthermore it has been shown that the combination of&#xD;
      acetaminophen and tramadol is very effective in inhibiting the quantification of&#xD;
      proinflammatory mediators (PGE2, TNFα) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in preventing the&#xD;
      development of hyperalgesia20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a human pain model, it could be demonstrated, that combining the drugs enhances&#xD;
      antihyperalgesia and leads to supra-additive analgesia21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a clinical setting, however, the combination of acetaminophen and tramadol and its effects&#xD;
      on postoperative sensitisation and pain has not been evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tramadol and acetaminophen are both available for oral administration22. Oral analgetic&#xD;
      treatments with various drugs (such as ibuprofen, oxycodone-acetaminophen or metamizol) after&#xD;
      Caesarean section have been shown of being superior in terms of patient satisfaction and&#xD;
      analgesia compared with parenteral opioid and iv. PCA devices23-25. Parenteral narcotics in&#xD;
      general are associated with nausea, vomiting, constipation, pruritus, respiratory depression&#xD;
      and sedation. Additionally, PCA devices and their associated stands are cumbersome, which&#xD;
      potentially could interfere with newborn infant care. Other drawbacks include the expense and&#xD;
      the need for close patient supervision 26-28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oral combination of acetaminophen and tramadol in respect of pain control and&#xD;
      postoperative sensitization after Caesarean section has not been evaluated yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2: Study objective: Study objective is to evaluate the analgetic and antihyperalgetic&#xD;
      potency of oral tramadol and acetaminophen in combination and alone after Caesarean Section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the following RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS will be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combining tramadol with acetaminophen reduces pain atleg rising more than Tramadol alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combining tramadol with acetaminophen has a dose sparing effect on tramadol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side-effects can be reduced by the combination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The combination reduces the area of Pin-Prick hyperalgesia surrounding the incision more&#xD;
           than tramadol alone&#xD;
