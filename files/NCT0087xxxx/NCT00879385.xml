      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.To evaluate the safety and feasibility of the sequential use of a DNA methyltransferase&#xD;
      (DNMT) inhibitor (decitabine) with a targeted biological agent against EGFR (panitumumab) for&#xD;
      KRAS wild type tumors in the second or third line treatment of advanced metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine re-expression or a reduction in promoter methylation in genes involved in&#xD;
           tumor suppressor pathways known to be important in colorectal cancer (CRC) or involved&#xD;
           in EGFR signaling pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate overall response (OR = CR +PR) according to RECIST criteria at 2, 4, and 6&#xD;
           cycles. Progression free survival, measured as the first evidence of tumor growth from&#xD;
           the start of treatment will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measure CEA levels at the beginning of each cycle to examine if they correlate with&#xD;
           treatment response or disease progression.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are living longer and running out of therapeutic&#xD;
      options due to disease resistance. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been validated&#xD;
      as a therapeutic target in colorectal cancer (CRC). Ligand binding to EGFR activates the&#xD;
      RAS/RAF/MAPK, STAT, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, which together modulate cellular&#xD;
      proliferation, adhesion, migration, and survival. Anti-EGFR targeted antibodies cetuximab and&#xD;
      panitumumab administered as monotherapy in CRC have shown response rates of approximately 9%&#xD;
      and 17% respectively (Amado et al., 2008; Saltz et al., 2004). Single agent panitumumab has&#xD;
      been approved for use in third line colorectal cancer and has been shown improve progression&#xD;
      free survival over supportive care. Further subset analysis showed the response rate of 17%&#xD;
      was confined to patients with KRAS wild type tumors only and that this group (approximately&#xD;
      60-70% of all CRC patients) should be considered for further study (Amado et al., 2008).&#xD;
      According to the Huntsman Cancer Hospital registry, colorectal cancer patients are the&#xD;
      largest disease group within our gastrointestinal cancer group and many have or eventually&#xD;
      will progress on available therapy or are or will become intolerant to the side effects of&#xD;
      second line therapies such as oxaliplatin neuropathy or irinotecan induced diarrhea, yet&#xD;
      still are candidates for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the lab through translational research studies, we hope to identify re-expression or a&#xD;
      reduction in promoter methylation of genes involved in tumor suppressor pathways known to be&#xD;
      important in colorectal cancer (CRC) or involved in EGFR signaling pathway. Candidate genes&#xD;
      we will evaluate will include genes described in prior studies as associated with the CpG&#xD;
      island methylator phenotype (CIMP) as well as genes previously reported to be hypermethylated&#xD;
      in association with colorectal neoplasia. These will include APC, SFRP family members, CDH-1&#xD;
      (e-cadherin) and p16 (Belshaw et al., 2008; Lind et al., 2004; Suehiro et al., 2008). Other&#xD;
      genes more specific to EGFR or KRAS signaling that will be assessed include: RASSF1A , a&#xD;
      tumor suppressor gene know to be hypermethylated in several human cancers including CRC, is&#xD;
      occasionally associated with KRAS wild type and when silenced by methylation allows for RAS&#xD;
      activation (Kang et al., 2006; Oliveira et al., 2005); SOX17, a member of the transcription&#xD;
      factor superfamily know to be hypermethylated in CRC and lead to disrupted Wnt signaling&#xD;
      (Zhang et al., 2008); SOCS-1 a negative regulator of STAT3 an activating ligand for EGFR that&#xD;
      has been shown to be silenced by hypermethylation and allow for constitutive signaling via&#xD;
      EGFR (Lee et al., 2006); and PTEN, a tumor suppressor that antagonizes the PI3K- AKT/PKB&#xD;
      signaling pathway by dephosphorylating phosphoinositides (Noro et al., 2007). Further&#xD;
      candidate genes may be discovered or added based on preliminary data and ongoing research.&#xD;
      Methylation analysis and gene expression pattern changes will be done using methylation&#xD;
      specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing of genes known to be involved in EGFR signaling&#xD;
      pathways and colorectal neoplasia as described above. We have prior data from our own work as&#xD;
      well as others to suggest the use of a hypomethylating agent can resensitize colon cancer&#xD;
      cells to therapeutic agents (Karpf et al., 1999; Morita et al., 2006). The translational&#xD;
      component of this research will be supported by institutional translational grant awarded to&#xD;
      the PI, Kimberly Jones, as of July 1st, 2008. This information may help identify other&#xD;
      important targets and allow for the design of better combination therapies. We plan to do&#xD;
      these assays on weekly blood and buccal samples while patients are on therapy, on epithelial&#xD;
      cells swabbed from panitumumab associated skin rash, and on archived or biopsied tumor&#xD;
      specimens when available (from KRAS testing (required) and optional end-of treatment biopsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacokinetic profile for decitabine has been well described and offers several&#xD;
      possible dosing schedules feasible for clinical practice and combination with other agents.&#xD;
      Decitabine is currently being tested in combination with standard cytotoxic agents. It has&#xD;
      shown some activity in solid tumors, however, myelosuppression is a common side effect,&#xD;
      especially when given concurrently with other myelosuppressive therapy (carboplatin)&#xD;
      (Appleton et al., 2007; Plimack et al., 2007). We propose a novel study using decitabine in&#xD;
      combination with a non-myelosuppressive targeted biological agent as well as giving it&#xD;
      sequentially rather than concurrently to try to maximize the effect of the second drug by&#xD;
      dosing it during the demethylation window. In the dose-finding study reported by Appleton et&#xD;
      al., they recommended a dose of 90 mg/m2 over 6 hours every 28 days, but went up as high as&#xD;
      135 mg/m2 and combined this with carboplatin (Appleton et al., 2007). We have chosen a dose&#xD;
      of 45 mg/m2 decitabine every 14 days based on its reported safety and biological equivalence&#xD;
      from this study. There was no grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicities observed with 3 patients&#xD;
      infused with 45 mg/m2 of decitabine followed by 5 AUC carboplatin; there was 1 episode of&#xD;
      grade 3 leukopenia and 1 of grade 3 neutropenia in 4 patients infused with 45 mg/m2 of&#xD;
      decitabine followed by 6 AUC carboplatin (Appleton et al., 2007). At the higher dose of 90&#xD;
      mg/m2 with 5 AUC carboplatin in 13 patients, 5 episodes of grade 4 leukopenia or neutropenia&#xD;
      were observed; in 10 patients with 90 mg/m2 and 6 AUC carboplatin, there were 4 episodes of&#xD;
      grade 4 leukopenia or neutropenia. The proposed infusion over 2 hours should not create any&#xD;
      infusion rate toxicities and will be a schedule patients will tolerate. Daily lower dose&#xD;
      infusions used in hematological disorders maybe be efficacious but daily intravenous&#xD;
      chemotherapy impacts patient's quality of life significantly. Decitabine also has an&#xD;
      elimination half-life of 30 minutes, so will clear the body rapidly. The proposed&#xD;
      administration of the decitabine twice, at half the dose, in a 28-day period should be better&#xD;
      tolerated than the 90 mg/m2 combined with carboplatin. The myelosuppressive toxicity which is&#xD;
      the main toxicity of decitabine should be less significant as it is not being combined with a&#xD;
      second myelosuppressive agent as it was with carboplatin. Low dose decitabine (45 mg/m2) has&#xD;
      nearly equivalent hypomethylating effects to 90 mg/m2 in both blood and buccal cells. The&#xD;
      more frequent dosing (every 2 weeks versus every 4 weeks) should maintain the hypomethylating&#xD;
      effect at a lower dose. Additionally, we propose a novel dosing schedule where our second&#xD;
      agent, panitumumab, will be given on alternating weeks and targeting the EGFR pathway when it&#xD;
      is hypomethylated from the prior decitabine treatment. Our work as well as others, has&#xD;
      demonstrated that specific promoter hypomethylation is observed by 8-14 days after the start&#xD;
      of treatment and genomic DNA reverts to baseline levels by 28 to 35 days after the start of&#xD;
      treatment (Appleton et al., 2007; Samlowski et al., 2005, Kantarjian, 2007 #23).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also be assessing clinical response and progression free survival (PFS) and comparing&#xD;
      it to historical controls of patients treated with panitumumab monotherapy. If the&#xD;
      combination can be given safely and responses are seen that are equal to or better than the&#xD;
      single agent panitumumab data, we would plan a multi-center larger phase II trial.&#xD;
