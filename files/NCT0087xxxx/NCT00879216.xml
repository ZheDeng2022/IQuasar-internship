  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to investigate whether the hypotensive effects of an&#xD;
      alpha-blocker are increased when VA106483 is given at the same time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VA106483 is intended to be used as a treatment for patients suffering from nocturia (defined&#xD;
      as waking to urinate at least once per night between periods of sleep). Nocturia is a&#xD;
      condition that often worsens as sufferers get older. This may be due to an over-active&#xD;
      bladder muscle, the bladder being able to hold less urine at night-time or over production of&#xD;
      urine in the bladder at night. Some of the treatments available for nocturia have&#xD;
      side-effects which make them unsuitable for elderly patients. These side-effects have not&#xD;
      been seen in studies with VA106483, which makes it potentially suitable for treating elderly&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nocturia is commonly associated with Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (or BPH, a non-cancerous&#xD;
      enlargement of the prostate gland, which often results in problems passing water). Of the&#xD;
      patients who suffer from BPH, an estimated 40-85% experience the symptoms of waking at night&#xD;
      to pass water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments which are commonly prescribed for BPH include alpha-blockers which work by&#xD;
      improving urine flow by a muscle relaxant effect. Alpha-blockers are known to cause&#xD;
      hypotension (lowering of blood pressure which can cause dizziness in some patients) . Since&#xD;
      it is likely that subjects may be co-prescribed VA106483 and alpha-blockers, the purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to determine that giving VA106483 does not increase the hypotensive effects of&#xD;
      alpha-blockers&#xD;
