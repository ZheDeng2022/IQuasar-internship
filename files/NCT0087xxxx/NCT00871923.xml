  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn whether Tarceva (erlotinib&#xD;
      hydrochloride), when given in addition to whole brain radiation therapy, is better to treat&#xD;
      brain metastases in patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
    </textblock>

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erlotinib hydrochloride is designed to block the activity of a protein found on the surface&#xD;
      of many tumor cells that may control tumor growth and survival. This may stop tumors from&#xD;
      growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take the study drug on&#xD;
      Days 1-6 before receiving radiation therapy. You will take 1 pill each day at least 1 hour&#xD;
      before or 2 hours after eating. You will take the study drug while you are receiving&#xD;
      radiation therapy. You will continue to take the study drug daily after the radiation therapy&#xD;
      is complete for as long as the study doctor thinks it is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will record at what time each day you take the study drug on a calendar that the will be&#xD;
      provided to you. You will bring this calendar with you to each of your study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the time you are taking the study drug, you must tell the research staff if you have&#xD;
      any changes in the drugs that you are taking. If you feel you are having any problems from&#xD;
      the study drug before starting radiation therapy, you must tell the study doctor right away.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Day 6 of taking the study drug, you will begin radiation therapy. You will receive&#xD;
      radiation therapy 1 time each day (Monday through Fridays only) for a total of 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a week during radiation therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a quality of life questionnaire (at the last week visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a mini-mental status exam (at the last week visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any changes in the drugs you may be taking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about how you are feeling and any side effects that you may be having&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have blood drawn (about 1/2 teaspoon) for lab tests if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One month after Radiation therapy follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a follow up visit 1 month after radiation therapy is complete. The study&#xD;
           doctor will decide if you will continue to take the study drug at the follow-up visit.&#xD;
           The following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an MRI or CT of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your vital signs will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a quality of life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a mini-mental status exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any changes in the drugs you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about how you are feeling and any side effects that you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have blood drawn (about 1/2 teaspoon) for lab tests if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visits (While on Tarceva):&#xD;
&#xD;
      If, at the end-of-study visit, the doctor decides that you will continue to take the study&#xD;
      drug, you will have a follow-up visit with the research nurse 1 time each month. At these&#xD;
      visits, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (If unable to return to MDACC, this visit will be conducted over the telephone and&#xD;
      arrangements will be made to mail study Tarceva medication.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive a 30-day supply of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will bring in your study drug calendar for the nurse to review.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about how you are feeling and any side effects that you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will also be asked about any changes in the drugs you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1/2 teaspoon) may be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests and procedures will be performed every 3 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an MRI or CT of the brain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your vital signs will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visit (Discontinuation of Study Drug):&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a follow up visit with the research nurse 1 month after your last dose of the&#xD;
      study drug, and the following will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (If unable to return to MDACC, this visit will be conducted over the telephone and&#xD;
      arrangements will be made to have the study Tarceva medication and medication diary returned&#xD;
      by mail.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about how you are feeling and any side effects that you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will return your study drug calendar and any remaining Tarceva tablets to the&#xD;
           research nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will also be asked about any changes in the drug you may be taking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your vital signs will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests and procedures will be performed every 3 months (off Tarceva) for the&#xD;
      first 2 years then every 6 months thereafter:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an MRI or CT of the brain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are unable to return for your follow up visits due to physical conditions, you&#xD;
           will be contacted by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Study Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will remain on study for as long as the study doctor thinks you are benefitting from the&#xD;
      study drug. You will be taken off study treatment early if the disease gets worse, you&#xD;
      experience intolerable side effects, or your doctor thinks that it is no longer in your best&#xD;
      interest to continue to receive treatment on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Erlotinib hydrochloride is FDA approved and commercially&#xD;
      available. It has not been FDA approved to treat NSCLC that has spread to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 20 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

The KPS was to allow physicians to evaluate a patient's survival. The higher KPS scores, the better treatment outcome.</description>

        <description>Overall Survival will be estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier (1958) using the intent-to-treat principle. The participants overall survival measured at 6 month, 1-year and 2 years.</description>
        <time_frame>From date of registration until the date of first documented death or lost to follow up, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years.</time_frame>
        <population>Twenty patients from University of Arizona and 20 patients at MDACC for a total of 40 patients were combined for statistical analysis for Median Survival. We excluded 4 MDACC patients because: 1 patients withdrew consent prior to protocol treatment, I patient death during radiotherapy, 2 patients early death without follow-up data.</population>
