  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of a new behavioral therapy for adults with&#xD;
      trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trichotillomania (TTM) is a disorder in which people compulsively pull out their own hair.&#xD;
      Treatments for TTM sometimes do not have long-term effectiveness. Acceptance and commitment&#xD;
      therapy (ACT) is a therapeutic approach thought to have longer lasting effects than standard&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches, because ACT focuses on accepting thoughts and&#xD;
      behaviors as opposed to changing them. Previous research indicates that a combination of ACT&#xD;
      and habit reversal behavioral therapy is more effective than no treatment. This study will&#xD;
      test whether a combination of ACT and behavioral therapy, called acceptance enhanced&#xD;
      behavioral therapy (AEBT), is more effective than the current standard treatment for TTM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last 12 weeks, and follow-up assessments will last for 6&#xD;
      months. At study entry, participants will complete a brief intelligence test and an in-person&#xD;
      interview about their medical history, psychiatric history, and hair pulling. At their second&#xD;
      visit, participants will have digital pictures taken of their hair-pulling sites and complete&#xD;
      two computer tasks measuring their response inhibition and cognitive flexibility. After the&#xD;
      second visit, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either AEBT or&#xD;
      psychoeducation and supportive therapy (PST)-a standard treatment for TTM. Both treatments&#xD;
      will involve ten 1-hour sessions completed over 12 weeks. Assessments of participants will&#xD;
      occur after 6 weeks of treatment, at treatment completion, and after 6 months. These&#xD;
      assessments will measure treatment effectiveness, based on several clinical scales and&#xD;
      measures of TTM symptoms. Participants who receive PST during this study will be offered AEBT&#xD;
      afterward.&#xD;
