  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and systemic exposure of an experimental&#xD;
      influenza (flu) treatment medication called DAS181. DAS181 is a dry powder that is&#xD;
      administered via oral inhalation using a special device. Study participants will include&#xD;
      healthy non-smoking males and females, ages 18-65. They will be given either DAS181 or&#xD;
      placebo. Participants will remain in the clinic overnight to be watched for health changes&#xD;
      for 24 hours after receiving the medication. Study procedures include: physical exams, chest&#xD;
      x-rays, ECGs, lung function tests, collection of blood and urine samples, and throat swabs.&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will occur on study days 2, 7, 14 and 30.&#xD;
