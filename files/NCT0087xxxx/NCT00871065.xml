  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rupture of a cerebral aneurysm is a serious medical condition that may result in permanent&#xD;
      disability or even death just related to the aneurysm rupture itself. Patients who undergo&#xD;
      successful surgical treatment of their aneurysm will rarely experience problems related to&#xD;
      that specific aneurysm in the future. However, blood that is on the surface of the brain from&#xD;
      the initial aneurysm rupture is very irritating to other blood vessels that it comes in&#xD;
      contact with. When these blood vessels become irritated, they spasm and become narrower. This&#xD;
      narrowing restricts blood flow through the vessel, and if severe can result in a stroke that&#xD;
      is caused by inadequate blood flow through the vessel. Depending on location and severity,&#xD;
      this condition of vessel spasm (cerebral vasospasm) may result in permanent disability or&#xD;
      death. Treatment to prevent cerebral vasospasm decreases the risk of stroke. This research is&#xD;
      trying to see if a medication that is FDA approved for the treatment of lung disease and&#xD;
      sexual dysfunction can be used to prevent and/or treat cerebral vasospasm.&#xD;

      When a cerebral aneurysm ruptures, the surface of the brain and its blood vessels are covered&#xD;
      with clotted blood. This condition is called subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Subarachnoid&#xD;
      hemorrhage secondary to rupture of a cerebral aneurysm is a medical condition associated with&#xD;
      a high morbidity and mortality; approximately 10-15% of patients die before reaching medical&#xD;
      care, and overall mortality is approximately 45%. Of those that survive, 30% suffer permanent&#xD;
      disability graded as moderate to severe, and two-thirds of survivors never return to the same&#xD;
      quality of life as they had prior to their hemorrhage. A large number of patients (30-70%)&#xD;
      who are able to make it to the hospital and have successful treatment of their aneurysm will&#xD;
      develop delayed cerebral vasospasm that is related to the blood clot from their initial&#xD;
      aneurysm rupture. Of patients that survive their initial aneurysm rupture, vasospasm results&#xD;
      in an additional 7% mortality and another 7% of severe disabilities secondary to ischemic&#xD;
      strokes from severe spasm of cerebral arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm has been a topic of significant research. The&#xD;
      occurrence and severity are directly related to the volume of hemorrhage and the thickness of&#xD;
      the blood clot encasing the arteries. Arterial vasospasm and impaired vasodilation are&#xD;
      delayed processes that have a gradual onset, typically starting no earlier than 3 days&#xD;
      post-hemorrhage and clinically resolving within 12 days of the initial aneurysm rupture.&#xD;
      Breakdown of the clotted subarachnoid blood impairs the normal vasodilator and constrictor&#xD;
      mechanisms of the cerebral arteries by altering the levels of several molecules including&#xD;
      nitric oxide (NO), a vasodilator. Nitric oxide is normally produced by vascular endothelial&#xD;
      cells and leads to vasodilation by stimulating the enzyme soluble guanylate cyclase. This&#xD;
      enzyme catalyzes the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which is&#xD;
      responsible for vasodilation through both direct and indirect actions. Selective deactivation&#xD;
      of cGMP is accomplished by the enzyme phosphodiesterase subtype V (PDE-V). Studies have&#xD;
      revealed elevated levels of PDE-V and diminished levels of cGMP in animals with&#xD;
      experimentally induced SAH, while levels of nitric oxide synthase remain stable after&#xD;
      hemorrhage. This prior research points toward SAH causing an enhancement in PDE-V activity,&#xD;
      subsequently decreasing cGMP levels and impairing normal vasodilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Papaverine, a nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, is beneficial and selectively used&#xD;
      for treatment of active vasospasm. Its use is limited by its short duration of action, and&#xD;
      its nonspecific nature results in systemic vasodilation and subsequent hypotension.&#xD;
      Sildenafil citrate, a selective PDE-V inhibitor, has been shown to enhance the reactivity of&#xD;
      the cerebral vasculature in normal healthy adults and has been shown to decrease the severity&#xD;
      of vasospasm in animals with experimentally induced SAH. These effects have been noted with&#xD;
      minimal effects on systemic hemodynamics. Given that sildenafil citrate has safely&#xD;
      demonstrated the expected clinical effect of cerebral arterial dilation in normal healthy&#xD;
      humans as well as animals with and without induced SAH, the aim of this study is to determine&#xD;
      if this medicine shows efficacy in humans with SAH secondary to ruptured aneurysm.&#xD;
