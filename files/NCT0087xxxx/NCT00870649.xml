    <textblock>
      Objectives:To reduce the risk of S. haematobium pathology recurrences during the three years&#xD;
      following vaccine administration and to control the safety of this therapeutic strategy in&#xD;
      children exposed to urinary schistosomiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology : Phase III trial, self-contained, randomized, double blind, in two parallel&#xD;
      groups receiving 3 injections at D0, W4, W8 and a boost at W52, one group receiving&#xD;
      &quot;Bilhvax&quot;, the other one placebo, in S. haematobium infected children pretreated by two doses&#xD;
      of PZQ (at W9 and W8) Patient included : Infected school children, 6 to 9 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective : To demonstrate a significant delay of recurrence of the schistosomiasis&#xD;
      pathology in vaccine group compared to control group in the 3 years period following the&#xD;
      first administration (between D0 and W152).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective : safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration : February 2009 to March 2012&#xD;

      Patient inclusion (detailed criteria):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children in CI or CP classes of public schools in St Louis Region (Senegal) A male or female&#xD;
      between, and including, 6 and 9 years of age at the time of the first vaccination Free of&#xD;
      obvious health problems excepted schistosomiasis as established by clinical examination&#xD;
      (W8-W1) Found positive for S. haematobium infection during the selection period (W12 à W9) :&#xD;
      microhaematuria ≥ 2+ et Urinary Filtration, UF ≥ 50 eggs of Sh/10ml urine Written inform&#xD;
      consent obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject (W9) and child acceptance&#xD;
      Pretreated with 2 doses of 40mg/kg PZQ (at W9 and W8) Absence of heavy lesions of the urinary&#xD;
      tract under echotomography (W8 et W1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective (detailed):&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate a significant delay of recurrence of the schistosomiasis pathology in vaccine&#xD;
      group compared to control group in the 3 years period following the first administration&#xD;
      (between D0 and W152).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criterion of meeting the recurrence is the association of :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive microscopic haematuria (positivity by urinary stick : ≥ 1+)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  either during the active visits (W82, W100, W117, W134, or W152).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  or after spontaneous complaint of the patient at any time Positive parasitological test&#xD;
           defined as the presence of at least one living egg of S. haematobium during one out of&#xD;
           three UF (one UF per day/3 days during one week). The delay of the first recurrence is&#xD;
           defined as the delay between the date of inclusion and the date of the positive&#xD;
           parasitological test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations : The number of patients necessary to detect the expected&#xD;
      difference after 3 years of study (50% of recurrence in vaccinated group versus 70% in&#xD;
      placebo group), with a statistical power of 80% and a bilateral test at 5%, is 103 children&#xD;
      per group. To assume the lost of statistical power in the &quot;intention to treat&quot; analysis (ITT)&#xD;
      resulting from the number of cases where vaccine protocol has not been completed, 125&#xD;
      children per group will be included in the study. In total 250 children will be included in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
