  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of&#xD;
      carisbamate (800 and 1200 mg/day) in patients with diabetic neuropathic pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the&#xD;
      investigator or the patient knows the name of the study assigned drug), placebo- and&#xD;
      active-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study, with an optional extension phase, in&#xD;
      patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), or nerve pain in their lower extremities&#xD;
      resulting from diabetes. The study population includes men and women between 18 and 75 years&#xD;
      of age who have chronic neuropathic pain associated with diabetic neuropathy. Up to 440&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled and randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      treatment with carisbamate 800 milligrams per day (mg/d), carisbamate 1,200 mg/d, pregabalin&#xD;
      300 mg/d, or placebo. The double-blind treatment will be administered orally, in a&#xD;
      twice-daily regimen, with or without food, over a period of 15 weeks. The study will consist&#xD;
      of a pretreatment phase, including a screening, washout, and baseline period; a double-blind&#xD;
      treatment phase, with a titration and a fixed-dosage period; an optional blinded extension&#xD;
      phase (with carisbamate 400 to 1,200 mg/d or pregabalin 150 to 300 mg/d); and a posttreatment&#xD;
      phase (including a follow-up visit and telephone contact). The duration of the study&#xD;
      (excluding the pretreatment phase) is approximately 58 weeks for patients who decide to enter&#xD;
      the extension phase and approximately 19 weeks for the other patients. The pretreatment phase&#xD;
      will last up to 28 days, including a screening visit up to 28 days before the planned first&#xD;
      dose of study drug, a washout of up to 7 days for subjects who need to discontinue&#xD;
      medications, and a baseline period of at least 7 days to determine daily average DPN scores&#xD;
      for entry into the study. The double-blind treatment phase will include a titration period of&#xD;
      3 weeks to determine the dosage, and a fixed-dosage period for the next 12 weeks. All&#xD;
      patients who complete the double-blind treatment phase will be offered the option to enter&#xD;
      the blinded extension phase for an additional 37 weeks, in which patients previously treated&#xD;
      with carisbamate or placebo will receive carisbamate at their individual dosage at the end of&#xD;
      the double-blind treatment period, and patients previously treated with pregabalin will&#xD;
      receive pregabalin at their individual dosage at the end of the double-blind treatment&#xD;
      period. During the double-blind and extension phases, patients will have daily assessments of&#xD;
      their pain, using the 11-point DPN pain rating scale; and how much their pain interferes with&#xD;
      their sleep, using an 11-point Sleep Interference rating scale. In addition, specific scales&#xD;
      will be used at visits (every week for the first 4 weeks, every 4 weeks through the end of&#xD;
      the double-blind treatment phase, every 11 to 12 weeks in the extension phase) to assess&#xD;
      pain, overall health quality, the effects of pain on daytime sleepiness, and the effects of&#xD;
      pain on work, activities, and health care utilization. Patients will remain blinded to the&#xD;
      drug assignment during the extension phase. The posttreatment phase will include a follow-up&#xD;
      visit with 7 to 14 days after the final visit of the double-blind treatment phase (for&#xD;
      patients who do not participate in the extension phase) or the extension phase. In addition,&#xD;
      the investigator staff will call patients 30 to 33 days after the last dose of study drug, to&#xD;
      ask about any adverse events. Patients will take two oral capsules each day, either&#xD;
      carisbamate (200 or 400 mg), matching pregabalin (75 or 150 mg), or matching placebo.&#xD;
