    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare two different ways of treating a broken arm&#xD;
      (fractured humerus) using either, the nonoperative approach or the operative, open reduction&#xD;
      and internal fixation (ORIF). The study will examine which treatment will overall give better&#xD;
      results in regards to shoulder and elbow function, residual pain and deformity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who agree to consent to participation in this study will be randomly selected to&#xD;
      receive one of the two treatment methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Nonoperative: This method requires the application of a plaster sugartong splint for 10&#xD;
           - 14 days followed by a transition to a functional (coaptation) brace to be worn for 4-6&#xD;
           weeks. Patients will be followed by physiotherapy from the baseline visit at 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Operative: This treatment option involves an operative procedure for fixation of the&#xD;
           broken bone with plates and screws (open reduction internal fixation - ORIF). With this&#xD;
           method of treatment, a splint or sling is worn for comfort postoperatively. The patient&#xD;
           will be followed by physiotherapy after the post-operative visit at 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard follow-up clinic visits at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 4 months, 6 months and 12 months will&#xD;
      be arranged from the date of randomization. The patient will be asked to complete two&#xD;
      questionnaires, reporting the level of wellbeing and physical function. These questionnaires&#xD;
      will be given to the patient at the time of baseline visit at 2 weeks and again at 6 weeks, 4&#xD;
      months, 6 months and 12 months. They should take approximately 10 - 20 minutes to complete.&#xD;
      At each appointment, the patients will be x-rayed until healing has occurred, examined and&#xD;
      evaluated (Constant Shoulder Score) by the surgeon and followed by physiotherapy for gentle&#xD;
      range of motion (ROM) exercises progressing to strengthening and proprioception of the elbow&#xD;
      and shoulder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fractures of the humeral diaphysis occur in a bimodal distribution and represent 3-5% of all&#xD;
      fractures. Overall the incidence is higher in women and typically presents at a more advanced&#xD;
      age in this population, rendering fixation more difficult due to osteoporosis. The majority&#xD;
      of fractures of the humeral diaphysis occur in the mid-shaft and proximal third and the&#xD;
      majority are simple (or non-comminuted) in pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presently, the standard treatment of isolated humeral diaphysis fractures is nonoperative&#xD;
      care using splints, braces, casts and slings. Most centres in North America and Europe favor&#xD;
      functional bracing with a coaptation splint given the positive results reported with this&#xD;
      device, despite the prolonged period of pain and discomfort as well as the need for repeated&#xD;
      clinic follow-up visits associated with it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presently there are no published prospective comparative studies that systematically evaluate&#xD;
      patient function following the operative or nonoperative treatment of humeral shaft&#xD;
      fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluations following functional bracing using patient-based outcome tools revealed&#xD;
      a 20% nonunion rate in patients suffering a simple (non-comminuted) fracture. Invariably,&#xD;
      this led to surgical intervention to achieve union. In those whose fracture healed with the&#xD;
      splint, only 50% reported a full recovery while none of those requiring surgery for nonunion&#xD;
      did so. This low rate of functional recovery may be due in part to the high rate of shoulder&#xD;
      stiffness following functional bracing. Significant stiffness in the shoulder following&#xD;
      functional bracing has ranged from 14-60% with an average of 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantages of open reduction and plate fixation of humeral shaft fractures include a&#xD;
      direct approach to the fracture site with direct visualization and protection of the radial&#xD;
      nerve (depending on fracture level and approach), the possibility of rigid compressive&#xD;
      fixation, and the opportunity for bone grafting and/or radial nerve exploration if needed.&#xD;
      Importantly, it permits rapid mobilization of the shoulder and elbow, obviating the need of&#xD;
      immobilization, and ensures anatomic or near anatomic alignment. These advantages must be&#xD;
      weighed against the small risk of infection (&lt;1-6%) with most occurring after open fractures&#xD;
      or severe crush injury, nonunion (4-6%) especially in high energy injuries, and iatrogenic&#xD;
      radial nerve injury (1-3%) the vast majority of which are transient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative care: Fixation with regular or broad 3.5mm or 4.5mm dynamic compression plate (DCP)&#xD;
      using standard technique will be applied in cases with normal bone density; in the face of&#xD;
      osteopenic bone, locked-plate implants will be employed at the discretion of the surgeon.&#xD;
      Bone graft will not be used routinely as these are simple fracture patterns. Postoperative&#xD;
      splinting (or sling) will be maintained for 10 - 14 days followed by gentle ROM exercises&#xD;
      under physiotherapy supervision. Strengthening and proprioception will be begun once fracture&#xD;
      healing has occurred, typically at 6-8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conservative care will entail the application of a plaster sugartong splint for 10-14 days&#xD;
      followed by transition to a functional (coaptation) brace, to be applied by a qualified&#xD;
      orthotist. Gentle ROM exercises of the elbow and shoulder will begin as tolerated under the&#xD;
      supervision of a physiotherapist after 2 weeks with strengthening and proprioception added&#xD;
      once fracture healing has occurred, typically at 6-8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicentre prospective randomized trial will involve the Canadian Orthopaedic Trauma&#xD;
      Society (COTS), an association of trauma surgeons involved in collaborative outcomes research&#xD;
      with a proven track record of research and publication. Patients with a humeral diaphyseal&#xD;
      fracture who meet all eligibility criteria and provide consent to participate will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the operative or splint/brace treatment group. Patients will start&#xD;
      physiotherapy at 2 weeks post-randomization (splint/brace group)or 2 weeks post-surgery for&#xD;
      gentle ROM exercises. The operative group will progress to strengthening and proprioception&#xD;
      at 4-6 weeks. The splint/brace group will only progress at the 6-8 weeks mark once union has&#xD;
      occurred. Evaluation at 2 and 6 weeks, 4, 6, and 12 months will include functional, clinical&#xD;
      and radiological parameters. Functional evaluation will include the DASH, SMFA questionnaires&#xD;
      and the Constant Shoulder Score. Clinical outcome will evaluate range and motion including&#xD;
      the shoulder and elbow of both the affected arm and contralateral shoulder and elbow.&#xD;
      Standard radiographic parameters will be measured. The primary outcome measure will be&#xD;
      functional outcome as measured with the DASH. Appropriate statistical analyses will be&#xD;
      performed on the data. Sample size calculation reveals the need for 90 patients per treatment&#xD;
      arm. A census of the centers committed to the study predicts a 1-24 month recruitment period.&#xD;
      Patient follow-up will end at the 12 month visit.&#xD;
