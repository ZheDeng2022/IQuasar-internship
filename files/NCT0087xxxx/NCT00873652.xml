  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The UK immunisation guidelines recommend that children immunised with an accelerated course&#xD;
      of hepatitis B vaccine (i.e. vaccination at 0, 1, 2 and 12 months) receive an additional&#xD;
      booster dose of vaccine in later childhood (usually at 3 1/2 years of age). The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to to assess what proportion of these children have 'protective'&#xD;
      concentrations (10mIU/ml) of hepatitis B specific antibodies before and after the booster&#xD;
      dose of hepatitis B vaccine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, open label study of children immunised in infancy against Hepatitis&#xD;
      B virus (HBV),evaluating the persistence of immunity and the immune response to a scheduled&#xD;
      booster dose of Hepatitis B vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children eligible/overdue for their pre school HBV vaccine booster will be identified by&#xD;
      reviewing clinical records at the John Radcliffe Hospital. The parents/legal guardians of&#xD;
      these children will be written to and advised that their child should receive/ have received&#xD;
      a booster dose of HBV vaccine. This letter will also inform parents/ legal guardians that&#xD;
      they have the option of participating in this study looking at the persistence of HBV vaccine&#xD;
      induced antibodies through early childhood and the response to a booster dose of HBV vaccine,&#xD;
      and that this study will be conducted by the Oxford Vaccine Group in the participants' homes.&#xD;
      Parents will be advised that if they do not wish to take part in this research study they&#xD;
      should arrange to contact their GP to discuss whether their child requires a booster dose of&#xD;
      hepatitis B vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants the study will consist of two visits at a four week interval(visit 1 and&#xD;
      visit 2). If the parents/guardians then sign the consent form a medical and immunisation&#xD;
      history will be taken and a medical examination will be undertaken if indicated. If no&#xD;
      exclusion criteria are identified, the child will be enrolled in the study. A 6ml blood&#xD;
      sample will be taken from the child and single booster dose of Hepatitis B vaccine will be&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all children receiving the booster dose of vaccine and their GP, practice nurse and child&#xD;
      health department will be informed. If the child is also due for their other pre-school&#xD;
      booster vaccines (the 4 in 1 Diphtheria, tetanus, tetanus and polio vaccine, the combined&#xD;
      Hib-MenC vaccine and the combined measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (MMR)) these will also be&#xD;
      offered, but will not form part of the study assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the second visit following a confirmation of ongoing consent for the study the first&#xD;
      eligibility for inclusion will be checked along with the occurrence of any serious adverse&#xD;
      events, 6mls of blood will be drawn from the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be used for antibody analysis by ELISA.&#xD;
