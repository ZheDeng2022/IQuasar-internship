      The objective of this study is to establish the safety in use of the topical drug Acnase&#xD;
      Creme and its effectiveness in treatment of acne grade I (comedones) and II (comedones,&#xD;
      papules, pustules).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The acne is a common dermatosis in dermatological practice, affects more than 80% of the&#xD;
      population during the second and third decades of life. It is found worldwide, with no&#xD;
      evidence of racial or ethnic differences that influence the susceptibility to its&#xD;
      development. However there is influence of genetic factors, hormones, the use of certain&#xD;
      drugs that may have previous or aggravate the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is an inflammatory disease of the follicle polissebáceo, which consists of large sebaceous&#xD;
      glands, multiacinares, rudimentary hair follicle and a channel comprising a acro-infundibulum&#xD;
      in its upper portion and an infra-infundibulum in the dermal portion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a benign condition, self-limited, but can cause serious psychological problems or&#xD;
      disfiguring scars, which can persist for the rest of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial change is a disorder of follicular epithelial differentiation, during which the&#xD;
      cornea cells (keratinocytes) which are the follicle polissebáceo are excessively released in&#xD;
      the lumen. The result of this event is the appearance of the precursor, microcomedão, from&#xD;
      which the lesions of acne are developed (closed comedones, open comedones, papules, pustules&#xD;
      and nodules). The dilation of the follicular infundibulum with the material produces a&#xD;
      corneal comedão closed. This is the first clinically visible lesions of acne. As&#xD;
      hyperkeratosis extends to the upper infundibulum, extended its opening, it formed the comedão&#xD;
      open.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of acne is complex and understood only in part. The follicular occlusion&#xD;
      with adherent keratinocytes and activation of hormone secretion resulting in the formation of&#xD;
      sebaceous microcomedão. Studies suggest that free fatty acids intrafoliculares control&#xD;
      inflammation through chemotactic properties on leukocytes, monocytes and neutrophils. The&#xD;
      free fatty acids may provide the primary stimulus for the retention hyperkeratosis&#xD;
      follicularis. Moreover, tallow provides a favorable substrate for the proliferation of&#xD;
      Propiniobacterium acnes (P. acnes). Studies suggest that P. acnes, a microaerophilic&#xD;
      bacterium (almost anaerobic), Gram-positive, has a lipase able to hydrolyze triglycerides in&#xD;
      sebum into free fatty acids. Therefore, these pathogens play critical role in the generation&#xD;
      of inflammatory lesions. The P. acnes produces proteases and neuroaminidases, which may&#xD;
      increase the permeability of the follicular epithelium. Also produce a chemotactic factor of&#xD;
      low molecular weight that selects the polymorphonuclear leukocytes. In the process of&#xD;
      phagocytosis of bacteria are released hydrolases, which break the integrity of the follicular&#xD;
      wall. Subsequently, the content intrafolicular - fragments of keratin, fat, hair, and P.&#xD;
      acnes - is expelled to the dermis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If surface aggregation of neutrophils, as was a wheal, and with the presence of purulent&#xD;
      secretion, a pustule. With the infiltration of inflammation deep and extensive, a nodule or&#xD;
      cyst is produced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, the eruption acnéica is located predominantly in the face (90%) and to a lesser&#xD;
      extent, in the back (60%) and chest (15%). As young man, mainly affects the face, while in&#xD;
      older, the back.&#xD;
