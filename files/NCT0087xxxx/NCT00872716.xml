  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that quetiapine XR has anxiolytic properties. The study aims to&#xD;
      investigate the putative anxiolytic properties of quetiapine XR in patients with anxiety&#xD;
      disorders. Therefore, in a proof-of-concept design patients with simple phobia will be&#xD;
      selected to investigate specific anxiolytic and antipanic activity during acute anxiety.&#xD;
      Moreover, in a combined fMRI/visual stimulus presentation paradigm activity of fear-network&#xD;
      associated brain structures such as the amygdala will be investigated under treatment with&#xD;
      quetiapine XR or placebo. Additionally, genetic factors potentially mediating anxiolytic&#xD;
      properties of quetiapine will be studied.&#xD;
