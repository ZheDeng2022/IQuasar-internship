      The WOMAN trial is a large pragmatic randomised double-blind, placebo controlled trial to&#xD;
      quantify the effects of the early administration of tranexamic acid on death, hysterectomy&#xD;
      and other relevant outcomes. 20,000 adult women, after delivery who have clinically diagnosed&#xD;
      postpartum haemorrhage, are eligible if the responsible doctor is for any reason&#xD;
      substantially uncertain whether or not to use an antifibrinolytic agent. Additionally, TWO&#xD;
      nested studies will be conducted in a subset of women trial participants. The first nested&#xD;
      study (ETAC) aims to evaluate the effect of tranexamic acid (TXA) on markers of coagulation&#xD;
      in 400 women randomised to the WOMAN trial. The second nested study (ETAPLAT) aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the haemostatic effect and antithrombotic effect of TXA in 128 women randomised to&#xD;
      the WOMAN trial.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Each year, worldwide about 530,000 women die from causes related to pregnancy and&#xD;
      childbirth. Almost all (99%) of the deaths are in low and middle income countries. Obstetric&#xD;
      haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality accounting for between one quarter and&#xD;
      one third of deaths, most of which occur in the postpartum period. About 14 million mothers&#xD;
      develop postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) each year and about 1-2% of them will die, with an&#xD;
      average interval from onset to death of about 2 to 4 hours. Obstetric haemorrhage is also an&#xD;
      important cause of maternal mortality in high income countries where it accounts for about&#xD;
      13% of maternal deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-fibrinolytic agents are widely used in surgery to reduce blood loss and the need for&#xD;
      blood transfusion. A systematic review of randomised controlled trials of anti-fibrinolytic&#xD;
      agents in elective surgery showed that tranexamic acid (TXA) reduced the risk of blood&#xD;
      transfusion by a relative 39% (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.69). In those requiring transfusion,&#xD;
      TXA reduced the transfused blood volume by 1.1 units (95% CI 0.64 to 1.59). Anti-fibrinolytic&#xD;
      agents also reduced the need for re-operation due to bleeding (RR=0.52: 95% CI 0.40 to 0.69).&#xD;
      There was no evidence of an increased risk of thrombotic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TXA significantly reduces uterine blood loss in women with menorrhagia and is &quot;recommended&#xD;
      for consideration&quot; as a treatment in intractable postpartum haemorrhage in the UK. However,&#xD;
      at present there is little reliable evidence from randomised trials on the effectiveness of&#xD;
      TXA in the treatment of PPH. A systematic review of randomised trials of TXA in PPH conducted&#xD;
      by the applicants identified three trials of the prophylactic use of TXA, including a total&#xD;
      of 460 participants. Although there was a significant reduction in average postpartum blood&#xD;
      loss in women treated with TXA [weighted mean reduction 96 ml (95%CI 76ml to 109ml)] the&#xD;
      quality of the trials was poor. None had adequate allocation concealment and even in&#xD;
      aggregate the trials were too small to assess the effects of TXA on the clinically important&#xD;
      end points of mortality, hysterectomy and thrombotic side effects. The most recently updated&#xD;
      PPH treatment guidelines prepared by the World Health Organization (WHO) state that TXA may&#xD;
      be used in the treatment of PPH if other measures fail, but points out that the quality of&#xD;
      evidence on which this recommendation is based is low and recommends that further clinical&#xD;
      trials of TXA in PPH are conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM: The WOMAN Trial aims to determine the effect of the early administration of tranexamic&#xD;
      acid (TXA) on death and hysterectomy in women with a clinical diagnosis of postpartum&#xD;
      haemorrhage. The effect of TXA on the need for surgical interventions, blood transfusion, the&#xD;
      risk of non-fatal vascular events (either haemorrhagic or occlusive), use of health services&#xD;
      and breastfeeding will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME: Outcomes will be collected at 42 days after randomisation, at discharge or at death&#xD;
      (whichever occurs first).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEST PRODUCT, DOSE AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION: A first dose of Tranexamic acid (1 gram by&#xD;
      intravenous injection) will be given as soon as possible after randomisation. If clinically&#xD;
      indicated due to continued bleeding, a second dose of Tranexamic acid (1 gram by intravenous&#xD;
      injection) will be given if within 4 hours of randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REFERENCE THERAPY, DOSE AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION: A placebo (sodium chloride 0.9%) matched&#xD;
      to the active drug will be administered in the same way as the active product. A placebo is&#xD;
      justified in this trial because all women with PPH will receive all other treatments&#xD;
      clinically indicated. Tranexamic acid/placebo will be given as an additional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SETTING: This trial will be co-ordinated from LSHTM and conducted in hospitals in low, middle&#xD;
      and high income countries. It is likely that most patient recruitment will be in countries&#xD;
      with high rates of mortality and morbidity from postpartum haemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION OF TREATMENT AND PARTICIPATION: The first dose will be given immediately after&#xD;
      randomisation. If required, the second dose will be given up to 24 hours after randomisation.&#xD;
      No further trial treatment will be given after 24 hours of randomisation. Participation will&#xD;
      end at discharge, death or at 42 days post randomisation whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION: All patients randomly assigned to one of the treatments will be&#xD;
      analysed together, regardless of whether or not they completed or received that treatment on&#xD;
      an intention to treat basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NESTED STUDY 1: Effect of tranexamic acid on coagulation in a sample of 400 participants in&#xD;
      the WOMAN trial (ETAC). This aims to evaluate the effect of TXA on markers of coagulation in&#xD;
      a sample of WOMAN trial participants. Standard coagulation parameters (platelets, ﬁbrinogen,&#xD;
      PT and aPTT time and D-dimer) and ROTEM® parameters measured after in vitro activation with&#xD;
      tissue factor (EXTEM) and inhibition with aprotinin (APTEM) will be determined (maximum&#xD;
      lysis, maximum strength [Maximal Clot Firmness (MCF)], time from start to when the waveform&#xD;
      reaches 2mm above baseline [Clotting Time (CT)], time from 2mm above baseline to 20mm above&#xD;
      baseline [Clot Formation Time (CFT)], time to lysis [CLT (10% difference from MCF)], time to&#xD;
      Maximum strength [MCF-t], Clot elasticity [MCE]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NESTED STUDY 2: This aims to assess the haemostatic and antithrombotic effect of TXA in a&#xD;
      sample of 128 participants in the WOMAN Trial (ETAPLAT). Platelet function, thrombin&#xD;
      generation, fibrinogen level, D-Dimer and coagulation factors V, VIII and vWF will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        All legally adult women with postpartum haemorrhage following vaginal or caesarean section&#xD;
        delivery who have a clinical diagnosis of postpartum haemorrhage. The clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
        PPH may be based on any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood loss after vaginal delivery &gt; 500 mL OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &gt; 1,000 mL after caesarean section OR blood loss sufficient to compromise the&#xD;
             haemodynamic status of the woman The fundamental eligibility criterion is the&#xD;
             responsible clinician's 'uncertainty' as to whether or not to use an antifibrinolytic&#xD;
             agent in a particular woman with postpartum haemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women for whom the responsible doctor considers there is a clear indication for&#xD;
             antifibrinolytic therapy should not be randomised.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women for whom there is considered to be a clear contraindication to antifibrinolytic&#xD;
             therapy should not be randomised.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Where the responsible clinician is substantially uncertain as to whether or not to use an&#xD;
        antifibrinolytic, all these women are eligible for randomisation and should be considered&#xD;
        for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        There are no other pre-specified exclusion criteria.&#xD;
