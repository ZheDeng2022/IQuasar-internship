      The purpose of this study is to provide access to intravitreal injection of Avastin in&#xD;
      high-risk infants who do not otherwise qualify for study NCT00702819, an investigational&#xD;
      multi-site study examining Avastin use for retinopathy of prematurity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of blindness in children in developed&#xD;
      countries around the world, and an increasing cause of blindness in developing countries. The&#xD;
      retina lines the inside of the eye. It functions as &quot;film&quot; within the camera which is the&#xD;
      eye. When an infant is born prematurely, the vascular network necessary to nourish the retina&#xD;
      has not fully developed. As a consequence, in some infants abnormal vessels proliferate&#xD;
      instead of the normal ones - a condition known as ROP. The abnormal vessels carry scar tissue&#xD;
      along with them, and may lead to retinal detachment and blindness if the eye is not treated.&#xD;
      The Multicenter Trial of Cryotherapy for Retinopathy of Prematurity (CRYO-ROP) Study&#xD;
      demonstrated that ablation of the peripheral avascular retina reduced the risk of poor&#xD;
      structural and visual outcome due to retinal distortion or detachment in ROP (1980's). The&#xD;
      ablated retina is not functional and is not amenable to regeneration. Peripheral retinal&#xD;
      ablation is not universally effective in fostering regression of ROP. This is particularly&#xD;
      true for an aggressive form of ROP (aggressive posterior ROP, or APROP) which typically&#xD;
      afflicts profoundly premature and infirm neonates. In this subset of infants, progression of&#xD;
      ROP to bilateral retinal detachment and blindness occurs despite timely and complete&#xD;
      peripheral retinal laser ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of ROP is largely dependent on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).&#xD;
      When an infant is born prematurely the relatively hyperoxic environment the baby is&#xD;
      introduced to shuts down the production of VEGF. Retinal maturation is delayed. Subsequently,&#xD;
      at a time when intraocular VEGF levels would normally be declining late in the third&#xD;
      trimester of pregnancy, abnormally high levels of VEGF are seen due to large areas of&#xD;
      avascular retina and associated tissue hypoxia. The availability of FDA-approved drugs for&#xD;
      anti-VEGF treatment renders it possible to treat such eyes off-label. Available drugs include&#xD;
      pegaptanib sodium (Macugen) for partial blockage of VEGF-A, or drugs such as ranibizumab&#xD;
      (Lucentis) and bevacizumab (Avastin), which cause complete blockage of VEGF-A. As VEGF is&#xD;
      required in the developing retina for normal angiogenesis, our goal is not to penetrate&#xD;
      tissue, but to block the excessive levels of VEGF trapped within the overlying vitreous which&#xD;
      is responsible for the abnormal vasculature in ROP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For purposes of this study we have chosen bevacizumab (Avastin), which will: a) attain&#xD;
      complete blockage (vs. Macugen) of intravitreal VEGF-A, and; b) which is limited in its&#xD;
      ability to penetrate tissues because it is a full antibody (vs. Lucentis, an antibody&#xD;
      fragment specifically designed for better tissue penetration), and is more likely to restore&#xD;
      VEGF homeostasis within the developing retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a nearly identical multi-site trial (NCT00702819) currently recruiting, which&#xD;
      Childrens Hospital Los Angeles is a part of. However, that study has limiting enrollment&#xD;
      criteria; this compassionate-use study was created to provide access to bevacizumab (Avastin)&#xD;
      for high-risk infants who do not qualify for study NCT00702819.&#xD;
