      The objective of this study is to directly compare the effects of parents and friends on&#xD;
      overweight and non-overweight children and adolescents' food intake and food selection using&#xD;
      a cross-sectional design. Overweight and non-overweight children (5-6 year-old) and&#xD;
      adolescents (13-14 year-old) will share a meal with a friend and with a parent on separate&#xD;
      occasions. Participants' food selection and the amount of food they consumed will be compared&#xD;
      across conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: The investigators hypothesize that overweight children and adolescents will&#xD;
      select more unhealthy food items and eat more in the presence of an overweight friend than&#xD;
      when eating with a lean friend; whereas lean participants eating with an overweight friend&#xD;
      will eat a similar amount of food than lean youth eating with a lean friend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: The investigators predict that overweight children and adolescents (but not&#xD;
      lean children and teens) will consume more food in the presence of their mother than in the&#xD;
      presence of a friend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: The investigators also predict that overweight youth's energy intake will be&#xD;
      related to parental prompts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: The investigators expect greater similarities in terms of food selection and&#xD;
      food intake between adolescents and their friend than between adolescents and their parent.&#xD;
