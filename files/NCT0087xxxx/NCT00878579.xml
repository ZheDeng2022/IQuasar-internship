      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the PDS System&#xD;
      compared to the surgical control of posterolateral fusion with autograft and pedicle screw&#xD;
      fixation for the treatment of one or two levels from L3-S1 to relieve back pain associated&#xD;
      with degenerative disc disease.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Confirmation of DDD (back pain with degeneration of the disc by patient history,&#xD;
             physical exam, and radiographic studies and with one or more of the following factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Osteophyte formation of facet joints or vertebral endplates&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Facet joint degeneration (no more than mild to moderate)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with ≤50% collapse of disc as compared to the adjacent level&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with or without a contained herniated nucleus pulposus &lt;5 mm and no free&#xD;
                  fragment&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Skeletally mature subjects aged between 18 and 70 years of age inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with primarily back pain associated with degenerative disc disease of the&#xD;
             lumbar spine at one level or two adjacent levels from L3 through S1. Subjects may have&#xD;
             a lesser degree of leg pain at the same level(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who require surgical or minimally invasive intervention, who have failed to&#xD;
             adequately improve following 6 months of non-operative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject is a surgical candidate for a posterior approach to the lumbar spine and is&#xD;
             suitable for fusion using pedicle screw systems&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with a minimum baseline Oswestry Score of 40% (20/50).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with a minimum baseline VAS Score of 40/100 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. MRI diagnostic for DDD within 3 months of the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects who are mentally, physically and psychosocially able to cooperate with the&#xD;
             study procedures and return for all required follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects who are able to understand this study and have given voluntary, written&#xD;
             informed consent to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who have leg pain greater than back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with severe facet degeneration, radiographic findings of severe facet joint&#xD;
             disease, degeneration or misshapen facet(s) or structural anomalies at the target&#xD;
             level(s) that would preclude placement of the PDS device or pedicle screw systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects who require a pedicle screw smaller than 4.5 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with Modic 3 bone changes at the target level(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Spondylolisthesis &gt; Grade 1 and/or spondylolysis at the target level(s).&#xD;

             incontinence).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with fixed motor deficit and/or peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with prior discectomy at the target level(s).&#xD;
&#xD;

             to scoliosis (Cobb angle &gt; 15 degrees) or kyphosis (&gt; 11 degrees) at any lumbar level.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects who have used any investigational drug or device within the past 30 days or&#xD;
             have had an experimental spinal implant at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects with active local or systemic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects with osteoporosis. A screening questionnaire for osteoporosis, SCORE (Simple&#xD;
             Calculated Osteoporosis Risk Estimation), will be used to screen subjects. If DEXA is&#xD;
             required, exclusion will be defined as a DEXA bone density measured T scored &lt; -1.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects with metabolic bone disease (e.g. osteomalacia, Paget's disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects with rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune spondyloarthropathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subjects with a systemic disease that compromises life expectancy (e.g. HIV, AIDS,&#xD;
             hepatitis) or are on immuno-suppressive agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subjects who are taking any drug known to potentially interfere with bony/soft tissue&#xD;
             healing, (e.g., steroids at any dose daily within the last 12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Subjects with active malignancy: A subject with a history of any invasive malignancy&#xD;
             (except non-melanoma skin cancer), unless s/he has been treated with curative intent&#xD;
             and there have been no clinical signs or symptoms of malignancy for at least 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Subjects with a known allergy to titanium and/or polycarbonate urethane (PCU).&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Subjects who have existing conditions or pending litigation claims that could&#xD;
             compromise their participation, follow-up care, or treatment outcomes (e.g., drug or&#xD;
             alcohol abuse).&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Subjects with a BMI of ≥ 40 kg/m2 or weight &gt; 275 pounds (125 kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Subjects who are pregnant or are planning a pregnancy during the study period.&#xD;
