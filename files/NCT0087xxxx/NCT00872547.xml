  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to monitor the performance of a large metal-on-metal bearing&#xD;
      from the DePuy ASR™ System in the treatment of patients with hip joint disease requiring hip&#xD;
      resurfacing surgery or a total hip replacement. Patients who enter the study will be&#xD;
      evaluated at regular intervals following hip surgery using patient, clinical and x-ray&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study was terminated with effect from 30th November 2011 following the completion of 2&#xD;
      year follow up assessments for those patients remaining in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please note that prior to this decision DePuy voluntarily recalled the ASR products on 24&#xD;
      August 2010. Additional information regarding this voluntary recall and the follow-up of&#xD;
      patients affected by the recall can be found at the following links&#xD;
      http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Publications/Safetywarnings/MedicalDeviceAlerts/CON155761 and&#xD;

&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria for ASR™ XL Head system:&#xD;
&#xD;
        i) Subjects whose bone morphology and bone quality mean that standard MoM hip resurfacing&#xD;
        arthroplasty is not indicated, but for whom cementless fixation in the acetabulum and&#xD;
        receipt of a large MoM bearing are still possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        General Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        i) Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have an existing condition that would&#xD;
        compromise their participation and follow-up in this study.&#xD;

        outside the normal range for a particular investigational site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        iii) Subjects with proven metal sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        iv) Subjects with infectious, highly communicable diseases, which may limit follow-up i.e.&#xD;
        Active tuberculosis, hepatitis, immuno-compromised conditions, etc.&#xD;

        clinical study which involves exposure to ionising radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ix) Subjects who are currently involved in any injury litigation claims.&#xD;
&#xD;
        x) Subjects who are undergoing corticosteroid treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        xi) Subjects with active or recent joint sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional Exclusion Criteria for DePuy ASR™:&#xD;
&#xD;
        i) Subjects with proven significant osteoporosis and poor bone quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ii) Subjects with marked atrophy or deformity in the upper femur, skeletal immaturity, or&#xD;
        where loss of musculature or neuromuscular disease would render the procedure&#xD;
        unjustifiable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        iii) Subjects whose anatomical CCD angle is below 120°.&#xD;
&#xD;
        iv) Subjects who have undergone irradiation of the affected hip.&#xD;
