  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to compare the serum and skin concentrations of&#xD;
      beta-carotene, lutein, and lycopene in preterm infants fed preterm formulas with mixed&#xD;
      carotenoids to serum concentrations in preterm infants fed preterm formulas with no added&#xD;
      carotenoids and to human milk fed infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of dietary carotenoids on&#xD;
      the developing eye. Stages and zones of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), retinal function,&#xD;
      and retinal characteristics will also be examined.&#xD;

      Infants that are born prior to 37 weeks gestation often face complications resulting from&#xD;
      their prematurity. Preterm infants are susceptible to morbidities that are not common in&#xD;
      healthy term infants. Underdeveloped organs such as the lungs, eye, intestine, and brain can&#xD;
      reveal conditions unique to prematurity: chronic lung disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia&#xD;
      (BPD), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular&#xD;
      hemorrhage (IVH), etc. Infants in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit (NICU) have increased&#xD;
      inflammation and oxidative stress in association with common diseases of prematurity and as&#xD;
      well as the treatments used to combat their illnesses (Gitto et al 2004; Ochoa et al 2003;&#xD;
      Saugstad 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the National Eye Institute (U.S. National Institutes of Health), retinopathy of&#xD;
      prematurity affects approximately 50% of preterm infants that are born weighing 1250 g or&#xD;
      less. While 90% of infants with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) experience the milder form&#xD;
      of the disease, which requires little or no medical treatment, severe ROP can lead to serious&#xD;
      visual impairments or even blindness. This condition is of particular interest since Hylander&#xD;
      et al. (Hylander et al 2001) have reported that human milk feeding of preterm infants (&lt;1500&#xD;
      g birth weight) has been associated with a lower incidence of ROP and this association was&#xD;
      proposed to be driven by the antioxidant content of human milk. Human milk provides a variety&#xD;
      of antioxidants to the breastfed infant, including the carotenoids lutein, zeaxanthin,&#xD;
      lycopene, and beta-carotene. As discussed earlier, lutein and zeaxanthin are concentrated to&#xD;
      the eye and are thought to provide protection against both light-induced and metabolic&#xD;
      oxidative damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retina and retinal vasculature are the last eye structures to develop in the human&#xD;
      fetus/neonate. Eyes of children with a history of ROP are reported to have retinal thinning&#xD;
      with diffuse hypopigmentation, mild linearization, or mild tortuosity of the major vessel&#xD;
      branch, mottled pigmentation of the macula, and other peripheral retinal anomalies (Minicucci&#xD;
      et al 1999). The lack of pigmentation in the retinal structure might be explained by the&#xD;
      deficit of lutein acquired by the fetus (by placental transfer during late gestation) or by&#xD;
      the neonate through the diet (by preterm infant formulas devoid of these carotenoids).&#xD;
      Preterm infants are at a nutritional disadvantage at birth as they have been deprived of the&#xD;
      period of maximal transfer of nutrients during the last few weeks of pregnancy. Blood levels&#xD;
      of beta-carotene have been associated with gestational age (Ostrea et al 1986) and cord blood&#xD;
      levels of beta-carotene (Herrera et al 2004; Kiely et al 1999; Yeum et al 1998), lutein&#xD;
      (Kiely et al 1999), and lycopene (Herrera et al 2004; Kiely et al 1999) were reported to be&#xD;
      significantly lower than maternal levels. Stores of fat-soluble antioxidant vitamins also&#xD;
      could be compromised due to the minimal fat deposition in the preterm infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore reasonable to suggest that providing preterm infants with a milk-based&#xD;
      ready-to-feed (RTF) preterm infant formula with DHA and ARA supplemented with carotenoids,&#xD;
      which are found in human milk, would result in serum carotenoid levels more like the&#xD;
      breastfed infant. Further, increased dietary carotenoid intake by preterm infants might&#xD;
      decrease the prevalence of morbidities that are associated with prematurity, such as ROP,&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Birth weight 500-1500 g.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Less than 33 weeks gestational age (GA) at birth. Maternal dates will be used to&#xD;
             estimate GA except in instances where a scan or the neonatologist's estimate differs&#xD;
             by two weeks or more. In this instance, the scan or neonatologist's estimate of GA&#xD;
             will be used. In the case where one neonatologist's estimate or scan confirms maternal&#xD;
             dates and the other estimate does not confirm maternal dates, use the estimate of&#xD;
             maternal dates.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Randomization within 96 hours of initiation of enteral feeding of &gt;/= 60mL/kg/d of HM&#xD;
             or formula&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Formula fed infants' feeding consists of no more than 20% from human milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enteral feeding initiated by 21 days of life (date of birth is Day 0 of life).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parent/LAR agrees to allow infants to receive the assigned SSC Advance or NeoSure&#xD;
             Advance formula in-hospital starting with the first enteral feed after randomization.&#xD;
             If mother is providing breast milk, formula will only be given if there is not&#xD;
             sufficient mother's milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parent/LAR signed the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SGA infants and infants with PDA are eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Singleton or twin births only. For twins to be eligible, both must meet inclusion&#xD;
             criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious congenital abnormalities that may affect growth and development.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Grade III or IV IVH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Maternal incapacity: including maternal cocaine or alcohol abuse during pregnancy or&#xD;
             current, or if the mother or infant is currently receiving treatment consistent with&#xD;
             HIV therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of major surgery (including surgery for NEC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Asphyxia (hypoxia and ischemia) as evident by severe and permanent neurological&#xD;
             damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed NEC (modified Bell's stage II or III) or positive blood cultures at the time&#xD;
             of randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infants who are enrolled in this clinical study should be excluded from participation&#xD;
             in other concomitant studies. This exclusion criterion can be reviewed on a&#xD;
             case-by-case basis. For example, infants will not normally be excluded if only&#xD;
             demographic data are being collected or outcome measures on treatment modalities&#xD;
             common to current clinical practice are being gathered.&#xD;
