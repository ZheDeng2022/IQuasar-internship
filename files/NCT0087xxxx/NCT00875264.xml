    <description>Patients will be treated with oral CEP-11981 once daily for 28 days, followed by a treatment-free period of 14 days. This 42-day (6-week) period will constitute 1 cycle. The starting dose for the study will be 3 mg/m2. Dose escalation from this starting dose follows a modified Fibonacci sequence.</description>

      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has a histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor that has relapsed or is&#xD;
             refractory. Additionally, the tumor must be considered unresponsive or poorly&#xD;
             responsive to accepted treatment modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0, 1, or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has normal neurologic examination findings. Patients having neurologic signs and&#xD;
             symptoms indicative of brain metastases must undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
             to rule out brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has fully recovered from any prior surgical procedure(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has fully recovered from reversible side effects of prior therapy for cancer including&#xD;
             radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  is in appropriate health as determined by medical and psychiatric history, medical&#xD;
             examination, electrocardiography (ECG), serum chemistry and hematology tests, and&#xD;
             urinalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  if a woman of childbearing potential (not surgically sterile or who are not 2 years&#xD;
             postmenopausal), must use a medically accepted method of contraception and must agree&#xD;
             to continue use of this method for the duration of the study and for 30 days after&#xD;
             participation in the study. Acceptable methods of contraception include abstinence,&#xD;
             barrier method with spermicide, intrauterine device (IUD), or steroidal contraceptive&#xD;
             (oral, transdermal, implanted, and injected) in conjunction with a barrier method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  if a man, not surgically sterile or who is capable of producing offspring, must&#xD;
             practice abstinence or use a barrier method of birth control, and must agree to&#xD;
             continue use of this method for the duration of the study and for 30 days after&#xD;
             participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  is willing and able to comply with study restrictions and to return to the clinic for&#xD;
             evaluations (including follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has any of the following hematologic values: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than&#xD;
             1500/mm3, platelet count less than 100000/mm3, hemoglobin less than 9 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has any of the following hepatic function values: bilirubin greater than 1.5 times the&#xD;
             upper limit of normal (ULN), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate&#xD;
             aminotransferase (AST) greater than 2.0 times the ULN in the absence of known hepatic&#xD;
             metastases, or ALT or AST greater than 3.0 times the ULN in the presence of known&#xD;
             hepatic metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has a serum creatinine value greater than 1.5 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has known cerebral metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  is currently on warfarin or heparin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has any pre-existing coagulopathy, recent hemoptysis, gross hematuria, or&#xD;
             gastrointestinal bleeding, and a history of a clinically significant cardiovascular or&#xD;
             cerebrovascular event within 6 months prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has uncontrolled hypertension defined as a blood pressure measurement greater than 150&#xD;
             mm Hg systolic or 90 mm Hg diastolic with medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  is receiving any other antineoplastic treatment for solid tumors. (Continuing hormonal&#xD;
             treatment is permitted.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has received any investigational drug within the past 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has previously been enrolled in the study or received CEP-11981.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has known hypersensitivity to gelatin or lactose monohydrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  is a woman who is pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has taken a medication known to be a potent inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2C8, or CYP3A4&#xD;
             within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has taken a medication known to be a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C8, or CYP3A4&#xD;
             within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
