    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to collect information to plan how to design a computer&#xD;
      program for cancer patients receiving palliative care, their caregivers, and doctors and&#xD;
      nurses who work in palliative care. Researchers want to learn how to make this program&#xD;
      practical for use by future patients, caregivers, doctors, and nurses.&#xD;

      The Computer Program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, researchers will interview cancer patients receiving palliative care, their&#xD;
      caregivers, and doctors and nurses who work in palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The computer program will be designed to help doctors and nurses monitor the symptoms of&#xD;
      patients. The program will also be designed to help doctors and nurses make decisions about&#xD;
      how to care for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview Session:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be interviewed by a research staff member.&#xD;
      The study chair may also attend the interview. The interview will be held at the Palliative&#xD;
      Care outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interview session will be done in 3 steps, which are described below. Each step will take&#xD;
      about 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, you will read questionnaires about patient symptoms. These questionnaires are drafts&#xD;
      of the ones that will be included in the software program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will then look at a draft of the computer program's layout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Last, you will be interviewed. You will be asked to discuss your experiences as a patient or&#xD;
      caregiver in reporting symptoms and health status to doctors and nurses. You will also be&#xD;
      asked to discuss what might make the program more usable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the interview, you may also be asked to answer sample questions on the draft&#xD;
      questionnaires and discuss how readable you think the questions are. For example, you will&#xD;
      discuss your opinion about the font size, text placement, and color scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interview session will be audio-taped. To protect your confidentiality, only your first&#xD;
      name will be used during the interview session. Patients and their caregivers will also be&#xD;
      interviewed separately to protect privacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient responses will not be disclosed to caregivers, and caregiver responses will not be&#xD;
      disclosed to patients. The patient's palliative care doctor will be told, however, if&#xD;
      patients or caregivers show signs of emotional difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the audio recording is transcribed (typed) by the research staff, all names will be&#xD;
      coded so that no one can be identified by name. The audio recordings will be stored in&#xD;
      password-protected files that are available only to the study chair and staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the results of the study are published, the audio recordings will be destroyed by the&#xD;
      study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your study participation will be over after the interview session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 26 participants will be enrolled in this study. This includes up to 9 patients and 9&#xD;
      caregivers in this part of the study, and up to 4 doctors and 4 nurses in a second part of&#xD;
      the study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
