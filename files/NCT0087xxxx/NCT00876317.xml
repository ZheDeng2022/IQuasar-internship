      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety two oral doses of etoricoxib&#xD;
      (60 mg and 90 mg) daily in acute soft tissue rheumatism affecting the shoulder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this clinical trial is the assessment of the efficacy and safety of two&#xD;
      single daily oral doses of etoricoxib 60 mg and 90 mg over a period of 14 days in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with acute soft tissue rheumatism affecting the shoulder. The study&#xD;
      will be performed according to a randomised, double blind, double-dummy, and parallel-group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will include 300 male or female out-patients, aged 18 years or above, with&#xD;
      acute episodes of soft tissue rheumatism affecting the shoulder (less than 5 days). The main&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be: Shoulder pain of acute onset of non-traumatic origin, a history&#xD;
      of painless unrestricted motion of the affected joint immediately before the acute attack,&#xD;
      acute one-sided shoulder pain caused by soft tissue rheumatism, patient-assessed pain on&#xD;
      active movement exceeding 50 mm on a 100-mm visual analogue scale and symptoms requiring&#xD;
      therapy with NSAIDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main exclusion criteria will be: Active or recurrent peptic (gastric or duodenal) ulcer,&#xD;
      history of peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding, history of other bleeding disorders&#xD;
      other than gastro-intestinal, concomitant treatment with anti-coagulants, lithium, other&#xD;
      NSAIDs (including aspirin doses &gt; 150 mg) or corticosteroids, local injections of steroids in&#xD;
      the affecting shoulder (six months previous), presence of any form of crystal, destructive,&#xD;
      infectious or inflammatory arthropathy, osteonecrosis, previous shoulder surgery in the&#xD;
      affected side, adhesive capsulitis, cervical radiculopathy, severe renal, cardiac or hepatic&#xD;
      failure, uncontrolled hypertension, pregnancy or breast feeding, confined to bed, planned&#xD;
      hospital stays or surgical procedures during the trial, planned surgical intervention of the&#xD;
      affected shoulder during the trial, alcohol or drug abuse and inability to comply with the&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have 4 Visits, at Day 1 (Visit 1), at Day 3 (Visit 2), at Day 7 (Visit 3) and&#xD;
      at Day 14 (Visit 4). Potentially eligible patients will be screened at Visit 1. Patients&#xD;
      found to be eligible will be allocated to one of the two treatments (etoricoxib 60 mg or 90&#xD;
      mg). Each patient will be treated for 14 days. Early termination of study on Visit 3 (Day 7)&#xD;
      will be possible in case of complete resolution of the symptoms. All procedures of the study&#xD;
      must be done after the patient sign the informed consent. An ultrasound and X-ray evaluation&#xD;
      of the affected shoulder will be done on Day 1 and haematological and biochemistry laboratory&#xD;
      evaluation will be done on Day 1 and at the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-point for efficacy will be the patient's assessment of pain on active&#xD;
      movement on Day 3, the secondary end-point(s) for efficacy will be: Patient's assessment of&#xD;
      pain on active movement during the last 24 hours, patient's assessment of pain at rest, the&#xD;
      Brief Pain Inventory, final global assessment of efficacy by patient at the end of the&#xD;
      treatment, final global assessment of efficacy by investigator at the end of the treatment,&#xD;
      withdrawal due to inadequate efficacy, patient's status (change in painful condition at the&#xD;
      end of therapy) and paracetamol consumption used as rescue medication. The secondary&#xD;
      end-point(s) for safety and tolerability will be: Incidence and intensity of adverse events,&#xD;
      final global assessment of tolerability by patient, final global assessment of tolerability&#xD;
      by investigator, incidence of laboratory-related adverse events, and withdrawal of patients&#xD;
      due to adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be tabulated and the analysis of the data will perform in order to evaluate&#xD;
      if the efficacy of the same doses of etoricoxib (60 mg and 90 mg) are equally effective for&#xD;
      the treatment of acute shoulder pain syndrome due to soft tissue rheumatism affecting the&#xD;
      shoulder.&#xD;
