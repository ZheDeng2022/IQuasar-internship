    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of erlotinib hydrochloride when&#xD;
      given together with GDC-0449 with or without gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients&#xD;
      with metastatic pancreatic cancer or solid tumors that cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs&#xD;
      used in chemotherapy, such as GDC-0449 and gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways&#xD;
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving GDC-0449 together with erlotinib hydrochloride with or&#xD;
      without gemcitabine hydrochloride may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of erlotinib hydrochloride and Hedgehog antagonist&#xD;
      GDC-0449 with or without gemcitabine hydrochloride in patients with unresectable solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the adverse events profile associated with these treatment regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the responses in patients treated with these regimens. III. To assess the&#xD;
      effect of erlotinib hydrochloride and Hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 on selected biomarkers in&#xD;
      circulating tumor cells and tumor biopsy samples from patients with metastatic pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the effect of erlotinib hydrochloride and Hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 on&#xD;
      fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography imaging in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To study the association between clinical (toxicity and/or tumor response or activity) and&#xD;
      biologic (pharmacodynamic) results associated with erlotinib hydrochloride and Hedgehog&#xD;
      antagonist GDC-0449 in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of erlotinib hydrochloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive Hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 orally (PO) once daily (QD) and erlotinib&#xD;
      hydrochloride PO QD on days 1-28. Some patients also receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV&#xD;
      over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission&#xD;
      tomography at baseline and on day 28. These patients also undergo tumor tissue and blood&#xD;
      sample collection at baseline and periodically during study for correlative laboratory&#xD;
      studies. Samples are analyzed for tyrosine phosphorylated or total MAP-K, EGFR, AKT, and&#xD;
      other potential biomarkers of activity/response and for levels of genes transcriptionally&#xD;
      activated (e.g., BCL-2, GLI, BFL-1/A1, 4-1BB, PTC1) by immunofluorescence, IHC, and&#xD;
      quantitative-PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 3 months.&#xD;
