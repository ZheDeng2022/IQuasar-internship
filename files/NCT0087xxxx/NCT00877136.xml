    <textblock>
      This is an interdisciplinary study that falls into the Humanitarian Use Device category.&#xD;
      There are no hypotheses to be tested in this treatment protocol. The study has the following&#xD;
      objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Provide supervised access to treatment with TheraSphere® to eligible patients with&#xD;
           primary cancer to the liver who are not surgical resection candidates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate patient experience and toxicities associated with TheraSphere® treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measure tumor response rates&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to provide supervised access at this institution to&#xD;
      TheraSphere® treatment for a heterogeneous population of patients with unresectable primary&#xD;
      liver tumors, with the liver being the only dominant site of disease. Based on experience&#xD;
      gained in previous studies and well-established interventional radiology techniques, this&#xD;
      protocol allows multiple treatments with TheraSphere® that may be delivered on an inpatient&#xD;
      or out patient basis. Patients may receive a single dose to the whole liver, or lobar&#xD;
      treatment delivered as a sequence of treatments approximately 30 - 90 days apart. The&#xD;
      investigator, working with co-investigators in radiation oncology, interventional radiology&#xD;
      and nuclear medicine, will develop a specific treatment plan for each patient, based upon the&#xD;
      presenting condition of the patient, the vascular anatomy, and the desired goal of treatment.&#xD;

    <description>TheraSphere® consists of insoluble glass microspheres where yttrium-90 is an integral constituent of the glass. TheraSphere® is delivered into the liver tumor through a catheter placed into the hepatic artery. This artery provides the main blood supply to the tumor in the liver. TheraSphere® being unable to traverse the tumor vasculature is embolized within the tumor and exerts a local beta radiation radiotherapeutic effect with relatively limited concurrent injury to surrounding normal tissue.</description>

             ablation.&#xD;
