  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The protocol involves functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Spectroscopy acquisitions immediately before and after Low Field Magnetic Stimulation&#xD;
      treatment on two separate days in a sham controlled, randomized trial, in order to assess the&#xD;
      physiologic effects of Low Field Magnetic Stimulation on brain function in a geriatric&#xD;
      population with bipolar depression.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will examine changes in brain activity from Low Field&#xD;
      Magnetic Stimulation in subjects over the age of 50 with bipolar disorder who are currently&#xD;
      depressed using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and proton Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Spectroscopy. Following screening visits, study procedures include two visits, at least two&#xD;
      weeks apart, during which subjects will complete brief mood scales, undergo 15 minutes of&#xD;
      imaging, receive 20 minutes of Low Field Magnetic Stimulation treatment, and then return to&#xD;
      the scanner to undergo another 15 minutes of imaging procedures. Due to the crossover design,&#xD;
      subjects receiving active treatment during the first visit will receive sham treatment during&#xD;
      the second visit; subjects receiving sham treatment during the first visit will receive&#xD;
      active treatment during the second visit. A follow-up phone call will occur two days after&#xD;
      each imaging/treatment visit. The main endpoint of this study is the observation of changes&#xD;
      in resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging activity in post-treatment&#xD;
      acquisitions as compared to pre-treatment acquisitions.&#xD;
