      This study is a prospective, multicenter, cohort study. The study will be completed in three&#xD;
      phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase aims to establish SCD PW marker and PW score scoring system&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use big data processing techniques to find out the differences between survivors with&#xD;
           ventricular arrhythmias and normal controls. Find out the SCD Pre-warning ECG Marker (PW&#xD;
           marker).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Establish SCD Pre-warning risk score system according to traditional SCD risk factors,&#xD;
           clinical characteristics of patients and abnormal electrocardiogram indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. According to the established SCD PW marker and PW score scoring system, the original&#xD;
           group of patients are classified and scored. After five years of follow-up with&#xD;
           sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation as the primary end point&#xD;
           and sudden cardiac death as the secondary endpoint, Kaplan-Meier are used to calculate&#xD;
           the mortality rate of sudden cardiac death and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The COX&#xD;
           proportional hazards regression model is used to further determine and evaluate the SCD&#xD;
           predictive value of PW marker and PW score risk factor scoring system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase is to validate the established PW marker and PW score system models and&#xD;
      evaluate the SCD predictive value of it. This stage is divided into two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients enrolled in traditional high-risk ventricular arrhythmia, will be divided into&#xD;
           PW marker positive group and PW marker negative group and join in a 5-year follow-up.&#xD;
           Kaplan-Meier is used to calculate the mortality rate of sudden cardiac death and&#xD;
           Kaplan-Meier survival analysis is performed to further verify the early warning effect&#xD;
           of PW marker on SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients will be divide into three groups including the low-risk group, middle-risk&#xD;
           group and high-risk group according to the PW score risk factor scoring system and join&#xD;
           in a 5-year follow-up. Kaplan-Meier is used to calculate the mortality rate of sudden&#xD;
           cardiac death, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis is used to further verify the early&#xD;
           warning effect of PW score scoring system on SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third stage is the development stage of SCD early warning equipment. This stage will&#xD;
      conduct clinical translational medical studies of PW marker and PW score based on the&#xD;
      previous study and develop PW marker and PW score as portable SCD warning device and/or&#xD;
      mobile phone APP which will be applied to the clinic for early warning diagnosis of SCD.&#xD;
