  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) using cryoballoon ablation is a well-established procedure for&#xD;
      the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the use of cryoballoon ablation in recent&#xD;
      clinical trials have been limited to PVI. As such, patients with paroxysmal AF have been the&#xD;
      main recipients of this procedure. In patients with persistent AF, or patients with&#xD;
      paroxysmal AF and significant AF substrate other than the pulmonary veins, the utility of&#xD;
      cryoballoon ablation is less straightforward. In such patients, the choices are to either use&#xD;
      cryoballoon ablation in a PVI-only approach or alternatively, use cryoballoon ablation for&#xD;
      PVI followed by the use of radiofrequency ablation for additional ablation and/or substrate&#xD;
      modification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substrate modification by targeting left atrial fibrosis detected on delayed enhancement&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (DE-MRI) is an increasingly popular approach with growing data&#xD;
      showing its utility to decrease the risk of recurrence. The ability to use cryoballoon&#xD;
      ablation for fibrosis based ablation in addition to PVI will therefore provide a significant&#xD;
      advantage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate feasibility and the outcome of targeted ablation of left atrial&#xD;
      fibrosis detected on DE-MRI in addition to pulmonary vein isolation using the Arctic Front&#xD;
      Advance Cryoballoon Catheter.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single center open-label pilot study to be performed at the University of Utah&#xD;
      Hospital. Patients that are referred for first time ablation of paroxysmal or persistent&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation (AF) will be considered to be enrolled in the study. An electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (ECG) will be performed at the time of the first clinic visit with the documentation of the&#xD;
      rhythm. All patients will be started on an oral anticoagulation (either a novel&#xD;
      anticoagulation agent or warfarin with a targeted international normalized ratio (INR) of&#xD;
      2-3). All patients will have a basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, prothrombin&#xD;
      time/INR, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and a chest x-ray at the time of the first clinic&#xD;
      visit. Women of childbearing potential will have a β-human chorionic gonadotropin test to&#xD;
      rule out pregnancy. Within a month prior to the planned ablation, all patients will undergo a&#xD;
      DE-MRI to assess pulmonary vein anatomy, fibrosis burden and distribution, and left&#xD;
      ventricular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo a transesophageal echocardiogram immediately prior to the ablation&#xD;
      procedure to rule out thrombus within the left atrial appendage. If thrombus is detected, the&#xD;
      procedure will be postponed. AF ablation procedure will consist of pulmonary vein isolation&#xD;
      using the Medtronic Arctic Front Advance Cryoballoon Catheter. Following PVI, additional&#xD;
      lesions will be placed targeting areas of fibrosis by further manipulation of the catheter&#xD;
      from its position within pulmonary vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following ablation, all patients will be observed for 24 hours to assess immediate post&#xD;
      procedural complications. All patients will be continued on anticoagulation for at least two&#xD;
      months. Patients may be continued on oral anticoagulation beyond two months post-ablation if&#xD;
      they are determined to have a high stroke risk profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A DE-MRI will be performed on all patients within 24 hours of ablation to assess esophageal&#xD;
      thermal injury. Patients with severe esophageal enhancement will have a repeat DE-MRI within&#xD;
      24 hours. Patients with moderate enhancement will have a repeat DE-MRI within 1 week. All&#xD;
      patients with persistent esophageal enhancement on repeat DE-MRI will be referred for&#xD;
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy. All patients will be placed on a proton pump inhibitor for 1&#xD;
      month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be discharged with a 60-day event monitor. Continuation of antiarrhythmic&#xD;
      medications will be at the discretion of the performing physician. Following the procedure, a&#xD;
      90-day blanking period will start. Following the blanking period, patients will be monitored&#xD;
      for one year for recurrence of AF. Recurrence of AF is defined as a detectable episode of AF,&#xD;
      atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia lasting at least 30 seconds. AF recurrence will be&#xD;
      assessed by 30-day event monitors at 3, 6, and 12-months following the blanking period. A&#xD;
      chest x-ray will be performed in all patients at the time of their first follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo a DE-MRI at 3 months at the time which ablation scar size and&#xD;
      burden, progression of left atrial fibrosis as well as presence of pulmonary vein stenosis&#xD;
      will be assessed.&#xD;
