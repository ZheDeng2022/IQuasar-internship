  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smokeless tobacco (SLT) is a known risk factor for Oral, Pharyngeal and Esophageal carcinoma.&#xD;
      Three-quarters global SLT consumption is among the South Asian Population. The habit of SLT&#xD;
      chewing commences at a very young age which has an underpinning of socio-cultural dimension&#xD;
      in South Asian population which perhaps due to its more addictive potential, has more&#xD;
      dependency. Youth also perceives SLT as a part of confectionery, which is socially served in&#xD;
      South Asian ceremonies. There exists very little or no evidence regarding efficacy of SLT&#xD;
      cessation interventions in this population. Most of the existing interventions are based in&#xD;
      western world with little or no cultural sensitivities pertinent to South Asia. In this&#xD;
      study, a culturally rooted behavior changing intervention (BCI) to alter SLT use prevalence,&#xD;
      perceptions pertinent to the deleterious effects of SLT use in the etiology of oral cancers&#xD;
      and help youth quit SLT in Karachi, Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline demography and SLT use prevalence will be ascertained among 11-16-year-old school&#xD;
      going children from both government and private schools. Multi stage cluster sampling will&#xD;
      randomly recruit forty clusters (schools) from within 6 districts of Karachi, which will then&#xD;
      be divided into intervention and control groups (clusters) using block randomization based on&#xD;
      proportionate number of each school type present (Government and Private).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups' participants will complete all questionnaires pre and post intervention as&#xD;
      described elsewhere and will also undergo screening for oral cancer and oral potentially&#xD;
      malignant lesions (OPMLs). Students in intervention cluster will be given BCI and printed&#xD;
      pamphlets along with a gift pack (reminder for SLT quit, a branded tooth paste and a tooth&#xD;
      brush) while students in control cluster will only differ in that they will not be exposed to&#xD;
      BCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BCI was designed after reviewing literature and consulting specialist group for all untoward&#xD;
      effects of SLT use in Oral Cavity that have a potential of transforming into oral carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow up after 12 weeks will be conducted to re-assess their SLT use prevalence,&#xD;
      perceptions regarding hazardous effects of SLT use in oral cavity, dependency on SLT and&#xD;
      success in quit (among users in both groups), and perception regarding warning labels on SLT&#xD;
      product packet&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In lieu of the increasing disease burden of oral cancer in South Asian countries due to&#xD;
      increasing popularly fashionable SLT consumption; the objective is to develop (i) a BCI&#xD;
      pertinent to socio-cultural aspect for South Asian SLT users, followed by (ii) assessing its&#xD;
      efficacy in changing perception and dependency regarding SLT use in high risk group of 11-16&#xD;
      years old school going children of Karachi of both private and public sector schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also aimed to deconstruct the BCI to establish which components of our BCT are more&#xD;
      useful in making an intervention most efficient by using sub-indices of fidelity index to&#xD;
      assess the adherence and quality of each component of intervention. Each component will be&#xD;
      scored using fidelity index by a neutral trained listener each time intervention is delivered&#xD;
      by a trained personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitatively, the objectives of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. measure SLT/ or BQ use prevalence amongst adolescents of 11-16 years ii. assess the&#xD;
      reasons behind their use of SLT/ or BQ in users (both intervention and control clusters) by&#xD;
      using Reasons for Betel Quid Chewing Scale (RBCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. evaluate the dependency on SLT/ or BQ in users (both intervention and control clusters)&#xD;
      using Fagerst√∂rm Tobacco and Nicotine Dependency scale for Smokeless Tobacco (FTND-ST) and&#xD;
      Betel Quid Dependency by using Betel Quid Dependency Scale (BQDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. assess perceptions of adolescents (both intervention and control clusters) regarding ill&#xD;
      effects of SLT/ or BQ use in oral cavity causing oral cancer and OPMLs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v. assess the perception of adolescents regarding oral cancer picture of SLT/ or BQ product&#xD;
      pack in cessation of its use with the help of Behavior Changing Intervention in intervention&#xD;
      cluster and a questionnaire item in control cluster.&#xD;
&#xD;
      vi. evaluate each component of Behavior Changing Intervention in its efficacy by using&#xD;
      fidelity index and self-perceived efficacy by participants of intervention cluster.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted at government and private schools of Karachi as schools have the&#xD;
      maximum probability of engaging focused age group of mixed ethnicity, religion, different&#xD;
      cultures and different socio-economic strata of the population. Also, these young individuals&#xD;
      spend a substantial number of their waking hours in school thus they are easily approachable&#xD;
      globally without needing to delineate or be reliant on families(41).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a population of approximately 24 million, Karachi is the largest city of Pakistan(42).&#xD;
      Karachi City government has divided the city into six (6) districts in 2013 with each&#xD;
      district being further divided into administrative towns of total 18 in number(43).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi stage cluster sampling will be done. Out of six districts, 26 clusters (secondary&#xD;
      schools) will be randomly selected proportionate to the number of each school type (ensuring&#xD;
      equal participation of government and private schools). The students of 11-16 years of age,&#xD;
      studying in grade VI - Grade X will be randomly recruited. Complete lists of all private and&#xD;
      government schools of Karachi have been arranged by requesting respective Directors (Appendix&#xD;
      6). If any randomly selected school declines to participate than another school will be&#xD;
      randomly selected from the same district; also, a government school will be selected if&#xD;
      government school will decline and vice versa. Fifty-100 students per school will be randomly&#xD;
      included in the study. Depending upon the size of each class, students will be randomly&#xD;
      selected from each of the secondary classes present on the day of our visit till a total&#xD;
      number of 50-100 is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will therefore summit a total sample size of 2200 that may be considered representative&#xD;
      of the 11-16 year adolescents of Karachi as Global Youth Tobacco Survey conducted in Karachi,&#xD;
      Pakistan in 2008 enrolled 720 individuals of 13-15 years for comprehensive tobacco control&#xD;
      program(44).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Students of younger or older age group than mentioned already will be excluded and students&#xD;
      who already are undergoing treatments for Oral Cancer will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For recruitment purposes, investigators will contact principals of selected schools (both&#xD;
      government and private) to provide them with details regarding the intervention, its merits&#xD;
      and efficacy, and will request for their inclination to participate in the trial. If any&#xD;
      selected school refuses to participate then another school of same profile will be sent an&#xD;
      invitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schools' heads will then be requested to send consent forms (will be provide to schools) to&#xD;
      the parents along with a covering letter in which they will be provided with all relevant&#xD;
      details regarding intervention and will be encouraged to contact principal investigator via a&#xD;
      text on given contact number who will then call parents to respond to all queries since&#xD;
      principal investigator does not have toll-free number(33).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will be requested to sign an acceptance or refusal on the form and sent it back to&#xD;
      school by a specific decided date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 12 weeks, a follow up visit will ensue to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Re-assess their perceptions regarding SLT/or BQ use in users and non-users of both&#xD;
           intervention and control clusters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Re-assess their dependency on SLT/or BQ in users of both intervention and control&#xD;
           clusters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Re-evaluate their perceptions (of users and non-users of intervention cluster) regarding&#xD;
           warning labels on SLT/or BQ product packet&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Collect their quit calendars to assess quit from users of both intervention and control&#xD;
           clusters, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Collect perceived efficacy of each component of BCI that helped them quit, attempt to&#xD;
           quit or change perceptions from all users and non-users of intervention cluster to&#xD;
           assess efficacy of each component of BCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any differences in outcome based on BCI will be assessed and documented between two arms of&#xD;
      cluster-randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The change in perceptions if at all, after four weeks, regarding imprinting of pictorial&#xD;
      warning labels on SLT packaging will help us in recommending its implementation at National&#xD;
      level to curb SLT use.&#xD;
