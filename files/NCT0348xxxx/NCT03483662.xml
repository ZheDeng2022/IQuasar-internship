      The IMPACTS study utilizes an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 2 design to achieve&#xD;
      two primary goals simultaneously: 1). to test the effectiveness of a multifaceted&#xD;
      implementation strategy for intensive BP control among underserved hypertensive patients at&#xD;
      high risk for CVD, and 2). to assess the acceptability, adoption, feasibility, fidelity, and&#xD;
      sustainability of the multifaceted implementation strategy in patients, providers, and&#xD;
      healthcare systems.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) reported that more&#xD;
      intensive blood pressure (BP) treatment (target systolic BP&lt;120 mm Hg) reduced major&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) by about 25% and all-cause mortality by about 27% compared to&#xD;
      standard BP treatment (target systolic BP&lt;140 mm Hg) among hypertensive patients aged ≥50&#xD;
      years. SPRINT clearly answered the question - Will lowering BP more than the currently&#xD;
      recommended goal further reduce the risk of CVD and mortality? The next important question is&#xD;
      how to implement a more intensive BP treatment program in real-world clinical practice,&#xD;
      especially in underserved patients. The IMPACTS trial is an effectiveness-implementation&#xD;
      hybrid trial to simultaneously test the effectiveness of a multicomponent intervention&#xD;
      program for more intensive BP treatment and the feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability of&#xD;
      implementing the program in underserved patients with hypertension in Louisiana, Alabama, and&#xD;
      Mississippi. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research has been used to guide&#xD;
      the development of the multicomponent intervention, including dissemination of SPRINT study&#xD;
      findings among patients, providers and policymakers; team-based collaborative care using a&#xD;
      stepped-care protocol adapted from the SPRINT intensive-treatment algorithm, BP audit and&#xD;
      feedback, and home BP monitoring; and health coaching on antihypertensive medication&#xD;
      adherence and lifestyle modification. The investigators will collaborate with 36 federally&#xD;
      qualified health center clinics that serve low-income populations in Louisiana, Alabama, and&#xD;
      Mississippi to recruit 1,260 trial participants and conduct the IMPACTS trial. The primary&#xD;
      clinical outcome is the difference in mean change of systolic BP from baseline to 18 months.&#xD;
      The fidelity of the intervention, measured by intensification of treatment by providers and&#xD;
      adherence to medications in patients, will be the primary implementation outcome. This study&#xD;
      will generate urgently needed data on effective, adoptable, and sustainable intervention&#xD;
      strategies aimed at eliminating health disparities and reducing the BP-related disease burden&#xD;
      in underserved populations in the US.&#xD;
