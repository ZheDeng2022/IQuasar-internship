      Online Remote Behavioural Intervention for Tics (ORBIT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of BiP Tic, a therapist-guided,&#xD;
      parent-assisted, internet-based behavioural therapy intervention for tics in young people,&#xD;
      compared with usual care plus online education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include 1) optimising the design of the intervention, 2) undertaking an&#xD;
      internal pilot, 3) evaluating cost effectiveness and 4) longer term impact, and 5)&#xD;
      identifying barriers to implementation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ORBIT (Online Remote Behavioural Intervention for Tics) trial is comparing the&#xD;
      effectiveness of two treatments delivered online for children and young people with Tourette&#xD;
      Syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder. Families in England with a child/young person (aged 9-17&#xD;
      years) who experiences tics are being asked to take part. Interested families undergo a&#xD;
      telephone screen with a researcher and then asked to complete an online questionnaire. They&#xD;
      then attend a screening appointment at either Great Ormond Street Hospital (London) or&#xD;
      Queen's Medical Centre (Nottingham).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families that are eligible and want to take part are randomly allocated to one of two&#xD;
      treatments. One treatment uses behavioural therapy (BT), the other involves psychoeducation.&#xD;
      Both treatments last for 10-weeks and involve completing online chapters (for the parent and&#xD;
      child) with the support of a therapist, there are also some tasks to complete offline. After&#xD;
      finishing the treatment, families are asked to complete more questionnaires (at 3, 6, 12 and&#xD;
      18 months after starting the treatment). A smaller sample of families and healthcare&#xD;
      professionals are also interviewed about their experience of participation. The study is&#xD;
      looking to see if the online delivered treatment may be effective at helping children and&#xD;
      young people manage their tics. The study is also exploring whether the online programme is&#xD;
      acceptable to families, identifying any problems in getting families to take part/complete&#xD;
      the programme and also healthcare professionals' views about the programme. It is important&#xD;
      to research online therapy for tics because, at the moment, many people with tics do not get&#xD;
      any therapy because there are not enough trained tic therapists. If online delivered&#xD;
      treatment is effective, this may mean more children and young people could access tic&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention consists of evidence-based interventions adapted from previously published treatment manuals on Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) and established behavioural intervention for tics protocols. Each of the 10 modules includes age-appropriate texts, animations and exercises. Prticipants are instructed to practice suppressing their tics, this is known as 'response prevention'. Then, with the help of their parent/carer, the participant is instructed to provoke premonitory urges (the urge to tic often felt before the tic is expressed) and try to supress the need to express/demonstrate the tic, this known as 'exposure'.</description>

    <description>The comparator intervention reviews the definition of tics, natural history, common presentations, prevalence, aetiology, risks and protective factors and strategies for describing tics to other people etc. Problem-solving and development of expertise in tic disorders is emphasised. The intervention includes strategies for promoting positive behaviours which will be rewarded by a parent as a parallel element to the tic control practice in the behavioural therapy arm. There is no information on tic control within the management package.</description>

          1. Previous structured behavioural intervention for tics e.g. HRT/CBIT or exposure and&#xD;
             response prevention within last 12 months: Patient confirmed through screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Change to medication for tics (start or stop tic medication) within the previous 2&#xD;
             months: Patient confirmed through screening and subsequent medication/interventions&#xD;
             commenced throughout out the trial are recorded at each time point for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnoses of alcohol/substance dependence, psychosis, suicidality, or anorexia&#xD;
             nervosa: Confirmed through parent DAWBA. DAWBAs that score people as being likely to&#xD;

             ascertain that they should definitely be excluded from the trial. If the child is&#xD;
             considered at immediate risk of suicide, the research team will inform the GP or usual&#xD;
             treating clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;

             the assessor at the telephone screen (and confirmed at baseline through CAIDS-Q)&#xD;
             through questions relating to type of school the child attends and previous diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Immediate risk to self or others: Confirmed through screening questions and DAWBA. The&#xD;
             participants GP will be informed of this.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Parent or child not able to speak or read/write English: Patient confirmed through&#xD;
             screening by the assessor.&#xD;
