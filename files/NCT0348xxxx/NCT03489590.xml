  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open label non-randomized study enrolling up to 20 healthy participants and up to 30&#xD;
      participants with cystic fibrosis to establish a healthy versus disease comparison. Each&#xD;
      participant will receive a mixture of inert gas (perfluoropropane (PFP)) in a ratio of 79%&#xD;
      PFP to 21% oxygen as a contrast agent to enhance visualization of the airway and alveolar&#xD;
      spaces using magnetic resonance imaging of inert gas/oxygen mixtures. The study consists of a&#xD;
      screening visit followed by up to 2 study visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the ability of conventional 'thermally' polarized&#xD;
      perfluorinated gases (19F) mixed with oxygen to detect changes in ventilation using magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI). A secondary goal is to assess the repeatability and the&#xD;
      within-subject variability of these findings in CF lung disease. This is an open label pilot&#xD;
      study expanding on work by other investigators currently using this technique in human&#xD;
      subjects. Projection images using controlled breathing techniques will be obtained using 19F&#xD;
      MRI, correlating spirometric variables with regional distribution of the gases.&#xD;
