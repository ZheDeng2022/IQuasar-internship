  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of performing remote limb&#xD;
      ischemic conditioning (RLIC) using the Doctormate device, a special blood pressure device&#xD;
      used to perform RLIC, on patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion&#xD;
      being transported to a thrombectomy capable center by the helicopter.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 15 subjects presenting to a community hospital with signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion, transported to a comprehensive stroke center&#xD;
      by aircew will receive RLIC using the Doctormate device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RLIC treatment will consist of 3-5 cycles ( depending on transportation time) of 5&#xD;
      minutes inflations of both blood pressure cuffs simultaneously. Blood pressure will be 200 mm&#xD;
      HG with 5 minutes of reperfusion between each inflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated upon arrival to the comprehensive stroke center and evaluated for&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at one site ( University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics)&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the feasibility of delivering RLIC by air medical crews in patients with AIS. This will be assessed by recording the number of cycles completed during transport.</measure>
    <time_frame>The duration of the flight, typically 30 min-3 hours depending on weather and distance of the community hospital</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will be assessed based on the number of cycles performed during transportation by air as follows:&#xD;
For flight time of duration of ≥ 60 minutes, ≥ 60% of subjects should receive 4 cycles of RLIC.&#xD;
For flight time of duration of 30-60 minutes, ≥ 60% of subjects should receive at least 3 cycles of RLIC.&#xD;
For flight duration of &lt; 30 minutes, ≥60% of subjects should receive at least 2 cycle of RLIC.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess adverse events related to performing RLIC in patients with large vessel occlusion.</measure>
    <time_frame>AEs will be assessed during transport by aircrew, at 24 hours of admission and at 90 days.</time_frame>
    <description>We will collect data on adverse events, severe and serious adverse events during transport, at 24 hours of hospital admission as well as at the 3 months follow up visit. An intendent medical monitor will be designated to evaluate the reported serious and related adverse events</description>
