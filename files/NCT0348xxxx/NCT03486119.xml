  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to elucidate predictive immune related biomarker to the responsiveness to the&#xD;
      PD-1 blockade and evaluate the dynamics of immune cells in peripheral blood from NSCLC&#xD;
      patients during nivolumab treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis that The ratio of MDSC after 1st or 2nd cycle can predict the response to&#xD;
      nivolumab in NSCLC patients earlier than the tumor assessment by imaging scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine whether myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) ratio&#xD;
      after 1st or 2nd cycle of nivolumab can be accurate predictive biomarkers of nivolumab in&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer related mortality&#xD;
      worldwide. Immune checkpoint blockade has emerged as a promising treatment modality in NSCLC.&#xD;
      More recently, Programmed Cell Death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor was approved by FDA as ≥ second line&#xD;
      treatment, which are major paradigm shift in NSCLC treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently two randomized phase III trials, comparing the overall survival (OS) of&#xD;
      nivolumab with that of docetaxel as second line therapy, were completed. CheckMate-017&#xD;
      included squamous cell lung cancer patients and CheckMate-057 did non-squamous cell lung&#xD;
      cancer patients. In both trials, nivolumab showed improvement of OS in all-comers regardless&#xD;
      of PD-L1 expression. As a result of retrospective analysis, PD-L1 positivity was not&#xD;
      predictive factor for the efficacy in squamous cell histology, but predictive factor for&#xD;
      non-squamous histology. Finally, nivolumab was approved the all-comer NSCLC patients&#xD;
      regardless of PD-L1 expression after failure to platinum based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although tumor PD-L1 expression is currently the best predictive biomarker for PD-1&#xD;
      blockades, the prediction accuracy is not high enough to solidify the drug efficacy.&#xD;
      Actually, PD-L1 negative patients can still respond to PD-1 blockades and some of PD-L1&#xD;
      positive patients do not respond to these therapy. Interestingly, the responders among PD-L1&#xD;
      negative patients showed comparable duration of response in those with PD-L1 positive in&#xD;
      Checkmate 057 trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we need to select patients who are most likely to benefit from anti-PD-1 therapy&#xD;
      and identify the better biomarker to predict the response to PD-1 blockades in NSCLC patients&#xD;
      earlier than tumor assessment by imaging scan. To maximize the benefit of nivolumab in NSCLC&#xD;
      patients, nivolumab should apply to all-comers, but we need to early decide to go or stop&#xD;
      depending on predictive biomarker after 1st or 2nd cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that various immune suppressive mechanisms including an accumulation and&#xD;
      activation of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) exist in&#xD;
      tumor microenvironment of cancer patients. MDSC are one of the major components of the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment, demonstrating their potentials, such as tumor progression by promoting&#xD;
      tumor cell survival, angiogenesis, invasion of healthy tissue by tumor cells, and metastases.&#xD;
      Recent studies show that MDSC as a heterogenous group of myeloid progenitors with immuno&#xD;
      suppressive function could be used as one of the promising biomarker candidate for cancer&#xD;
      immunotherapies. Ipilimumab could affect the immune cells in peripheral blood from melanoma&#xD;
      patients. This study demonstrated that responder to ipilimumab showed early increase of&#xD;
      eosinophil counts, whereas non-responders presented that elevated monocytic MDSC increased&#xD;
      serum levels of S100A8/A9 and HMGB1 that attract and activate MDSCs. This result suggests&#xD;
      that measurement of MDSCs could be a predictive immune related biomarker to ipilimumab&#xD;
      treatment. On the other hand, we do not know how PD-1 blockade affects the immune suppressive&#xD;
      cells such as MDSC or Tregs and makes difference between responder and non-responder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, we conducted pilot trial to compare the T lymphocytes and MDSC population in&#xD;
      peripheral blood between responder and non-responder to nivolumab. Interestingly, our&#xD;
      preliminary data demonstrated that after 1st cycle of the therapy CD11b+CD33+MDSC/CD45+ or&#xD;
      CD14- ratio has significantly decreased in responder compared to non-responder. The cut-off&#xD;
      value of peripheral MDSC ratio could be reliable biomarker for accurate prediction of&#xD;
      nivolumab therapy in NSCLC patients. To validate our finding, we need to expand this study in&#xD;
      NSCLC patients who will be treated with nivolumab.&#xD;
