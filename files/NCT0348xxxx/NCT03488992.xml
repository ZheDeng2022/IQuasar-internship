  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the health benefits of a recently developed&#xD;
      multimineral/multivitamin/phytochemical (MVM/phytochemical) nutritional supplement. This&#xD;
      newly developed supplement - an advancement of a previous formula designed to enhance human&#xD;
      health by providing RDA-levels of essential vitamins and minerals - contains eight&#xD;
      phytochemicals selected to address fruit and vegetable undernutrition, and chosen on the&#xD;
      basis that: 1) published research from cell culture, animal model and, when available, human&#xD;
      clinical work, suggests that it may benefit human health, and 2) it is considered safe for&#xD;
      human ingestion at proposed levels of consumption.&#xD;

      This study will be an eight-week, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel arm clinical trial&#xD;
      to compare markers of nutritional, inflammatory and oxidative status, cardiovascular and&#xD;
      neurological health as well as microbial status in subjects consuming a novel&#xD;
      multivitamin/multimineral/phytochemical (MVM/phytochemical) supplement compared to subjects&#xD;
      consuming a placebo tablet. In addition, this study will evaluate whether the&#xD;
      MVM/phytochemical supplement improves subjects sense of well-being as evaluated by a&#xD;
      quality-of-life survey. The study will aim to enroll 112 consenting men and women&#xD;
      characterized as having metabolic syndrome. Potential subjects will be recruited through&#xD;
      flyers, newspapers and advertisements placed throughout the community. Consented subjects&#xD;
      will undergo a 28-day washout, followed by a 56-day trial period. Biological samples (blood,&#xD;
      urine, stool, saliva) will be collected at baseline (day 0) and at day 56. Diet and exercise&#xD;
      history, as well as a quality of life survey, will be collected at these time points as well.&#xD;
      Risk to participants is expected to be minimal and will be outlined through an informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
