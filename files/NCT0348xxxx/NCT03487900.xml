      The CREDO 2 study follows CREDO 1 study, which aims to construct an objective evaluation of&#xD;
      endoscopic remission in Crohn's Disease (CD). In addition to reproducibility and validation,&#xD;
      the predictive value of this remission evaluation needs to be tested in different settings to&#xD;
      valorise its usefulness in clinical practice and in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CREDO 2 aims to investigate whether the evaluation of endoscopic remission, as defined in&#xD;
      CREDO 1, in patients in clinical remission is predictive of sustained clinical remission at 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of CREDO2 is a multicentre longitudinal prospective cohort study. The screening&#xD;
      period to include a patient is two weeks. Patients will be followed up to week 104.&#xD;

      The CREDO 2 study follows CREDO 1 study, which aims to construct an objective evaluation of&#xD;
      endoscopic remission in Crohn's Disease (CD). In addition to reproducibility and validation,&#xD;
      the predictive value of this remission evaluation needs to be tested in different settings to&#xD;
      valorise its usefulness in clinical practice and in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CREDO 2 aims to investigate whether the evaluation of endoscopic remission, as defined in&#xD;
      CREDO 1, in patients in clinical remission is predictive of sustained clinical remission at 2&#xD;
      years. The design of CREDO2 is a multicentre longitudinal prospective cohort study. The&#xD;
      screening period to include a patient is two weeks. Patients will be followed up to week 104.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is sustained clinical remission at week 104. The primary secondary&#xD;
      endpoints are sustained clinical remission at weeks 26 and 52. The sustained clinical&#xD;
      remission at 2 years is defined by the absence of relapse and complication of the disease.&#xD;
      Relapse is defined as Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) &gt; 220 or between 150 and 220 for&#xD;
      2 consecutive weeks with an increase of at least 70 points relative to the baseline CDAI,&#xD;
      associated with an objective marker of inflammation: C-reactive protein (CRP) ≥5 mg/l and /&#xD;
      or faecal calprotectin ≥250 μg/g. CD complication is defined by an intestinal resection&#xD;
      surgery for CD, stricturoplasty, endoscopic dilatation, hospitalisation for intestinal&#xD;
      strictures, abscess and / or fistula (including anoperineal disease) and/or therapeutic&#xD;
      escalation. Therapeutic escalation is defined as an increase in the dosage of the treatment,&#xD;
      shortening of the treatment interval, addition of a new treatment for CD (including&#xD;
      corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, biologics, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors or any&#xD;
      experimental treatment). The number of patients to be included is 320 when using a two-sided&#xD;
      test with a type 1 error of 5% to detect with a power of 80% an association between a&#xD;
      predictor and week 104 sustained remission failure, corresponding to a variation in&#xD;
      proportions of patients who failed from 40% in the high-risk group to 20% in the low-risk&#xD;
      group, and assuming a 12% loss due to treatment discontinuation or patient withdrawal.&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited via two cohorts. First, patients included in CREDO 1 could be&#xD;
      included in CREDO 2 if they agree and meet the criteria of non-exclusion. Assuming that 2/3&#xD;
      of the 15 patients included in each of the 16 centres involved in CREDO 1 could be included&#xD;
      in CREDO 2, 160 patients will be included from CREDO 1. An additional cohort of 10 patients&#xD;
      per centre will be included in CREDO 2 by the same local investigator within each centre&#xD;
      using the same methods as for CREDO 1 cohort, except that recruitment criteria will be those&#xD;
      of CREDO 2, to provide 160 additional patients to reach the targeted cohort size for CREDO 2.&#xD;
      Recruitment will therefore be performed in 16 centres and each local investigator will have&#xD;
      to register 20 videos, including those selected from CREDO 1, stratified by endoscopic&#xD;
      remission status according to his/her global judgment: complete remission; almost complete&#xD;
      remission; neither complete nor almost complete remission. The main inclusion criteria are&#xD;
      adult patients, with established CD with ileal and / or colonic involvement, without&#xD;
      significant clinical activity for more than 3 consecutive months with, at baseline, CDAI &lt;150&#xD;
      and CRP &lt;5 mg / l and faecal calprotectin &lt;250 μg / g, stable maintenance treatment for more&#xD;
      than 3 months, an ileocolonoscopy planned for CD and the decision to maintain or decrease the&#xD;
      treatment (but not increase) after the colonoscopy. All maintenance treatments are authorized&#xD;
      / immunosuppressive (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate), biologic (infliximab,&#xD;
      adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, ustekinumab, vedolizumab) and JAK inhibitors.The main&#xD;
      exclusion criteria are an incomplete record of the ileocolonoscopy or more than three&#xD;
      resected ileocolonic segments (not counting ileocecal valve), taking NSAIDs in the two weeks&#xD;
      prior to endoscopy, anoperineal MC without luminal involvement, suspicion of intestinal&#xD;
      infection within 4 weeks prior to baseline endoscopic assessment. The expected period of&#xD;
      recruitment is 12 months from the first patient included in the study and 20 patients will be&#xD;
      included in each of the 16 centres in Belgium and France. At inclusion, demographic,&#xD;
      phenotypic, medical history and treatment data will be collected and ileocolonoscopy will be&#xD;
      performed and recorded by the local investigator using pre-specified standards, provided&#xD;
      sufficient quality. Biological (albumin, haemoglobin, platelets, CRP and faecal calprotectin)&#xD;
      assessments will be carried out at the inclusion and at each follow-up visit (week 26, 52 104&#xD;
      and unplanned). The clinical activity will be evaluated through CDAI. Within each centre, the&#xD;
      local investigator, as local reader, will read the 20 ileocolonoscopy videos of the centre.&#xD;
      In addition, each video will be read by central readers, selected among 12 central readers in&#xD;
      four groups of 3 central readers. Each video will be read by 2 central readers and by a third&#xD;
      one in case of disagreement between the first two. Each central reader will read a little&#xD;
      more than 54 videos due to these disagreements. All these readers, local and central, will&#xD;
      have undergone the training session validated by an examination on the evaluation of&#xD;
      endoscopic remission. In a separate delayed session, the central readers will evaluate&#xD;
      components of usual endoscopic severity indices. Agreement between data provided by local&#xD;
      readers and central readers will be assessed through Kappa and intraclass correlation&#xD;
      coefficient estimates. If agreement is satisfactory, endoscopic data provided by local&#xD;
      readers will be used to investigate the association between baseline endoscopic evaluation&#xD;
      and sustained clinical remission at week 104 using the logistic regression method, ROC&#xD;
      curves, sensitivity and specificity. If agreement is poor, the association will be studied on&#xD;
      central reader data using the same methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study should provide a tool to evaluate the ability of endoscopic remission evaluation&#xD;
      in patients in clinical remission to accurately predict sustained clinical remission. If it&#xD;
      is the case, this tool could become the therapeutic objective for patients in clinical&#xD;
      remission with ileal and/or colonic CD. If agreement is satisfactory between local and&#xD;
      central reading, the tool could be used in therapeutic trials, but also in clinical practice.&#xD;
      If this is not the case, the tool should be used in clinical trials using central readings.&#xD;
