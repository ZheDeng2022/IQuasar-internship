  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for people who have a paralyzed arm and hand from a spinal cord injury, who&#xD;
      have also received a recording electrode array in the brain as part of the BrainGate study.&#xD;
      The study will look at the ability of these participants to control different grasping&#xD;
      patterns of the hand, both in virtual reality and in his/her actual hand. Movement of the&#xD;
      participant's hand is controlled by a functional electrical stimulation (FES) system, which&#xD;
      involves small electrodes implanted in the arm, shoulder and hand that use small electrical&#xD;
      currents to activate the appropriate muscles.&#xD;

      This work aims to advance Brain-Computer-Interfaces (BCls) to provide severely paralyzed&#xD;
      persons a natural way of controlling Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) neuroprostheses&#xD;
      for restoring arm and dexterous hand movements. The prospect of using BCI technology for&#xD;
      restoring arm and hand movements for reaching and grasping is based on the hypothesis that in&#xD;
      a paralyzed human, there is a repeatable and understandable relationship between recordable&#xD;
      brain activity and specific aspects of imagined arm movements. Many previous studies have&#xD;
      attempted to understand the relationships between brain activity and arm and hand movements&#xD;
      in able-bodied monkeys. Little is known about these same relationships in humans, and&#xD;
      specifically within the context of trying to control an FES arm and complex hand system. This&#xD;
      study will recruit persons who already have BCI and FES systems implanted to take advantage&#xD;
      of the possibility of recording high resolution brain activity in human participants. Thus,&#xD;
      from this study, we aim to gain a better understanding of how brain signals are related to&#xD;
      specific aspects of arm and complex hand movements in humans with paralysis. Additionally,&#xD;
      this study will test novel implementations of complex hand movement restoration in Veterans&#xD;
      and other persons with chronic hand and arm paralysis.&#xD;
