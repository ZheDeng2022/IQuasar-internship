    <textblock>
      Anesthesia is a drug induced, reversible, comatose state that facilitates surgery and it is&#xD;
      widely assumed that cognition returns to baseline after anesthetics have been eliminated.&#xD;
      However, many patients have persistent memory impairment for weeks to months after surgery.&#xD;
      Cardiac surgery appears to carry the highest risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction&#xD;
      (POCD). These cognitive deficits are associated with increased mortality, prolonged hospital&#xD;
      stay and loss of independence. The investigators propose to investigate the role of&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine (DEX) in preventing long-term POCD after cardiac surgery and enhancing early&#xD;
      postoperative recovery. It is anticipated that DEX will be the first effective preventative&#xD;
      therapy for POCD, improve patient outcomes, and reduce length of stay and healthcare costs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dexmedetomidine (DEX), a highly potent and selective α2-adrenoceptors (α2R) agonist used in&#xD;
      clinical practice for sedation, analgesia, and anxiolysis, was recently shown to have&#xD;
      beneficial effects on early cognitive changes by reducing delirium in humans.It also reduced&#xD;
      memory impairment after surgery and isoflurane anesthesia, both in elderly mice (20-22&#xD;
      months) and in pups exposed to anesthesia in the early postnatal period. Importantly,&#xD;
      co-treatment with DEX has been shown to restore learning and memory function in rats exposed&#xD;
      to propofol in utero. Therefore, the investigators set out to investigate whether DEX has an&#xD;
      effect on cognitive dysfunction months after surgery and whether it accelerates cognitive&#xD;
      recovery from anesthesia and surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized 1:1 in permuted blocks of 4 to 8. The randomization sequence&#xD;
      will be computer generated and stratified by 2 factors, planned procedure (CABG/CABG + valve&#xD;
      or valve only procedure) and study site (for full multicentre trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In hospital outcomes include delirium (assessed twice daily post-operative day (POD) 0-10,&#xD;
      death, hemodynamic instability requiring vasopressors, time to extubation, re-intubation (and&#xD;
      reason), length of stay (in Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit and total hospital), POCD,&#xD;
      depressive symptoms between POD 4-10, post-operative complications (infection [surgical site,&#xD;
      sepsis, pneumonia], myocardial infarction, renal replacement therapy, re-operation,&#xD;
      cumulative opioid consumption (to POD 4), in-hospital mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative outcomes include POCD (3/6/12 months), depression (3/6/12 months), mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment (MCI) at 3/6/12 months (defined as 1-2 standard deviations below age&#xD;
      matched controls), persistent surgical site pain at sternotomy/thoracotomy/graft harvest site&#xD;
      (Brief Pain Inventory, 3/6/12 months), recovery (3,6, 12 months).&#xD;
