  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Omnigen Pilot study aims to provide an evidence base for Omnigen as a treatment for&#xD;
      Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU). It aims to achieve this by tailoring a regenerative therapy used&#xD;
      for ocular surface repair to provide proactive non-surgical wound management of Diabetic Foot&#xD;
      Ulcers (DFU).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is designed as a multi-centre prospective, patient and observer blind,&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial, recruiting patients from two clinical centres across the East&#xD;
      Midlands; Derby Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (DHFT) and Nottingham University&#xD;
      Hospitals NHS Trust (NUH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be approached within diabetic foot clinics by their usual clinical&#xD;
      carers to determine whether they are interested in participating in the study. They will be&#xD;
      provided with written information about the study and the researcher will explain the study&#xD;
      verbally to them and address any questions and concerns the patient may have. Patents will be&#xD;
      given at least 24 hours to consider taking part in the trial before signing a consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent has been given, baseline information will be collected. This will&#xD;
      include demographic information, medical history and concomitant medication. eGFR and HbA1c&#xD;
      will also be collected if not done within previous 3 months as part of standard care. The&#xD;
      baseline wound status, assessment of ulcer infection according to Infectious Diseases Society&#xD;
      of America (IDSA) criteria, peripheral pulses, neuropathy and ankle brachial pressure index&#xD;
      will also be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be randomised to receive either standard of care or Omnigen graft with&#xD;
      standard of care. Staff administering the Omnigen product will be aware of which treatment&#xD;
      the participant is receiving however the participant and the research staff conducting the&#xD;
      healing assessments will be blinded to their treatment allocation. Therefore the participant&#xD;
      and the assessors will be blinded to the treatment given in order to minimize any bias in the&#xD;
      collection of healing outcome data. For those randomized into the control arm, 'Dummy&#xD;
      Packaging' will be used to ensure the blind is maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen two weekly from their baseline visit until healing for up to 12 weeks&#xD;
      and at 2 weeks post healing in those that heal. If a participant's foot ulcer heals before&#xD;
      the final 12 weeks visit, they will attend a healing confirmation visit two weeks post the&#xD;
      original heal date, however will not be required to attend any further fortnightly visits&#xD;
      until the final blinded assessment visit at week 12 . If the participant's foot ulcer has not&#xD;
      healed at 12 weeks then a blinded assessment should still be conducted at this time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data is collected using the Dacima Clinical Suite Electronic Data Capture (EDC) software&#xD;
      (Dacima Software Inc.)&#xD;
