  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation of haemodynamic changes is still challenging in clinically relevant situations&#xD;
      (e.g. in bleeding, septic and postoperative patients) with the conventional monitoring&#xD;
      routinely used including heart rate and mean arterial pressure. If the arterial pressure&#xD;
      drops and the heart increases, the haemodynamic state is already decompensated and a therapy&#xD;
      is at risk being indicated too late.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to decompensation - still in the state of compensated shock - it would be desirable to&#xD;
      detect the shock already. The compensated shock is characterized by an occult drop of cardiac&#xD;
      output and a hypoperfusion of vital organs like e.g. the splanchnic region. Due to these&#xD;
      pathophysiological characteristics, a therapy would be indicated already in this stadium of&#xD;
      shock progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The available monitoring tools to detect compensated shock are on the one hand side invasive&#xD;
      (intravascular catheter), cost-intensive (cost of the catheter systems), or need extensive&#xD;
      training (echocardiography). Consequently, the implementation of advanced haemodynamic&#xD;
      monitoring is still low despite the high clinical relevance for the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the goal of this project to evaluate in healthy volunteers the routinely implemented&#xD;
      technology of photo-plethysmography in its ability to detect haemodynamic changes by extended&#xD;
      signal analysis of the pulse-contour and the pulse-wave-transit-times in relation to the&#xD;
      gold-standard echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary goal of this study is to analyse the physiological and haemodynamic changes during&#xD;
      progressive central hypovolaemia displayed by non-invasive or minimal-invasive monitoring&#xD;
      devices and associate the changes to each other.&#xD;
