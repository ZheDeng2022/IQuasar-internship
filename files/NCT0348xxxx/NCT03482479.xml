  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Naltrexone is an FDA approved drug (for alcoholism) that has found widespread use &quot;off-label&quot;&#xD;
      to treat pain and improve quality of life at much lower doses than are used for the approved&#xD;
      indication. There are a few scientific studies in three conditions (fibromyalgia, Crohn's&#xD;
      disease, and multiple sclerosis) that suggest that this drug has benefit and is safe.&#xD;
      However, considering the extent of use in other conditions, and uncertainty about the&#xD;
      mechanism of action study is needed in a diverse set of diseases, including vasculitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine if low dose naltrexone is effective in&#xD;
      improving health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among patients with vasculitis. Although it&#xD;
      is a pilot study, a placebo-controlled component is used because of the prominent placebo&#xD;
      group effect seen in studies with self-reported subjective outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of low-dose naltrexone (LDN) 4.5 mg nightly in improving self-reported&#xD;
      physical health in patients with vasculitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study enrollment, each patient will be randomized to receive either LDN for 6 weeks&#xD;
      followed by oral placebo for 6 weeks, or placebo for 6 weeks followed by LDN for 6 weeks. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measure and some secondary outcome measures are patient-reported and will be&#xD;
      recorded every 3 weeks, or every 6 weeks&#xD;
