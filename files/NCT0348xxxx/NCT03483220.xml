  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      drug addiction is a major health hazard that has its effect on personality and behavior&#xD;
      including the impulsivity and pattern of decision making. It also has its effect on both the&#xD;
      structure and function of different brain regions mainly the prefrontal cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the aim of the study is to study the decision making styles and impulsivity among people with&#xD;
      different psychoactive substance addiction, studying the change in the volume of prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex in relation to drug addiction and studying the relation between drug impulsivity,&#xD;
      decision making patterns and brain volume.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substance use disorder is still one of the major health hazards and an expanding field of&#xD;
      research in all its aspects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An estimated quarter of a billion people, or around 5 per cent of the global adult&#xD;
      population, used drugs at least once in 2015. Even more worrisome is the fact that about 29.5&#xD;
      million of those drug users, or 0.6 per cent of the global adult population, suffer from drug&#xD;
      use disorders. This means that their drug use is harmful to the point that they may&#xD;
      experience drug dependence and require treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The magnitude of the harm caused by drug use is underlined by the estimated 28 million years&#xD;
      of &quot;healthy&quot; life (disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)) lost worldwide in 2015 as a result&#xD;
      of premature death and disability caused by drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of those years lost, 17 million were attributable solely to drug use disorders across all&#xD;
      drug types. DALYs attributable to morbidity and mortality resulting from all causes of drug&#xD;
      use have increased overall in the past decade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yet, with fewer than one in six persons with drug use disorders provided with treatment each&#xD;
      year, the availability of and access to science-based services for the treatment of drug use&#xD;
      disorders and related conditions remain limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decision making is a complex multidimensional process involving motivation and drive, giving&#xD;
      subjective value to different options, identifying and choosing alternatives based on the&#xD;
      values and preferences, assessing consequences of our choices, taking risk, and seeking&#xD;
      reward. A recent model by Redish et al. of the genesis of decision making posits that&#xD;
      decisions represent the outcome of three interacting systems: planning, habit, and a&#xD;
      situation-recognition systems. Furthermore, challenges or vulnerabilities to these systems&#xD;
      are proposed to be associated with the natural course of addiction and to provide potential&#xD;
      for therapeutic intervention. Several brain structures, including dorsolateral prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC),&#xD;
      ventral striatum, amygdala and insula are involved in decision making process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive control is essential to the ability to flexibly direct our behavior in response to&#xD;
      constantly changing environment and tasks and includes but is not limited to: working memory,&#xD;
      response inhibition, conflict monitoring, error detection, and task-switching. A considerable&#xD;
      body of research on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has helped characterize the regional&#xD;
      specificity of various cognitive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individual differences in decision-making, including decision-making style, risk-prone&#xD;
      attitude, impulsivity, and personality, can influence decision-making in different&#xD;
      situations. Risky decision-making involves evaluating the tradeoff between perceived risks&#xD;
      and returns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospect theory claims that people consider outcomes as gains or losses, relative to a&#xD;
      reference point, suggesting that people favor risk aversion in the gain domain and favor&#xD;
      risk-seeking in the loss domain. Based on this, it follows logically that people with&#xD;
      addictive behavior will make more risky decisions in loss domain than normal population.&#xD;
      Brevers et al. reported that subjects with alcohol dependence make more risky choices in the&#xD;
      gain domain than did a group of controls. However, Yao et al. have found no difference in&#xD;
      risky choices made in the gain domain but demonstrated more risky choices in disadvantage&#xD;
      trials in the loss domain in people with IGD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decision-making can be viewed in terms of somatic markers hypothesis as a complex process&#xD;
      that sometimes involves a conflict between a primary inducer (the natural or conditioned&#xD;
      stimulus), and a secondary inducer (thoughts related to this stimulus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with drug addiction will show higher impulsivity and risky decision making styles than&#xD;
      normal population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the work:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the decision making styles and impulsivity among people with different psychoactive&#xD;
      substance addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studying the change in the volume of prefrontal cortex in relation to drug addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studying the relation between drug impulsivity, decision making patterns and brain volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 participants with drug addiction diagnosed by DSM-5 criteria will be recruited and&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age above 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clearly consenting to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intoxication or withdrawal state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comorbid Axis I psychiatric disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The protocol and study design of this thesis will be applied for approval by an ethical&#xD;
           committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An informed consent will be obtained and signed from the subjects to participate in the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confidentiality will be maintained during the whole study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A descriptive study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant in this group will have the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Addiction severity index 4th version for assessment of addiction pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale (Lynam et al. 2006) The UPPS-P impulsivity scale is a&#xD;
           59-item inventory designed to measure five distinct personality pathways to impulsive&#xD;
           behavior: Negative Urgency, Lack of Perseverance, Lack of Premeditation, Sensation&#xD;
           Seeking, and Positive Urgency .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Iowa gambling task computerized version: The task involved drawing one card per trial&#xD;
           from one of four decks (labeled as A, B, C, and D). Each deck contained 40 cards in a&#xD;
           ﬁxed sequence which is unknown to participants at the start of the task. Next,&#xD;
           participants are asked to select cards from the four decks to gain as much money as&#xD;
           possible. The task ends when the 100th card is drawn, although subjects do not know this&#xD;
           in advance. The immediate monetary gain for each draw from deck A or B is higher the&#xD;
           gain from deck C or D. However, money loss can occur and the risk is higher in highly&#xD;
           paying groups (A and B) than the low paying groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. MRI brain examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Voxel based morphometry through analysis of 3D T1 weighted sequence in order to&#xD;
                assess total intracranial volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Resting state functional MRI.&#xD;
