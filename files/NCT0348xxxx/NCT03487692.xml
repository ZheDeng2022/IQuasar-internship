  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes group visits, shared appointments where patients receive self-management education&#xD;
      in a group setting and have a medical visit, are a promising way to deliver high quality&#xD;
      diabetes care. Group visits can improve glycemic control and decrease healthcare utilization.&#xD;
      To date, no studies have systematically implemented a diabetes group visit intervention in a&#xD;
      network of U.S. community health centers. The University of Chicago is partnering with&#xD;
      Midwest Clinicians' Network (MWCN), a member organization of 130 health centers across ten&#xD;
      Midwestern states. Approximately half of all Federally Qualified Health Centers in this&#xD;
      region are affiliated with MWCN. The objectives of the study are [1] providers and staff at&#xD;
      20 health centers will have the requisite knowledge, skills, and motivation to implement a&#xD;
      diabetes group visit plus text messaging intervention at their sites; [2] changes in diabetes&#xD;
      processes of care; knowledge, attitudes, and skills for diabetes self-management; clinical&#xD;
      outcomes; and health care utilization for patients participating in the diabetes group visit&#xD;
      program will be evaluated; and [3] the diabetes group visit program will be available for&#xD;
      dissemination among and use by health centers and healthcare providers at the local, state,&#xD;
      regional, and national levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      UChicago and MWCN will recruit and enroll 20 health centers (HCs) to participate in a&#xD;
      training intervention and to implement diabetes group visit and text messaging programs at&#xD;
      their clinic sites. Each HC will assemble a team of 3-4 providers and staff to participate in&#xD;
      the training. HCs will be randomized to one of two training cohorts. HC providers and staff&#xD;
      will attend two in-person Learning Sessions in Chicago and a series of monthly webinars,&#xD;
      recruit and enroll patients, implement a 6-month diabetes group visit and text messaging&#xD;
      program plus subsequent booster sessions, complete periodic surveys and interviews, assist&#xD;
      with data collection through patient surveys and chart abstraction, and present their program&#xD;
      to peer HCs during Learning Sessions and to local stakeholders, state primary care&#xD;
      organizations, or other professional groups. Each HC will enroll 15 patients in the group&#xD;
      visit and text messaging program; the 2018 Training Cohort will do so immediately following&#xD;
      their enrollment in the study and the 2020 Training Cohort will do so after 18 months. During&#xD;
      the first 18 months, the 2020 Training Cohort will collect data from electronic health&#xD;
      records (EHR) of randomly selected patients to serve as a control group. Changes in&#xD;
      self-reported outcomes, diabetes processes of care, and clinical outcomes will be assessed&#xD;
      for intervention patients from baseline through 2 year follow up, and processes of care and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes will be compared for intervention vs. control participants. Capacity of HC&#xD;
      providers and staff to conduct a group visit and text messaging intervention for patients&#xD;
      with diabetes, as well as their confidence in identifying and addressing health disparities,&#xD;
      will be evaluated through surveys and in-depth interviews. This study will expand knowledge&#xD;
      of the barriers, facilitators, and perceived benefits and drawbacks of group visit and text&#xD;
      messaging interventions and inform the development of a toolkit that will be disseminated to&#xD;
      other HCs.&#xD;
