      This open-label Phase 2 study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of modified T cells&#xD;
      (JCAR017) administered to adult patients with aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).&#xD;
      The study will also help determine how long the modified T cells stay in the patient's body.&#xD;
      Furthermore, changes in the patient's quality of life will be described. Phase 2 (autologous&#xD;
      T cells expressing anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor) (DLBCL NOS [de novo or tFL],&#xD;
      follicular lymphoma Grade 3B [FL3B], high grade B-cell Lymphoma [HGBL] and primary central&#xD;
      nervous system lymphoma [PCNSL]).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multi-cohort, multi-center, Phase 2 study to determine the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of JCAR017 in adult patients with aggressive B-cell NHL. The study will enroll&#xD;
      patients in Europe and Japan with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise&#xD;
      specified (NOS; de novo or transformed follicular lymphoma [tFL]), high-grade B-cell lymphoma&#xD;
      with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements with DLBCL histology (HGBL), follicular lymphoma&#xD;
      Grade 3B (FL3B), and primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Patients with secondary&#xD;
      central nervous system (CNS) involvement are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled, patients will undergo leukapheresis to enable JCAR017 cell product generation.&#xD;
      Upon successful JCAR017 cell product generation, patients will receive lymphodepleting&#xD;
      chemotherapy followed by infusion of JCAR017. JCAR017 will be administered at a dose of 100 x&#xD;
      10^6 JCAR017-positive transfected viable T cells by intravenous infusion. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed for approximately 2 years after their JCAR017 infusion for safety, disease status,&#xD;
      survival and health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed adverse events following exposure to gene modified T cells will be assessed and&#xD;
      long-term persistence of these modified T cells will continue to be monitored under a&#xD;
      separate long-term follow-up protocol for up to 15 years after JCAR017 infusion as per&#xD;
      competent authority guidelines.&#xD;

             anthracycline and rituximab (or other CD20-targeted agent)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Transplant not eligible subjects will include those who are deemed ineligible for&#xD;
                  high-dose chemotherapy and HSCT due to age, performance status or comorbidity,&#xD;
                  while also having adequate organ function for CAR T cell treatment. At the very&#xD;

                  only): Subjects meeting eligibility criteria for either Cohort 1 or 2 Cohort 4:&#xD;
                  Subjects with newly diagnosed HGBL. Subjects must be eligible for anthracycline&#xD;
                  and rituximab (or other CD20-targeted agent) containing regimen as induction&#xD;
                  prior to consolidation with JCAR017** Cohort 5: Subjects with PCNSL who failed&#xD;
                  first line therapy with HDCT and ASCT Cohort 7: Subjects meeting eligibility&#xD;
                  criteria for Cohort 1 and suitable for outpatient treatment***&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  For subjects with transformed disease, the subject should have had at least&#xD;
                       2 lines of systemic therapy for his/her transformed disease (ie, DLBCL) for&#xD;
                       Cohort 1 and 1 line for Cohort 2 to be eligible. Lines of therapy do not&#xD;
                       include those given for a previously indolent condition (ie, follicular&#xD;
                       lymphoma). Subjects do NOT have to have anthracycline for their DLBCL if&#xD;
                       received for indolent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  For subjects already undergoing anthracycline and rituximab containing&#xD;
                            regimen, eligibility is to be discussed with Medical Monitor. Subjects&#xD;
                            with complete metabolic response after 2 cycles of induction will&#xD;
                            proceed with JCAR017 infusion only at time of relapse, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
                              -  Subjects must meet the conditions for outpatient treatment and&#xD;
                                 monitoring as outlined in the Outpatient Administration and&#xD;
                                 Monitoring Guidance for Lisocabtagene Maraleucel.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Subjects with secondary CNS lymphoma involvement may enroll in Cohorts 1 to 4&#xD;
             and 7; subjects with PCNSL are eligible for Cohort 5. Subject selection must consider&#xD;
             clinical risk factors for severe adverse events (AEs) and alternative treatment&#xD;
             options. Subjects should only be enrolled if the Investigator considers the potential&#xD;
             benefit outweighs the risk for the subject. For Cohort 5 and to not compromise safety,&#xD;
             subject selection has been restricted to those fit enough to HDCT and ASCT as their&#xD;
             prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Histological confirmation of diagnosis at last relapse. Enough tumor material must be&#xD;
             available for central confirmation of diagnosis, otherwise a new tumor biopsy is&#xD;
             mandated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: If the subject did not experience CR since last biopsy, the most recent biopsy&#xD;
             will be considered adequate to participate in the trial. For subjects with PCNSL, at a&#xD;
             minimum, corresponding pathology report is required if archival tumor material is not&#xD;
             available and repeated biopsy not feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. For subjects with NHL (except Cohort 5): Subjects must have positron emission&#xD;
             tomography (PET)-positive disease as per Lugano Classification (Cheson, 2014)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. For subjects with PCNSL: Subjects must have disease that is objectively measurable by&#xD;
             International Workshop to Standardize Baseline Evaluation and Response Criteria in&#xD;
             Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (Abrey, 2005). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)&#xD;
             cytology will be repeated (in case of leptomeningeal disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Adequate organ function, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequate bone marrow function to receive LD chemotherapy as assessed by the&#xD;
                  Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min (estimated&#xD;
                  glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] by Cockroft Gault)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 5 x ULN and total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL (or &lt;&#xD;
                  3.0 mg/dL for subjects with Gilbert's syndrome or lymphomatous infiltration of&#xD;
                  the liver)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequate pulmonary function, defined as ≤ Grade 1 dyspnea according to Common&#xD;
                  Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and oxygen saturation (SaO2) ≥&#xD;
                  92% on room air&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequate cardiac function, defined as LVEF ≥ 40% as assessed by echocardiogram or&#xD;
                  multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan performed within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
                  leukapheresis&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Adequate vascular access for leukapheresis procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects must agree to not donate blood, organs, sperm or semen, and egg cells for&#xD;
             usage in other individuals after the JCAR017 infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Female subjects of childbearing potential (FCBP) must:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Have two negative pregnancy tests as verified by the Investigator (one negative&#xD;
                  serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin [ß-hCG] pregnancy test result at&#xD;
                  screening and one negative serum pregnancy test within 48 hours prior to the&#xD;
                  first dose of LD chemotherapy). This applies even if the subject practices true&#xD;
                  abstinence* from heterosexual contact&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Either commit to true abstinence* from heterosexual contact (which must be&#xD;
                  reviewed on a monthly basis and source documented) or agree to use, and be able&#xD;
                  to comply with, effective contraception without interruption. Contraception&#xD;
                  methods must include 1 highly effective (barrier) method of contraception from&#xD;
                  screening until at least 12 months following LD chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Highly effective methods are defined as those that result in a low failure rate (ie,&#xD;
        less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. The following are examples of&#xD;
        contraception:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Highly effective methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intrauterine device (IUD)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hormonal (birth control pill, injections, implants)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Partner's vasectomy c) Agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation&#xD;
             and for at least 12 months following LD chemotherapy d) There is insufficient exposure&#xD;
             data to provide any recommendation concerning the duration of contraception and the&#xD;
             abstaining from breastfeeding following treatment with JCAR017. Any decision regarding&#xD;
             contraception and breastfeeding after JCAR017 infusion should be discussed with the&#xD;
             treating physician 14. Male subjects must:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Practice true abstinence* (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis and source&#xD;
                  documented) or agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female&#xD;
                  or a female of childbearing potential while participating in the study and until&#xD;
                  at least 12 months following Lymphodepleting (LD) chemotherapy even if he has&#xD;
                  undergone a successful vasectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. There is insufficient exposure data to provide any recommendation concerning the&#xD;
                  duration of contraception following treatment with JCAR017. Any decision&#xD;
                  regarding contraception after JCAR017 infusion should be discussed with the&#xD;
                  treating physician * True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the&#xD;
                  preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. In contrast, periodic abstinence&#xD;
                  (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal&#xD;
                  are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness that would prevent the subject from participating in the study&#xD;
