      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MT-3724 in&#xD;

      This is a multi-center, open-label two-part study evaluating the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      MT-3724 in combination with GEMOX in relapsed or refractory B-cell Lymphoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: (MT-3724 Dose Escalation) Define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MT-3724 in&#xD;
      combination with standard treatment of GEMOX&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: (MTD Expansion Cohort) Confirm the safety and tolerability of the MTD of MT-3724 from&#xD;
      Part 1 in the MTD Expansion Cohort, where MT-3724 will be given at the MTD in combination&#xD;
      with GEMOX. In addition, the PK, PD, immunogenicity and tumor response at the MTD of MT-3724&#xD;
      in combination with GEMOX will be more thoroughly evaluated in Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MT-3724 will be administered as intravenous (IV) infusion over 1 hour. In C1, MT-3724&#xD;
      infusion should be administered on Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 22, 29, and 36 of the 42-day&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cycle 2 and beyond, MT-3724 will be administered weekly on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each&#xD;
      28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first 2 weeks of C1, no more than two MT-3724 doses can be administered on&#xD;
      consecutive days. If MT-3724 is administered on consecutive days, then at least 20 hours&#xD;
      (more than 5 half-lives of MT-3724 in plasma) must elapse between the start of the 2&#xD;
      infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Weeks 3 through 6 of C1 and for C2 and beyond, different dosing days within ± 2 days from&#xD;
      scheduled weekly doses may be selected at investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment -Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 will be administered as 30-minute IV infusion. In C1,&#xD;
      Gemcitabine will be administered on Day 16 and Day 30 of the 42-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cycle 2 and beyond, Gemcitabine will be administered on Day 2 and Day 16 of each 28-day&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment -Oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 will be administered as 2-hour IV infusion after&#xD;
      Gemcitabine. In C1, Oxaliplatin will be administered on Day 16 and Day 30 of the 42-day&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cycle 2 and beyond, Oxaliplatin will be administered on Day 2 and Day 16 of each 28-day&#xD;
      cycle. Oxaliplatin infusion will start one hour after the start of Gemcitabine infusion&#xD;
      (unless a delay is warranted at the investigator's discretion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continued Treatment with MT-3724 in combination with GEMOX will continue for four cycles of&#xD;
      until death, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or another&#xD;
      reason for withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After four cycles, the subjects who experience clinical benefit can continue MT-3724&#xD;
      treatment with additional cycles of 28 days each (either alone or in combination with GEMOX)&#xD;
      if supported by the investigator's assessment of the benefit-risk ratio, after consultation&#xD;
      with sponsor and Medical Monitor&#xD;
