      Guidelines recommend not screening adults with &lt;10-year life expectancy for cancer; however,&#xD;
      primary care physicians feel uncomfortable talking to older adults about prognosis. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to determine whether providing PCPs with scripts on patient prognosis and&#xD;
      older adults with information on their prognosis would be useful when recommending stopping&#xD;
      cancer screening.&#xD;

      The American Cancer Society and the American Board of Internal Medicine Choosing Wisely&#xD;
      Campaign recommend clinicians not screen older adults who have &lt;10 year life expectancy for&#xD;
      breast (specific to women) or colorectal cancer (CRC). This is because these patients have&#xD;
      little chance of experiencing the life prolonging benefits of cancer screening and instead&#xD;
      may only experience harm from being screened. The most concerning harm of cancer screening is&#xD;
      overdiagnosis - the diagnosis and treatment of cancers that otherwise would not have caused&#xD;
      problems in an older adult's lifetime. Despite this, around half of adults &gt;75 years with &lt;10&#xD;
      year life expectancy are regularly screened for cancer. One reason for the overuse of these&#xD;
      tests is that PCPs feel uncomfortable discussing stopping screening with older adults since&#xD;
      it requires estimating and discussing patient prognosis. Some PCPs admit to recommending&#xD;
      cancer screening to older adults with short life expectancy simply to avoid talking to&#xD;
      patients about prognosis. However, by avoiding these discussions, PCPs may be impeding older&#xD;
      adults' ability to make informed decisions about their care and may be putting patients at&#xD;
      risk of the harms of cancer screening without any chance of benefit. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to interview PCPs and older adults about their thoughts and feelings on how&#xD;
      PCPs may discuss older adults' prognosis in the context of talking about stopping cancer&#xD;
      screening. Based on those findings, the investigators will develop strategies for PCPs to use&#xD;
      to approach these discussions and will draft scripts to suggest language for PCPs to use when&#xD;
      communicating about prognosis when recommending stopping cancer screening. Then, the&#xD;
      investigators will study if providing PCPs with these scripts and information about their&#xD;
      patients' prognosis is useful. Specifically, the investigators will provide 45 PCPs with&#xD;
      information about their patients' prognosis and the example scripts before a clinic visit for&#xD;
      up to 5 of their patients. The investigators aim to recruit 90 patients with approximately&#xD;
      5-10 year life expectancy. The investigators will interview PCPs and older adults after these&#xD;
      visits to learn how and/or if the prognostic information and the scripts were used. These&#xD;
      data are essential for improving the quality of PCP discussions around stopping cancer&#xD;
      screening and will ultimately improve the care of older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To learn from PCPs and older adults about how to discuss patient prognosis when&#xD;
           recommending stopping cancer screening and to develop strategies for having these&#xD;
           discussions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study whether providing information on patient prognosis and scripts for discussing&#xD;
           patient prognosis when recommending stopping cancer screening are useful to PCPs and&#xD;
           older adults.&#xD;

    <description>Investigators will send the PCP via secure email the patient's prognosis calculated by the Lee-Schonberg index three days before the patient visit. Investigators will also send PCPs information on patient life expectancy from Cho et al.'s US life tables and scripts developed to sensitively include information on patient prognosis when recommending patients stop being screened for cancer. After five of their patients have participated or recruitment goals are met, investigators will ask PCPs to complete a 10 minute web-based questionnaire about their experience.</description>
