  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the effects of PATH-Pain on emotion regulation to improve self-management&#xD;
      of pain and pain-related disability in older adults with chronic pain, negative emotions, and&#xD;
      cognitive impairment. Half the participants will receive the intervention, and half the&#xD;
      participants will receive usual care with education. Intervention subjects are hypothesized&#xD;
      to have significantly less pain-related disability versus usual care subjects after 24 weeks.&#xD;

      This study examines the effects of PATH-Pain on emotion regulation to improve self-management&#xD;
      of pain and pain-related disability in older adults with chronic pain, negative emotions, and&#xD;
      cognitive impairment. We propose that emotion regulation is the mechanism of change through&#xD;
      which PATH-Pain improves pain and pain-related disability (outcomes). This pilot study will&#xD;
      provide initial evidence of the: a) feasibility and acceptability of PATH-Pain; b) effects of&#xD;
      PATH-Pain on emotion regulation (mechanism of change) and outcomes (pain and pain-related&#xD;
      disability); and c) mediating effect of emotion regulation (mechanism of change) on outcomes&#xD;
      (pain and pain-related disability). We will randomize 120 older adults (60 years or older)&#xD;
      with chronic non-cancer related pain and negative emotions to PATH-Pain vs. Usual Care with&#xD;
      Education (UCE). PATH-Pain will be administered by licensed mental health clinicians.&#xD;
      Research assessments will be conducted at the Wright Center at study entry (baseline), and at&#xD;
      6, 12 (end of treatment), and 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally 20 providers of patients will be interviewed for feedback regarding the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
