  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIa study sponsored by AzurRx SAS and Syneos Health is a local representative&#xD;
      sponsor and involves testing of a new medication for the compensation of exocrine pancreatic&#xD;
      insufficiency (EPI) caused by chronic pacreatitis (CP) and/or distal pancreatectomy. The new&#xD;
      medication is called MS1819 Spray Dried (MS1819-SD) which is a lipase produced by the LIP2&#xD;
      gene of Yarrowia lipolytica using recombinant DNA technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the safety of escalating doses of study&#xD;
      drug MS1819-SD in people with chronic pancreatitis. This enzyme has demonstrated an&#xD;
      appropriate profile to compensate the pancreatic lipase (enzyme) deficiency that is common&#xD;
      with CP patients. The deficiency in this enzyme can be responsible of greasy diarrhea, fecal&#xD;
      urge and weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of the study is open-label, meaning that all eligible participants will receive&#xD;
      the study drug MS1819-SD. The MS1819-SD dose will increase throughout the study during dose&#xD;
      escalation visits in each treatment period; study includes a total of four treatment periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the MS1819-SD treatment phase is of 48-60 days, The total duration of&#xD;
      patient participation in the study is of 74-93 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately twelve patients will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
