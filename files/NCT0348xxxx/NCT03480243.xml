        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study participant is male or female and between 18 and 55 years of age (inclusive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study participant is of a body weight of at least 50 kg for males and 45 kg for&#xD;
             females, as determined by a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m^2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female study participants use an efficient form of contraception for the duration of&#xD;
             the study (unless menopausal). Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to an&#xD;
             interaction with the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP), which may reduce the&#xD;
             efficacy of the contraception method. The potential for reduced efficacy of any&#xD;
             hormonal contraception methods requires that a barrier method (preferably male condom)&#xD;
             also be used&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study participant has clinical laboratory test results within the local reference&#xD;
             ranges or values are considered as not clinically relevant by the investigator and&#xD;
             approved by the UCB Study Physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study participant has Blood Pressure (BP) and pulse rate within normal range in supine&#xD;
             position after 10 minutes of rest&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male study participant agrees that, during the study period, when having sexual&#xD;
             intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential, he will use an efficient barrier&#xD;
             contraceptive (condom plus spermicide) AND that the respective partner will use an&#xD;
             additional efficient contraceptive method&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study participant has previously received Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) in&#xD;
             this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study participant has participated in another study of an IMP (or a medical device)&#xD;
             within the previous 3 months before Screening (or within 5 half-lives for the IMP,&#xD;
             whichever is longer) or is currently participating in another study of an IMP (or a&#xD;
             medical device)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study participant has a history of drug or alcohol dependency within the previous 6&#xD;
             months or tests positive for alcohol (breath test) and/or drugs of abuse (urine test)&#xD;
             at the Screening Visit or at any time during confinement&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study participant has made a blood or plasma donation or has had a comparable blood&#xD;
             loss (&gt;400 mL) within the last 3 months prior to the Screening Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study participant smokes more than 5 cigarettes per day (or equivalent) or has done so&#xD;
             within 6 months prior to the Screening Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study participant is taking any concomitant medication currently or within 2 weeks&#xD;
             prior to the first day of dosing with the exception of paracetamol (acetaminophen)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study participant has any clinically relevant Electrocardiogram (ECG) finding at the&#xD;
             Screening Visit or confinement&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study participant has a history within the last 5 years or present condition of&#xD;
             malignancy, with the exception of basal cell carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female study participant tests positive for pregnancy, plans to get pregnant during&#xD;
             the participation in the study, or who is breastfeeding&#xD;
