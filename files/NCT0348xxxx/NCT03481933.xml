  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Within the spectrum of fronto-temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) semantic dementia (SD)&#xD;
      causes profound language dysfunction. SD damages semantic processing typically in the&#xD;
      temporal poles (anterior temporal lobes, ATL). It is an early onset disease (often before 65&#xD;
      years of age) affecting about 4000 patients in France and for which no validated treatment is&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For several years a growing number of studies have explored the effects of transcranial&#xD;
      stimulation (TCS) on aphasic patients following stroke. Several studies have targeted&#xD;
      left-sided language areas and/or homotopical right-sided regions with excitatory or&#xD;
      inhibitory TCS, respectively, according to the principle of inter-hemispheric inhibition. In&#xD;
      addition, repetitive multi-day TCS has provided evidence for long-lasting language effects&#xD;
      (&gt;6 months) presumably linked to stimulation-induced neuroplasticity. Such investigations&#xD;
      have provided promising results and have demonstrated that the stimulation site is a&#xD;
      determining factor by showing that stimulation of cortical areas belonging to the language&#xD;
      network usually results in more convincing effects than stimulating areas outside that&#xD;
      network. Despite these findings the use of TCS in degenerative language diseases, such as&#xD;
      primary progressive aphasias including SD, has only been explored in few small cohort studies&#xD;
      and, surprisingly, they have not targeted language-related cortices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project proposes the application of multi-day repetitive TCS with direct current (tDCS)&#xD;
      in a large population of SD patients (N=60). It is built on a exploratory investigation of&#xD;
      our team which has used three single tDCS sessions in a double-blind sham-controlled study.&#xD;
      Excitatory and inhibitory tDCS to the left and right temporal pole, respectively,&#xD;
      demonstrated highly significant transient effects (20 min) on semantic processing in 12 SD&#xD;
      patients, providing 'proof of concept' and the rationale for this project. The aim here&#xD;
      consists of using repetitive multi-day tDCS for a potential therapeutic outcome leading to&#xD;
      long-lasting semantic improvement via neuroplasticity. The project is grounded on 2&#xD;
      hypotheses: i) tDCS to temporal poles (left-excitatory, right-inhibitory) reactivates&#xD;
      semantic processing in SD, ii) repetitive tDCS during ten days could induce neuroplasticity&#xD;
      and therapeutic language improvement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Main objective and evaluation criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the potential therapeutic efficacy of repetitive tDCS during 10 days on&#xD;
      language/semantic impairment in SD via a double-blind sham-controlled study design. The&#xD;
      evaluation criteria will be a significant improvement of language/semantic performances two&#xD;
      weeks after tDCS as compared to base-line (before tDCS), contrasting subgroups receiving&#xD;
      left-excitatory or right-inhibitory tDCS vs. sham tDCS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives and evaluation criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the time course of potential language/semantic improvement through the&#xD;
           application of four follow-up time-points: base-line (max one week before tDCS), three&#xD;
           days, two weeks and four months after tDCS. The evaluation criteria will be significant&#xD;
           improvement/modulation of language/semantic performances, comparing performances at the&#xD;
           four time-points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess brain markers which could reflect stimulation-induced neuroplasticity. Evaluation&#xD;
           criteria will be significant modulation of cortical metabolism (FDG-PET) and functional&#xD;
           connectivity (fMRI resting-state) comparing base-line and the 'two-week' time-point.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare left-excitatory and right-inhibitory tDCS to reveal the most efficient&#xD;
           stimulation modality. Evaluation criteria will be a detection of a potential outcome&#xD;
           difference between left-excitatory and right-inhibitory tDCS on the performance within&#xD;
           the different language/semantic tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Improve the understanding of the semantic roles of the left and right temporal pole, and&#xD;
           their potential anatomical connectivity, by comparing left and right temporal pole&#xD;
           stimulation and using MRI-based fiber tracking. 4) Improve the understanding of the&#xD;
           semantic roles of the left and right temporal pole, and their potential anatomical&#xD;
           connectivity, by comparing left and right temporal pole stimulation and using MRI-based&#xD;
           fiber tracking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design :&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 days of stimulation (20min, 2mA). Four language/semantic evaluations: base-line; 3 days; 2&#xD;
      weeks; 4 months post-tDCS. Two MRI/PET acquisitions: pre-stimulation (base-line); 2 weeks&#xD;
      post-tDCS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with semantic dementia (SD). Healthy controls for normative measures (no tDCS for&#xD;
      controls)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing treatment :&#xD;
&#xD;
      tDCS (specific device) : NE STARSTIM-ENOBIO 8 channels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practical procedure :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study will be 41 months; 36 months being dedicated to patient inclusion.&#xD;
      Participation duration of a patient will be of 4 months and 1 week to 4 months and 3 weeks&#xD;
      maximum. First, patients will undergo a series of standardized neuropsychological and&#xD;
      language tests that are included in routine care and inclusion criteria will be checked.&#xD;
      After inclusion, the base-line visit will comprehend 1) MRI/PET in the Nuclear Medicine&#xD;
      Service (CHU Pitié Salpêtrière), and 2) language/semantic tasks at the Department of&#xD;
      Neurology (CHU Pitié Salpêtrière). Subsequently the ten stimulation sessions will be&#xD;
      scheduled. They will take place in the Institute of Memory and Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      (Department of Neurology, CHU Pitié Salpêtrière) during two consecutive weeks (20 minutes of&#xD;
      tDCS). The tDCS sessions will be followed by three time-point visits: 3 days (time-point 2)&#xD;
      and two weeks (time-point 3) after the last stimulation session patients will undergo the&#xD;
      language/semantic tasks. At time point 3 the second MRI/PET acquisition will take place.&#xD;
      Finally, the visit of time-point 4 will be at four months after the last tDCS session,&#xD;
      dedicated to a last application of language/semantic tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selected number of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      80 SD patients selected in order to have 60 randomized into three arms (20 patients/arm).Two&#xD;
      arms receiving active tDCS versus one receiving sham tDCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 healthy volunteers will be included (participants will provide normative language/semantic&#xD;
      scores and MRI/PET measures; they will not undergotDCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of centers: 3 centers in France (Paris)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion period: 36 months Participation period (Selection/inclusion, tDCS sessions and&#xD;
      evaluation at 4 time-points): 4 months and 1 week to 4 months and 3 weeks Total duration: 41&#xD;
      months&#xD;
