    <textblock>
      This is a phase II Randomized comparison clinical trial of activated CIK armed with&#xD;
      anti-CD3-MUC1 bispecific antibody for advanced liver cancer. And the aim of this research is&#xD;
      to study the clinical efficacy and safety of activated CIK armed with anti-CD3-MUC1&#xD;
      bispecific antibody for liver cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies in China, ranking&#xD;
      fourth in all malignant tumors and third in mortality.immunotherapy is considered to be one&#xD;
      of the most promising means of human against cancer. This is a phase II clinical trial of&#xD;
      single- center, The investigators plan to recruit for 90 patients with advanced liver&#xD;
      cancer,and all patients are divided into three groups.one group will receive cryotherapy, one&#xD;
      group will receive Non-intervention therapy，and the rest one will receive mixed liquor of&#xD;
      activated CIK and anti-CD3-MUC1 bispecific antibody together with cryotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result of this study was statistic and analysed with the record of Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria In Solid Tumors(RECIST1.1) evaluation standard.&#xD;
