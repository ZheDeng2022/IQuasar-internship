  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a 2nd generation EGFR-TKI that irreversibly binds to EGFR receptors, afatinib is currently&#xD;
      recommended as the standard first-line treatment for EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer, and&#xD;
      clinical studies are also being actively conducted in other types of carcinomas characterized&#xD;
      by EGFR gene mutation and overexpression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall results from previous studies of gefitinib and erlotinib as EGFR TKIs , as well&#xD;
      as from preceding studies of afatinib - a 2nd generation EGFR TKI - suggest the possibility&#xD;
      of an effective therapy in esophageal cancer or squmaous lung cancer. In this phase II trial,&#xD;
      afatinib shall be administered to patients with squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus or lung&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma to evaluate its effects and toxicity. Also, biomarkers to predict&#xD;
      responses to afatinib shall be explored through further studies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      As a 2nd generation EGFR-TKI that irreversibly binds to EGFR receptors, In a phase III study&#xD;
      LUX-lung 8 in patients with squamous lung cancer, afatinib monotherapy showed longer&#xD;
      progression-free disease survival than erlotinib therapy. afatinib is currently recommended&#xD;
      as the standard first-line treatment for EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer, and clinical&#xD;
      studies are also being actively conducted in other types of carcinomas characterized by EGFR&#xD;
      gene mutation and overexpression. Thirty (30) solid cancer patients were included in a phase&#xD;
      I trial of afatinib, and of them, a patient with esophageal cancer had partial response.&#xD;
      Taken together, based upon the results from clinical trials of afatinib conducted so far, 7&#xD;
      out of 15 esophageal cancer patients achieved clinical responses of 3 months or longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the overall results from previous studies of gefitinib and erlotinib as EGFR TKIs and&#xD;
      our study of dacomitinib, as well as from preceding studies of afatinib - a 2nd generation&#xD;
      EGFR TKI - suggest the possibility of an effective therapy in esophageal cancer or squmaous&#xD;
      lung cancer. In this phase II trial, afatinib shall be administered to patients with squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma of esophagus or lung squamous cell carcinoma to evaluate its effects and&#xD;
      toxicity. Also, biomarkers to predict responses to afatinib shall be explored through further&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
