      The interaction between conditioned pain modulation and expectation in understanding the&#xD;
      placebo effect of pain reduction&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) has recently been coined for the psychophysical protocols&#xD;
      that assess the functioning of descending pain inhibitory pathways in humans. There is a&#xD;
      growing body of evidence points to the important role of spinal serotonin (5-HT) and&#xD;
      noradrenaline (NA) in mediation of pain inhibition via CPM. On the other hand, there is also&#xD;
      evidence on synergistic modulatory effect of the opioidergic control on CPM, however this&#xD;
      issue is under debates. It seems therefore, that pre-treatment CPM assessment may be relevant&#xD;
      for prediction of analgesic drug interaction and additive effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo effects are inherent to every treatment and significantly contribute to clinical&#xD;
      outcomes even in the presence of strong verum analgesic effects. From a psychological point&#xD;
      of view, a series of recent studies supported the nature of the placebo effect as a learning&#xD;
      phenomenon wherein verbally-induced expectations, cued and contextual conditioning or social&#xD;
      learning are considered as the core mechanisms to produce a benefit. Placebo analgesic&#xD;
      effects can be elicited by verbal instructions that generate anticipation for a benefit, thus&#xD;
      creating expectations of analgesia. The effect of placebo is, primarily mediated by&#xD;
      mu-receptors associated opioidergic neurotransmission. Alike brain structures activated by&#xD;
      placebo manipulations, prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, PAG and RVM are the most&#xD;
      important brain structures involved in initiating of opioid-mediated anti-nociception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interesting question that emerges is the extent of overlap between the&#xD;
      serotono-noradrenergic analgesia represented by CPM, and opioidergic analgesia represented by&#xD;
      expectation-based placebo manipulation, for pain reduction. It seems that the final pathway&#xD;
      for the two systems is the descending analgesia tract(s). It is unclear, though, if such&#xD;
      final common pathway dictates a limited analgesic effect, i.e., it can only be activated to a&#xD;
      certain extent, regardless of which system activates it, and therefore additive effects of&#xD;
      expectation and CPM are limited to a certain ceiling. Alternatively, different tracts of&#xD;
      descending pain inhibition are activated by each system, and the analgesic effect is&#xD;
      additive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive cortical brain potentials (especially, a P300 waveform) evoked in response to a&#xD;
      combination of rare and frequent innocuous sensory stimuli represent a neurophysiological&#xD;
      tool for assessment attention. As this test bases on uncertainty and the expectation of&#xD;
      upcoming stimuli, the recording of P300 may be relevant for evaluation cognitive processes&#xD;
      associated with expectation-related placebo analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to explore the interaction between serotono-noradrenergic and&#xD;
      opioidergic systems of analgesia in healthy subjects. More specifically, the investigator&#xD;
      will study whether these two systems work in an additive or a complementary way, and whether&#xD;
      the neurophysiological assessment of individual expectation capabilities can predict the&#xD;
      placebo magnitude.&#xD;
