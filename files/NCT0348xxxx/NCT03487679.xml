    <textblock>
      Participants will undergo one day of habitual eating followed by 36 hours of water only&#xD;
      fasting and final day of habitual eating of the exact same diet consumed on the first eating&#xD;
      day. Blood draws will be performed on Day 1 in a 10-12 hr fasted state and 2 hour&#xD;
      postprandial state and again on Day 3 in a 36hr fasted state and a 2 hour post prandial&#xD;
      state. Microbiome samples and blood glucose data will be collected throughout the course of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

      Screening and Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective subjects who pass the initial phone screening interview (i.e. meet&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria) will be admitted into the study and scheduled for a consent&#xD;
      visit. At the consent visit, subjects who decide to participate will be given a series of&#xD;
      questionnaires including a health history questionnaire, physical activity questionnaire, and&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a 3-day diet record, to be completed before the baseline visit at&#xD;
      the beginning of the study. Women who consent to participate will be scheduled to complete&#xD;
      the study within the follicular phase and menses of the menstrual cycle to avoid confounding&#xD;
      alterations in lipoproteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit1 (Baseline fasted):&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of the study protocolstudy participants will report to the Ragle Human Nutrition&#xD;
      Research Center located on the UC Davis campus (1283 Academic Surge, University of&#xD;
      California, Davis, in Davis CA 95616) for a 12-hour overnight fasting blood draw and&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements at approximately 8AM. Any participants that are found to have&#xD;
      fasting glucose above or below 70-100mg/dL will be removed from the study. Study participants&#xD;
      will be given a Precision Xtra Blood Ketone Testing Kit to collect blood ketone data during&#xD;
      the fasting period of the study protocol, a set of stool collection kits to collect stool&#xD;
      samples throughout the rest of the study protocoland fitted with a GoBe activity monitor to&#xD;
      track physical activity throughout the rest of the study protocol. Proper use, care, and&#xD;
      storage of the Precision Xtra systems, stool collection kits, and GoBe monitors will be&#xD;
      explained in detail to study participants during the baseline visit. Study participants will&#xD;
      be given a 24-hr food diary to record their food and beverage intake throughout the rest of&#xD;
      the day or may be asked to track their diet using GB 360.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit 2 (Baseline postprandial):&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline visit on Day 1 of the study protocol, study participants will go about&#xD;
      their normal routines and eat their habitual diet ad libitum while recording their dietary&#xD;
      intake throughout the day. This food record will be used in order for the study participants&#xD;
      to mimic their food intake on Day 1 during the eating period on Day 3 of the study protocol.&#xD;
      Study participants will eat their last meal of the day at approximately 6PM. Post-prandial&#xD;
      blood samples will be collected at 2 hours after the ingestion of this last meal and&#xD;
      immediately processed to yield patient plasma and isolated PBMCs to be stored for future&#xD;
      analysis. These post-prandial samples will constitute the baseline &quot;Fed&quot; state of each&#xD;
      participant. Study participants will also perform their first bloodprick for ketone&#xD;
      measurement using the Precision Xtra Monitor under instruction and supervision by study&#xD;
      personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After ingestion of their final meal, participants will undergo a full 36 hours of fasting&#xD;
      comprising Day 2 and the beginning of Day 3 of the trial without otherwise modifying their&#xD;
      typical routine, including drinking coffee or tea (but with no creamers or sweeteners of any&#xD;
      kind), if this is part of their normal routine. The time of the ingestion of the standardized&#xD;
      meal will be used as the start point (0hr) for the continuous 36 hours of fasting. 36 hrs of&#xD;
      fasting has been shown to be well tolerated in human subjects and was chosen for this trial&#xD;
      as it represents the approximate amount of time that fasting would be experienced during a&#xD;
      single cycle of an alternate day fasting regimen. Therefore, results from this study could be&#xD;
      generalized to plan for future studies of alternate day fasting. Subjects will be encouraged&#xD;
      to report any feelings of dizziness, headaches, nausea, or severe hunger that they may&#xD;
      experience and, based on the severity of their conditions, will be advised whether or not to&#xD;
      continue with the trial. Subjects will be asked to take small blood pricks starting&#xD;
      immediately after waking up on Day 2 and then every 3 conscious hours thereafter using&#xD;
      thePrecision Xtra Blood Ketone Testing Kits in order to test blood ketone levels during the&#xD;
      fasting period. Ketone levels obtained from the blood pricks will be recorded automatically&#xD;
      by the Precision Xtra monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit 3 (Post 36h fasted):&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 36 hours of fasting, roughly 8AM on Day 3, subjects will return to the Ragle Center,&#xD;
      perform a final blood prick for ketone monitoring by the Precision Xtra and their blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected and again immediately processed and stored for future analysis&#xD;
      constituting the &quot;Fasted&quot; state for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit 4 (Post 36h postprandial):&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the blooddraw at Study Visit 3, study participants will be allowed free access to food&#xD;
      throughout the rest of the day and asked to eat an identical diet to the dietary intake the&#xD;
      participants recorded on Day 1 in their 24 hour food diary. Subjects will eat their last meal&#xD;
      at approximately 6PM. Post-prandial blood samples will be collected at 2 hours after the&#xD;
      ingestion of this last meal and immediately processed to yield patient plasma and isolated&#xD;
      PBMCs to be stored for future analysis. These post-prandial samples will constitute the&#xD;
      &quot;Refed&quot; state of each participant. After this final blood draw, the Precision Xtra system&#xD;
      will be collected, the GoBe removed, and the activity and ketone data collected throughout&#xD;
      the course of the study will be transferred to a secure computer for analysis. Fasting&#xD;
      compliance will be determined as 1) increasing or steady ketone levels throughout the 36hr&#xD;
      fasting period and 2) the absence of significant drops in blood ketone levels, which would&#xD;
      indicate food intake and noncompliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      StoolCollection (Days 1-3):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will use the provided stool collection kits to collect stool samples from&#xD;
      each bowel movement throughout the entire course of the study. Stool samples will be obtained&#xD;
      from study participants at the Ragle Center as soon as possible after initial collection by&#xD;
      study participants, frozen, and stored at -80C.&#xD;
