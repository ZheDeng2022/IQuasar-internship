  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic spinal pain (CSP) includes chronic low back and neck pain. CSP is a highly prevalent&#xD;
      and severely debilitating disorder characterized by tremendous personal and socioeconomic&#xD;
      impact, long-term sick leave, low quality of life and very high socioeconomical costs. The&#xD;
      current strategies for treating CSP are not yet optimal in reducing pain and related&#xD;
      disability, urging the need for improvement. A possible problem is that the current&#xD;
      approaches are often to limited and only address pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatments for CSP do not address associated complaints like sleeping problems which&#xD;
      are however important issues. If present, sleeping problems may contribute to CSP severity&#xD;
      and related disability. If left untreated, they represent a barrier for effective CSP&#xD;
      management. Up to now, however, sleeping problems are hardly addressed and if so, it is&#xD;
      mostly limited to sleeping medication. This is a problem since the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      drug treatment has not been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, within the current innovative project we propose examining the added value of&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) to the current best physical therapy&#xD;
      treatment for CSP. CBT-I includes changing negative thoughts about sleep, sleep hygiene,&#xD;
      altering sleeping patterns, and teaching relaxation skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are to examine if CBT-I combined with the modern physical therapy&#xD;
      approach (education about pain followed by exercise therapy) is more effective than the&#xD;
      modern physical therapy approach alone for reducing pain, improving sleep and functionality&#xD;
      in CSP patients with sleeping problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore 120 CSP patients with sleeping problems will be randomly divided over the 2&#xD;
      treatment programs (60 per group) and will be assessed before and after their 14-week therapy&#xD;
      program consisting of 18 therapy sessions. Comparisons will be made for pain severity, sleep&#xD;
      quality and functionality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Modern pain neuroscience has advanced our understanding of chronic spinal pain (CSP). Despite&#xD;
      the scientific progresses with regard to the treatment of chronic spinal pain (CSP), current&#xD;
      treatments for CSP do not address pain comorbidities like insomnia, an important yet seldom&#xD;
      addressed issue. Treatment of CSP mostly still relies on monotherapies or on biomedical&#xD;
      models, as shown by expensive but ineffective treatments like lumbar fusion surgery, ignoring&#xD;
      important comorbidities such as insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the current innovative project we propose examining the added value of cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) to the current best evidence treatment for CSP. The&#xD;
      innovative nature of this approach to CSP goes well beyond the combination of 2 available and&#xD;
      effective treatments: combining cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia with the recently&#xD;
      established modern neuroscience approach (pain neuroscience education followed by&#xD;
      cognition-targeted exercise therapy) strengthens the content of both individual approaches&#xD;
      and applies the current understanding regarding insomnia and pain neuroscience to clinical&#xD;
      practice. This innovative combination will result in a synergistic effect of both treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary scientific objective of the study is to examine if CBT-I combined with a modern&#xD;
      neuroscience approach (pain neuroscience education followed by cognition-targeted exercise&#xD;
      therapy) is more effective than the modern neuroscience approach alone for reducing pain in&#xD;
      CSP patients with insomnia. Secondary objectives of the study are to examine if CBT-I&#xD;
      combined with the modern neuroscience approach is more effective than the modern neuroscience&#xD;
      approach alone for improving pain related outcomes, sleep related outcomes and physical&#xD;
      activity/functionality in CSP patients with insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To comply with these scientific objectives, the 120 CSP patients with comorbid insomnia will&#xD;
      be subjected to the baseline assessment of all outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up assessments will be performed immediately after 14 weeks of therapy (all tests),&#xD;
      and 3 months (questionnaires), 6 months (questionnaires) and 12 months (all tests, depending&#xD;
      on a go/no go decision) after finishing the therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate these objectives, a muli-center triple-blind randomized, controlled trial with&#xD;
      1 year follow up will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate statistical analyses will be performed to evaluate and compare treatment effects.&#xD;
      Statistical, as well as clinical significant differences will be defined and the effect size&#xD;
      will be determined.&#xD;
