      This is a randomized, controlled study with a 48-week treatment phase to determine the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy of temperature controlled laminar flow device (TLA, Airsonett™) in the&#xD;
      patients with severe allergic asthma who are withdrawal of omalizumab therapy. All patients&#xD;
      will be recruited from outpatient clinics of Thoracic Department of Chang Gung Memorial&#xD;
      Hospital and meet the inclusion criteria. After entry the study, these patients will&#xD;
      continuous their concomitant asthma medicines, except the treatment of omalizumab. These&#xD;
      patients will be randomized (1:1) to receive TLA device or matching Control group. The&#xD;
      participants will be recorded by randomized number to protect their private information. To&#xD;
      minimize a potential treatment group imbalance of clinical asthma management practice and&#xD;
      concomitant asthma medication use, randomization will be stratified by concomitant asthma&#xD;
      medication [in addition to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting β2-agonist (LABA)]&#xD;
      use at baseline: (1) patients not receiving theophylline, oral β2-agonists, antileukotrienes&#xD;
      or maintenance oral steroids; (2) patients receiving one or more from theophylline, oral&#xD;
      β2-agonists and anti-leukotrienes, but not receiving maintenance oral steroids; (3) patients&#xD;
      receiving maintenance oral steroids. The doses of ICS and LABA (taken separately or as a&#xD;
      fixed combination) and other concomitant asthma medications will be kept constant through the&#xD;
      treatment period. If they have asthma exacerbation of emergency visit or/and hospitalization,&#xD;
      or &gt; or =2 episodes of asthma exacerbation (defined as a worsening of asthma symptoms&#xD;
      requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids), the patients either with TLA or Control&#xD;
      group will return to start the omalizumab therapy till the end of 48-week follow-up.&#xD;
      Omalizumab dose is based on the patient's body weight and total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE)&#xD;
      level at screening and is administered every 2 or 4 weeks to provide a dose of at least 0.016&#xD;
      mg/kg per IU/ml of IgE. Patients are permitted short-acting β2-agonist rescue medication as&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients make study visits at weeks 0, 2, 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48 of the treatment phase. The&#xD;
      primary efficacy variable is the first time to asthma exacerbations during the 48-week TLA&#xD;
      treatment phase. Rate of hospitalization, and emergency visit per year will be also recorded.&#xD;
      Diary cards are used to record the clinical symptom score, asthma control test (ACT) and use&#xD;
      of rescue medication in the internet of Asthma Help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life will be assessed using the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) score at weeks&#xD;
      0, 12, 24, 36 and 48 of the treatment phase. Spirometry and exhaled NO will be performed at&#xD;
      each visit. All visits include assessment of vital signs and physical examination.&#xD;
