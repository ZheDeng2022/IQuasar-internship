      This is a short longitudinal preliminary study that aims to describe the dynamics of&#xD;
      low-density subclinical malaria to support the final study design of a subsequent matched&#xD;
      cohort study. The primary objective is to assess the dynamics of subclinical malaria detected&#xD;
      by ultrasensitive PCR over a short duration. The results will be used to guide the design of&#xD;
      a matched cohort study of subclinical malaria in Myanmar and along its borders with China and&#xD;
      Bangladesh&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a short longitudinal preliminary study that aims to describe the dynamics of&#xD;
      low-density subclinical malaria to support the final study design of a subsequent matched&#xD;
      cohort study. In this study, a small number of asymptomatic infections detected by&#xD;
      ultrasensitive PCR (usPCR) will be followed and tested intensively for three months to&#xD;
      measure the temporal dynamics of these infections. A much larger number of uninfected&#xD;
      individuals will be followed for just 2-4 weeks (two visits), providing a comparator group&#xD;
      for the infected cohort. The validity of our results in a subsequent matched cohort study&#xD;
      depends, in part, on our ability to accurately classify infection status using a single usPCR&#xD;
      result. In other words, do the investigators have sufficient confidence in the correct&#xD;
      classification of malaria infection positive and negative status using usPCR test at the&#xD;
      beginning of the study? While there is no gold standard test more sensitive than usPCR,&#xD;
      repeated usPCR testing offers a surrogate. Presumably, in a low transmission setting, someone&#xD;
      who is truly uninfected on the first testing should remain negative on multiple consecutive&#xD;
      tests, but this remains to be confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll study participants in up to six study sites, each with &gt;2&#xD;
      villages, towns, unions, refugee camps or plantations, or a single military base. Alternative&#xD;
      and additional sites may be added to ensure enough infected cases. The investigators will&#xD;
      screen for eligibility (age at least 0.5 year; able &amp; willing to strictly follow study&#xD;
      protocol and to provide written informed consent or assent as appropriate) and enroll and&#xD;
      consent eligible individuals. Study procedures are based on test results:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RDT-positive: one-time enrollment for data and venous blood collection; Refer to and&#xD;
           ensure appropriate treatment by care providing team; No study-related follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RDT-negative: Collect data and DBS samples; Return to research clinic in 2-4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PCR-negative participants: One follow up visit approximately 2-4 weeks after enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PCR-positive participants: Five follow up visits at approximately 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12&#xD;
           weeks (for those with total 12 weeks follow up) or 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 weeks (for those&#xD;
           with total 6 weeks follow up) after enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Finger stick blood sampling with be done for RDT and dried blood spot sampling in all&#xD;
           participants at each scheduled and unscheduled visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venous sampling will be done for participants with RDT+ infections detected at times&#xD;
           when study staff trained for venous sampling are present. Blood volumes at any time&#xD;
           point are limited to 2 mL for children aged &lt; 3 years, 3 mL for age 3-5 years, and 5 mL&#xD;
           for older children and adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimated duration of study:18 months&#xD;

        Sites broadly representative of the range of malaria epidemiologies seen in the region have&#xD;
        been identified based on available data on the incidence of clinical malaria and prevalence&#xD;
        of subclinical malaria (measured by both standard testing and by usPCR in surveys we have&#xD;
        supported). In a staged fashion, initial screening will be undertaken at these sites,&#xD;
        starting with the sites in Myanmar, where laboratories proficient in usPCR have been&#xD;
        established.&#xD;
