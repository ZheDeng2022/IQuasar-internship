      This study evaluates the safety, tolerability, and activity of BioFe in the dietary&#xD;
      management of iron deficiency in adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency is the most common, widespread, and costly nutritional disorder worldwide&#xD;
      with the World Health Organization (WHO) stating that up to 2 billion people are iron&#xD;
      deficient. There is a serious and widespread misconception that oral iron supplements are&#xD;
      safe and effective at alleviating iron deficiency. In a recent Cochrane review of 67 clinical&#xD;
      trials, women taking oral iron supplements had a mere 38% decreased risk of iron deficiency&#xD;
      compared to placebo. On the contrary, these subjects had a 114% increased risk of side&#xD;
      effects, the vast majority of which were associated with gastrointestinal (GI) disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In infants and children, iron deficiency impedes mental, motor, and auditory neuronal&#xD;
      development leading to serious lifelong cognitive and physical deficiencies. In adults, iron&#xD;
      deficiency, and associated iron deficiency anemia, cause extreme fatigue, decreased immune&#xD;
      system function and increased susceptibility to infectious disease, reduced work capacity,&#xD;
      dizziness, headaches, hair loss, and generalized reduced quality of life. Iron deficiency is&#xD;
      also linked to Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS), adult hearing deficits, reduced strength,&#xD;
      coordination, and endurance, anxiety, increased heart failure morbidity, decreased&#xD;
      intellectual performance, and erectile dysfunction among many others conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most iron deficient people are not effectively treated by, or are intolerant to, oral iron&#xD;
      supplements. Intravenous iron repletion drugs effective, but are also costly and onerous to&#xD;
      deliver leading to both patient and payor dissatisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BioFe, Medical Food for Iron Deficiency is nutritional/Baker's yeast (Saccharomyces&#xD;
      cerevisiae), expressing the Ferritin protein. Ferritin is an indispensable iron storage,&#xD;
      transport and absorption protein normally produced at low levels by almost all living&#xD;
      organisms. An illustrative example of the biology of the Ferritin/Iron complex is its&#xD;
      presence in human breast milk, providing infants the natural biological iron required for&#xD;
      rapid learning and development, without gastrointestinal upset. BioFe provides high level&#xD;
      expression of Ferritin that is naturally complexed with iron during culture, is pasteurized,&#xD;
      and dried.&#xD;
