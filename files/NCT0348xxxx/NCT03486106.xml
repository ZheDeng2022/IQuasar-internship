      This study evaluates the effect of music and its influence on anesthetic requirements during&#xD;
      total knee replacement surgery. Half of the participants will receive noise-cancelling&#xD;
      headphones in the operating room, and the other half of participants will receive&#xD;
      noise-cancelling headphones with music playing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to surgery, patient participants will receive a combined spinal-epidural per VCU total&#xD;
      joint protocol; the following steps are considered standard of care and not considered study&#xD;
      procedures. The combined spinal-epidural procedure creates complete numbness below the&#xD;
      abdomen down to the feet, which negates the need for general anesthesia. For patient comfort&#xD;
      during the combined-spinal epidural procedure, a one-time dose of 2 milligrams of intravenous&#xD;
      midazolam will be given; this dose is adequate for reducing anxiety while allowing the&#xD;
      patient to maintain conversation with health care providers if necessary. The standard&#xD;
      intrathecal dose for total knee replacement at our institution is 15 mg bupivacaine and 0.2&#xD;
      mg preservative-free morphine; this dose will provide complete numbness to the lower&#xD;
      extremities for approximately 3-6 hours. After this dose is administered, the patient will&#xD;
      then be positioned appropriately in the operating room and vital signs will monitored per&#xD;
      standard protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient participant will be randomized to one of two groups. Participants in the control&#xD;
      group will receive noise-cancelling wireless headphones that will not play any noise&#xD;
      throughout the procedure. Participants in the experimental group will receive the same&#xD;
      noise-cancelling wireless headphones but will be permitted to listen to the music of their&#xD;
      choice while in the operating room. Music will be provided via Spotify, which is an Internet&#xD;
      streaming music service, and will be played through headphones; this way, no other individual&#xD;
      in the operating room will be distracted or influenced by the patient's music selection.&#xD;
      Participants will not be able to change the Spotify channel. We will be using the paid&#xD;
      Spotify service with no commercials. If participants opt to have the music stopped, we will&#xD;
      withdraw them from the study and continue standard of care. The participants will have the&#xD;
      music playing for about two hours. If the participant has no music preference, the music will&#xD;
      be chosen for them and it will be the same for all participants that have no preference. The&#xD;
      volume will be adjusted in the operating room until the participant approves of the volume by&#xD;
      saying &quot;yes, the volume is good&quot; or giving another verbal cue of approval.The music will&#xD;
      continue playing until the surgical procedure is complete and the patient has reached the&#xD;
      post-anesthesia recovery unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As stated previously, spinal anesthesia provides numbness that negates the need for general&#xD;
      anesthesia, but patients often times need additional sedation, which will be defined as&#xD;
      anesthesia medication that is used to treat patient anxiety and discomfort in the operating&#xD;
      room. Patient participants in both groups will receive sedation via the same protocol, which&#xD;
      is outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedation will only be given as needed per patient request; the patient will be given a&#xD;
      noise-making device (such as a rubber duckie that makes sound when squeezed) that will inform&#xD;
      the anesthesia provider that the patient is uncomfortable and needs some sedation. A weight&#xD;
      based dose of 0.3 micrograms per kilogram of intravenous propofol will be given for each&#xD;
      patient request. This dose is expected to provide amnesia or light sleep for a few minutes.&#xD;
      For patient safety, if the patient requests sedation more than once within a two minute&#xD;
      window, the anesthesia provider will not administer any more medication during this two&#xD;
      minute period. Additionally, the anesthesia provider may withhold sedation if he or she&#xD;
      determines with physical exam and hemodynamic monitors that the patient is already&#xD;
      over-sedated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After five propofol boluses have been given to a patient, a propofol continuous infusion will&#xD;
      be initiated at 25mcg/kg/min. The patient may still request additional sedation with the&#xD;
      request instrument if he or she is still conscious enough to do so. If the anesthesia&#xD;
      provider has given more than five boluses even with the baseline propofol infusion, the&#xD;
      infusion will be increased to 50mcg/kg/min. In the highly unlikely scenario that five&#xD;
      additional boluses are required with a propofol infusion rate of 50 mcg/kg/min, the&#xD;
      anesthesia providers and investigators will make a clinical decision as to what is the safest&#xD;
      next step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be scenarios that warrant conversion to general anesthesia. These scenarios&#xD;
      include, but are not limited to, hemodynamic instability, regurgitation of gastric content,&#xD;
      obtundation, excessive agitation, and inadequate spinal anesthesia. The decision to convert&#xD;
      to the general anesthesia will be made by the anesthesiologist and anesthesia provider in the&#xD;
      operating room; implementation of this study should not prevent or delay this decision if it&#xD;
      is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documentation will be completed by the anesthesia provider per standard protocol for&#xD;
      electronic anesthesia charting at VCU. This will allow for data acquisition by the&#xD;
      investigators through the anesthesiology printed record in Cerner.&#xD;
