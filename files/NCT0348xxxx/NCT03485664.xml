      This prospective study was performed on 82 participants. Severe pain on percussion of the&#xD;
      relevant tooth was considered as basic criteria when deciding on acute infection phase. The&#xD;
      acutely infected teeth were labeled as the study group (n=35) and the asymptomatic ones as&#xD;
      the control group (n=47). The extractions were done in the usual way. Amount of anesthetic&#xD;
      solution used and durations of extractions were recorded.&#xD;

      This research designed as a prospective study between February 2017 and June 2017. An ethical&#xD;
      committee approval was obtained (document number 2017/01). The patients were selected among&#xD;
      medically healthy volunteers, who referred to us for extraction only one mandibular molar&#xD;
      tooth. The informed consents were obtained. Exclusion criteria were smoking, oral&#xD;
      contraceptive use, any conditions affecting the immune system, usage of antibiotics in last&#xD;
      two weeks and the teeth needed surgical extractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 82 patients aged between 15 and 79 years (mean 40.52 ± 15.46) met the study&#xD;
      criteria. When deciding on acute infection phase, percussion sensitivity was accepted as the&#xD;
      basic criteria. It was defined as severe pain when a dental mirror was dropped about 1 cm&#xD;
      above the tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with acutely infected teeth were labeled as &quot;study group&quot; (n = 35) and the&#xD;
      asymptomatic patients as &quot;control group&quot; (n = 47). The null hypothesis of the study was&#xD;
      &quot;there is no significant difference between the acutely infected and asymptomatic lower molar&#xD;
      teeth in terms of the complications that may occur during and after tooth extraction&quot;. The&#xD;
      level of statistical significance was accepted as 0.05 and SigmaPlot 11.0 (Systat Software,&#xD;
      Inc., San Jose, Calif.) program was used for statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Method All the extractions were performed by the same operator. The investigators&#xD;
      used 4% Articaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine HCL as the anesthetic solution. Inferior alveolar&#xD;
      nerve (IAN) and buccal nerve (BN) blockages were performed by using 1.5 mL. and 0.5 mL of&#xD;
      solution, respectively. If the anesthesia had failed, the same procedure was repeated. The&#xD;
      amount of anesthetic solution used for each patient was recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numbness on the half of the lower lip, and feeling no pain when probing the periodontal space&#xD;
      of the target tooth was accepted a successful IAN blockage. Then the BN blockage was&#xD;
      performed and the routine extraction was completed. Unless there was a radiographically&#xD;
      confirmed granulation tissue, the investigators did not curette the extraction sockets. The&#xD;
      investigators also did not package any medications into the wounds or did not suture. A&#xD;
      sterile damp gauze was placed tightly on the extraction area and the patients were asked to&#xD;
      bite it for 20 minutes. Extraction durations were noted for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were given postoperative instructions. In the presence of a possible&#xD;
      complication, they were asked to apply to our clinic and not to use antibiotics on their own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Evaluation of Systemic Condition The investigators called all the patients on&#xD;
      first and second post-extraction days for assessing the systemic signs of fever, fatigue, and&#xD;
      shivering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Evaluation of The Extraction Wound If the patients applied with severe pain,&#xD;
      The investigators recorded onset time and characteristic of the pain. In the intraoral&#xD;
      examination, no granulation tissue as a sign of healing and exposed bare alveolar bone was&#xD;
      accepted as alveolar osteitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators use SigmaPlot 11.0 (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA) package software&#xD;
      programme for statistical analysis. To compare the rates of AO, chi-square test with Yates&#xD;
      correction was employed. Shapiro-Wilk normality test was performed on the data for the amount&#xD;
      of anesthetic solution used and the duration of extractions. Since the data did not fit the&#xD;
      normal distribution, nonparametric Mann Whitney U test was used.&#xD;
