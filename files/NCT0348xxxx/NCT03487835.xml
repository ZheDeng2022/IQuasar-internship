      Aim: The present study aimed to investigate the role of Kinesiology ('Kinesio') tape in the&#xD;
      physiological risk of falling in older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Twenty two older adults aged over 65 years and living in nursing homes. After&#xD;
      assessment of demographic information, they were randomized into one of two groups [(Kinesio&#xD;
      tape (n = 22) and control (n = 20)]. Kinesio tape was applied on the Kinesio tape group only&#xD;
      and worn during a 2-week intervention period. Participants were evaluated with the Visual&#xD;
      Analog Scale, Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up and Go Test, Mini-Mental State Examination,&#xD;
      30-Second Sit to Stand test and Functional Independent Measurement instrument at baseline,&#xD;
      after 2 weeks of application and at 2-week follow-up.&#xD;

      Measures After participant demographics data (age, daily medication etc.) and their history&#xD;
      of falls information been collected, the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Functional Independence&#xD;
      Measure (FIM), and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) were administered along with the Timed Up and Go&#xD;
      test (TUG) and 30-Second Sit to Stand test (30s STS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1. History of falls Participating adults were then asked about another resident's&#xD;
      experience of falls in the preceding year. Interviews were conducted verbally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. The visual analog scale The VAS is a pain-intensity measurement scale that is both&#xD;
      effective and simple to use; the reliability and validity of the VAS have been previously&#xD;
      determined. To determine perceived body pain, individuals are asked to mark the intensity of&#xD;
      their existing pain on a 10-cm scale where a range of numbers-from 0 (no pain) to 10&#xD;
      (unbearable pain)-are displayed to determine body pain (Tyler, Jensen, Engel and Schwartz,&#xD;
      2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3. The functional independence measure The FIM analyses two aspects of disability: motor&#xD;
      and cognitive functions. The FIM is comprised of six functional categories: self-care,&#xD;
      sphincter control, mobility, locomotion, communication, and social perception. A total of 18&#xD;
      activities are evaluated by the FIM to determine functional independence; a seven-point scale&#xD;
      is used to evaluate each activity with the highest-possible score for the scale being 126&#xD;
      (Küçükdeveci, Yavuzer, Elhan, Sonel and Tennant, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4. The timed up and go The TUG test is an objective, reliable and simple measure aimed at&#xD;
      evaluating balance and functional mobility; the TUG test can also be used to assess the risk&#xD;
      of falling. Scores are calculated by measuring the number of seconds it takes for a&#xD;
      participant to complete the test. The use of a walking aid is permitted during the test&#xD;
      (Amold &amp; Faulkner, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5. 30-Second sit to stand The 30s STS test measures leg strength; the test records the&#xD;
      number of times a patient can go from a sitting to a standing position within a&#xD;
      30-secondperiod. For the safety of the participant, the chair used for the test should be&#xD;
      rested against a wall to ensure that it does not slip. The patient's transformation from a&#xD;
      standing into a sitting position should be performed in full (Whitney et al., 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5. The berg balance scale The BBS assesses balance by testing a patient's ability to&#xD;
      maintain their balance while performing functional activities. The Berg Balance Scale is&#xD;
      comprised of 14 items; each section is graded on a scale from 0 (bad) to 4 (best). Higher&#xD;
      scores indicate better balance. Scores of 0-20 signify high risk, those of 21-40 signify&#xD;
      medium risk and those of 41-64 signify low risk (Bogle &amp; Newton, 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6. The mini-mental state examination The MMSE assesses an individuals' mental function. The&#xD;
      standardization of this scale was established in Turkish by Güngen, Ertan, Eker, Yaşar, and&#xD;
      Engin (2002); the scale is easily applicable and provides information regarding a&#xD;
      participant's cognitive impairment. The highest possible score is 30, with higher scores&#xD;
      indicating good cognitive status. Scores lower than 23-24 are generally suggestive of an&#xD;
      'abnormal' cognition; additional levels of score breakdown specified (Güngen, Ertan, Eker,&#xD;
      Yaşar, Engin, 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. 'Kinesio' tape application The original 'Kinesio' tape (5cm wide) for this study. Only&#xD;
      those participants in the 'Kinesio' tape group only were taped; tape was applied in&#xD;
      accordance with Kenzo Kase's 'Kinesio' taping manual (Kase et al., 1996; Kase et al., 2003).&#xD;
      Before application of the tape, the area of application was wiped with water containing 70%&#xD;
      alcohol; anything that might prevent the tape from adhering to patient's skin eliminated&#xD;
      prior to the application. The length of the extremity subject to the tape's application was&#xD;
      measured and three I-shaped tapes were cut accordingly; one tape was applied to the ankle and&#xD;
      the other two tapes were applied along the base of the extremity to support the arches of the&#xD;
      foot, starting around the malleoli (Figure 2 and 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, the patient's ankle and foot arches were supported; additionally, the&#xD;
      researchers aimed to increase ankle stability and the proprioceptive sense the tape provided&#xD;
      the foot and ankle. The application was performed by stretching the tape original length&#xD;
      between 25-75%, according to the technique outlined by Kase, Wallis, and Kase (2003). An&#xD;
      expert physiotherapist with a 'Kinesio' tape certificate applied the tape while the&#xD;
      participant was in a sitting position, and was also responsible for taking all the&#xD;
      appropriate measurements.. Individuals in the 'Kinesio' group were visited every other day&#xD;
      for two-week intervention period. Tapes were verified during this period, and those with&#xD;
      deformities were removed and new ones were applied instead. All participants had their tape&#xD;
      removed and reapplied every three days. All participants lived in nursing homes and their&#xD;
      nursing-home staff were informed about the study protocol. In particular, participants were&#xD;
      informed that the tape did not need to be removed during bathing or situations such as&#xD;
      getting dressed. After the two-week intervention period, the TUG, the BBS, 30s STS, FIM and&#xD;
      VAS were re-administered to both the 'Kinesio' tape group and the control. During the two&#xD;
      weeks that followed the second measurement, no 'Kinesio' tape application was conducted on&#xD;
      either group. Two weeks following the end of the intervention period, a third set of&#xD;
      measurements were taken from each group. In summary, three measurements were administered to&#xD;
      each group, these included: one at baseline, prior to 'Kinesio' taping application; 1st&#xD;
      measurement; one following application, 2nd measurement; and one after a two-week follow-up&#xD;
      period, 3rd measurement. After study had been completed, the 'Kinesio' tape application was&#xD;
      offered to individuals in the control group if they desired.&#xD;
