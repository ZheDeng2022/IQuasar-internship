    <textblock>
      Pleural effusion is the accumulation of excess fluid in the pleural cavity, which results in&#xD;
      disturbance of the equilibrium between vascular hydrostatic and oncotic pressures. The&#xD;
      underlying causes of pleural effusion include pleural inflammation or infection, congestive&#xD;
      heart failure, lymphatic drainage blockage and malignancy.A parapneumonic effusion is a&#xD;
      pleural effusion associated with lung infection. Early in the course of parapneumonic&#xD;
      effusion, the pleura becomes inflamed with leakage of cellular elements, protein, and fluid&#xD;
      into the pleural space, forming the effusion. Subsequent bacterial invasion results in a&#xD;
      frank empyema, the presence of which often requires thoracentesis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A delay in the diagnosis and initiation of proper therapy for infectious effusions leads to&#xD;
      increases in the complication rate. These delays are more common in patients with coexisting&#xD;
      heart failure or malignancy.In fact, pleural effusion manifestations are alerting signs of&#xD;
      pain, dyspnea, and the signs of respiratory failure due to compression of the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other signs include tachypnea, decreased percussion, and decreased respiratory sounds. The&#xD;
      most common cause of pleural effusion in children is parapneumonic effusion or purulent&#xD;
      empyema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the prevalence of pleural effusion is high in children, its mortality rate is low .&#xD;
      According to the studies performed in the United States, parapneumonic effusion is known as&#xD;
      the most common underlying cause of pleural effusion in 50% to 70% of the cases . Congenital&#xD;
      heart diseases include 5-15% of the causes and malignancies are the rare reasons of effusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, effusions may be transudate or exudate and examination of the pleural fluid is&#xD;
      necessary to differentiate them. Exudate is confirmed by the presence of at least one of the&#xD;
      following criteria; pleural effusion concentration higher than half of the serum protein&#xD;
      level, pleural effusion protein level more than 3 g/dL, pleural effusion lactate&#xD;
      dehydrogenase higher than 200 U, pH lower than 7.2, and glucose lower than 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C-reactive protein is an acute phase protein that is synthesized by the liver in response to&#xD;
      various stimuli.The induction of C-reactive protein synthesis in the liver is triggered by&#xD;
      the production of Interleukin-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha by local pleural cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pleural fluid C-reactive protein levels are likely to reflect the serum levels because&#xD;
      the presence of C-reactive protein in the pleural fluid may be due to increased diffusion&#xD;
      from the blood as a result of inflamed capillary leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pleural C-reactive protein has been proposed as a specific biomarker for the differential&#xD;
      diagnosis of pleural effusions and reportedly exhibits higher sensitivity and specificity&#xD;
      than serum C-reacive protein. C-reactive protein can be considered a good candidate due to&#xD;
      its 1000-fold elevation in response to infection and the positive correlation between the&#xD;
      serum and pleural C-reactive protein levels. Pleural fluid C-reactive protein level was&#xD;
      significantly higher in exudates than that in transudative effusion.&#xD;
