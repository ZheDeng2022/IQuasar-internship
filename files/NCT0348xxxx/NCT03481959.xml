  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abuse of psychoactive substances is a behavior belonging to the field of risk behaviors that&#xD;
      begins and takes place during adolescence. These risk behaviors are a major public health&#xD;
      problem in France and worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cannabis is the first illicit drug consumed by adolescents in France. His experimentation&#xD;
      progresses rapidly between 11 and 17 years. The relationship between cannabis use and mental&#xD;
      health has been shown by several studies. In particular Attention Deficit Hyperactivity&#xD;
      Disorder (ADHD), characterized by attention deficit, impulsivity and disabling motor&#xD;
      hyperactivity and beginning before 12 years of age (DSM-5), is a major risk factor for the&#xD;
      consumption of cannabis. ADHD is a common condition (9% of children and 5% of adults), but&#xD;
      often undiagnosed or untreated. It has been shown that the treatment of ADHD in childhood&#xD;
      protects the consumption of psychoactive products during adolescence or adulthood. However,&#xD;
      to our knowledge there is no study showing that treatment with methylphenidate in an ADHD&#xD;
      patient - not treated - but already a cannabis user, was a positive prognostic factor in the&#xD;
      decrease in cannabis use.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Cannabis is the first illicit drug consumed by adolescents in France. His experimentation&#xD;
      progresses rapidly between 11 and 17 years. The relationship between cannabis use and mental&#xD;
      health has been shown by several studies. In particular Attention Deficit Hyperactivity&#xD;

      consumption of cannabis. ADHD is a common condition (9% of children and 5% of adults), but&#xD;
      often undiagnosed or untreated. It has been shown that the treatment of ADHD in childhood&#xD;
      protects against the use of cannabis during adolescence or adulthood. However, there is no&#xD;
      study showing that treatment with methylphenidate in an ADHD patient - not treated - but&#xD;
      already a cannabis user, was a positive prognostic factor in the decrease in cannabis use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The hypothesis of this study is that patients diagnosed with ADHD and&#xD;
      cannabis-treated patients treated with methylphenidate will decrease their number of days of&#xD;
      cannabis use compared to ADHD patients receiving placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Originality and Innovative There is no study showing that treatment with methylphenidate in&#xD;
      an ADHD patient - not treated - but already a problematic cannabis user, was a positive&#xD;
      prognostic factor in decreasing cannabis use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, there is not enough team in addiction trained in the detection of attention deficit&#xD;
      disorder which is now recognized as a factor of vulnerability for the development of&#xD;
      addictions. This project is the opportunity for a training in the detection of the ADHD in&#xD;
      the adolescent and the young adult of the professionals of the addiction and the setting up&#xD;
      of a treatment by Methylphenidate as well as its handling.&#xD;
