    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective single arm trial designed to study the safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      of a medical device, NovoTTF-200A, used with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in subjects with&#xD;
      brain metastases from small cell lung cancer (SCLC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are low intensity alternating electric fields, which are&#xD;
      tuned to interfere with the division process of cancer cells. TTFields are delivered to the&#xD;
      region of cancer using an investigational device, called the NovoTTF-200A system. The device&#xD;
      is portable, light weighted, battery operated device designed to deliver TTFields to brain&#xD;
      metastases from small cell lung cancer (SCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TTFields are a novel, non-invasive regional anti-mitotic treatment modality. Pre-clinical&#xD;
      studies and clinical data in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) have demonstrated a favorable&#xD;
      safety profile and clinical superiority when treating the brain with TTFields. In addition,&#xD;
      durable response have been demonstrated with 200kHz TTFields monotherapy for supratentorial&#xD;
      tumors of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of brain metastases is devastating for SCLC patients and their families.&#xD;
      Treatment options in this setting are limited to SRS or WBRT or a combination thereof. Few&#xD;
      clinicians treat SCLC brain metastases with SRS alone because intracranial recurrence is high&#xD;
      due to the fact that the entire brain is not treated. WBRT treats the entire brain and&#xD;
      improves intracranial control, but at the risk of neurocognitive complications. Thus, new&#xD;
      therapeutic options are needed, particularly ones that allow for greater intracranial control&#xD;
      while minimizing the risk of neurocognitive adverse events. As such, TTFields following SRS&#xD;
      may allow for sufficient regional treatment of the brain to eliminate any remaining tumor&#xD;
      cells following radiosurgery as well as micro-metastases that remain untreated, and&#xD;
      ultimately prolong intracranial control. Due to the favorable safety profile seen in phase&#xD;
      III recurrent and newly diagnosed glioblastoma trials and in which the patients reported&#xD;
      improved neurocognitive and emotional functioning, NovoTTF-200A is not expected to have&#xD;
      neuro-toxic effects seen with WBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators hypothesize that the use of NovoTTF-200A applied to the brain&#xD;
      following SRS for SCLC brain metastases will have cerebral control comparable to WBRT with&#xD;
      less neurocognitive effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will undergo stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Radiosurgery is a single treatment&#xD;
      and will be done as an outpatient procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) will be followed by continuous TTFields treatment using the&#xD;
      NovoTTF-200A. The patient will start using the NovoTTF-200A device within 7 days of SRS. The&#xD;
      NovoTTF-200A treatment will be started by the device support specialist (DSS), trained by&#xD;
      NovoCure, or by your study doctor. The patient will be educated and trained on how to&#xD;
      properly use the device in the clinic or by a separately scheduled home visit. During this&#xD;
      visit, the patient will be told how to operate the device, replace depleted batteries,&#xD;
      recharge them, and connect to an external power supply. All patients will be required to&#xD;
      shave their head, so the transducer arrays can be placed. Patients will wear 4 electronically&#xD;
      insulated transducer arrays (sticky pads) on the top of the patient's head (based on the&#xD;
      patient's tumor location) for the time the patient is using the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this visit, the patient will continue treatment at home where participants can maintain&#xD;
      regular daily routine. The patient must use the device for at least 18 hours a day per day on&#xD;
      average. Breaks are allowed for personal needs (e.g. showering/bathing, array exchange).&#xD;
      Patients will be instructed to replace the Transducer arrays 2-3 times a week with help of a&#xD;
      caregiver. Patients will be instructed to use the device for a minimum of 4 weeks from the&#xD;
      time of initiation. The NovoTTF-200A device will be inspected, either by the study doctor,&#xD;
      research nurse, or by a Novocure representative, on a monthly basis to assess the patient's&#xD;
      compliance with treatment. Each course of using the device will consist of continuous&#xD;
      NovoTTF-200A use for one month. Multiple courses will be offered as long as the patient's&#xD;
      tumor(s) in the brain have not come back. If the patient's tumor(s) do come back, the patient&#xD;
      will need to terminate use of NovoTTF-200A. If tumors do not return in the patient's brain,&#xD;
      the patient will be able to stay on NovoTTF-200A for up to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to visit the study doctor for follow-up care at several monthly&#xD;
      intervals (1, 3, 6, 9, an 12 months after completion of stereotactic radiosurgery), or until&#xD;
      the tumor(s) in the patient's brain return.&#xD;
