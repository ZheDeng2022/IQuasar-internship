      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of topical antibiotic irrigation&#xD;
      (gentamycin) and its ability to reduce surgical site infections in midfacial fracture surgery&#xD;
      compared to sterile normal saline (NS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In April of 2020 a petition was made to add gentamycin and remove bacitracin after the FDA&#xD;
      warning of the toxic side effects of bacitracin and because the hospital where the study was&#xD;
      conducted has removed bacitracin from its formulary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modification was approved.&#xD;

      Nagi Demian David Wainwright, Duc Lam, Georgian Brown Faculty Advisor: Nagi Demian, David&#xD;
      Wainwright Population: Adult Patients admitted to Memorial Hermann Hospital (MHH) for&#xD;
      treatment of Midfacial fractures Number of Sites: Memorial Hermann Hospital Study Duration:&#xD;
      Prospective trial, 4 years Subject Duration: Associated hospital stays, Follow up to eight&#xD;
      weeks postoperatively General Information The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of&#xD;
      topical antibiotic irrigation (Gentamicin) and its ability to reduce surgical site infections&#xD;
      in midfacial fracture surgery compared to sterile normal saline (NS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Information The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 16&#xD;
      million surgical procedures were performed in acute care hospitals in the United States in&#xD;
      2010 (CDC). A recent study found that surgical site infections (SSIs) accounted for roughly&#xD;
      31% of all hospital acquired infections (HAIs) (Magill). The overall infection rate for&#xD;
      traumatic midfacial fracture is about 9% (Lauder). Current regimens applied for prevention of&#xD;
      SSIs include: preoperative antiseptic preparation and systemic parenteral antibiotic&#xD;
      prophylaxis, intraoperative aseptic techniques, and postoperative incision care (Mangram).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative topical antibiotic irrigation intraoperatively is becoming more prevalent,&#xD;
      supplementing the recommended use of intravenous prophylactic administration of antibiotics&#xD;
      prior to surgery (Andreasen). Typical irrigation agents include sterile saline, Gentamicin,&#xD;
      chlorhexidine gluconate, betadine, Bacitracin, and hydrogen peroxide. The majority of&#xD;
      prospective references reviewed were limited to orthopedic, abdominal, ocular, breast,&#xD;
      dermatologic, and cardiothoracic surgeries with a significant lack of sources referencing&#xD;
      maxillofacial surgeries (McHugh). The available reports on the use of topical antibiotic&#xD;
      irrigation in prophylaxis of facial surgical wounds is insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the use of topical antibiotic irrigation (Gentamicin) reduce surgical site&#xD;
           infections in midfacial fracture surgery compared to sterile NS? Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prospective randomized trial: All groups with receive standard parenteral (IV)&#xD;
           prophylactic antibiotic. In the control group, the fractures will be irrigated with&#xD;
           sterile normal saline prior to closure. In the trial group, the fractures will be&#xD;
           irrigated with Gentamicin topical antibiotic IRB NUMBER: HSC-DB-18-0038 IRB APPROVAL&#xD;
           DATE: 05/08/2020 UT Houston Protocol Template Page 2 of 4 Adapted from NIH protocol&#xD;
           template and ICH Guidelines (80mg diluted in 1L 0.9% NS) prior to closure. Patients will&#xD;
           not receive postoperative oral antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Double blinded: Intraoperative irrigation will be concealed (saline vs Gentamicin) to&#xD;
           the patient and the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expected duration of study is about 4 years and subject participation is expected to be&#xD;
           about 200.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary outcome to be measured is the rate of surgical site infections. The main&#xD;
           investigator (Dr. Demian) will determine SSI (evidence of infection: persistent&#xD;
           swelling, fever, recurrent swelling, erythema, and purulent discharge). Statistical&#xD;
           analysis plan will be multivariate: SSI, use of Gentamicin, type of fracture, past&#xD;
           medical history, social history, days before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gentamicin information - Topical use Gentamicin injection or Gentamicin compounding powder in&#xD;
      0.9% Sodium Chloride injection or sterile water for injection for a final concentration of&#xD;
      0.08mg/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This drug is contraindicated in those individuals with a history of previous&#xD;
           hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to it&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dosage form: 8mg/Vial, injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum doseage: 5 mg/kg/day IV/IM is FDA-approved maximum. There is no maximum dose&#xD;
           stated for ophthalmic or topical administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is no premixed solution. The Gentamicin is obtained at the hospital pharmacy and&#xD;
           is mixed with 0.9% normal saline in the operating room by the scrub tech under sterile&#xD;
           condition with nurse practitioner supervision (Georgian Brown) in order to maintain the&#xD;
           blind. 80mg will be used per patient. Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion: All patients 18 years of age and older who are planned for open reduction&#xD;
           internal fixation of midfacial fractures as part of standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion: Infected surgical sites, allergies to Gentamicin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment: Will recruit all patients who are admitted to Memorial Hermann hospital at&#xD;
           Texas Medical Center Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expected number of visits will be about 5. First visit will be for evaluation in&#xD;
           emergency department. Second visit will be for surgery. Also, patient will be monitored&#xD;
           in the hospital postoperatively and will be seen for follow up in clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every case included will be randomized based on lottery system for intraoperative&#xD;
           sterile saline vs Gentamicin irrigation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every administered agent will not be known to patient or surgeon&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient will be then followed and monitored as per standard of care (inpatient&#xD;
           monitoring, clinic follow up after discharge, last follow up at 8 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following will be considered evidence of infection: persistent swelling, fever,&#xD;
           recurrent swelling, erythema, and purulent discharge IRB NUMBER: HSC-DB-18-0038 IRB&#xD;
           APPROVAL DATE: 05/08/2020 UT Houston Protocol Template Page 3 of 4 Adapted from NIH&#xD;
           protocol template and ICH Guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient information will be gathered to evaluate the type of surgery, medical history of&#xD;
           patient, research intervention of irrigation, types of antibiotics used, inpatient&#xD;
           recovery, and follow up care. The information will be recorded an encrypted separate&#xD;
           electronic document to ensure protection of patient information: secureshare.uth.tmc.edu&#xD;
           Data and Safety Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events are not expected&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be collected and kept by designated research assistants, Duc Lam and Georgie&#xD;
           Brown.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be kept on the secured website: secureshare.uth.tmc.edu&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interpretation of all information and results to be calculated at the conclusion of the&#xD;
           last follow up of the last case included in the study to reduce bias&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the conclusion of the study, data kept will have no patient information but still&#xD;
           will be stored in the secured location Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The aim of this study is to mainly compare the statistical outcomes between each group.&#xD;
           Once the data tabulation is completed, other statistical analysis may be pursued after&#xD;
           consultation with the statistician in UT Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to data requisition, UTHealth statisticians, Dr. Ruby Benjamin-Gardner and Dr.&#xD;
           MinJae Lee, were consulted for sample size calculation assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Given the prevalence of surgical wound infection in our target population is 9%, with a&#xD;
           sample size of 100 per group (200 total), a type 1 error rate of 0.05 and a type 2 error&#xD;
           rate of .80 (80% power), we will be able to detect a reduction of 9 percentage points,&#xD;
           from 10% in the saline group to 1% in the topical antibiotic group. Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IRB approval will be sought from CPHS. Start of project will be conducted only after all&#xD;
           permissions and approval are granted. Chart reviews and data collection will be&#xD;
           conducted only after all permissions and approval are granted&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consent will be obtained from each patient using standard consent forms for the specific&#xD;
           surgery. A separate research consent form will be completed by each patient discussing&#xD;
           the research study specifically.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once IRB approval is granted, additional application to the respective hospital will be&#xD;
           submitted individually to the respective research office and the offices of the&#xD;
           respective chiefs of staff Data handling and record keeping&#xD;
