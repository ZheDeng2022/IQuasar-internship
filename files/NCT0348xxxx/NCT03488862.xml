      Purpose: The purpose of this trial is to investigate whether a microfluidics assay can detect&#xD;
      trace amounts of residual leukemia and predict relapse in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)&#xD;
      patients in remission who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) or&#xD;
      Induction and Consolidation Chemotherapy (ICC) at the North Carolina Cancer Hospital (NCCH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): A total of 40 eligible subjects will be treated per standard of care&#xD;
      with either SCT or induction and consolidation chemotherapy (ICC) based on the appropriate&#xD;
      AML treatment paradigm for their disease. Peripheral blood (10 ml) for microfluidic chip&#xD;
      analysis and possible Immune Monitoring Core Facility analysis will be collected along with&#xD;
      routine lab draws prior to SCT. Patients in remission after SCT or those with confirmed&#xD;
      remission by bone marrow biopsy after induction chemotherapy will be followed for 1 year; and&#xD;
      peripheral blood (20 ml) will be collected to assess MRD by standard methods or by&#xD;
      microfluidic chip analysis on a monthly basis. In addition, bone marrow biopsies will be&#xD;
      performed at the end of consolidation (typically 5 months from remission), and at 1-year post&#xD;
      remission in non-transplant patients. In transplanted patients, bone marrow biopsies will be&#xD;
      collected at + 30 days, + 90 days, +180 days, and +360 days after SCT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      An unmet need in the treatment of AML is earlier detection of potential relapse by monitoring&#xD;
      MRD. The hope is that if clinicians can pinpoint when a patient's MRD starts towards a rapid&#xD;
      expansion to relapse, preemptive therapies can be instituted earlier with the hope of&#xD;
      eliciting improved outcomes. Current methods fall short of the ability to properly monitor&#xD;
      MRD in individual patients. An ideal MRD assay would be easy to conduct, sensitive to low MRD&#xD;
      levels and suitable for frequent analysis. A significant challenge for achieving this in AML&#xD;
      is that unlike other leukemias, AML's interpatient heterogeneity is immense; and there is no&#xD;
      characteristic genetic mutation or aberrant protein expression pattern for AML patients ,&#xD;
      thus hindering the broad applicability of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), fluorescence&#xD;
      in-situ hypbridization (FISH) or multi-parameter flow cytometry (MFC) testing for MRD.&#xD;
      Furthermore, AML relapse is rapid and it's been calculated that 42 day sampling intervals&#xD;
      would be a minimum frequency needed to predict 75% of relapses during follow up after&#xD;
      chemotherapy or SCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microfluidics assay being evaluated in this study is relatively inexpensive, broadly&#xD;
      applicable, as it identifies almost all (&gt;90%) of AML cells, and easy to use. The&#xD;
      microfluidic chip device is constructed with antibodies immobilized within the chip that can&#xD;
      detect cell surface antigens commonly expressed on leukemic cells (ie, CD33, CD34, CD117, and&#xD;
      CD123) directly in the peripheral blood without requiring preprocessing. The captured cells&#xD;
      are then exposed to fluorescent antibodies targeting surface proteins that are aberrantly&#xD;
      expressed on AML blasts (eg CD7, CD56 etc.), and fluorescence microscopy is used to identify&#xD;
      captured cells that express an aberrant surface protein. The investigators have already&#xD;
      completed a pilot study using this technology to monitor 5 AML patients after SCT. Because&#xD;
      this assay required peripheral blood and not a bone marrow biopsy, 39 microfluidic tests&#xD;
      could be carried out compared to only 8 PCR, MFC, FISH, and/or microscopy tests. Moreover,&#xD;
      the frequent testing allowed us to observe signs of impending relapse earlier than the bone&#xD;
      marrow biopsy-based test. The investigators plan to build on our findings in this trial and&#xD;
      test the applicability of using the microfluidic assay for early signs of AML relapse. If&#xD;
      successful, the microfluidic chip assay could be employed for serial MRD evaluations both in&#xD;
      the post-SCT setting and in patients with AML undergoing conventional chemotherapy while&#xD;
      providing a venue for the detailed management of a particular patient's AML including&#xD;
      response to therapy and risk for disease recurrence.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adult patients (≥18 years of age) with newly diagnosed or suspected AML who are going&#xD;
             to undergo stem cell transplant (SCT) or are being treated with induction and&#xD;
             consolidation chemotherapy (ICC) at the NCCH are eligible. These subjects must provide&#xD;
             written informed consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             --For the purposes of this study, induction chemotherapy is any therapy intended to&#xD;
             induce remission in AML patients that combines anthracycline/anthracenedione with&#xD;
             cytarabine; or combinations of cytarabine at a dose of ≥1 g/m2/dose x ≥ 5 doses with a&#xD;
             purine analogue. Liposomal combinations of anthracycline and cytarabine are also&#xD;
             considered induction therapy. Subjects receiving investigational induction therapies&#xD;
             will be eligible as long as the standard-of-care agents within the induction therapy&#xD;
             fulfills criteria above.&#xD;
&#xD;
             For the purposes of this study, specific choice of consolidation chemotherapy, or&#xD;
             decision to pursue SCT in remission are not mandated prior to enrollment, as these&#xD;
             decisions are not typically made until after induction chemotherapy has been given.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects scheduled for SCT or ICC must have confirmed CD33-, CD34-, CD117- or&#xD;
             CD123-positive disease to qualify for enrollment to undergo serial blood draws for&#xD;
             assessment of MRD by microfluidic chip analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects may be enrolled after beginning induction chemotherapy, provided that&#xD;
             sufficient AML blasts are available in the pre-treatment peripheral blood or bone&#xD;
             marrow sample to confirm that the blasts express CD33, CD34, CD117 or CD123.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adult patients (≥18 years of age) with newly diagnosed or suspected AML who are&#xD;
             scheduled to undergo SCT or ICC at the NCCH who do not provide written informed&#xD;
             consent to participate are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who are receiving non-intense therapies for AML that do not contain&#xD;
             anthracycline/anthracenedione or dual analog therapies. Such non-intense therapies&#xD;
             include: DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (azacitidine/decitabine), combinations&#xD;
             including DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, cytarabine monotherapy at doses below 1&#xD;
             g/m2 x 5, purine analog monotherapy or investigational therapies that are not combined&#xD;
             with standard induction agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects who test negative for the leukemic blasts surface antigens CD33, CD34, CD117,&#xD;
             and CD123 are ineligible for inclusion to undergo serial blood draws for assessment of&#xD;
             MRD by microfluidic chip analysis.&#xD;
