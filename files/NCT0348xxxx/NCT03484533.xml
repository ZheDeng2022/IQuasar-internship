      The investigators will conduct a randomized trial to evaluate whether provision of oral HIV&#xD;
      self-test kits (HIVST) to HIV-positive pregnant women to provide to their male partner,&#xD;
      increases the proportion of male partners who test and link to HIV care or prevention,&#xD;
      compared to invitation letters for fast track testing. Pregnant women who are randomized to&#xD;
      the arm with secondary distribution of HIVST to their male partners will be trained in the&#xD;
      use and interpretation of HIVST, and given two oral fluid-based HIVST kits to use with or&#xD;
      give to their partners, along with information about HIV testing and prevention and care&#xD;
      services. The investigators will offer men confirmatory testing regardless of their HIVST&#xD;
      result, counseling, and if negative, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and if positive,&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART). The investigators will provide counseling to minimize social&#xD;
      harms of HIV self-testing, and additional counseling and referral to social support services&#xD;
      when social harms occur. This project will address key challenges in PMTCT B+ programs, by&#xD;
      evaluating innovative strategies to increase male partner's knowledge of their HIV status,&#xD;
      disclosure, and involvement coupled with offering PrEP to HIV-negative men, ART to&#xD;
      HIV-positive men, and encouraging post-partum ART continuation and adherence among&#xD;
      HIV-positive women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uganda has the fifth highest HIV burden globally and one of the highest fertility rates in&#xD;
      Africa. Prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission Option B+ (PMTCT B+) is national&#xD;
      policy in Uganda. To maximize the prevention and clinical benefits of PMTCT B+, the&#xD;
      challenges of low HIV testing by male partners and high rates of post-partum discontinuation&#xD;
      of ART, insufficient adherence, and incomplete viral suppression need to be addressed. Women&#xD;
      may be more likely to continue ART long-term and have higher adherence post-partum if their&#xD;
      partner is tested, there is mutual disclosure of HIV status, and their partner takes ART or&#xD;
      PrEP, depending on his status. Innovative approaches are needed to allow men to test in&#xD;
      settings other than busy antenatal clinics, preferably where they have privacy, are&#xD;
      comfortable and do not miss work. Innovative HIV testing technology -HIVST- could increase&#xD;
      male partner's uptake of HIV testing, and prevention (PrEP) or ART (for all HIV-positive&#xD;
      men). This study has been designed to address this gap through an enhanced PMTCT B+ program&#xD;
      with HIV self-testing, and linkage to PrEP or ART, for male partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a demonstration project the investigators recently completed among mutually disclosed East&#xD;
      African HIV serodiscordant couples (the Partners Demonstration Project), integrated ART and&#xD;
      PrEP delivery with time-limited PrEP for the HIV-negative partner as a 'bridge' until the&#xD;
      HIV-positive partner was on ART for six months, and achieved viral suppression, was very&#xD;
      acceptable, achieved very high uptake and adherence to ART and PrEP, and nearly eliminated&#xD;
      HIV transmission. This protocol builds on that demonstration project by evaluating whether&#xD;
      PMTCT outcomes are improved by increasing uptake of HIV testing and PrEP among HIV-negative&#xD;
      men whose pregnant partner is HIV-positive. PrEP for HIV-negative male partners of&#xD;
      HIV-positive pregnant women provides highly effective prevention benefits during an important&#xD;
      'season of risk' when men may have higher HIV acquisition risk from their partner if she is&#xD;
      viremic (during the first few months after ART initiation, post-partum ART discontinuation or&#xD;
      due to viral resistance), or from outside partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a randomized trial to evaluate whether provision of oral HIV&#xD;
      self-test kits to HIV-positive pregnant women who are randomized to the HIVST arm, achieves&#xD;
      higher uptake of their male partner's testing and linkages to HIV care and prevention among&#xD;
      male partners, compared to invitation letters for fast track testing in the clinic (the&#xD;
      standard of care). The investigators will recruit HIV-positive women â‰¥18 years accessing&#xD;
      PMTCT B+ programs in Kampala, who have a male partner of unknown HIV status. Women will be&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention (HIVST) or the control arm (invitation letters to deliver to&#xD;
      partners to come for fast-track testing at the Antenatal Care (ANC) clinic where she receives&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
