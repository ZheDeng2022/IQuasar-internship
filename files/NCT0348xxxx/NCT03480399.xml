      No prospective data exist about long term morbidity and quality of life after multivisceral&#xD;
      surgical resection for retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma (RSTS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the safety of this surgical approach and the effect on the Quality of Life&#xD;
      over the long period we propose a prospective observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the surgical treatment has no significant impact in determining a&#xD;
      lower Quality of Life in the long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Primary objective Estimate the difference between baseline and 4 and 12 months&#xD;
      scores of the &quot;global health status / QoL&quot; scale in patients primarily treated for localized&#xD;
      RSTS, as determined in QLQ-C30 version 3.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the long term morbidity of aggressive surgical approach to RSTS in terms of&#xD;
           renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the difference between baseline and 4 and 12 months scores of DN4 / LEFS / BPI&#xD;
           questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the difference between baseline and 4 and 12 months scores of the following&#xD;
           scales from QLC-C30: PF2, RF2, EF, CF, SF, FA, FI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the difference between baseline and 4 and 12 months scores of the following&#xD;
           scales and single items from QLC-C29: Blood and mucus in stool, Stool frequency, Sexual&#xD;
           interest, Impotence, Dyspareunia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate the surgical resection pattern (number and type of organs resected) and the&#xD;
           tumor features (size, grading and histological subtype) with the long-term morbidity and&#xD;
           quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult patients (age &gt; 18 years) with primary localized RSTS surgically treated at our&#xD;
           institution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Written, voluntary, informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;

      Study description This is an observational study aimed to prospectively evaluate the long&#xD;
      term morbidity of aggressive surgical approach to RSTS and the impact over the patients'&#xD;
      quality of life. Consecutive patients candidate to surgery for primary RSTS will be offered&#xD;
      to be enrolled. We plan to include all the RSTS patients consecutively operated on for&#xD;
      primary retroperitoneal sarcoma from first accrual on up to the 24 months after the study&#xD;
      start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the entrance of the study, an informed written consent will be obtained. Study&#xD;
      participants will be asked to complete four self-filled in one-off questionnaires (see &quot;Study&#xD;
      parameters&quot; paragraph).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study parameters Study parameters EORTC QLQ-CR29 and EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaires (baseline,&#xD;
      4 mos, 12 mos) LEFS questionnaire (baseline, 4 mos, 12 mos) BPI questionnaire (baseline, 4&#xD;
      mos, 12 mos) DN4 questionnaire (baseline, 4 mos, 12 mos) Serum creatinin (baseline, 4 mos, 12&#xD;
      mos) Morbidity events (4 mos, 12 mos) Neurologic exam of lower limbs (baseline, 4 mos, 12&#xD;
      mos) Disease status (4 mos, 12 mos)&#xD;
&#xD;
      * In case of preoperatory complementary treatment, the questionnaires will be administrated&#xD;
      just before the beginning of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Life: the core questionnaire, the EORTC QLQC30,is an extensively validated&#xD;
           questionnaire for the assessment of health related quality of life in cancer patients&#xD;
           (Aaronson 1991). It contains both functional (physical, role, cognitive, emotional,&#xD;
           social), and physical symptom multidimensional scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and&#xD;
           vomiting) as well as two single item &quot;global health status&quot; and &quot;quality of life&quot;&#xD;
           scales, plus several single-item symptom measures. The QLQ-CR29 is a condition specific&#xD;
           module (colo-rectal disease) developed to be used in conjunction with EORTC QLQC30; it&#xD;
           is made up of 29 items for a total of four scales assessing urinary frequency, faecal&#xD;
           seepage, stool consistency and body image as well a number single items scales. Both the&#xD;
           tools are available and validated in the Italian language.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Femoral Impairment: the dedicated questionnaire (Lower Extremity Functional Scale -&#xD;
           Italian Version, LEFS questionnaire) will investigated daily life activities that&#xD;
           require ad adequate function of knee joint stability and quadriceps strength as a&#xD;
           surrogate of motor impairment of homolateral femoral nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic Pain Syndrome: the Italian version of the 'Brief Pain Inventory Short form&quot;&#xD;
           (BPI, attached) ( ) will be administered in order to obtain information on pain status&#xD;
           at censored time (basal, 4 and 12 months after surgery values).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropathic Pain: the Italian version of &quot;Douleur Neuropathique en 4 Questions&quot; (DN4,&#xD;
           attached) will be administered in order to obtain information on neuropathic pain at&#xD;
           censored time (basal, 4 and 12 months after surgery scores).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long term morbidity: morbidity events will specifically regard femoral nerve impairment&#xD;
           at physical examination, abdominal complications, sexual life and physiological&#xD;
           functions. Renal failure in particular will be investigated by renal function blood&#xD;
           tests monitoring and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) calculated according to&#xD;
           Cockroft-Gault and simplified MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) methods.&#xD;
           Serum creatinine value will also be registered. Renal failure will be defined according&#xD;
           to National Kidney Foundation 2002 criteria (Stage 2 or higher), and classified&#xD;
           according to GFR thresholds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease status will be recorded and in case of local and/or distant relapse the date of&#xD;
           events will also be retrieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations Statistical analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary end-point The two-sided 95% confidence interval (95%CI) of the paired difference&#xD;
           between baseline and 4 (or12) months scores will be calculated for the primary outcome&#xD;
           scale variables (items &quot;29&quot; and &quot;30&quot; QLQ-C30).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary end-points Descriptive statistics and frequency tabulation were used to&#xD;
           summarize patient characteristics and long term morbidity profile. Continuous variables&#xD;
           will be described with appropriate summary statistics such as the mean, median, standard&#xD;
           deviation, minimum and maximum. Categorical variables will be tabulated with frequencies&#xD;
           and percentages. The probabilities of renal failure and femoral neuropathy will be&#xD;
           estimated by the corresponding relative frequencies; their corresponding 95% confidence&#xD;
           limits will be calculated using the exact method, i.e. taking into account the binomial&#xD;
           distribution of proportions. The binary associations between the surgical resection&#xD;
           pattern (number and type of organs resected) and the tumor features (size, grading and&#xD;
           histological subtype) will be tested by using exact chi-square test. As regards the&#xD;
           quantitative parameters measured over time, summary statistics (mean, median, standard&#xD;
           deviation, minimum and maximum) or frequencies and percentages - as appropriate for the&#xD;
           type of data - will be summarized by each time point; mixed models will be used to&#xD;
           analyze the longitudinal measurements, allowing to take into account the within subject&#xD;
           correlation and to straightforwardly analyze unbalanced data that may arise in the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim Analysis We plan to performed an interim cross-sectional analysis at the end of&#xD;
      patient enrollment in order to describe the study population at baseline, according to the&#xD;
      primary and secondary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to include all the RSTS patients consecutively operated on for primary&#xD;
      retroperitoneal sarcoma from first accrual on for the next 24 months (about 60 patients&#xD;
      estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 60 patients allows the estimation of a two-sided 95,0% confidence interval&#xD;
      for the paired difference between baseline and post treatment scores with a precision (half&#xD;
      CI width) of 0.25 times the standard deviation of the difference.&#xD;
