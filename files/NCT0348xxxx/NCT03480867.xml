  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain cancer in adults. Despite surgery,&#xD;
      conventional radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, the average survival for GBM is 15-16 months.&#xD;
      Although additional chemoradiotherapy has been shown to increase survival, the majority recur&#xD;
      at the original location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite many efforts to improve the local control by improving surgical techniques,&#xD;
      increasing the radiotherapy dose or adding newer chemotherapy agents, these attempts have&#xD;
      failed to show a survival benefit or an improved cancer control. People who are not&#xD;
      participating in a study are usually treated with surgery followed by radiation (6 weeks&#xD;
      duration) together with temozolomide (chemotherapy drug) followed by temozolomide alone. For&#xD;
      patients who receive this usual treatment approach for this cancer, about 4 out of 100 are&#xD;
      free of cancer growth five years later. Because GBM invades the surrounding normal brain,&#xD;
      this study is looking into the possibility of minimizing invasion by starting treatment using&#xD;
      the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy prior to surgery. This approach is an&#xD;
      experimental form of treatment and the diagnosis is based exclusively on imaging and not on&#xD;
      histology of the tumour tissue, and there is a possibility that your tumor may not be a GB&#xD;
      but of other origins.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the deadly properties of GBM is its capacity to diffusely infiltrate the surrounding&#xD;
      normal brain tissue. Unlikely many malignancies, in GBM local disease progression, rather&#xD;
      than metastatic disease, is the leading cause of death. Extent of resection plays a key role&#xD;
      in the treatment of these patients with complete surgical resection improving outcome. In a&#xD;
      prospective, non- interventional, multi-institutional study of over 140 patients with GBM and&#xD;
      minimal or no residual tumor on post-operative MRI, Stummer et al.have shown that extent of&#xD;
      resection is indeed associated with improved survival. However, despite evidence of complete&#xD;
      resection on post-operative imaging studies, surgery is rarely truly complete. GBMs are&#xD;
      invasive tumors and, at time of surgery, a clear boundary is not clearly identifiable, either&#xD;
      on pre- or intra- operative imaging. Even when sophisticated imaging'techniques are used,&#xD;
      they are unable to detect invasive brain cancer cell for proper pre-operative surgical&#xD;
      planning to optimally delineate the tumor boundaries for a truly complete resection. Even if&#xD;
      they were, brain eloquence would preclude a complete resection of most GBMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite extensive and complete surgical tumor removal coupled with radiation and&#xD;
      chemotherapy, even in high doses, 90% of patients still fail at the border or within a few&#xD;
      centimeters from the surgical cavity. Glioma cell migration outside the original tumor site&#xD;
      may be responsible for this recurrence pattern. Cell migration is a complex, dynamic process&#xD;
      and is well-documented in GBM. It involves, at least, 3 independent but coordinated biologic&#xD;
      processes: 1) cell adhesion to components of the extracellular matrix, 2) cell's own motility&#xD;
      and 3) invasion. Giese et al.) reported that cell migration is established by several&#xD;
      independent mechanisms, facilitating the spread of tumor astrocytes, but with cell motility&#xD;
      being the possible common denominator for this biologic behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invasion of tumor glioma cells is a multi-factorial process. To migrate, the cell needs a&#xD;
      change in morphology and to interact with the extracellular matrix. It is possible that the&#xD;
      surgical insult at the time of tumor removal may facilitate such an environment. Also,&#xD;
      Wild-Bode et al.(6) have shown, in animal models, that sub-lethal doses of irradiation&#xD;
      promote the migration and invasiveness of glioma cells. It is conceivable that the use of&#xD;
      conventionally fractionated radiation therapy (2 Gy per day), even in doses above 60 Gy,&#xD;
      leads to only sub-lethal damage potentially promoting cell migration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recently completed Phase 2 study for patients with newly diagnosed GBM, our group has&#xD;
      shown that the use of concurrent temozolomide and hypofractionated radiation therapy to a&#xD;
      dose of 60 Gy given in 20 fractions (daily dose of 3 Gy) preceded by 2 weeks of temozolomide&#xD;
      given in the post-operative setting was associated with 2-year survival rates of 63% and 29%&#xD;
      for MGMT methylated and unmethylated tumors, respectively (Dr. G. Shenouda, personal&#xD;
      information. Manuscript submitted for publication). These promising results may be possibly&#xD;
      due to a dual effect of the use of neoadjuvant temozolomide (prior to radiation therapy) and&#xD;
      the use of a hypofractionated radiotherapy regimen. The upfront use of temozolomide may have&#xD;
      affected tumor control by interfering with the upstream signaling event triggered by the RT&#xD;
      preventing cell migration and also by promoting inhibition of glioma cell invasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GBMs are one of the most rapidly growing tumors. Primary GBMs typically develop and grow to&#xD;
      be greater than 3 cm in less than 4 months. Under the current standard treatment approach,&#xD;
      patients undergo surgery and, rather than starting adjuvant therapy immediately at a moment&#xD;
      when there is the least amount of residual tumor burden, they wait 3-4 weeks, for practical&#xD;
      reasons, to start adjuvant treatment with RT and TMZ. In addition, the combined treatment&#xD;
      takes an additional 6 weeks to complete. Thus it takes 9-10 weeks for patients to complete&#xD;
      maximum local treatment. In other words, one of the most aggressive tumors has been given&#xD;
      another 9-10 weeks to proliferate, repopulate and invade. It is conceivable that this delay&#xD;
      in adjuvant treatment gives the residual brain cancer cells the opportunity to regrow and&#xD;
      invade prior to completion of RT and TMZ thus contributing to 85% of all failures occurring&#xD;
      at or within 2 cm of the original resection cavity margin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of pre-operative RT, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, has been&#xD;
      successfully used in other pathologies. In patients with soft tissue sarcoma, localized .&#xD;
      rectal cancer, locally advanced breast cancer, and esophageal cancer the use of pre-operative&#xD;
      RT has been associated with improved local control (8-11). Recently, the use of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      radiosurgery has been explored in patients harboring resectable metastatic brain lesions&#xD;
      (12). A total of 47 patients underwent radiosurgery prior to the surgical procedure (total of&#xD;
      51 lesions) and the authors report high rates of local control with limited toxicity. The use&#xD;
      of pre-operative RT has several theoretical advantages in patients with GBM. Neoadjuvant RT&#xD;
      is delivered prior to the surgical procedure minimizing, theoretically, the risk of local&#xD;
      cell migration at the time of the surgical intervention. It has also the advantage of&#xD;
      treating a target that has an intact blood supply and, most importantly, RT will be delivered&#xD;
      to a better defined target. It also allows a definitive portion of the treatment paradigm to&#xD;
      be delivered in a timely manner with no prolonged delay.&#xD;
