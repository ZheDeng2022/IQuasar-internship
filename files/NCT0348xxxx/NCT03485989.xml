  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With advancing age, older adults are susceptible to vitamin and mineral deficiencies for a&#xD;
      variety of reasons. Nutrient-dense food sources of vitamin E and other key vitamins and&#xD;
      minerals, like hazelnuts, may offer a simple means of improving nutritional status of healthy&#xD;
      older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This hypothesis is that individuals eating hazelnuts everyday will result in measurable&#xD;
      increases in magnesium and vitamin E levels, two under-consumed micronutrients among older&#xD;
      adults. Thus, subjects will consume two ounces (56 g) of hazelnuts each day for sixteen&#xD;
      weeks. Investigators will measure vitamin E and magnesium levels along with a general&#xD;
      assessment of micronutrient status as primary outcomes. Since nuts are nutrient-rich sources&#xD;
      of unsaturated fatty acids but low in carbohydrates, changes in fasting glucose, lipid and&#xD;
      lipoprotein profiles, and BMI will also be determined (secondary outcomes).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older adults are at increased risk of various chronic diseases where inadequate levels of&#xD;
      vitamins and minerals may play a significant role, including cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease, liver disease, and cancer. Older adults are increasingly more&#xD;
      susceptible to vitamin and mineral deficiencies with changes in dietary preferences, changes&#xD;
      in socioeconomic status, decreased consumption of a variety of foods, poor absorption in the&#xD;
      gut, and an increased demand for many of these micronutrients with advanced age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological studies and recent clinical trials have shown that use of&#xD;
      multivitamin/mineral or single nutrient supplements, such as vitamin E, have beneficial&#xD;
      effects on disease risk, but many people are hesitant to use dietary supplements due to&#xD;
      reports of ineffectiveness or potential negative effects. However, food sources of vitamin E&#xD;
      and other key vitamins and minerals continue to show health benefits. As an alternative to&#xD;
      mandating consumption of multivitamin and mineral supplements or food fortification, a&#xD;
      dietary solution is to increase consumption of nutrient-dense foods, like hazelnuts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tree nuts, including hazelnuts, contain a wide variety of vitamins and minerals, and are&#xD;
      particularly good source of vitamin E and magnesium, two &quot;shortfall nutrients&quot; that are&#xD;
      lacking in the typical American diet. Over 90% of U.S. adults do not meet recommended intake&#xD;
      levels of vitamin E, and 60% do not get enough magnesium. Tree nuts are also a good source of&#xD;
      protein and fiber and are high in healthful unsaturated fatty acids and phytochemicals such&#xD;
      as flavonoids and phytosterols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most clinical studies on the benefits of nut consumption have been conducted using almonds&#xD;
      and walnuts, with hazelnuts used less frequently. However, the health benefits of consuming&#xD;
      hazelnuts have been demonstrated in many clinical trials, including lower blood glucose&#xD;
      levels, alterations in blood lipids, and declines in biomarkers of oxidative stress. Although&#xD;
      several clinical trials have investigated nutritional impact of hazelnuts in adults, no&#xD;
      clinical trials with hazelnuts have focused on examining micronutrient status and potential&#xD;
      health benefits only in older (≥55 years) adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of body status of many micronutrients can be difficult, especially so the&#xD;
      evaluation of vitamin E levels when age is considered as a factor. Although serum&#xD;
      α-tocopherol levels are generally higher in adults above the age of 50 compared to younger&#xD;
      adults, the increased prevalence of hypercholesterolemia in older adults makes interpretation&#xD;
      of circulating α-tocopherol levels difficult. Alternatively, urinary α- and γ-carboxyethyl&#xD;
      hydroxychromanol (α- and γ-CEHC) is believed to be a biomarker of α- and γ-tocopherol status&#xD;
      that changes with vitamin E intake. In particular, low α-CEHC excretion is considered a&#xD;
      reliable marker of poor α-tocopherol status, while an increase in α-CEHC is indicative of&#xD;
      adequate α-tocopherol status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study was to determine whether daily hazelnut consumption by healthy&#xD;
      older adults for 16 weeks improves biomarkers of micronutrient status, especially vitamin E&#xD;
      and magnesium. For a detailed assessment of vitamin E status, plasma α- and γ-tocopherol&#xD;
      concentrations were determined together with urinary α- and γ-CEHC levels. In addition, a&#xD;
      commercially available lymphocyte proliferation assay was utilized to evaluate the status of&#xD;
      several other micronutrients. Since hazelnut consumption is reported to reduce blood lipids&#xD;
      and improve glucose homeostasis, these biomarkers were also monitored in our study.&#xD;
