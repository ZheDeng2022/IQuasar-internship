    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologic evidence of metastatic RCC with sarcomatoid features (≥10% sarcomatoid&#xD;
             component) or poor-risk RCC prognostic features (as defined by IMDC criteria). (14) An&#xD;
             outside pathology report is sufficient for study eligibility. However, pathology&#xD;
             should still be obtained as possible for internal institutional pathology review.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥ 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Phase I dose-escalation portion only:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have ≤3 prior systemic treatment regimens with recent evidence of disease&#xD;
        progression by RECIST 1.1 criteria. Previous treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitor&#xD;
        therapy is allowable as a line of systemic therapy for the phase I portion. Prior systemic&#xD;
        therapy in the adjuvant treatment setting is allowable as a prior line of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase Ib dose-expansion portion only:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have been treated with 0 or 1 prior lines of systemic therapy. Previous&#xD;
        treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapy is allowable as a line of systemic&#xD;
        therapy for the phase Ib expansion portion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior therapy with gemcitabine chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0-1. Patients must have primary or metastatic FFPE tissue&#xD;
             available for histologic confirmation and possible determination of percent&#xD;
             sarcomatoid component (if applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Outside pathology report is sufficient for study eligibility. However, pathology should&#xD;
        still be obtained as possible for internal institutional pathology review.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of treated brain metastases are eligible if off systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids for at least 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ function, as confirmed by laboratory values obtained ≤&#xD;
             14 days prior to the first day of study therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hematologic: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 109/L, platelet count ≥ 100 × 109/L,&#xD;
        and hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL (may have been transfused) Hepatic: Total bilirubin level ≤ 1.5 ×&#xD;
        the upper limit of normal (ULN) range and AST and ALT levels ≤ 2.5 × ULN or AST and ALT&#xD;
        levels ≤ 5 x ULN (for subjects with documented metastatic disease to the liver).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Renal: Estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 45 mL/min using Cockroft Gault formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a projected life expectancy of at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PREGNANCY AND CONTRACEPTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy test: Negative serum or urine pregnancy test at screening for women of&#xD;
        childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Contraception: Highly effective contraception for both male and female subjects throughout&#xD;
        the study and for at least 30 days after last avelumab treatment administration if the risk&#xD;
        of conception exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, women must not breastfeed while on this study as study drugs may also affect a&#xD;
        breast-feeding child. Pregnant women and women who are breastfeeding are not allowed to&#xD;
        participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  IMMUNOSUPRESSANTS: Current use of immunosuppressive medication, EXCEPT for the&#xD;
             following: a. intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injection (e.g.,&#xD;
             intra-articular injection); b. Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses ≤ 10&#xD;
             mg/day of prednisone or equivalent; c. Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity&#xD;
             reactions (e.g., CT scan premedication).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE: Active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an&#xD;
             immuno-stimulatory agent. Patients with diabetes type I, vitiligo, psoriasis, or hypo-&#xD;
             or hyperthyroid diseases not requiring immunosuppressive treatment are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION: Prior organ transplantation including allogenic stem-cell&#xD;
             transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  INFECTIONS: Active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV/AIDS: Known history of testing positive for HIV or known acquired immunodeficiency&#xD;
             syndrome, or positive HIV test result at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HEPATITIS: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection at screening&#xD;
             (positive HBV surface antigen or HCV RNA if anti-HCV antibody screening test positive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  VACCINATION: Vaccination within 4 weeks of the first dose of avelumab and while on&#xD;
             trials is prohibited except for administration of inactivated vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HYPERSENSITIIVTY TO STUDY DRUG: Known prior severe hypersensitivity to investigational&#xD;
             product or any component in its formulations, including known severe hypersensitivity&#xD;
             reactions to monoclonal antibodies (NCI CTCAE v4.03 Grade ≥ 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE: Clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease:&#xD;
             cerebral vascular accident/stroke (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment), myocardial&#xD;
             infarction (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment), unstable angina, congestive heart failure&#xD;
             (≥ New York Heart Association Classification Class II), or serious cardiac arrhythmia&#xD;
             requiring medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  OTHER PERSISTING TOXICITIES: Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy (NCI CTCAE&#xD;
             v. 4.03 Grade &gt; 1); however, alopecia, sensory neuropathy Grade ≤ 2, or other Grade ≤&#xD;
             2 not constituting a safety risk based on investigator's judgment are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including immune colitis,&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease, immune pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis or psychiatric&#xD;
             conditions including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or&#xD;
             behavior; or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study&#xD;
             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the&#xD;
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make&#xD;
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
