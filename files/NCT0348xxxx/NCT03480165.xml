  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial aims to investigate the efficacy of 20 mg Parecoxib when it is given as&#xD;
      an addition to 20 ml 0.75% ropivacaine in patients receiving ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      supraclavicular brachial plexus block prior to the upper limb surgeries. It is hypothesised&#xD;
      that the addition of parecoxib to ropivacaine will provide superior sensory and motor&#xD;
      blockades to those who only received 0.75% ropivacaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty six (n=86) patients were randomised in one-to-one ratio to either receiving 20 mg&#xD;
      parecoxib and 20 ml 0.75% ropivacaine (n=43) or 20 ml 0.75% ropivacaine and 1 ml 0.9% saline&#xD;
      (n=43). The primary efficacy outcomes of interest are a) The time to onsets of sensory and&#xD;
      motor blockades (measured in minutes); b) The time to recovery from sensory and motor&#xD;
      blockades (measured in hours). The secondary efficacy outcomes of interest are a) The&#xD;
      presence of complete sensory blockade at 30 minutes post intervention (recorded as a binary&#xD;
      yes-no categorical variable); b) The presence of complete motor blockade at 30 minutes post&#xD;
      intervention (recorded as a binary yes-no categorical variable).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brachial plexus block (BPB) has enjoyed ubiquitous popularity for upper limb surgeries.There&#xD;
      are a few common techniques for BPB and one of the most frequently-utilised one is&#xD;
      supraclavicular BPB since it provides a quick-onset, efficient, safe and dense anaesthesia&#xD;
      for surgical procedures that involve the proximal mid-humerus down to the distal hand. At&#xD;
      present, most BPB techniques have been widely performed under ultrasound guidance to enhance&#xD;
      the BPB's success rate and lessen its complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several adjunct drugs that can be mixed with local anaesthetics agents (e.g.&#xD;
      ropivacaine) to speed up the onset and prolong the duration of BPB and minimise the risk of&#xD;
      local-anaesthestic(LA)-associated overdose and toxicity. Parecoxib, a prodrug of valdecoxib,&#xD;
      is an ideal choice for such combination due to its excellent toxicity profile.It acts by&#xD;
      inhibiting the function of the constitutive COX-2, an isoform of cyclooxygenase (COX),&#xD;
      resulting in the diminution of prostaglandin H2 and E2 synthesis. Consequently, this&#xD;
      diminishes nociception by reducing sensory neuron's excitability and bradykinin-associated&#xD;
      hyperalgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, there is only one study which investigates the efficacy of parecoxib as an adjunct to&#xD;
      ropivacaine in patients requiring BPB performed via axillary approach for their upper limb&#xD;
      surgeries. However, adjunct parecoxib's efficacy in BPB performed via supraclavicular&#xD;
      approach is still not fully scrutinised. Therefore, this clinical trial endeavours to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of adjunct parecoxib in supraclavicular BPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomised two parallel groups active-controlled single centre double-blind&#xD;
      (participant and outcome assessors) clinical trial comparing the effects of parecoxib as an&#xD;
      adjunct to ropivacaine. This trial protocol received the approval from University of Science&#xD;
      Malaysia's Human Ethics Research Committee (HERC) on the 20th June 2016 and all participants&#xD;
      had provided written informed consent for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants were then block-randomized using a block size of 4 with a balanced 1:1&#xD;
      allotment ratio without any covariate stratification. The block randomization was performed&#xD;
      using permuted block design, with the random numbers generated by a random number generator&#xD;
      package in Stata 9.0. This was performed by an independent third party statistician. To&#xD;
      ensure selection bias was prevented, the allocation sequence was kept inside a&#xD;
      password-protected STATA 9.0 file which was only accessible to the independent third-party&#xD;
      statistician. The sequence of treatment allotment was only revealed after a study participant&#xD;
      was properly recruited and subsequently randomised to treatment allotment. To prevent&#xD;
      ascertainment and performance bias, the study participants and the independent assessors (2nd&#xD;
      medical officers) were shielded from the knowledge of the type of intervention received.&#xD;
      However, the intervention was administered by the primary investigator who was not blinded to&#xD;
      the kind of intervention received by a study participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To mask the participants and outcome assessors to the types of intervention received by the&#xD;
      participants, each visually indistinguishable syringe containing one of the 2 types of&#xD;
      intervention were pre-filled to 20 ml and labelled with code numbers by an independent&#xD;
      third-party pharmacist before they were sent to the operating theatre (OT) for intervention&#xD;
      administration by the principal investigator (Vivekananda Gunasekaran).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DETAILS OF INTERVENTIONS ADMINISTERED&#xD;
&#xD;
      The premedication was first prescribed in the morning of the surgery. Upon arrival at the OT,&#xD;
      all study participants underwent standard anaesthesia monitoring for relevant clinical&#xD;
      parameters (baseline blood pressure (BP), saturation pressure of oxygen (spO2),&#xD;
      electrocardiography (ECG) and heart rate (HR)) which were obtained using the electric B30&#xD;
      monitor (Stimuplex D速 plus 50mm, B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) and documented before the BPB&#xD;
      commenced. Subsequently, IV access was introduced using at least 20G IV cannula which was&#xD;
      inserted on the selected hand of study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous (IV) loading of Ringer's Lactate solution (B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) at a&#xD;
      dose of 10 ml/kg was administered before performing the block. Brachial plexus block (BPB)&#xD;
      was performed in the block corner at the recovery bay. Drugs regime and other standard&#xD;
      equipments for BPB were prepared and acquired and these include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 mls of Lignocaine 2% for skin infiltration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20 mls of Ropivacaine (Naropin速, Astrazeneca) 0.75% + 20mg Parecoxib (Dynastat速,&#xD;
           Pfizer)(1 mls) ---Group A&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20mls Ropivacaine 0.75% + 1 ml Normal Saline----Group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultra Sonographic machine (Mindray速 Version M5, Mindray, Shenzen, China) with high&#xD;
           frequency (10-15MHz) linear probe&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  50 to 80mm 22 G insulated peripheral nerve block needle. (Vygon, France)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol solution for skin cleaning&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BPB was implemented by a single operator (principal investigator, Vivekananda&#xD;
      Gunasekaran) and assessed by an independent 2nd medical officer in-charge who was blinded to&#xD;
      the treatment administered. No peripheral nerve stimulator was employed during the procedure.&#xD;
      The detailed descriptions of the techniques utilized in the BPB are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The block site will be cleaned and draped. The US probe also was draped for the&#xD;
           procedure as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SUPRCLAVICULAR BPB TECHNIQUE&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subjects were positioned semi-recumbent with the head turned to the contralateral&#xD;
                side with the ipsilateral shoulder slightly elevated with the pillow.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  An exploratory scan was performed in all patients before the block, by positioning&#xD;
                the probe on a coronal oblique plane above the clavicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hypoechoic and pulsating supraclavicular artery was then identified, which was&#xD;
                lying above the hyper echoic first rib. While maintaining the view of the artery,&#xD;
                the probe was then angled until both the first rib and the pleura were also seen&#xD;
                simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After skin preparation and draping, the probe was next placed in the&#xD;
                supraclavicular fossa and subcutaneous infiltration will be given on the targeted&#xD;
                needle side&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The needle was then inserted from lateral to medial direction in the long axis of&#xD;
                the transducer (in-plane technique).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Nineteen (19) ml of 0.75% ropivacaine and 1 ml of 20 mg of parecoxib (Group I:&#xD;
                parecoxib + ropivacaine) or 19 mls of 0.75% alone plus 1 ml of normal saline (Group&#xD;
                II: ropivacaine alone) was then injected at the &quot;corner pocket&quot;. Adrenaline was not&#xD;
                added into any solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The remaining 5 ml was later injected to a point approximately level with the&#xD;
                superior/ cephalad aspect of the subclavian artery, but no further than 1 cm&#xD;
                lateral to the artery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block performance-related pain was then evaluated immediately after removing the needle by&#xD;
      asking the patient to verbally quantify the level of pain using a score between 0 to 10 (0&#xD;
      meaning no pain, 10 meaning excruciating pain). The study participants were withdrawn from&#xD;
      the trial and rescue medications were given if one of the following withdrawal criteria&#xD;
      occurred:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient developed local anaesthetic toxicity (seizure)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient developed hemodynamically instability bradycardia/hypotension)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient developed anaphylaxis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedures for the assessment of sensory and motor block are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ASSESSMENT OF SENSORY BLOCK&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Sensory blockade was assessed every 5 minutes within the first 30 minutes following&#xD;
           the completion of drug administration. The magnitude of sensory blockade is graded as&#xD;
           follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 0 = normal sensory response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 1 = reduced sensory perception (partial sensory blockade)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 2 = no sensation (complete sensory blockade).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sensory loss was confirmed by the loss to cold sensation using 10 mls cold saline&#xD;
                bottle and pinprick sensation using 23G needle in all dermatomes of the brachial&#xD;
                plexus (Grade 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time zero was defined as the time at which LA was completely injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sensory block success was defined as complete pin-prick sensory blockade in all&#xD;
                dermatomes of the brachial plexus (C5-T1).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The block was considered incomplete if any supplemental local anesthetic is needed&#xD;
                for complete anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The block was considered failed if the desired volume did not provide complete&#xD;
                anesthesia or conversion to general anaesthesia was required prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  General anaesthesia was routinely performed with intravenous induction (sedation)&#xD;
                agent, short acting opioids and muscle relaxant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ASSESSMENT OF MOTOR BLOCK&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Motor block was assessed by subject's capability of flexing his / her elbow and hand&#xD;
           against gravity. This was then graded according to the following scale:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 1: ability to flex or extend the forearm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 2: ability to flex or extend only the wrist and fingers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 3: ability to flex or extend only the fingers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 4: inability to move the forearm, wrist, and fingers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  INTRA-SURGICAL ASSESSMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Requirement of block supplementation, surgical wound infiltration and patient&#xD;
                requested sedation or general anaesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Surgical anaesthesia success was defined as surgery without the requirements of&#xD;
                block supplementation, general anesthesia (administered for incomplete block) or&#xD;
                surgical site infiltration&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Haemodynamic monitoring was performed at baseline, after LA injection, after 15&#xD;
                min, 30 min, 1 hour of block procedure &amp; after completing surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  POSTOPERATIVE ASSESSMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sensory and motor blockade durations were assessed on half-hourly basis (up to 12&#xD;
                hours postoperatively), during the post surgical period.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) morphine or IV tramadol was given as rescue&#xD;
                analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pain scores were assessed using the visual rating scale (VRS) (0-10) where pain was&#xD;
                evaluated when the patients were resting at 1, 2, 4, 12, 24 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The duration of analgesia (time interval from the completion of local anesthetic&#xD;
                administration until the first need of rescue analgesia in the form of PCA morphine&#xD;
                or IV tramadol) and the amount of morphine or tramadol consumed during the&#xD;
                postoperative 24 hours were also documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Any evidence of complications (e.g., bruises/swelling at the block site, chest&#xD;
                pain/ breathing difficulty, dysaesthesia/ muscle weakness in the operated extremity&#xD;
                not related to the site of operation) were also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Surgeons were alerted to report any neurological problems not related to surgery&#xD;
                during the clinical rounds prior to the patients were discharged from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Anaesthetic preferences (one of the following: 1) the BPB; 2) block under deep&#xD;
                sedation; 3) block under GA).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Preferred block for future hand operations was then recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated using power analysis method. The level of significance was&#xD;
      fixed at 0.05, power (1 - type 2 error) at 0.80 and a dropout rate of 20%. Based on the&#xD;
      standard deviation of 140 minutes and a hypothesised mean difference in total duration of&#xD;
      sensory block of 104 minutes, the total sample size is 39 subjects per intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science for Windows version 23&#xD;
      (SPSS 23) and Stata version 11. Missing data were treated as Missing at Random (MAR) under&#xD;
      Rubin's missing data mechanism. Multiple imputation was then used to address the missing data&#xD;
      problem. The data were descriptively summarised using mean and standard deviations (or&#xD;
      interquartile range) for continuous outcomes or frequency and percentage for categorical&#xD;
      variables. Multiple imputation was then used to address the missing data. The mean&#xD;
      differences in continuous outcome variables (onset and duration of sensory and motor&#xD;
      blockades) between the intervention arms were analysed using independent t-test or&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test. For categorical outcome variables (complete motor and sensory blockades at&#xD;
      30 minutes per intervention), Chi-square or Fisher exact tests were utilised. The assumptions&#xD;
      of normality and homogeneity of variances were checked using histogram with overlying normal&#xD;
      plots, box plots, Mann-Whitney (normality) and Levene's tests (homoscedasticity of&#xD;
      residuals).&#xD;
