      In a cohort of symptomatic patients referred to coronary computed tomography angiography&#xD;
      (CCTA), the investigators aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate and compare the diagnostic precision of Rubidium Positron Emission&#xD;
           Tomography (Rb PET) and 3 Tesla Cardiac Magnetic Resonance imaging (3T CMRI) in patients&#xD;
           where CCTA does not exclude significant coronary artery disease (CAD) using invasive&#xD;
           coronary angiography with fractional flow reserve (ICA-FFR) as reference standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the diagnostic precision of quantitative flow ratio (QFR) and ICA-FFR in&#xD;
           patients where CCTA does not exclude significant CAD using Rb PET and 3T CMRI as&#xD;
           reference standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To show superiority for the CADScor®System compared to the Diamond-Forrester score in&#xD;
           detection of CAD with CCTA and ICA quantitative coronary angiography (ICA-QCA) as&#xD;
           reference standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To study the diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR)&#xD;
           in patients where CCTA does not exclude significant CAD with ICA-FFR as reference&#xD;
           standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To identify and characterize genetic risk variants´ and circulating biomarkers´&#xD;
           importance in developing CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate the bone mineral density in the hip and spine and correlate this to the&#xD;
           degree of vascular calcification.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CCTA has become the preferred diagnostic modality for symptomatic patients with low to&#xD;
      intermediate risk of CAD. Of the patients examined, CCTA exclude cardiovascular disease in&#xD;
      70-80% with an excellent negative predictive value of more than 95%. Having a low positive&#xD;
      predictive value, however, CCTA often overestimates the severity of CAD, especially in&#xD;
      patients with moderate to severe coronary calcification. Following CCTA, patients are hence&#xD;
      unnecessarily tested using golden standard ICA-FFR. These ICAs often show no obstructive&#xD;
      coronary stenosis and are therefore not followed by revascularization. The issues outlined&#xD;
      raises the question of whether it is possible (1) to make a more precise risk stratification&#xD;
      and consequently better selection of patients prior to CCTA and (2) to reduce the number of&#xD;
      patients referred for unnecessary ICAs following CCTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with suspicion of coronary stenosis detected by CCTA, current guidelines&#xD;
      recommend verification of myocardial ischemia. In Dan-NICAD 2, we intend to investigate the&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy of advanced non-invasive myocardial perfusion imaging tests; Rb PET and&#xD;
      3T CMRI. These examinations have shown a high diagnostic accuracy in symptomatic patients&#xD;
      with high risk of ischemic heart disease. However, the diagnostic accuracy is not&#xD;
      investigated in patients as follow-up after CCTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative way to increase the diagnostic accuracy of CCTA and thus avoid unnecessary&#xD;
      downstream testing using ICA is to utilize the ability to extract physiological information&#xD;
      from the anatomical CCTA images. CT-FFR has in previous studies shown promising results.&#xD;
      CT-FFR has not been head to head compared against Rb PET and 3T CMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtained during ICA, QFR is a novel wire-free approach for fast computation of FFR with&#xD;
      potential to increase the global use of physiological lesion assessment. QFR is superior to&#xD;
      traditional assessment of intermediate coronary lesions (ICA-QCA diameter stenosis). However,&#xD;
      disagreement between FFR and QFR has been identified in up to 20% of all measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acoustic detections of coronary stenosis from automatically recorded and analyzed heart&#xD;
      sounds is a newly developed technology potentially useful for pre-test risk stratification&#xD;
      before e.g. CCTA. One of these devices, the CADScor®System, has previously shown an area&#xD;
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC of ROC) of 70-80% compared to&#xD;
      conventional ICA-QCA. This indicates that the CADScor®System could potentially supplement&#xD;
      clinical assessment of CAD and be used for risk stratification prior to CCTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to obtain blood samples for biobank purposes and record heart sounds&#xD;
      with the CADScor®System in 2000 patients that by clinical evaluation undergo CCTA. In&#xD;
      approximately 400 patients (20%), CCTA does not exclude significant CAD. These patients are&#xD;
      all examined using Rb PET, 3T CMRI, and ICA with QCA. In patients with a coronary diameter&#xD;
      stenosis of 30-90% determined during the ICA examination, FFR, coronary flow reserve (CFR)&#xD;
      and QFR is performed.&#xD;
