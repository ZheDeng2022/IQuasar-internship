      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children s weight has increased sharply in recent years. This may put them at higher risk for&#xD;
      health problems. High blood glucose in a pregnant mother and too much weight gain during&#xD;
      pregnancy also may have long-term effects on the child s health. Children who become&#xD;
      overweight or obese during childhood tend to remain so as adults. Researchers want to study&#xD;
      many risk factors during and after pregnancy, and how these affect a child s development.&#xD;
      They will also follow the mother s health and well-being after pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn how a pregnant mother s environment, lifestyle, and health conditions may affect her&#xD;
      child s growth and development from birth until adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) or Hispanic adult pregnant women and their offspring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers will have 3 visits during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the child s first year, mothers will have 2 visits and their child will have 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will have 2 visits in their second year and 1 each year until they turn 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers will have a visit 2 years after birth and 4-5 years later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the mother and child s medical records will be reviewed. They will have physical exams&#xD;
      and give blood and stool samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers may give cord blood and placenta samples. They will give breastmilk and urine&#xD;
      samples. They will fill out questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children s hair and toenail clippings (and baby teeth that fall out, if possible) will be&#xD;
      collected. They will have an ultrasound. They may get an activity monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mother and child will be followed until the child s 18th birthday.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 50% of Pima Indian children from diabetic pregnancies develop T2DM by age 25.&#xD;
      Since intrauterine exposure to diabetes leads to a higher risk of diabetes in the offspring,&#xD;
      the risk might be greatly diminished by preventing diabetes during pregnancy or ameliorating&#xD;
      its effects. Standard prenatal and obstetrical care has not been able to abolish this excess&#xD;
      risk in the Pima Indians, which has remained unchanged from the 1940 s to the early 1990's.2&#xD;
      The risk of intrauterine exposures to diabetes in the mother and obesity has been shown to be&#xD;
      strongly associated with youth onset type 2 diabetes in other populations including&#xD;
      Hispanics. 3 The current project will establish a longitudinal cohort of mother/infant/child&#xD;
      dyads among American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) and Hispanic ethnic groups, to study the&#xD;
      role of a combination of biological and environmental factors on infant/childhood obesity and&#xD;
      cardio metabolic risk.&#xD;
