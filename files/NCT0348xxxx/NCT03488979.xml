  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a common, costly, and disabling condition characterized by recurrent&#xD;
      exacerbations. Episodes of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) account for the largest&#xD;
      proportion of admissions and 30-day readmissions to US hospitals. Medication nonadherence and&#xD;
      dietary/fluid nonadherence have been associated with re-admissions. Hand-carried ultrasound&#xD;
      (HCU) devices are portable, relatively inexpensive, and can augment the physical exam in the&#xD;
      assessment of volume status. Dilated Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) with poor collapsibility&#xD;
      correlates with elevated central venous pressure, which may be correlated with earlier&#xD;
      readmission for ADHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design to measure maximum IVC diameter (IVC max) in mm and the degree of IVC&#xD;
      collapsibility with inspiration on qualitative assessment in approximately 100 patients&#xD;
      admitted with ADHF. The co-investigator will share the IVC images and interpretation with&#xD;
      educational intervention group patients in real time; IVC images and interpretation will not&#xD;
      be shared with control group patients. Study team will assess whether sharing these IVC&#xD;
      measurements correlates with greater adherence to heart failure self-management after&#xD;
      discharge, as measured by the administration of the Medical Outcomes Study Specific Adherence&#xD;
      Scale, modified to a 3-item version relevant for patients with heart failure (MOSSAS-3HF) at&#xD;
      4 weeks after discharge. Study team will also assess for any difference in 30-day readmission&#xD;
      rates for intervention vs. control group patients.&#xD;

      The following list indicates the sequence and timing of our study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inpatients will be screened for study eligibility by one of the co-investigators via&#xD;
           review of the electronic medical record (EMR) for administration of intravenous (IV)&#xD;
           diuretics and documentation of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) as the&#xD;
           indication for diuresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible patients will be invited to participate by a research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All consenting patients' demographic data will be recorded. A Study Identification&#xD;
           Number will be assigned and personal identifiers will be logged in a &quot;key&quot; separate from&#xD;
           the dataset. The number of subjects who are approached but decline enrollment will be&#xD;
           documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline adherence to heart failure self-management regimen will be assessed by&#xD;
           administration of the Medical Outcomes Study Specific Adherence Scale, a 3-item&#xD;
           questionnaire for patients with heart failure (MOSSAS-3HF). The 3 questions in the&#xD;
           MOSSAS-3HF ask patients to rate how often in the past 4 weeks they adhered to their&#xD;
           medication regimen, low-salt diet, and daily weight measurement. Answer choices for each&#xD;
           of the 3 items range from 0 (none of the time) to 5 (all of the time), so a maximum&#xD;
           total score would be 15, for adherence &quot;all of the time&quot; to each of the 3 items.&#xD;
           Baseline health beliefs regarding benefits of treatments for heart failure and&#xD;
           self-efficacy will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who consent will be randomized into attention control group or educational&#xD;
           intervention group using sealed envelopes (randomization generated in sets of 6 for a&#xD;
           total of one hundred participants by using Research Randomizer).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will undergo a limited bedside HCU examination of the inferior vena&#xD;
           cava.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A patient education tool and the patient's own IVC images will be shared with each&#xD;
           patient in the intervention group in real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All images will be acquired by an experienced registered board certified&#xD;
           ultrasonographer between 36 and 60 hours after admission using an HCU device by&#xD;
           SonositeÂ®.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each HCU examination is estimated to last 3-10 minutes. All IVC studies will be&#xD;
           performed with the patient in the supine position using the HCU machine (Sonosite Inc.,&#xD;
           Washington). Ultrasound probe will be at subxyphoid placement. Measurements will be&#xD;
           taken using 2-D images at approximately 2 cm from the IVC/right atrium juncture, taking&#xD;
           care to avoid any hepatic veins emptying into the IVC at the approximation of IVC/ right&#xD;
           atrium interface. The IVC normally collapses with inspiration and expands with&#xD;
           expiration. For this reason, patients may be asked to &quot;sniff&quot; to measure IVC&#xD;
           collapsibility with inspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For patients under isolation precautions, standard hospital disinfectant procedures as&#xD;
           recommended by the manufacturer and as followed by echocardiography department will be&#xD;
           followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ultrasonographer will calculate and document the patient's IVC max and qualitative&#xD;
           Inferior Vena Cava Collapsibility Index (IVCCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two weeks after discharge, a follow up phone call will be made to the all participants.&#xD;
           The scripted phone call for intervention patients will reinforce heart failure&#xD;
           self-management education from the Patient Education Tool. The scripted phone call for&#xD;
           control patients will only ask neutral questions about progress since hospital discharge&#xD;
           and whether the patient remembers getting an ultrasound in the hospital as part of the&#xD;
           research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A phone call will be made and a letter will be mailed to the participants approximately&#xD;
           3 weeks after the study enrollment date to serve as a reminder for the final 30-day&#xD;
           phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A research assistant will contact all enrolled patients by telephone 4 weeks after&#xD;
           discharge to administer MOSSAS-3HF and to ask whether the patient required hospital&#xD;
           admission or emergency department care since the original hospital discharge where&#xD;
           patient was enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of electronic medical records will be used to determine length of stay and&#xD;
           whether patients were readmitted to Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center or Johns&#xD;
           Hopkins Hospital within 30 days; for those patients not readmitted within 30 days, an&#xD;
           attempt will be made to determine whether the patient has been readmitted to another&#xD;
           hospital or sought care at another Emergency Department during the follow up telephone&#xD;
           call.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All HCU examinations will be recorded and available for review by a board-certified&#xD;
           cardiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If an enrolled patient requests termination of the HCU examination at any time, it will&#xD;
           stop immediately.&#xD;
