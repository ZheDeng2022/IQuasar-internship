  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ten patients with motor neurone disease (MND, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or&#xD;
      ALS) will be successively enrolled to one of two dose levels of IC14 (human chimeric&#xD;
      monoclonal anti-CD14) intravenously for four doses. Patients must be within 3 years of MND&#xD;
      diagnosis and have adequate respiratory function. Safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and&#xD;
      PK/PD will be measured. To evaluate feasibility of the endpoints, additional endpoints of&#xD;
      ALSFRS-R, respiratory function tests, disease biomarkers and patient-reported outcomes will&#xD;
      be measured.&#xD;

      The objectives of this study are to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of IC14 in patients with motor neurone&#xD;
           disease (MND).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of IC14 in patients with MND.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The preliminary effect of IC14 on the Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional&#xD;
           Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) in patients with MND.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The preliminary effect of IC14 on forced vital capacity (FVC) and other clinical markers&#xD;
           of disease severity in patients with MND.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The preliminary effect of IC14 on patient-reported outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The preliminary effect of IC14 on disease biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten patients with MND will be sequentially assigned to receive one of two dose regimens of&#xD;
      IC14 in an unblinded manner:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the initial 3 patients: IC14 at a dosage of 2 mg/kg on Study Day 1, then 1 mg/kg&#xD;
           once daily on Study Days 3-5 for 4 total doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the subsequent 7 patients: IC14 at a dosage of 4 mg/kg on Study Day 1, then 2 mg/kg&#xD;
           once daily on Study Days 2-4 for 4 total doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation will continue until 28 days after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
