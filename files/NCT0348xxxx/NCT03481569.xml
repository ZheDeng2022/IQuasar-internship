  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nosocomial Central Nervous System infections are difficult to treat and an early appropriate&#xD;
      therapy can improve prognosis. The two main reasons for treatments failure are the difficulty&#xD;
      to reach high concentrations of antibiotics (ATB) in CNS because of brain barriers (BB), and&#xD;
      the emergence of Multi-Drug-Resistant (MDR) pathogens that require high ATB concentrations&#xD;
      for being killed. Therefore a better knowledge of ATB CNS distribution and PK-PD&#xD;
      characteristics is essential for efficiency of treatments and to avoid resistance&#xD;
      progression. Because of BB and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) turnover, unbound (active)&#xD;
      concentrations of ATB in CSF are frequently much lower than corresponding plasma&#xD;
      concentrations, which therefore may not be used to predict efficacy. However except for&#xD;
      patients with EVD, CSF access is difficult. Overall the litterature about ATB distribution&#xD;
      within CSF exist but PK-PD publications are rarer. Especially for Broad Spectrum ATB which&#xD;
      are recommended in case of invasive infection in ICU patients due to MDR pathogens such as&#xD;
      Acinetobacter baumanii, extended spectrum ß-Lactamase producing (ESBL) pathogens or&#xD;
      Multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, measuring ATB concentrations within the CSF at certain time-points is necessary&#xD;
      but not sufficient to predict antimicrobial efficacy. First PK modelling is required to&#xD;
      describe the full CSF concentrations versus time profiles. Then targets must be obtained from&#xD;
      literature or determined for the relevant PD index, which may be, depending of the&#xD;
      antibiotic, Time over Minimal Inhibitrice Concentration (T&gt;MIC), Area Under the Curve over&#xD;
      MIC (AUC/MIC) or peak concentration over MIC (Cmax/MIC). Eventually Monte-Carlo simulations&#xD;
      can be conducted to predict the probability of target attainment according to various dosing&#xD;
      regimens to find the optimal one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this multicenter population PK-PD study is to characterize CSF distribution and&#xD;
      challenge recommended dosing regimens of 8 ATB indicated in CNS infections (vancomycin,&#xD;
      daptomycin, ceftazidime, meropenem, colistin, linezolid, piperacillin-tazobactam and&#xD;
      ceftaroline) and to study the Cefepime diffusion in the CSF, known to be highly neurotoxic.&#xD;
