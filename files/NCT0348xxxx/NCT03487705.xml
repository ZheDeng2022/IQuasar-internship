  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Essential tremor (TE) is the most common abnormal movement of the adult. His diagnosis is&#xD;
      based on a bundle of clinical arguments (Movement Disorders Society, 1998). Well&#xD;
      characterized in the adult, little data is available concerning child. The objective of this&#xD;
      work is (1) to define the demographic and clinical characteristics of the TE of children and&#xD;
      adolescents, (2) to determine the electrophysiological characteristics in the child, (3)&#xD;
      evaluate the functional impact of TE, and assess the functional impact of TE, and assess the&#xD;
      current management modalities of TE in children and adolescent.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multicenter, descriptive cross-sectional study will include children and adolescents whose&#xD;
      diagnosis of TE has been retained by an abnormal movement specialist before the age of 18&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each child will benefit from an examination and a neurological and general clinical&#xD;
      examination, a functional questionnaire, an electromyogram with accelerometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be determined: demographic characteristics (age, sex and ethnicity), family history of&#xD;
      essential tremor, age of onset of tremor, tremor characteristics (location, occurrence&#xD;
      conditions, aggravating or precipitating factors, scalability); additional examinations&#xD;
      carried out and the treatments proposed or taken by the child as well as the functional&#xD;
      repercussions of TE in the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with tremor who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be selected&#xD;
      retrospectively or prospectively from the active queue of patients at each center.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject whose age is between 3 and 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject affiliated to a social security scheme&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parents or subjects who have been informed of the course and consequences of the study&#xD;
             by an investigator and who have signed the informed consent form for prospective&#xD;
             inclusion or who have given their non-opposition for retrospective inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of essential tremor established according to the diagnostic criteria of the&#xD;
             Movement Disorders Society (1998), by a neuropediatrician or a neurologist, specialist&#xD;
             in abnormal movements. The diagnosis is based on the presence of the following&#xD;
             criteria: bilateral action tremor of the hands and forearms, absence of other&#xD;
             neurological signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of an electromyogram for retrospective inclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal neurological examination outside tremor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Family history or personal dysthyroidism&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Existence of a global psychomotor or motor developmental delay&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taking medication that may induce tremor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  known poisoning by heavy metals, bismuth, mercury, methyl bromide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe appearance of the tremor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tremor suggestive of a psychogenic origin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal or non-existent brain MRI if family case&#xD;
