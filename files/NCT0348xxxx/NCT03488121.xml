  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Choosing Wisely Canada is a campaign for promoting appropriate use of medical services to&#xD;
      reduce unnecessary prescribing and unnecessary diagnostic tests. Its success depends on&#xD;
      physicians' uptake of the campaign's recommendations on appropriate use of health care. This&#xD;
      study will conduct a cluster-randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of two&#xD;
      low-cost incentives for physicians to promote their uptake of Choosing Wisely recommendations&#xD;
      in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL). The first incentive involves placing a motivational poster&#xD;
      in a physician's examination room. These posters will contain motivational messages about the&#xD;
      important roles that doctors and patients can play in reducing unnecessary care. The second&#xD;
      incentive involves sending thank-you letters to physicians to recognize their contribution in&#xD;
      reducing unnecessary care, and thus, 'nudge' them into following recommendations. The study&#xD;
      will evaluate the effects of the incentives on physicians' prescribing of antibiotics and&#xD;
      serum ferritin tests. Potential cost savings of implementing the two incentives will also be&#xD;
      estimated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will employ a prospective, cluster randomized controlled trial design and will&#xD;
      involve fee-for-service family physicians in NL. Randomization will be performed at the&#xD;
      clinic level and stratified by clinic size. Clinics will be randomized into one of four&#xD;
      groups: i) the control group will not receive any incentive; ii) the poster group will&#xD;
      receive posters only; iii) the letter group will receive thank-you letters only; and iv) the&#xD;
      double incentive group will receive both posters and thank-you letters. The number of clinics&#xD;
      in each group will be equal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will test two interventions. First, it will examine the impact of placing a poster&#xD;
      in a physician's examination room containing motivational messages about the important roles&#xD;
      that doctors and patients can play in reducing unnecessary care. The second incentive will&#xD;
      involve sending thank-you letters to physicians aiming to encourage them to following&#xD;
      Choosing Wisely's recommendations by recognizing their contribution in reducing unnecessary&#xD;
      care. The study will focus on physicians' prescribing of antibiotics and serum ferritin&#xD;
      tests. The posters will be designed to contain inspirational messages and pictures that&#xD;
      highlight the important and unique roles that physicians and patients play in reducing&#xD;
      unnecessary care and health care costs. These will be displayed in physicians' examination&#xD;
      rooms so that they are salient to doctors and patients. The thank-you letters will contain&#xD;
      two types of information: the changes in the rates of antibiotics and serum ferritin tests&#xD;
      ordered since Choosing Wisely NL's introduction and a thank you message from the NL Medical&#xD;
      Association (NLMA). These will be sent to doctors quarterly (to reinforce the message) with&#xD;
      the changes in the rates of antibiotics and serum ferritin tests ordered being updated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These incentives will be delivered over a 12-month period. The researchers will measure&#xD;
      changes in the study outcomes at the end of this 12-month intervention period. Further, to&#xD;
      examine if the effects of the intervention are sustained, these changes will be evaluated&#xD;
      again 6 months after the withdrawal of incentives. The two incentives will be delivered via&#xD;
      NLMA to its member family physicians. As such, physicians will be blinded to this study&#xD;
      (i.e., they would not know that these posters and letters are part of a study). The study&#xD;
      will focus on fee-for-service physicians in NL as data on the number of patients are only&#xD;
      available for these physicians.&#xD;
