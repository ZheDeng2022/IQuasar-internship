  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first administration of GSK3858279 in humans and will be conducted in two&#xD;
      parts: Part A will consist of a single ascending dose escalation design to evaluate safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, PK, TE and immunogenicity of either a single intravenous (IV) or a single&#xD;
      subcutaneous (SC) dose. Approximately 48 healthy participants will be enrolled in 6 cohorts&#xD;
      and randomized to 3:1 ratio (GSK3858279 or placebo). Part B will evaluate safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, efficacy (pain), PK, TE and immunogenicity after repeat SC dosing.&#xD;
      Approximately 50 OA participants will be randomized in a parallel group design to receive&#xD;
      either GSK3858279 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Volunteers who are overtly healthy as determined by medical evaluation including&#xD;
             medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and cardiac monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight within the range 50 to 100 kilogram (kg) and body mass index (BMI) within&#xD;
             the range 18 to 32 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2) (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following for at&#xD;
             least 28 weeks after the dose of study intervention: Refrain from donating sperm PLUS&#xD;
             either be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual&#xD;
             lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain&#xD;
             abstinent OR must agree to use contraception/barrier as detailed below: agree to use a&#xD;
             male condom and should also be advised of the benefit for a female partner to use a&#xD;
             highly effective method of contraception as a condom may break or leak when having&#xD;

        For Part B:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age between 40 and 75 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  OA of the index knee as defined by symptomatic for &gt;=6 months with a clinical&#xD;
             diagnosis of OA as per American College of Rheumatology (ACR) clinical diagnosis&#xD;
