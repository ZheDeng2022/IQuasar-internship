  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limb loss is frequently associated with postamputation pain that can be challenging to treat&#xD;
      and often involves opioids. Advances in the field of neuromodulation has led to development&#xD;
      of an intentionally reversible percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) system that&#xD;
      has had promising results when treating chronic postamputation pain. PNS may offer sustained&#xD;
      pain relief even after the treatment period has ended. Currently, there is no convincing&#xD;
      evidence regarding the role of PNS in the acute postoperative period, which may be a critical&#xD;
      time to control pain as those with higher pain appear to be at higher risk for developing&#xD;
      persistent post-procedural pain. The investigators of this study aim to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility and effects of PNS in the acute postoperative period and determine the&#xD;
      feasibility of completing a randomized controlled treatment outcome study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      16 patients with new nontraumatic transfemoral or transtibial amputation will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having met inclusion criteria, the patients will be randomized to experimental or control&#xD;
      groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the experimental group undergo placement of PNS leads within 7 days of amputation&#xD;
      surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups will be treated with standard pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic pain&#xD;
      therapies and evaluated weekly for 8 weeks, then at 3, 6, and 12 months postamputation&#xD;

    <description>Self-report measure PGIC reflects a patient's belief about the efficacy of treatment. PGIC is a 7 point scale depicting a patient's rating of overall improvement. Patients rate their change as&#xD;
1 = &quot;very much improved,&quot; 2 = &quot;much improved,&quot; 3 = &quot;minimally improved,&quot; 4 = &quot;no change,&quot; 5 = &quot;minimally worse,&quot; 6 = &quot;much worse,&quot; or 7 = &quot;very much worse.&quot; A lower score is better.</description>

    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Pain catastrophizing is the tendency to magnify the threat value of a pain stimulus and to feel helpless in the presence of pain. This is further characterized by the inability to prevent or inhibit pain-related thoughts surrounding a painful event. Pain catastrophizing affects how individuals experience pain. The PCS is a 13-item inventory of statements in which the subject is asked to rate the degree to which they agree, on a scale of &quot;0&quot; = not at all to &quot;4&quot; = all the time. The responses for each item are added for a total PCS score (range 0-52). A lower score is better.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Disability Index (PDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4, Week 8, and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PDI is designed to measure the degree to which aspects of life are disrupted by chronic pain. The impact of pain on various aspects of life (e.g. family/home responsibilities, recreation, social activity, occupation, sexual behavior, self-care, and life-support activities) are recorded on a 10-point scale from &quot;0&quot; = no disability to &quot;10&quot; = worst disability. The sum of scores is recorded for a total PDI score (range 0-70). A lower score is better.</description>

        <description>Using the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) questionnaire, subjects were asked to rate their RLP over the past 24 hours on a scale of &quot;0&quot;=no pain to &quot;10&quot;=worst pain they have ever experienced. A lower score is better. Data from Weeks 1-4 and Weeks 5-8 were averaged to obtain a numerical score for these time points.</description>

          <title>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)</title>
          <description>Self-report measure PGIC reflects a patient's belief about the efficacy of treatment. PGIC is a 7 point scale depicting a patient's rating of overall improvement. Patients rate their change as&#xD;
1 = &quot;very much improved,&quot; 2 = &quot;much improved,&quot; 3 = &quot;minimally improved,&quot; 4 = &quot;no change,&quot; 5 = &quot;minimally worse,&quot; 6 = &quot;much worse,&quot; or 7 = &quot;very much worse.&quot; A lower score is better.</description>

        <title>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</title>
        <description>Pain catastrophizing is the tendency to magnify the threat value of a pain stimulus and to feel helpless in the presence of pain. This is further characterized by the inability to prevent or inhibit pain-related thoughts surrounding a painful event. Pain catastrophizing affects how individuals experience pain. The PCS is a 13-item inventory of statements in which the subject is asked to rate the degree to which they agree, on a scale of &quot;0&quot; = not at all to &quot;4&quot; = all the time. The responses for each item are added for a total PCS score (range 0-52). A lower score is better.</description>

        <title>Pain Disability Index (PDI)</title>
        <description>The PDI is designed to measure the degree to which aspects of life are disrupted by chronic pain. The impact of pain on various aspects of life (e.g. family/home responsibilities, recreation, social activity, occupation, sexual behavior, self-care, and life-support activities) are recorded on a 10-point scale from &quot;0&quot; = no disability to &quot;10&quot; = worst disability. The sum of scores is recorded for a total PDI score (range 0-70). A lower score is better.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Several participants underwent unanticipated amputation revisions, which has the potential to contribute to worsening pain and the need for increased opioids, which may significantly confound results. Subjects were instructed to use the device continuously, and the effects of PNS therapy may be impacted by the number of hours the device was utilized by the patient. Variations in subject compliance with device usage may impact outcomes.</limitations_and_caveats>
