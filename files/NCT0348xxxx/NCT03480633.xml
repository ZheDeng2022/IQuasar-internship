  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this single-center, longitudinal observational study, we will comprehensively examine&#xD;
      clinical characteristics, proteomic, metabolomic, genomic and imaging data to better&#xD;
      understand how different heart failure types may develop and progress over time. We will&#xD;
      evaluate distinct sub-groups of heart failure (also known as heart failure phenotypes) with&#xD;
      an ultimate goal of bringing the right medications and therapy to the right patients to&#xD;
      optimize benefit and minimized side effects, an effort to improve precision medicine in heart&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;

      Patients 18-years and older with and without heart failure (across all left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction) will be enrolled in this single center, longitudinal observational&#xD;
      Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and one-year follow up blood samples including DNA as well as clinical&#xD;
      characteristics, events leading up to heart failure diagnosis, etiology of heart failure, the&#xD;
      presence and duration of other medical problems, laboratory, echocardiographic data and&#xD;
      images, and therapy information will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes of interest include major adverse cardiovascular events (a combination of&#xD;
      all-cause death and heart failure hospitalizations), individual endpoints of all-cause death,&#xD;
      cardiovascular death, all-cause hospitalization, cardiovascular hospitalization, heart&#xD;
      failure hospitalization, right-sided heart failure, and kidney injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from the Preserved vs. Reduced Ejection Fraction Biomarker Registry and Precision&#xD;
      Medicine Database for Ambulatory Heart Failure Patients (PREFER-HF) trial will&#xD;
      comprehensively examine longitudinal clinical characteristics, proteomic, metabolomic,&#xD;
      genomic and imaging data to better understand pathophysiology of heart failure and phenotypes&#xD;
      in heart failure with an ultimate goal of improving precision medicine in heart failure.&#xD;

      Blood samples will be collected at baseline as well as at 1 year follow up. At both time&#xD;
      points, a total blood volume of up to 50 mL will be collected using EDTA and serum tubes,&#xD;
      while patients are seated. Samples will be spun at 1800 rpm and plasma aliquoted. Samples&#xD;
      will be frozen immediately at -80 C. For patients who opt to participate in the genetic&#xD;
      portion of this study, buffy coat aliquoting and processing will be executed using the same&#xD;
      blood samples.&#xD;
