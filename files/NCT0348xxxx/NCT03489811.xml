  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of essential oils on anxiety scores among children who have&#xD;
      an autism spectrum disorder. One third of the children will receive a control blend of oils,&#xD;
      one third of the children will receive a test blend of oils, and the other third will receive&#xD;
      a second test blend of oils.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Essential oils have been found in studies to reduce both stress and anxiety as measured by an&#xD;
      anxiety inventory, but studies have not tested these effects among children who have an&#xD;
      autism spectrum disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The essential oils used in this study are administered each morning for a total period of&#xD;
      four weeks, with an optional second exposure on an as-needed basis during the final two of&#xD;
      the four weeks of the study. The oils are administered during this time to evaluate both the&#xD;
      preventive effects and the treatment effects of the essential oils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety is measured on an anxiety inventory, which is completed by the parent of the&#xD;
      participant at the end of each week during the study. Parents complete this data online,&#xD;
      allowing them to participate from anywhere in the U.S.&#xD;

    <time_frame>baseline and day 35</time_frame>
    <description>The Spence Children's Anxiety Scale collects parent-reported signs and symptoms of anxiety at baseline and again at the end of each week of the intervention. Each item is scored as (0) never, (1) sometimes (2) often, or (3)always. The total score ranges from 0-114, with higher scores indicating higher levels of anxiety.</description>
