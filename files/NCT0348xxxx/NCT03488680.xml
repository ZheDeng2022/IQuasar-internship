  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Child under nutrition is a major risk factor for ill health and mortality, contributes&#xD;
      substantially to the burden of disease in low-income and middle-income countries and is&#xD;
      associated with close to half of all child deaths. The prevalence of both underweight and&#xD;
      stunting is highest in Africa and South-Central Asia. Ethiopia is one of the poorest&#xD;
      countries in Sub- Saharan Africa, and child malnutrition is a serious public health problem&#xD;
      where the rates for stunting (40%), underweight (25%) and wasting (9%) among children under 5&#xD;
      years are among the highest in the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Globally, about 40% of child mortality less than two years is associated with inappropriate&#xD;
      feeding practices. Optimal breastfeeding and appropriate complementary feeding could prevent&#xD;
      13% and 6% under-five mortality, respectively. Over two third of malnutrition is associated&#xD;
      with inappropriate feeding practices during the first year of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first two years of life provides a critical window of opportunity for ensuring&#xD;
      appropriate growth and development of children from generation to generation through optimal&#xD;
      feeding. Hence, the objective of this study to evaluate the effectiveness of behavior change&#xD;
      communication on optimal complementary feeding through community level actors in improving&#xD;
      feeding practice, health and nutritional status of infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cluster-randomized controlled trial which was conducted in West Gojjam Zone, Northwest&#xD;
      Ethiopia from May 9, 2016 to October, 2017. Behavior change communication on complementary&#xD;
      feeding was conducted in the intervention kebeles/villages for 8 months. A validated&#xD;
      interviewer administered structured questionnaire was used for collecting information on the&#xD;
      study subjects both at the baseline and after intervention. Data will be checked, coded and&#xD;
      double entered using EPI info and exported to SPSS version 21 for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The output of the study findings could be useful for health and nutrition policy makers and&#xD;
      other concerned bodies in decision making and to design effective intervention strategies to&#xD;
      improve feeding practices thus mitigating child malnutrition and improving their health and&#xD;
      growth. The total budget needed to conduct the study is 7,000 US dollar.&#xD;

      Globally, about 40% of death children less than two years is associated with inappropriate&#xD;
      feeding practices. Optimal breastfeeding and appropriate complementary feeding could prevent&#xD;
      13% and 6% under-five mortality, respectively. Over two third of malnutrition is associated&#xD;
      with inappropriate feeding practices during the first year of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every day, 3000-4000 infants die in the developing world from diarrhea and acute respiratory&#xD;
      infections because they are given inadequate amounts of breast milk. More than 10 million&#xD;
      children die each year in sub- Saharan Africa and South Asia. A major contributor to their&#xD;
      deaths is poor breastfeeding practice. The risk of death from diarrhea of partially breastfed&#xD;
      infants 0 - 6 months of age was 8.6 times the risk for exclusively breastfed children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infant and young feeding practices for infant and young children worldwide are not optimal.&#xD;
      It is only 34.8% of infants are exclusively breastfed worldwide. Complementary foods are&#xD;
      often introduced too early or too late and are often nutritionally inadequate or unsafe. Only&#xD;
      about 39% of infants in the developing countries, 25% in Africa are exclusively breastfed for&#xD;
      the first six months and 6% of infants in developing countries are never breastfed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A wide range of harmful infant and young child feeding practices were documented in Ethiopia.&#xD;
      According to EDHS of 2011, 52% of infants started breastfeeding within one hour of birth and&#xD;
      exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months with the 4.2 months mean duration of&#xD;
      exclusive breastfeeding. About half (49%) of children aged 6-8 months consumed solid,&#xD;
      semi-solid, or soft foods and 5% of children were fed minimum dietary diversity and 4% of&#xD;
      children fed minimum meal frequency per day while 96% of children continued breastfeeding at&#xD;
      one year, and 82% continued at 2 year. Only 4% of children 6 - 23 months living with their&#xD;
      mothers are fed in accordance with infant and young child feeding practices and 66% children&#xD;
      under the age of two receive age-appropriate breastfeeding. Overall, nearly three children in&#xD;
      every ten (27%) are given prelacteal feeds within the first three days of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Amhara region, 38% of infants started breastfeeding within one hour of birth while only 2%&#xD;
      and 34% of children 6-24 months were fed according to the minimum standards with respect to&#xD;
      food diversity (four or more food groups) and meal frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-optimal infant and young child feeding practices are associated with caretakers' poor&#xD;
      knowledge, lack of information and being restricted by traditional beliefs. It is essential&#xD;
      to give caregivers necessary knowledge and information to alter their inappropriate feeding&#xD;
      behaviors. Promotion of appropriate feeding practices, therefore, is fundamentally important&#xD;
      in reducing child malnutrition and mortality and, thus, for achieving MDG 1. In order to&#xD;
      sustain the gains made by promoting exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life,&#xD;
      interventions need to extend into the second half of infancy and beyond. This could be&#xD;
      ensured by enabling caregivers to appropriately feed their children with safe and adequate&#xD;
      complementary foods while maintaining frequent breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several efforts to improve the feeding status of the infant and young children have been&#xD;
      carried out at different times. The Ethiopian government developed the infant and young child&#xD;
      feeding guideline in 2004 following WHO recommendations of global strategy for feeding&#xD;
      infants and young children for proper nutrition &amp; health. Community based nutrition program&#xD;
      was also designed to build upon the HEP packages and implemented in all agrarian regions of&#xD;
      Ethiopia. However, these efforts have failed to bring about substantive and sustainable&#xD;
      changes leading to improvement of infant and young child feeding practices since efforts&#xD;
      (nutrition actions) were not based on the evidence on existing feeding practices and what&#xD;
      works and what does not. Moreover, the health extension workers were not effectively&#xD;
      networked with the community volunteers, work load for health extension workers and lack of&#xD;
      training and supervision outcomes could factor their effects on the feeding practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, the problem of stunting has remained pervasively high in the country. The&#xD;
      government has designed an accelerated stunting reduction program under the revised national&#xD;
      nutrition program. Moreover the Federal Ministry of Health has made reduction of child&#xD;
      malnutrition in Ethiopia a priority flagship program under the commitment to the Seqota&#xD;
      declaration, which states zero level hunger among under two children by 2030. Therefore, the&#xD;
      aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of behavior change communication on&#xD;
      optimal complementary feeding through community level actors in improving feeding practice,&#xD;
      nutrition and health status of infants.&#xD;
