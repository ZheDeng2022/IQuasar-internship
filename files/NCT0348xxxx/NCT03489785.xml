  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to identify the predictive factors of unpredicted movement in&#xD;
      motor evoked potential (MEP) during intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring in adult&#xD;
      patients undergoing brain surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in neuroendovascular techniques, several complications can occur by brain&#xD;
      urgery. Therefore, for neurosurgeons and anesthesiologists, it is a major concern to describe&#xD;
      and monitor surgical lesion for maintaining structural and functional integrity as well as&#xD;
      achieving maximal cytoreduction in lesion, and modifying the management of patients on the&#xD;
      process of surgery. For example, microvascular Doppler sonography, indocyanine green&#xD;
      aniography, intraoperative digital subtraction angiography, and intraoperative&#xD;
      neurophysiologic monitoring (IONM) are used for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of unpredictable and unacceptable movement is relative low. However, the&#xD;
      results are so horrendous that they can cause injuries in site of rigid pin fixation of the&#xD;
      head, cervical spine injuries, excessive surgical field movement, and deterioration of&#xD;
      surgical outcome. However, risk factors associated with unpredictable and unacceptable&#xD;
      movement remain unclear. Therefore, the aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate risk&#xD;
      factors associated with unpredictable and unacceptable movement in the patients who underwent&#xD;
      brain surgery with MEP monitoring under general anesthesia while using neuromuscular blocking&#xD;
      agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recorded demographic data including age in years, sex, height in meters,&#xD;
      weight in kilograms, body mass index (BMI in kg/m^2), ASA physical status class, diagnosed&#xD;
      disease, performed surgical procedure, duration of anesthesia in minutes, duration of surgery&#xD;
      in minutes, underlying disease (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, neurologic disease, respiratory&#xD;
      disease), medications. Laboratory data was also collected including arterial blood gas&#xD;
      analysis, hematocrit, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, ionized calcium, ionized magnesium, and&#xD;
      lactate. Unpredictable and unacceptable movement was defined as either the dangerous gross&#xD;
      movement requiring the increase the continuous infusion rate of rocuronium in view of the&#xD;
      surgeon, anesthesiologist, and neurophysiologic specialist or the shake of the surgical field&#xD;
      requiring the increase the continuous infusion rate of rocuronium.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators retrospectively compare the data of patients with and without unpredictable and unacceptable movement during surgery. For continuous variables, values were compared using the independent t-test. Differences in proportions were compared using chi-square test. Variables with P-values &lt; 0.05 in the primary test were selected and univariate binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the factors predictive of an unpredictable and unacceptable movement. P-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</description>
