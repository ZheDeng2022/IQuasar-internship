  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with congenital heart diseases (CHD) often show reduced health related physical&#xD;
      fitness as well as limitations in gross and fine motor skills/development. Intervention&#xD;
      programs in childhood are still rare and often focus just on the improvement of cardiac&#xD;
      outcomes or exercise capacity. Web-based interventions, as a useful alternative to training&#xD;
      manuals or supervised training, are cost effective and allow a customization of training&#xD;
      times. Primary purpose of this study is to improve health related physical fitness in&#xD;
      children with congenital heart disease.&#xD;

    <description>The FitnessGram® is a fitness test from the Cooper Institute that assesses health-related physical fitness. It uses evidence-based standards to measure functional health status of the musculoskeletal system divided into the components muscular strength, muscular endurance and flexibility. The FitnessGram® includes tests for the upper body and the abdominal/trunk areas. Mean scores were calculated and compared to an actual reference sample of German children and adolescents.</description>

    <description>The intervention group gets access to a training platform. Every week, 3 training videos of 20 minutes each will be released on that platform with the aim to perform those during the ongoing week.&#xD;
Each exercise session is arranged in a video session with child friendly instructions and executions for the different exercises. The videos serve as a virtual training partner and exercise will be performed simultaneously while watching the video&#xD;
The overall training volume is 72 session calculated from 3 sessions per week over a duration of 24 weeks (6 month)</description>
