  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy of virtual reality analgesia (VRA) for pediatric patients undergoing&#xD;
      Botulinum toxin injections (BTI) for spasticity management. Patients will be assigned to one&#xD;
      of three groups; one group of subjects will randomly be assigned to VRA intervention using&#xD;
      Google Cardboard Virtual reality head- mounted display powered by a iPod touch, a second&#xD;
      group of subjects will receive VRA with Oculus Rift, and a third group of subjects will&#xD;
      receive no intervention beyond standard sedation, anesthetic, and/or restraint-this group&#xD;
      will serve as the control group.&#xD;

      Group 1: Oculus Rift This group will receive BTI's per conventional protocols. They will wear&#xD;
      the Oculus Rift VRHMD (Figure&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) powered by the laptop pc (Figure 2) during the procedure viewing a VR 360 degree video of&#xD;
      their choice. Measurements in pain and anxiety will be taken per the outcome measures listed&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Google Cardboard VRHMD This group will receive BTI's per conventional protocols.&#xD;
      They will wear the Google cardboard VRHMD (Figure 3) powered by iPod touch/smartphone (Figure&#xD;
      4) during the procedure viewing a VR 360 degree video of their choice. Measurements in pain&#xD;
      and anxiety will be taken per the outcome measures listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3. Control This group will receive BTI's per conventional protocols without VRA&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>Severity of Pain Measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>About 20 minutes per patient.</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of pain using the Face Legs Activity Cry Consolability scale (FLACC scale) which is a Behavioral Pain Assessment Scale. Each category is scored on the 0-2 scale, that results in total score of 0-10.&#xD;
0= Relaxed and comfortable , 1-3 = Mild discomfort, 4-6=Moderate pain, 7-10= Severe discomfort or pain or both. Lower score is a good outcome and higher score is a bad outcome. The assessment is for all the subjects in the study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of severity of anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>About 20 minutes per patient</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of anxiety using Short State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Anxiety scale which is a self-evaluation questionnaire completed by the patient's parent or guardian about how they feel and how the child feels at that moment.&#xD;
It consists of 6 questions each having scale 1-4. 1 being Not at all and 4 being Very much. The questions are as follows:&#xD;
I feel calm&#xD;
I am tense&#xD;
I feel upset&#xD;
I am relaxed&#xD;
I feel content&#xD;
I am worried</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with spasticity requiring BTI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children ages 5 - 18&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children who have contraindications for sedation for BTI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with intact vision who can attend VR intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children who have uncontrolled seizures &gt; than 4 per year&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children who are not attentive to VR secondary to poor concentration, poor cognition&#xD;
             to external stimuli&#xD;
&#xD;
