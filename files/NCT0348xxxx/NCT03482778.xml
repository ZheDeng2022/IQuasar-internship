&#xD;
      AYAs with cancer experience many challenges that impact their health-related quality of life&#xD;
      (HRQOL) but few measures adequately capture AYAs' HRQOL in valid and reliable ways. The main&#xD;
      goal of the study is to expand the use of the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement&#xD;
      Information System (PROMIS) to provide valid and reliable assessment of important HRQOL&#xD;
      concerns for AYAs. The study team will do this by validating existing PROMIS measures and&#xD;
      developing and validating new measures of financial distress, fertility/parenthood concerns,&#xD;
      and body image concerns for AYAs with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM1b:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have developed conceptual frameworks and created item pools for body image,&#xD;
      fertility, and financial burden domains and are ready to proceed with the next aim of our&#xD;
      measure development work, cognitive interview testing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      AIM1a:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are approximately 70,000 new diagnoses of cancer annually in adolescents and young&#xD;
      adults (AYAs; ages 15-39), and nearly 2 million people in the United States are living with&#xD;
      or have survived being diagnosed with cancer as an AYA. Despite the high number of AYA&#xD;
      survivors, survival rates of AYAs have not kept pace with those of their younger or older&#xD;
      counterparts. AYAs face unique challenges given the physical, cognitive, and psychosocial&#xD;
      developmental milestones that may be disrupted as a result of their cancer experience. In&#xD;
      addition to the age-related disparities in survival rates, AYAs are at greater risk of&#xD;
      significant psychological and financial distress compared to older adults with cancer.&#xD;
      Accordingly, assessing and better understanding the unique needs and health-related quality&#xD;
      of life (HRQOL) of this important, underserved group as they manage their cancer experience&#xD;
      is essential in order to optimize and tailor supportive care approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few HRQOL conceptual frameworks exist that describe the types of symptom burden and&#xD;
      functional impact experienced by AYAs with cancer, but most HRQOL measures fail to capture&#xD;
      the range of HRQOL domains that are important to AYAs. Further, measures of HRQOL&#xD;
      specifically developed for AYAs lack common items and standardized scoring approaches across&#xD;
      the age range of 15-39, limiting the ability to understand the unique needs of this age&#xD;
      group. The NIH's Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) assesses&#xD;
      most of the relevant HRQOL domains (pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression, cognitive&#xD;
      functioning, physical functioning, sexual functioning, and social support) but has not been&#xD;
      validated in AYAs and PROMIS does not include key domains such as financial distress, body&#xD;
      image concerns, or fertility/ parenthood concerns that provide a complete perspective of&#xD;
      HRQOL in AYAs with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to expand the use of PROMIS to provide reliable and valid&#xD;
      assessment of important HRQOL concerns for AYAs. To accomplish this goal, the study team&#xD;
      propose the following specific aims: (1) develop item pools of financial distress, body image&#xD;
      concerns, and fertility/parenthood concerns for AYAs with cancer using PROMIS measurement&#xD;
      development methodologies; (2) calibrate item banks and short forms of financial distress,&#xD;
      body image concerns, and fertility/ parenthood concerns in a large, developmentally diverse&#xD;
      sample of AYAs with and without cancer; and (3) validate newly developed short forms of&#xD;
      financial distress, body image concerns, and fertility/ parenthood concerns along with&#xD;
      existing PROMIS short forms in a developmentally and clinically diverse, prospective sample&#xD;
      of AYAs with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of this research study, the investigators will have a psychometrically robust,&#xD;
      state-of-the-art measurement system tailored to AYAs' unique HRQOL needs. Through the&#xD;
      identification, adaptation, and development of reliable, valid, and responsive measures of&#xD;
      HRQOL for AYAs with cancer, the investigators will give these underserved patients a voice&#xD;
      and provide the assessment tools clinicians and researchers need to enhance patient-centered&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM1b:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, are utilizing the cutting-edge measures and scientific standards of the&#xD;
      PROMIS in the development of new item banks for financial burden, body image, and fertility,&#xD;
      and in the examination of the psychometric properties of existing PROMIS measures for use in&#xD;
      AYAs with cancer. For the purposes of this current protocol, investigators will focus on the&#xD;
      cognitive interview stage of this process to evaluate the comprehensibility of the&#xD;
      preliminary item pools.&#xD;

    <description>Investigators will ascertain: (a) comprehension of the question (i.e., what does the respondent believe the question is asking; what do specific words, phrases and concepts in the question mean to the respondent); (b) the processes used by the respondent to retrieve relevant information from memory (i.e., what does the respondent need to recall to be able to answer the question; what strategies does the respondent use to retrieve the information); and (c) response processes (i.e., can the respondent match his/her response to the question's response options). Participant responses to interview questions will be coded 0 or 1 reflecting adequate comprehension or misunderstanding. Translatability review will also be conducted by FACITtrans to identify items/concepts that may not translate easily or prove to have limited or no conceptual equivalence in other cultures and to suggest alternative wording changes.</description>
