  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have reported a high prevalence of hypertensive (HT) urgency. However, these&#xD;
      studies have also reported low rates of serious complications, suggesting that rapid blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP) reduction may be unnecessary. There are limited clinical data available on this&#xD;
      topic in Asian populations. The investigators aimed to determine the basic characteristics,&#xD;
      treatment methods, and outcomes in HT urgency patients, both in the emergency room (ER) and&#xD;
      at a two-week follow-up.&#xD;

      Previous studies have reported the high prevalence of hypertensive (HT) urgency. However,&#xD;
      these studies have also reported low rates of serious complications, suggesting that rapid&#xD;
      blood pressure (BP) reduction may be unnecessary. There are limited clinical data available&#xD;
      on this topic in Asian populations. The investigators aimed to determine the basic&#xD;
      characteristics, treatment methods, and outcomes in HT urgency patients, both in the&#xD;
      emergency room (ER) and at a two-week follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a cohort study conducted at Srinagarind hospital, a tertiary-care level university&#xD;
      hospital in Khon Kaen, Thailand. The data collection period was from January 2012 to June&#xD;
      2017. The Khon Kaen University Ethics Committee in Human Research approved the protocol.&#xD;
      Patients aged 18 years or older who visited the ER with a diagnosis of HT urgency were&#xD;
      consecutively enrolled in the study. Patients who were pregnant or lactating had secondary&#xD;
      causes of HT, or had incomplete medical records were excluded from the study Office BP was&#xD;
      measured using an upper arm cuff oscillometric BP device. The appropriate cuff size for each&#xD;
      individual's arm circumference was used. Three BP readings were taken at 30-second intervals&#xD;
      with the patient in a sitting position after five minutes of rest. The average of three BP&#xD;
      measurements was used for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristic data were shown as the mean and standard deviation (SD) or&#xD;
      percentage. An independent sample t-test was used to compare between groups for continuous&#xD;
      variables including age, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), time of treatment, and the number of&#xD;
      medications being administered. A probability value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically&#xD;
      significant. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS for Mac version 20.0,&#xD;
      registered to Khon Kaen University.&#xD;
