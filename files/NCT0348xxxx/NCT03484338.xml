    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether accelerated resolution therapy (ART) is effective for the&#xD;
      treatment of prolonged and complicated grief and associated psychological trauma among older&#xD;
      adult hospice caregivers who have experienced the death of an immediate family member at&#xD;
      least 12 months ago.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ART is an evidence-based therapy for the treatment of depressive symptoms and trauma and&#xD;
      stress-related disorders that includes the core components of trauma-focused therapy&#xD;
      including imaging rescripting, voluntary image replacement, guided visualization with use of&#xD;
      eye movements, desensitization and processing of distressing memories, and in-vitro exposure&#xD;
      to future feared triggers. Mental health professionals are delivering ART in clinical&#xD;
      practice to assist with grief; however, there is a need for formal research evaluation of the&#xD;
      effects of ART on complicated grief and psychological distress.&#xD;

    <description>The PCL-5 (PTSD Patient Checklist)26 is a 20-item self-report instrument that will be used to assess the DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD (psychological trauma)(corresponding to criteria B-E). The total symptom severity score ranges from 0 to . A diagnostic cut-point for PTSD of 33 has been recommended. In addition, it is generally accepted that a reduction of 10 points or more on the PCL-5 is indicative of statistical and clinically meaningful improvement.</description>

    <description>For the biomarkers of sAA and IL-6, measurement will occur using the protocols listed in the Salimetrics® α-Amylase Kinetic Enzyme Assay Kit for kinetic measurement of sAA activity (Appendix B) and Salimetrics® Salivary Interleukin-6 Elisa Kit KIT (Appendix C). The unstimulated passive drool method will be used. Participants will be asked to tilt head forward, allowing the saliva to pool on the floor of the mouth, and then pass the saliva through the SalivaBio Collection Aid (SCA) into a polypropylene vial.</description>
