  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, single-centre study to determine the reference range (95th percentile) of human&#xD;
      chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels in a healthy, non-pregnant, adult female population using&#xD;
      the RAMP® Total β-hCG test.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a glycoprotein hormone secreted by the placenta shortly&#xD;
      after implantation of a fertilized ovum into the uterine wall and the rapid rise of blood hCG&#xD;
      concentration after conception makes it an excellent marker for confirmation and monitoring&#xD;
      of early pregnancy. As such, levels in the blood of non-pregnant premenopausal individuals&#xD;
      are low, typically &lt; 5 mIU/mL (milli-International Unit per milliliter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of identifying a clinically significant range of expected hCG values as determined&#xD;
      by the RAMP β-hCG test, a 95th percentile of a healthy, non-pregnant, adult female reference&#xD;
      population [upper reference limit (URL)] shall be determined in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and give informed consent will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study. Because hCG levels in blood increase with age, the study population&#xD;
      will be divided into two age groups: 18 to 40 years and &gt;40 years, with approximately 125&#xD;
      subjects per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) blood sample will be collected from each subject&#xD;
      via standard venipuncture. The maximum trial duration for each subject will be one&#xD;
      visit/blood draw.&#xD;

        Approximately two hundred-fifty (250) healthy, non-pregnant adult female subjects will be&#xD;
        enrolled in the study. Because hCG levels in blood increase with age, the study population&#xD;
        will be divided into two age groups: 18 to 40 years and &gt;40 years, with approximately 125&#xD;
        subjects per group.There are no enrollment restrictions based upon race or ethnic origin.&#xD;
