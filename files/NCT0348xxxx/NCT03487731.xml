  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a phase I/II trial where allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are&#xD;
      injected intracfect into the lumbar facet joints. Forty (40) subjects are scheduled to&#xD;
      undergo injection after meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluate at&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are 40 subjects that will be randomized into the trial into one of 4 groups. In the&#xD;
      pilot phase 5 subjects will be enrolled into Group 1, and another 5 subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      into Group 2. Subjects in group 1 will receive placebo but will be eligible for a cross over&#xD;
      phase where they will receive a injection of the study investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pilot phase, the first three (3) subjects in each treatment group will not be treated&#xD;
      less than 10 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the pilot study, thirty (30) subjects will be scheduled to undergo CT guided facet&#xD;
      injection of the lumbar facet joints using a posterior approach after meeting all&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and baseline evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomized to either Group A or Group B.Group A will consist of&#xD;
      15 subjects that will receive 20 million Allogeneic hMSCs. Group B will receive placebo.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Facetogenic back pain diagnosed using the following diagnostic criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The facet joint may be affected by systemic disease, as rheumatoid arthritis and&#xD;
                  ankylosing spondylitis, or be site of micro traumatic fractures, osteoarthritis,&#xD;
                  meniscoid entrapment, synovial impingement, joint subluxation, synovial&#xD;
                  inflammation, loss of cartilage, and mechanical injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pain onset at dorsal extension and release at flexion is often considered&#xD;
                  suggestive for facet pain, even if non-specific, such as maximal tenderness upon&#xD;
                  deep palpation of posterior elements&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of temporary improvement with a medial branch block anesthetic injection&#xD;
                  of the targeted joints&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Axial lumbar pain without radicular symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pain on hyperextension, rotation, and lateral bending with physical exam&#xD;

             urine pregnancy test at screening and within 36 hours prior to injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Inability to perform any of the assessments required for endpoint analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;

         14. Have a clinical history of malignancy within 5 years (i.e., subjects with prior&#xD;
             malignancy must be disease free for 5 years), except curatively-treated basal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma in situ or cervical carcinoma, if&#xD;
             recurrence occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Have a non-pulmonary condition that limits lifespan to &lt; 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Have a history of drug or alcohol abuse within the past 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Be serum positive for HIV, hepatitis BsAg or Viremic hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Be currently participating (or participated within the previous 30 days) in an&#xD;
             investigational therapeutic or device trial.&#xD;
