  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Of the annual incidence of stroke&#xD;
      (~750,000) in the USA about 60% fail to recover arm and hand use contributing to reduced&#xD;
      quality of life for survivors and caregivers. How can therapists facilitate the&#xD;
      rehabilitation of individuals with arm movement deficits and increase their quality of life&#xD;
      over a long time period? It is known that principles of treatment including repetition,&#xD;
      feedback, challenge and progression are important for producing recovery. The ability for&#xD;
      patients to train at home and manage their own rehabilitation duration, intensity and&#xD;
      progression, via effective self-management strategies, is vital. What is needed is an&#xD;
      effective, easy to use, low cost system that self-motivates patients to intensively practice&#xD;
      their therapy exercises at home while maintaining elements of repetition, feedback, challenge&#xD;
      and progression. In this proposal the investigators intend to adapt just such a &quot;web-based&#xD;
      system&quot; originally designed in the UK. The first version of the system has shown preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy and feasibility in a small pilot study in UK. The investigators will adapt the&#xD;
      system for use in the USA, with the assistance of consultants from the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and feasibility of using a free,&#xD;
      easy to use, interactive web-based upper extremity stroke rehab program on individuals with&#xD;
      stroke who have recently been discharged from outpatient rehabilitation. The goal is to&#xD;
      compare the home use of the web-based stroke rehab program with that of written exercises in&#xD;
      a randomized controlled trial. The aims/objectives are to (1) adapt the existing system for&#xD;
      use in America including adding bilateral activities and then to assess (2) motor function&#xD;
      immediately before and after six weeks intervention and after twenty weeks follow up in order&#xD;
      to support the efficacy of using this web-based intervention; (3) behavioral changes in&#xD;
      motivation and self-efficacy at the same time points to understand the relationship between&#xD;
      behavioral and motor function changes; (4) perceptions of patients and caregivers of the&#xD;
      web-based program to understand feasibility and barriers to home use; and (5) perceptions of&#xD;
      therapists to understand feasibility and barriers to clinic use.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Objective 1, Development of the expanded STROKE web program applicable to individuals with&#xD;
      stroke in the USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a necessary objective to achieve before the investigators can start the trial; but it&#xD;
      has no associated hypothesis. One rationale is to expand the target population in terms of&#xD;
      impairment severity based both on feedback from therapists and on the need to add more&#xD;
      bilateral activities that are important for everyday use. The second rationale is to check&#xD;
      that material is readable and applicable to individuals with stroke in the USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: To determine the immediate and durable motor function changes from a six-week&#xD;
      web-based stroke rehab program vs. usual written exercise care in individuals discharged from&#xD;
      outpatient therapy after a stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Six weeks of web-based stroke training compared to six weeks of a written home upper limb&#xD;
      exercise program will result in clinically meaningful and statistically significant&#xD;
      improvement in upper extremity function immediately after the intervention and 4.5 months&#xD;
      later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This primary hypothesis is justified based on the combination of two theoretical constructs&#xD;
      as described earlier. First, there is evidence that web-based programs, based on Self&#xD;
      Determination Theory principles, will show an increase in motivation to exercise vs. a&#xD;
      control with no intervention in non-disabled individuals. Second, since the web-based program&#xD;
      is also based on neuroplasticity and motor learning principles known to improve functional&#xD;
      recovery, and not just physiological improvements, the participants should also improve their&#xD;
      functional recovery rather than merely gain physical activity benefits while maintaining or&#xD;
      even losing their functional level. Third, the pilot feasibility study supports this&#xD;
      hypothesis for the immediate effect and, after the power analysis, for the follow up testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: To determine the immediate and durable behavioral benefits of a six-week&#xD;
      web-based stroke program vs. standard care in individuals discharged from outpatient therapy&#xD;
      after a stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Six weeks of web-based stroke training compared to six weeks of a written home upper limb&#xD;
      exercise program will result in statistically significant gains in motivation to exercise,&#xD;
      self-efficacy and amount of practice time immediately after the intervention and 4.5 months&#xD;
      later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This secondary hypothesis explores whether the STRONG program will improve the patients&#xD;
      motivation to exercise and their self-efficacy, while the written exercise program has the&#xD;
      opposite effect, by the end of the intervention. There is evidence from the non-disabled&#xD;
      population that behavioral improvements such as increasing exercise time will occur when&#xD;
      individuals are intrinsically motivated but this has not been shown in the stroke population&#xD;
      using a LifeGuide platform web-based system27. Conceptually, the investigators predict that&#xD;
      individuals with stroke will also become intrinsically motivated, because the program&#xD;
      incorporates design details that enhance feelings of autonomy, competence and relatedness.&#xD;
      Therefore, based on SDT, participants will not only have a better functional level but an&#xD;
      increase in self-efficacy, motivation and independence. Specifically, during the 4.5 months&#xD;
      after training, participants in the STRONG web program will demonstrate this by maintaining&#xD;
      an increased amount of practice even though the investigators will have withdrawn our&#xD;
      external support from the therapist (but not the participants ability to communicate with&#xD;
      friends).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embedded Qualitative Component. Qualitative work is based on inductive reasoning and is&#xD;
      hypothesis generating rather than hypothesis testing 49. Therefore, the investigators do not&#xD;
      offer specific hypotheses but outline some of the questions that will be asked to give&#xD;
      meaning and a context to the use of the web-based program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 4: To determine the perceptions of patients/caregivers to the use of a web-based&#xD;
      stroke training program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative methods will be used to explore patient and caregiver experiences and perceptions&#xD;
      of using the Web-based system as part of stroke recovery to answer questions such as - In&#xD;
      what ways did the STRONG web program help or hinder their rehabilitation? What did&#xD;
      participants like and dislike about it? How did participants use it and why? What&#xD;
      difficulties did participants have with using it? How could it be better? What did&#xD;
      participants perceive to be the 'added value' of using the STRONG web program over routine&#xD;
      practice alone?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 5: To determine the perceptions of therapists to the use of a web-based stroke&#xD;
      training program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative methods will be used to explore therapists' experiences and perceptions of the&#xD;
      STRONG web program in order to answer questions such as - What are the most important/useful&#xD;
      aspects of the STRONG web program. What are the most difficult/problematic aspects of the&#xD;
      STRONG? When would therapists use it and why? Who is it most successful for and why? What&#xD;
      does it add to routine practice? In what ways does it detract from or complicate routine&#xD;
      practice?&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Individuals over 40 years who have Ischemic or Hemorrhagic stroke &lt;20 weeks prior&#xD;
                  to recruitment: Controlling for age and type of stroke is less relevant for a&#xD;
                  pragmatic trial. We chose &lt;20 weeks to allow the maximum time to enroll&#xD;
                  participants and still ensure that after a 6-week intervention they will not be&#xD;
                  beyond the 6 month time period typically used to demark the beginning of the&#xD;
                  chronic time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Discharged from outpatient rehabilitation (within a week): We chose this marker&#xD;
                  to reduce confounds from continuing therapy services or from time spent without&#xD;
                  opportunity to practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Impaired upper limb function: Participants must have recognizable (observable)&#xD;
                  dysfunction. They should also have the ability to move their hand forward by at&#xD;
                  least 3 inches without trunk compensation and demonstrating anti-gravity&#xD;
                  movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Able to use or willing to learn how to use a computer/tablet based on&#xD;
                  patient/caregiver self-report and judgment of patient's therapist: This is&#xD;
                  necessary to access the web-based intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Able to provide informed consent based on judgment of patient's therapist:&#xD;
                  Participants need to have enough cognitive and communication function to&#xD;
                  understand instructions from the web-based program. This will be a preliminary&#xD;
                  screen to reduce the numbers of failed screening at consent time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  program. This will be a preliminary screen to reduce the numbers of failed screening&#xD;
             at consent time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Co-morbidities such as neurological, orthopaedic and cardiovascular complications that&#xD;
             compromise safety and participation: Based on the discharge orders from the hospital,&#xD;
             if the patient is recommended to discontinue exercising their paretic arm, they will&#xD;
             be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Severe cognitive and communication problems indicated by failure to respond to&#xD;
             two-step commands: Participants must be able to interact with the web-based&#xD;
