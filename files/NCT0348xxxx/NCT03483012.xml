  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying the combination of a drug called atezolizumab and a radiation&#xD;
      procedure called stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) as a possible treatment for triple-negative&#xD;
      breast cancer that has spread to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atezolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved atezolizumab for this&#xD;
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atezolizumab is a protein that affects the immune system by blocking the PD-L1 pathway. The&#xD;
      PD-L1 pathway controls the body's natural immune response, but tumors can interrupt this&#xD;
      pathway and partially resist or escape the immune system. By blocking the PD-L1 pathway,&#xD;
      Atezolizumab may help the immune system identify and catch tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a standard procedure used to treat patients with cancer in&#xD;
      the brain. SRS uses many precisely focused radiation beams to treat tumors. It is not surgery&#xD;
      in the traditional sense because there's no incision. Instead, SRS uses 3-D imaging to target&#xD;
      high doses of radiation to the affected area with minimal impact on the surrounding healthy&#xD;
      tissue. Like other forms of radiation, SRS works by damaging the DNA of the targeted (tumor)&#xD;
      cells. The affected cells then lose the ability to reproduce, which causes tumors to shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When given separately, atezolizumab and SRS, work in different ways to help stop cancer cells&#xD;
      from growing and spreading. However, it is not known if giving atezolizumab and SRS at the&#xD;
      same time will have a better effect than giving each treatment on its own. It is hoped that&#xD;
      SRS treatment will damage cancer cells and make them more visible to the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers conducting this study are testing to see whether giving SRS with atezolizumab&#xD;
      may boost the body's immune response to cancer, and therefore improve upon the effects of&#xD;
      either SRS or atezolizumab given alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators will measure the length of time that the&#xD;
      participant receive this study intervention without the disease getting worse. The&#xD;
      investigators will also look at how well the disease responds to atezolizumab and SRS as well&#xD;
      as the safety of the combination.&#xD;

             and must have a maximum diameter of ≤ 3.0 cm in any direction on the enhanced scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must not have more than 5 new or progressive lesions in the brain&#xD;
             requiring SRS treatment (greater than 5 total brain lesions are allowed as long as no&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Participants must have discontinued systemic therapy at least 14 days prior to&#xD;
                  initiating protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  There is no limit to the number of prior lines of systemic therapy. Participants&#xD;
                  who have not received any systemic therapy for metastatic disease are also&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior local therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior surgery, whole brain radiation or SRS is allowed as long as the most recent&#xD;
             brain progression is amenable to SRS treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Resolution of all chemotherapy-related or radiation-related toxicities to Grade 1&#xD;
             severity or lower, except for stable sensory neuropathy (≤ Grade 2 allowed) and&#xD;
             alopecia (of any grade).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is ≥18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable dose of dexamethasone 2mg or less for at least 7 days prior to initiation of&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/μl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets ≥75,000/μl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin ≤1.5mg/dL (≤2.0 in patients with known Gilberts syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional ULN. ≤5.0 × institutional ULN for&#xD;
                  patients with documented liver metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  albumin &gt;2.5mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  serum creatinine ≤1.5mg/dL or calculated GFR ≥60 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 8 days of initiating protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from&#xD;
             heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate&#xD;
             of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last&#xD;
             dose of study treatment. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she&#xD;
             is postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of&#xD;
             amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone&#xD;
             surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). Examples of contraceptive&#xD;
             methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male&#xD;
             sterilization, established, proper use of hormonal contraceptives that inhibit&#xD;
             ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.&#xD;
             The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration&#xD;
             of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic&#xD;
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and&#xD;
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. The effects of atezolizumab on&#xD;
             the developing human fetus are unknown and radiotherapy has known teratogenic effects&#xD;
             so women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation and 4 months after completion of atezolizumab&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and has signed&#xD;
             the informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CNS complications for whom urgent neurosurgical intervention is indicated (e.g.,&#xD;
             resection, shunt placement).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known leptomeningeal or brainstem metastases. The presence of leptomeningeal&#xD;
             enhancement alone, without associated clinical manifestations and/or positive CSF&#xD;
             cytology, will not be constituted as known leptomeningeal metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with high dose systemic corticosteroids defined as dexamethasone &gt;2mg/day or&#xD;
             bioequivalent within 7 days of initiating therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to undergo gadolinium contrast-enhanced MRI or receive IV contrast for&#xD;
             any reason (e.g., due to pacemaker, ferromagnetic implants, claustrophobia, extreme&#xD;
             obesity, hypersensitity).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous treatment with any anti-PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2 agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity to compounds of similar biologic&#xD;
             composition to atezolizumab or any constituent of the product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including, but not limited&#xD;
             to uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, congestive heart failure-New York Heart Association Class III or IV,&#xD;
             active ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction within the previous six months,&#xD;
             uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, gastric or duodenal ulceration diagnosed within the&#xD;
             previous 6 months, severe malnutrition or psychiatric illness/social situations that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a medical condition that requires chronic systemic steroid therapy or&#xD;
             on any other form of immunosuppressive medication. For example, patients with&#xD;
             autoimmune disease that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppression agents should&#xD;
             be excluded. Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic&#xD;
             corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is&#xD;
             not considered a form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has evidence of active, noninfectious pneumonitis that requires treatment with&#xD;
             steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant is known to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),&#xD;
             HepBsAg, or HCV RNA. HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
             are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with&#xD;
             atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of different malignancy are ineligible except for the&#xD;
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible&#xD;
             if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years or are deemed by the principal&#xD;
             investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine within 28 days of planned start of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant is pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;
