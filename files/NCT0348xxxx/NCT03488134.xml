    <textblock>
      Although thyroid cancers are low-grade endocrine malignancy, most patients usually received&#xD;
      thyroidectomy with ablative radioactive iodine therapy. Such patients were followed with&#xD;
      thyroid ultrasonography and serial serum thyroglobulin evaluation. Prior researches indicated&#xD;
      that one-third well-differentiated thyroid cancers could transform to poorly-differentiated&#xD;
      patterns, even to be anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), a fatal malignancy, and no effective&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies was noted, including surgical intervention, chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy. The poorly-differentiated or anaplastic change of thyroid cancer cells&#xD;
      proliferates rapidly and always invades local tissues with distant metastasis. Cellular&#xD;
      de-differentiation is the most pivotal cause for malignant transformation and invasion.&#xD;
      De-differentiation usually in papillary thyroid cancer and follicular thyroid cancer, and&#xD;
      definitely in ATC. Therefore, the investigators try to find the biological markers and&#xD;
      therapeutic targets via the exosomal expression in urine. On the continuing basis of prior&#xD;
      ATC cells culture experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exosomes are nanovesicles secreted into extracellular environments. Cancer cell-derived&#xD;
      exosomes could be found in plasma, saliva, urine and other body fluid of patients with&#xD;
      cancer. The investigators try to analyze the urinary exosomal proteins, including&#xD;
      thyroglobulin and galectin-3, to find the early prognostic biological markers in urine via&#xD;
      this prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expected to enroll 150 post-operative patients with papillary, follicular&#xD;
      or anaplastic thyroid cancer, and collect the urine samples in outpatient clinic per year.&#xD;
      The investigators will analyze the urine exosomal proteins and probable biological markers,&#xD;
      including thyroglobulin and galectin-3. The investigators hope to find the prognostic&#xD;
      biological markers via this prospective study. The investigators further hope to find newly&#xD;
      therapeutic and follow-up pathway for such patients with well-differentiated or anaplastic&#xD;
      thyroid cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Papillary and follicular thyroid cancers are low-grade endocrine malignancy, and most&#xD;
      patients usually received thyroidectomy with ablative radioactive iodine therapy. These&#xD;
      patients were followed with thyroid ultrasonography and serial serum thyroglobulin&#xD;
      evaluation. Serum thyroglobulin is the pivotal biomarker in survey of possible residual tumor&#xD;
      or recurrence of thyroid cancer. Generally, such patients appear to have the higher residual&#xD;
      risk of isolated thyroglobulinemia, and postoperative serum thyroglobulin may suggest distant&#xD;
      metastases. Low-risk patients with a non-stimulated postoperative serum thyroglobulin was&#xD;
      usually defined of less than 0.4 ng/mL or with thyroid hormone withdrawal thyroglobulin of&#xD;
      less than 1.0 ng/mL. However, expensive recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) is usually needed to&#xD;
      stimulate serum thyroglobulin for detecting local recurrence or distant metastasis. The issue&#xD;
      of earlier biological markers for predicting prognosis of thyroid cancer should be raised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exosomes are nanovesicles secreted into extracellular environments. Cancer cell-derived&#xD;
      exosomes could be found in plasma, saliva, urine and other body fluid of patients with&#xD;
      cancer. A growing evidence suggests that exosomes could be used as biomarkers to be the&#xD;
      diagnosis and prognosis of malignant tumors. Exosomes are 40-100 nm diameters, and correspond&#xD;
      to the intraluminal vesicles of endosomal multivesicular bodies. Exosomes secreted by cells&#xD;
      could micro-molecularly transfer messages between cells, and be the biological markers of&#xD;
      cancer. In addition, exosomes could be collected in serum, tissue fluid and urine for&#xD;
      diseases follow-up, and urine as the biosample is easier to repeatedly obtain and&#xD;
      non-invasive. In this study, the investigators enroll patients with papillary, follicular,&#xD;
      and collect the urine samples before operation, immediately after operation,&#xD;
      post-operatively. The investigators try to analyze the urinary exosomal proteins to find the&#xD;
      early prognostic biological markers in urine via this prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study report will explore that urinary exosomal thyroglobulin could be a reliable&#xD;
      biological marker to substitute for serum thyroglobulin in the future. Such patient do not&#xD;
      need to withdraw thyroid hormone or receive rhTSH stimulation. For patients with thyroid&#xD;
      cancer, if they received thyroidectomy with ablative radioactive I-131 therapy, serum&#xD;
      thyroglobulin is defined to be cancer biomarker in the course of follow-up. If thyroglobulin&#xD;
      cannot be detected in serum, then such patients were suggested to be biochemically complete&#xD;
      treatment, independent of the interference of anti-thyroglobulin antibody. Usually, serum&#xD;
      thyroglobulin cannot be detected even under expensive rhTSH stimulation in patients of&#xD;
      biochemically complete treatment. Therefore, no serial biomarkers could be recorded for&#xD;
      evaluation and prediction of cancer recurrence. In this pilot study, urinary exosomal&#xD;
      thyroglobulin provides a non-invasive, reproducible, convenient, serial and correct follow-up&#xD;
      for patients with thyroid cancer, because the investigators use peptide sequence to quantify&#xD;
      the levels of thyroglobulin in urine exosome. Significant reduction in cost-spending in rhTSH&#xD;
      consumption, and patients do not need to stop using thyroid hormone during the course of&#xD;
      cancer follow-up. In recent years, the progress of peptides mass spectrometry provided a&#xD;
      cost-effective, correct and new pathway for the discovery of biomarkers. Large profiling of&#xD;
      proteomics of human urine reveled different follow-up manners. In the viewpoints of oncology,&#xD;
      one option is to find new biomarkers for earlier diagnosis of various cancers, and the other&#xD;
      is to make a breakthrough for follow-up residual tumor and cancer recurrence. The goal of our&#xD;
      pilot study is trying to find the new pathway for tracking the biomarker in patients with&#xD;
      thyroid cancer receiving ablative surgery and radioactive I-131 treatment.&#xD;
