  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positive urine cultures collected from indwelling catheters from inpatients will be&#xD;
      randomized to standard reporting or modified reporting. Physician antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      decisions will be prospectively observed and determined to be appropriate or inappropriate.&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that modified reporting will lead to an increase in the percentage of&#xD;
      appropriate therapy without an increase in pyelonephritis or sepsis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized trial of two methods of laboratory reporting in which&#xD;
      physicians are the main research participants. At the time of positive urine culture results,&#xD;
      the patient will be randomized by computer generated random number placed into serially&#xD;
      numbered sealed, opaque envelopes into two equal groups. One group will receive modified&#xD;
      reporting, with a report that states &quot;This POSITIVE urine culture collected from an&#xD;
      indwelling catheter may represent asymptomatic bacteriuria or urinary tract infection. If&#xD;
      urinary tract infection is suspected clinically, please call the microbiology laboratory for&#xD;
      identification and susceptibility results.&quot; The other group will receive conventional&#xD;
      reporting of identification and susceptibility. Physicians will then have the option of&#xD;
      calling the laboratory to receive the results or not. Complete results will be released by&#xD;
      telephone and laboratory information system to physicians who call to request them.&#xD;
      Physicians will be informed about the study prior to initiation, and debriefed about the&#xD;
      study after the results have been collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria will include consecutive positive urine cultures collected from indwelling&#xD;
      catheters among patients admitted to acute care, that are greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
      of age. Inpatients must be admitted to Health Sciences Center or St. Clare's Mercy hospitals&#xD;
      only, in order to facilitate access to inpatient records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria will include pregnancy, antibiotic treatment at the time of collection,&#xD;
      patients in the Intensive Care Unit and patients with blood neutrophils &lt;1.0 within 7 days,&#xD;
      which will help protect immunocompromised individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will review patient charts at 24 and 72 hours and 7 days after collection.&#xD;
      After randomization and reporting, a physician investigator will assess inpatients for the&#xD;
      true diagnosis of asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB) or urinary tract infection (UTI). Health&#xD;
      records will be accessed including demographics, treatment decisions and outcomes (untreated&#xD;
      UTI or pyelonephritis). Frequency of physician calls requesting complete reporting will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research hypothesis is that restricted reporting will reduce the rate of inappropriate&#xD;
      treatment prescribed by physicians. Among inpatients, the expected rate of inappropriate&#xD;
      treatment in the control group will be 50 percent, and 20 percent in the intervention group.&#xD;
      Accepting a risk of type 1 error of five percent, and a risk of type 2 error of twenty&#xD;
      percent, the study will recruit 72 patients. In order to account for missing data,&#xD;
      recruitment will be increased to 100 patients. The statistical test to be used is a&#xD;
      comparison of proportions between two groups (T test, two sided analysis). An intention to&#xD;
      treat analysis including all patients randomized will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians must remain unaware of the research project so that their treatment decisions are&#xD;
      unbiased. However, a general notice will be sent to all physicians regarding the study&#xD;
      design, and a debrief will be provided in which study results are presented and the option to&#xD;
      withdraw data will be provided. This will cause physicians to feel less deceived while still&#xD;
      not informing them of the study and thus will not change their behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians of discharged inpatients will be contacted at 7 days to assess for adverse events.&#xD;
      Because recruitment will be brief, it is unlikely that physicians will have a second patient&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics permission will be sought from the local ethics board. Consent of patients or&#xD;
      physicians will not be requested. In compliance with ethics requirements, participants will&#xD;
      experience no more than minimal risk. If an adverse event occurs, the patient will be removed&#xD;
      from the study immediately and given standard treatment. Physician consent will not be&#xD;
      requested, as awareness of the study would bias treatment decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit of this study to patients includes a reduction in adverse events caused by&#xD;
      inappropriate treatment. The risk to patients includes possible untreated UTI. The benefit to&#xD;
      physicians includes education toward appropriate treatment of AB. The risk to physicians&#xD;
      includes additional effort to access laboratory results for UTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will use a paper case report form, and entry into a password protected online&#xD;
      database. Analysis will be performed using SPSS 20.0 (IBM). The only expense of the project&#xD;
      will be the graduate student to collect the data, perform the analysis and write the&#xD;
      manuscript. The manuscript will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at a&#xD;
      national conference.&#xD;
