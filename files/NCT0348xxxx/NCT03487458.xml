  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective study. Patients with traumatic rib fractures are divided into&#xD;
      control group and surgical (OP) group, depending on whether they undergo rib fracture&#xD;
      fixation surgeries. They complete Short Form-36 and Work Quality Index (WQI) before surgery&#xD;
      and after surgery (before discharge, post-surgery 1 month, 3 months and 6 months). The goal&#xD;
      of this study is to examine the life quality of patients who receive surgical treatment for&#xD;
      rib fracture by analyzing patients' response, comorbidity, vital signs (blood pressure, heart&#xD;
      rate, respiratory rate, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) etc.), severity of fracture (AIS, ISS) and&#xD;
      medical costs. The investigators hope to find the most suitable method of treatment for&#xD;
      patients with rib fractures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic rib fracture is one of the most common thoracic traumas. Patients often complain of&#xD;
      severe pain of the fracture site, especially when coughing, sneezing, inhaling and lifting&#xD;
      arms. If there is obvious displacement of the rib fracture, there are risks of&#xD;
      life-threatening open pneumothorax, hemothorax and internal bleeding. Multiple rib fractures&#xD;
      may even cause flail chest, leading to respiratory distress and respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even patients with mild rib fractures may suffer from pain, causing movement limitations and&#xD;
      poor sleep. Those whose occupations require heavy labors may even lose their jobs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Large wounds and difficulties with localization and fixation made surgical interventions a&#xD;
      poor option in the past. Thus, treatment goals were set on pain control and infection&#xD;
      prevention. However, in recent years, there are improvements with medical imaging, endoscopy&#xD;
      and fracture fixation instruments, so rib fracture fixations become a new treatment option.&#xD;
      In addition, patients now ask for higher life quality after the trauma recovery, and not just&#xD;
      passively controlling the pain and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study is a prospective study. The investigators enrolled patients with&#xD;
      traumatic rib fractures from the National Taiwan University Hospital and Far Eastern Memorial&#xD;
      Hospital from July 2017 to July 2018. This study incorporated the use of Short Form-36 and&#xD;
      Work Quality Index (WQI) to compare the control groups and the surgical (OP) groups. The&#xD;
      participants would complete the questionnaires before surgery and after surgery (before&#xD;
      discharge, post-surgery 1 month, 3 months and 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to examine the life quality of patients who receive surgical&#xD;
      treatment for rib fracture by analyzing patients' response, comorbidity, vital signs (blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, GCS etc.), severity of fracture (AIS, ISS) and&#xD;
      medical costs. The investigators hope to find the most suitable method of treatment for&#xD;
      patients with rib fractures.&#xD;
