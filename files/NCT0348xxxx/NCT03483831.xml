      Objective: to evaluate hydration status and his impact on cognitive performance in&#xD;
      adolescents-based cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A randomized controlled pilot study is active in ten classes of one middle school&#xD;
      (n=214 adolescents aged 12-14; including dismissed students) in an urban area around Milan,&#xD;
      five classes being assigned to the intervention group and five classes to the control group.&#xD;
      The five school-months intervention (from January to May 2018) includes changes in class&#xD;
      environment (water dispenser to refill constantly, re-usable water bottles and educational&#xD;
      posters about water consumption) and individual reinforcement tools (text messages and school&#xD;
      lessons). The main endpoint is going to be the hydration status with osmolality urine test&#xD;
      (dehydration status≥800 mOsm/kg). The secondary endpoint is going to be the correlation&#xD;
      between the hydration status and cognitive performance (attention, short-term memory and&#xD;
      concentration) through administration of neuropsychological tests from Neuropsychological&#xD;
      Assessment Battery for Adolescence (BVN 12-18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: it is expected an improvement of hydration status in intervention group versus&#xD;
      control group and positive effects of a correct hydration on cognitive performance.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Energy metabolism is higher per kilogram body weight in children than in adults.&#xD;
      1 Children aged from 11 to 14 should consume at least 1.5 liters of water per day, according&#xD;
      to EFSA advice (European Food Safety Authority) 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This amount of daily water is difficult to reach because young people usually do not&#xD;
      recognize thirst and they often haven't got an easy access to water 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific evidence proves that a soft dehydration, as a loss 1 % of body weight, can cause&#xD;
      reduction of concentration and cognitive performance with consequences on memory and&#xD;
      attention in children.4,5&#xD;
&#xD;
      An English systematic study about school policies on drinking water 4 compared three&#xD;
      different contexts: schools in which water in the classroom was prohibited, schools that&#xD;
      allowed limited access to water (for example, the water was allowed in the classroom, but not&#xD;
      on the desk) and schools that had open access to water (for example, water was allowed in the&#xD;
      classroom and bottles were kept at the desk). The results showed that the percentage of&#xD;
      children who consumed less than the recommended daily amount of fluid was significantly&#xD;
      higher in the schools that prohibited water consumption (81%) and in the schools that had&#xD;
      limited access to water during the school day (80%). This percentage was considerably reduced&#xD;
      in the schools where children had free access to water (46.5%). In Italian schools generally&#xD;
      access to water is limited and water consumption is allowed only at lunch 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Study Design and participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this cluster randomized controlled pilot study, organized and managed by IRCCS Policlinico&#xD;
      San Donato researchers, students (both male and female) aged from 12 to 14 will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent to participate in study was obtained from representatives of the school during a&#xD;
      meeting organized before the study. All students and their parents gave informed consent to&#xD;
      participation. The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee (protocol number&#xD;
      159/INT/2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 5-months project involves 214 middle school students (ten classes in total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruited students will be randomized in two groups; both intervention and control group&#xD;
      include five classes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention All pupils from the intervention and control classes will be taken&#xD;
      anthropometric, blood pressure measurements and simple urine samples; a questionnaire related&#xD;
      to dietary and physical activity habits and cognitive tests (to evaluate cognitive&#xD;
      performances in terms of attention, memory and concentration) will be administered; the ten&#xD;
      classes will receive changes in the school environment and individual reinforcement tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in class environment: only in the intervention classes refillable water dispensers&#xD;
      and water consumption poster will be placed; every class will receive 5 bottles (18&#xD;
      Liters/each) per week, for a total of 100 bottles to use from January to May.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in the school environment: educational posters adapted from The Healthy Eating Plate&#xD;
      conveying messages promoting healthy diet, water consumption, and daily exercise will be&#xD;
      posted in school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reinforcement tools: three health and water consumption promoting lessons, held by expert&#xD;
      nutritionists, will be included in the curriculum. Students will be received an easy textbook&#xD;
      developed by our nutritionist team as a support to school lessons and as a tool for involving&#xD;
      parents. A re-usable BPA-Free water bottles to encourage water consumption and a pedometer to&#xD;
      encourage them to be physically active will be supplied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only in intervention classes, automated text messages promoting water consumption will be&#xD;
      sent in the morning to students and their parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES Primary Outcome Measure: hydration status&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measure: correlation and the variation between hydration status and&#xD;
      cognitive performances (attention, memory and concentration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES Urine sample collection and cognitive tests administration will be performed at&#xD;
      the beginning and at the end of one school day on January and on May). Anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements and eating habits and lifestyle questionnaires will be performed before and&#xD;
      after the intervention (on January and May).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osmolality test: hydration status Hydration status will be evaluated through urinary&#xD;
      osmolality test, which indicates the solute concentration to kilograms solvent ratio&#xD;
      (mOsm/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Katz et al.8 a value over 800 mOsm / kg indicates dehydration status, while a&#xD;
      value lower than 800 mOsm / kg indicates normal hydration status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary osmolality test:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is easy to use (it is sufficient a urine sample to carry out the analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is accurate (in terms of sensibility and specificity) and it is a valid hydration&#xD;
           index9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples will be transported at the Clinical Pathology Medicine Laboratory-1 (SMEL-1),&#xD;
      I.R.C.C.S. Policlinico San Donato University Hospital, where they will be stored at 2-8° C&#xD;
      until they will be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive areas evaluation protocol To evaluate the hydration status effects on cognitive&#xD;
      performances several neuropsychological tests from the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery&#xD;
      for Adolescence (BVN 12-18) 10 will be administrated to all students. These allow cognitive&#xD;
      performances measurement on various domains like memory, attention, executive and&#xD;
      visuo-spatial functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests will be administrated by clinical psychologists during an estimated time of about 60&#xD;
      minutes (including explanations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests from BVN are composed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Involved areas: selective and sustained attention. Selective visual attention test&#xD;
           Structure: subjects must search and indicate the same squares as the target. Available&#xD;
           time: 3 minutes. Scoring: sum of correct answers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Involved areas: Attention, logic reasoning, executive functions, calculation domain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reasoning test and arithmetical judgments Structure: first part of mental calculation and&#xD;
      second part of numbering. Available time: 10 minutes. Scoring: sum of correct answers of two&#xD;
      parts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Involved areas: short term verbal memory, working memory Direct and reverse Digit Span&#xD;
           Structure: test is composed of increasing series of numbers; subject must remember the&#xD;
           series Available time: 10 minutes. Scoring: score given by the longest series for both&#xD;
           direct span and reverse span.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Involved areas: language; executive function. Phonetic fluency Structure: the subject&#xD;
           must write on paper the greatest number of words starting with three different letters&#xD;
           Available time: 1 minute for each letter for a total of 3 minutes. Scoring: sum of&#xD;
           written words.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Involved areas: visual perceptive functions. Street test Structure: presentation of&#xD;
           degraded figures; subject must found the original figure and writing it on paper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Available time: 30 second for every image for a total of 7 minutes. Scoring: sum of correct&#xD;
      answers given within 30 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data elaboration and statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covariance analysis will be used to evaluate the variations of hydration status, comparing&#xD;
      intervention group versus control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard error will be calculated trough a strong estimator which considers the study cluster&#xD;
      design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of five-classes, with about 25 students for each class, has been estimated to&#xD;
      evaluate a difference of 0.5 standard deviation of differences in urinary osmolality in both&#xD;
      groups (intervention and control) between morning and afternoon time; it is considered an&#xD;
      intra-classes correlation coefficient of 0.02 and a power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard deviation difference of 0.5 has been evaluated considering Fadda et al. 2012&#xD;
      published on Appetite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of the sample size has been done with &quot;cluster randomized power analysis&quot;&#xD;
      procedure of PASS 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication Policy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this pilot study, researchers are the only owners of all collected data and they will&#xD;
      publish data in an unconditional and integral way.&#xD;
