      Our Specific Aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At the individual level, to compare within-person change in BP and secondary outcomes&#xD;
           between the intervention and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At the family level, to evaluate ENACTS' effects on BP and secondary outcomes as&#xD;
           within-person change in family members who provide primary support, and as mean change&#xD;
           in other adult family members who are not directly engaged in the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At the policy level, to evaluate the intervention's ability to influence grocery store&#xD;
           policy on clearly identifying foods that are low in sodium or high in potassium, some of&#xD;
           which might not be easily identified with existing labels (e.g., fresh produce). ENACTS&#xD;
           combines empirically supported elements of existing programs, thus increasing its&#xD;
           probability of success. It aligns with the American Heart Association's call for&#xD;
           multilevel prevention.&#xD;

      This study adapts an existing educational intervention to address self-management of&#xD;
      hypertension in NHPIs. The multilevel 6-month intervention - &quot;Engaging NHPIs and Activating&#xD;
      Communities to Take Steps&quot; (ENACTS) - will use peer-facilitated, self-care BP education&#xD;
      delivered weekly for 8 weeks emphasizing healthy diet, traditional NHPI foods, adherence to&#xD;
      medication, and encouragement to increase physical activity and stop smoking; with text&#xD;
      messaging to boost adherence. ENACTS will be implemented as a randomized controlled trial at&#xD;
      3 community sites serving NHPIs in the Puget Sound area of Washington. 270 NHPI adults (90&#xD;
      per site) with a self-reported physician diagnosis of hypertension and elevated BP measured&#xD;
      at enrollment will be randomized to either ENACTS or usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is change in systolic BP. Secondary outcomes are food purchasing&#xD;
      behaviors (online ordering, grocery receipts); medication adherence; social support; smoking&#xD;
      cessation; and GIS data on daily energy expenditure. The study will use a Geographic&#xD;
      Information Systems (GIS) mobile phone app to track participants. Outcomes will be measured&#xD;
      at baseline, weekly, at 8 weeks, and at 6 months. The study will also examine change in&#xD;
      household food purchasing patterns, enhanced family support for BP control, and BP&#xD;
      improvement among family members. A subset of intervention participants and family members&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in a program that uses personal photographs for narrative art&#xD;
      projects to promote labeling of healthy foods by local retail outlets.&#xD;
