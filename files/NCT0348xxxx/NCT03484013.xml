      Purpose of the study is the evaluation of the applicability of the percutaneous technique&#xD;
      through double Proglide and Pre-Close Technique to the treatment of complex aortic aneurysms&#xD;
      with thoracic endoprosthesis (TEVAR), fenestrated or branched (F / B-EVAR) in which&#xD;
      patient-related factors, the devices used or the procedure, could affect the performance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endovascular treatment using a percutaneous technique (Percutaneous Endovascular Aneurism&#xD;
      Repair - P-EVAR) has been used with increasing frequency to treat aortic aneurysms by&#xD;
      reducing operative times, postoperative pain and length of stay, compared to treatment by&#xD;
      surgical femoral access. During EVAR procedures, two accesses to the femoral arteries are&#xD;
      required to introduce the necessary tools for the stentgraft implantation. Such accesses can&#xD;
      be classically obtained by surgical incision, isolation of the common femoral arteries and&#xD;
      direct introduction of the devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternatively, the most modern approach involves direct puncture of the artery (without the&#xD;
      need for incision), through the skin and closure of the arterial breach through prolonged&#xD;
      manual compression of the vascular closure or systems (Vascular Closure Devices - VCD)&#xD;
      specifically designed. Among the various closure devices one of the most used and studied is&#xD;
      the Perclose Proglide (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara CA, USA) that allows to affix a&#xD;
      polypropylene stitch to close the arterial breach. When closing high-caliber accesses (&gt; 8&#xD;
      French) it is necessary to use two devices that must be positioned before inserting the&#xD;
      introducer (&quot;Pre-Close Technique&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have so far evaluated the application of this method to the treatment of complex&#xD;
      cases such as thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms that requiring the use of high&#xD;
      caliber introducers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is the evaluation of the technical success and clinical outcomes&#xD;
      of the PEVAR technique with a double vascular suture device Perclose ProGlide (Abbott&#xD;
      Illinois, U.S.A.).Endovascular treatment using a percutaneous technique (Percutaneous&#xD;
      Endovascular Aneurism Repair - P-EVAR) has been used with increasing frequency to treat&#xD;

      to treatment by surgical femoral access. During EVAR procedures, two accesses to the femoral&#xD;

&#xD;
      This is a retrospective observational study (320 cases treated in San Raffaele hospital in&#xD;
      Milan, during the period: October 2015 - 31 December 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chronology of the assessments will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An immediate evaluation at the end of the procedure by performing the ecocolordoppler&#xD;
           examination of the percutaneous accesses performed (as per routine). On the basis of&#xD;
           longitudinal and sagittal scans of the vessel, the Physician must check the presence of&#xD;
           the above complications that could be considered as &quot;failure&quot; of percutaneous access. In&#xD;
           the event that these complications are clinically evident (eg uncontrollable bleeding&#xD;
           from the puncture site), in the interest of a prompt management of the surgical problem,&#xD;
           it will not be necessary to perform an ecocolordoppler examination and the outcome will&#xD;
           be assigned &quot;failure &quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A second echocolordoppler assessment performed on the first postoperative day (as per&#xD;
           routine) The study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles deriving&#xD;
           from the Helsinki Declaration and the current legislation on Observational Studies.&#xD;
