      A commonly used therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that often (but not always)&#xD;
      gives good results is &quot;exposure therapy&quot;: When the patient (for example, Veterans who have&#xD;
      attacks of anxiety when a noise startles them) talks about the trauma that precipitated the&#xD;
      PTSD, she or he slowly becomes less sensitive to PTSD. This works only on some patients. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to expose PTSD patients to a number of &quot;training&quot; sessions in which&#xD;
      they will be in a virtual world (similar to a video game) driving a car through a place&#xD;
      resembling Iraq. This will happen inside an MRI machine, and the investigators will obtain&#xD;
      brain images while the patient is exploring the &quot;virtual Iraq&quot; environment. The investigators&#xD;
      will project on the screen a bar that will let the patient know, in real time, which is the&#xD;
      state of her or his brain, from CALM to STRESS. The job of the patient will be to try to come&#xD;
      up with personal strategies (breathe slowly, think calming thoughts) to try to bring the bar&#xD;
      to CALM. The investigators believe that after a number of sessions, the patient will be able&#xD;
      to create personalized mental strategies to bring their brain to CALM state, even in real&#xD;
      life. This could become a much stronger way of performing &quot;exposure therapy&quot;. Finally, the&#xD;
      investigators will use a wearable device (similar to a wristwatch) to be able to study&#xD;
      physical activity and sleep patters in PTSD patients through the training, in the hope that&#xD;
      the investigators may find a way to objectively study when a patient is doing better.&#xD;

      A Virtual World/Neuro-feedback Real-time Functional MRI Approach to PTSD Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite availability of treatment, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains a major&#xD;
      problem in Veterans, with tremendous impact on patients, their families, and the VHA system.&#xD;
      A major therapeutic approach used for Veterans with PTSD is exposure therapy, which has&#xD;
      beneficial effects in many patients. However, improvements on current therapies are needed as&#xD;
      many Veterans improve less than the investigators would like.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching hypotheses of this proposal are two-fold. First, that brain activity measured&#xD;
      with functional MRI (fMRI) can be used to discern the different brain states of a PTSD&#xD;
      patient during a threatening experience vs. during a calm moment, and that patients, aided by&#xD;
      neuro-feedback derived from real-time fMRI during a virtual reality experience, can learn to&#xD;
      reduce their response by willfully modifying their brain state. Secondly, that the continuous&#xD;
      measurement of physical activity, heart rate, and sleep patterns using wearable devices can&#xD;
      help in the study of PTSD treatment trajectories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will combine virtual worlds, machine learning, real-time fMRI, and&#xD;
      neuro-feedback to provide a novel PTSD treatment that the investigators hope will be more&#xD;
      effective than current alternatives, at least in certain challenging cases. Importantly, the&#xD;
      investigators will construct a computational model that is specific for patient+stimulus&#xD;
      combination. This is critical as PTSD patients are very heterogeneous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Use of Virtual World/Neurofeedback with Real-Time fMRI as therapy for PTSD Fifteen&#xD;
      PTSD patients recruited at MEDVAMC will be exposed to Virtual Iraq, a virtual world platform&#xD;
      in which they will be exposed to war-like scenarios, and to calm scenes where no threat will&#xD;
      be present. Brain activity will be collected using fMRI and analyzed with machine learning to&#xD;
      discern between both extreme brain states (STRESS vs. CALM). These two states will be used&#xD;
      during neurofeedback training: In the following weeks, participants will be exposed to 7&#xD;
      fMRI/Virtual World sessions in which they will be instructed to try to move a gauge to the&#xD;
      CALM side by using individual mental strategies (active like concentrating on a particular&#xD;
      memory, or passive as it has been shown that neurofeedback does not necessarily need willful&#xD;
      effort to work). The stressfulness of the Virtual World will be manipulated by the gauge:&#xD;
      when the patient is able to move the bar toward CALM (by bringing the brain toward that&#xD;
      state) the stressfulness of the Virtual World will decrease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: PTSD symptoms will decrease as training progresses and patients learn mental&#xD;
      strategies to &quot;bring the world&quot; to a CALM state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Study of wearable technology to assess treatment success in PTSD While there are PTSD&#xD;
      measuring tools and the investigators will use them before, during, and after training, in&#xD;
      general self-reports are not as robust and reliable as one would like. Thus, it would be&#xD;
      beneficial to have more physiological measures of treatment progression for PTSD, and for&#xD;
      psychiatry in general. The investigators will use a wearable device similar to a wristwatch&#xD;
      that the participant will continuously wear throughout the training, and will allow the&#xD;
      investigators to measure physical activity, heart rate, and sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Data from the wearable device will correlate with self reports and with&#xD;
      increased ability to willfully bring the Virtual World to the CALM state during training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, the investigators propose that neurofeedback will give PTSD patients the&#xD;
      possibility of discovering personal mental strategies to become calmer during stressful&#xD;
      situations. However, the learning process does not need to be the result of willful effort,&#xD;
      as it has been shown that real time fMRI-related learning can occur without conscious effort&#xD;
      or awareness. In addition, the investigators postulate that wearable devices will capture&#xD;
      physiological data linked to the trajectories during PTSD treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators understand that unfortunately the approach may be too expensive to be&#xD;
      routinely used (a careful post-study cost-benefit study may prove otherwise, though).&#xD;
      However, the investigators hypothesize that if this pilot is successful, it will be possible&#xD;
      to use this data to develop less expensive hybrid alternatives to add to exposure therapy,&#xD;
      such as using fMRI in combination with EEG to discern between brain states (only one MRI&#xD;
      visit needed), and then using only EEG during training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Studies The research in this proposal will build upon the investigators' 4-year&#xD;
      research project at UT Austin funded by the Army Research Office. That work greatly extended&#xD;
      the utility of 3D Virtual Worlds for use as stimuli for fMRI-based research, and laid the&#xD;
      groundwork for individualized therapies and training. It will play a central role in&#xD;
      providing neuro-feedback by analyzing brain activity of patients in response to virtual&#xD;
      worlds designed to elicit PTSD responses, such as those provided by BRAVEMIND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      fMRI data acquisition samples a volume of brain activity every 2-3 seconds for several&#xD;
      minutes as needed. Each sample is a 3D array of voxels that measure the aggregate brain&#xD;
      activity for a few million neurons. Conventional fMRI data analysis treats the values from&#xD;
      each voxel as separate time series, and performs a linear statistical analysis that relates&#xD;
      the stimulus to the measured activity. To deal with the increased complexity of using&#xD;
      real-time virtual worlds as a stimulus, the investigators instead used machine learning for&#xD;
      analysis. Machine learning based methods can extract complex correlations over many voxels&#xD;
      rather than a single voxel. The method involves &quot;training&quot; by feeding example input/output&#xD;
      pairs into the algorithm. In the investigators' case, the input is an fMRI time sample and&#xD;
      the output, reflecting the stimulus, is a category in which the investigators are interested.&#xD;
      The investigators refer to each category as a &quot;brain state&quot;, which is the brain activation&#xD;
      pattern specified by labeling each time slice with a particular stimulus category.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators were able to achieve accurate performance for detecting brain states in two&#xD;
      different experiments. Both used virtual worlds suggestive of Iraqi towns and virtual&#xD;
      characters of U.S. Army and native hostile combatants. In the first experiment, the&#xD;
      investigators used a passive viewing paradigm in which 1-6 combatants were presented at&#xD;
      different locations in a virtual town. Performance averaged across subjects was quite good&#xD;
      and far above chance in terms of determining how many combatants (1-6) was the participant&#xD;
      seeing at each time. The second experiment used a similar but more complex stimulus that&#xD;
      included a specific visual task requiring user reaction. Subjects were asked to rapidly&#xD;
      respond via a button press to a weapon being pulled out suddenly by a single hostile&#xD;
      combatant within a crowd of 20 characters, half of which were friendly forces. Task&#xD;
      difficulty was varied randomly over encounters that lasted 30 sec each. The investigators'&#xD;
      machine-learning methods could recognize this brain state dimension with 70%-90% accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods Aim 1. Use of Virtual World/Neurofeedback with Real-Time fMRI as&#xD;
      therapy for PTSD The investigators will combine virtual worlds, real-time fMRI, machine&#xD;
      learning, and neuro-feedback, to provide a novel PTSD treatment that the investigators hope&#xD;
      will be more effective than current alternatives. The investigators also anticipate that by&#xD;
      examining the brain maps like those above the investigators will gain insight into how PTSD&#xD;
      manifests in the brains of different subjects. The stereo audio/visual stimulus will be&#xD;
      provided by the BRAVEMIND system. Prior to scanning, each subject will participate in a&#xD;
      side-lab therapy session attended by a trained therapist. The investigators will adjust&#xD;
      stimulus parameters to provide an appropriately therapeutic range of responses between CALM&#xD;
      and STRESSED. Various scenes/scenarios will be available. This range of parameter settings&#xD;
      will be captured for subsequent scanning sessions. In the scanner, the virtual-reality&#xD;
      stimuli will be delivered using an MR-compatible 3D display. Subjects will provide&#xD;
      self-report their level of &quot;STRESSED&quot; anxiety using a five-button MR-compatible response&#xD;
      device. This response data and the MRI data from the first two sessions will be used by&#xD;
      machine-learning algorithms to build classifiers that can discriminate the subject's&#xD;
      responses between CALM - STRESSED at every 1.5 sec time sample. In the following 6 sessions,&#xD;
      the subject will be presented with similar but not identical stimuli while receiving feedback&#xD;
      from the machine learning. This will enable them to gradually learn how to self-modulate&#xD;
      their own brain response toward a calmer reaction. Such self-induced changes will be detected&#xD;
      by the fMRI system and will be used to modulate the virtual world to directly reduce the&#xD;
      degree of perceived threat; thus, providing the real-time neuro-feedback required by&#xD;
      extinction therapy (a &quot;thermometer&quot; will be displayed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole-brain FMRI data will be collected using a 3T Siemens Prisma scanner using SMS&#xD;
      acceleration to obtain 2-mm voxel size and TR = 1.5 sec (SMS x3, G = 2, TE = 30 ms, FA = 72&#xD;
      ). Scanning sessions will last ~1 hour, and begin with the collection of localizers and a&#xD;
      high-resolution anatomy (MP-RAGE), 1-mm cubic voxels, followed by the collection of fMRI data&#xD;
      during virtual-reality stimulus presentation. Each fMRI run will last ~6 min, and 6-8 runs&#xD;
      will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pitfalls and alternative strategies. The investigators have demonstrated the ability to&#xD;
      classify an internal brain dimension with 89% accuracy, but it may not be possible to obtain&#xD;
      similar accuracy for the &quot;PTSD&quot; dimension. It may be possible to improve results by including&#xD;
      the observed pulse and respiration data as input into the machine learning. Moreover, even if&#xD;
      the feedback is unsuccessful, the investigators will still gain insights into the physiology&#xD;
      of PTSD from the sensitivity maps that are generated by the machine learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Study of wearable technology to assess treatment success in PTSD Physical activity,&#xD;
      heart rate, and sleep patterns all play important roles in PTSD. Wearable technology has&#xD;
      recently evolved such that the investigators can now constantly measure these three&#xD;
      parameters in a non-invasive manner throughout the course of a study. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to study self-reported symptoms in conjunction with physical activity, sleep&#xD;
      patterns, and heart rate date over 9 weeks. The investigators will use linear regression to&#xD;
      study whether CAPS5, PCL, and diary symptoms correlate with activity, sleep, and heart rate&#xD;
      patterns during treatment. The investigators hypothesize that in patients in which the&#xD;
      treatment is most successful, a) Average HR will decrease more, b) Bouts of high HR during&#xD;
      day and night will be less common, c) Average physical activity will increase, d) Physical&#xD;
      activity will regularize to more activity during the day and less activity during the night,&#xD;
      e) Average time asleep will increase, and f) Sleep patterns will regularize with less awake&#xD;
      epochs during the night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pitfalls and alternative strategies. It is possible that the data from wearable devices will&#xD;
      not correlate with symptom improvement. A likely explanation would be that the error rate of&#xD;
      current devices does not allow for correlations to be significant. If that is the case, this&#xD;
      approach should be tested again in the future. Another less likely explanation would be that&#xD;
      physical activity, heart rate, and sleep quality are not as strongly correlated with PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms as the available data suggests. Since this is a small pilot study, data suggesting a&#xD;
      trend would point into possible directions to study in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General conclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main idea of the study is that the VR will change to a less stressful environment as the&#xD;
      brain approaches the state previously defined as CALM. The investigators postulate that over&#xD;
      time, patients will learn to consciously bring their brain to CALM state, which will provide&#xD;
      them with individualized mental strategies to calm down when a trauma/stress trigger is&#xD;
      present.&#xD;

    <description>Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5)&#xD;
The CAPS is the gold standard in PTSD assessment. The CAPS-5 is a 30-item structured interview that can be used to:&#xD;
Make current (past month) diagnosis of PTSD Make lifetime diagnosis of PTSD Assess PTSD symptoms over the past week&#xD;
In addition to assessing the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, questions target the onset and duration of symptoms, subjective distress, impact of symptoms on social and occupational functioning, improvement in symptoms since a previous CAPS administration, overall response validity, overall PTSD severity, and specifications for the dissociative subtype (depersonalization and derealization).&#xD;
The CAPS was designed to be administered by clinicians and clinical researchers who have a working knowledge of PTSD, but can also be administered by appropriately trained paraprofessionals. The full interview takes 45-60 minutes to administer.</description>
