  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the study drug ceftolozane-tazobactam&#xD;
      is more effective in controlling febrile neutropenia (fever and low white blood cell counts)&#xD;
      than using approved antibiotics in patients with cancer. The safety of ceftolozane-tazobactam&#xD;
      will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Ceftolozane-tazobactam is FDA approved and commercially&#xD;
      available to treat certain types of infections. It is not approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      febrile neutropenia, either by itself or in combination with other antibiotics. Its use to&#xD;
      treat febrile neutropenia is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All other antibiotics given on this study are FDA approved and commercially available for the&#xD;
      treatment of infections. However, only cefepime is specifically FDA approved to treat febrile&#xD;
      neutropenia. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 100 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Groups and Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study and participant agrees,&#xD;
      participant will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to either receive either the&#xD;
      study drug (Group 1) or a standard treatment antibiotic (Group 2). This is done because no&#xD;
      one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. Both&#xD;
      participant and the study doctor will know what participant is receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is in Group 1, participant will receive ceftolozane-tazobactam by vein over 1&#xD;
      hour every 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is in Group 2, participant will receive a standard treatment antibiotic. This&#xD;
      may include one of the following 3 options:&#xD;
&#xD;
      cefepime by vein over about 30 minutes every 8 hours. meropenem by vein over about 30 minutes&#xD;
      every 8 hours. piperacillin/tazobactam by vein over about 1 hour every 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will receive the study drugs by vein for at least 3 days. After 3 days, if the&#xD;
      study doctor thinks it is in participant's best interest and participant is eligible,&#xD;
      participant may switch to receiving a different antibiotic either by mouth or by vein. The&#xD;
      study doctor will tell participant more about what antibiotic participant may begin to&#xD;
      receive, how it is administered, and its possible risks. If participant begins taking the&#xD;
      study drugs by mouth, the study doctor or study staff will tell participant how and when to&#xD;
      take each drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will be given additional standard drugs to&#xD;
      help control the infection. Participant may ask the study staff for information about how the&#xD;
      drugs are given and their risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant may receive the study drugs for up to 14 days. Participant will no longer be able&#xD;
      to receive the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, if&#xD;
      participant needs treatment that is not allowed on this study, or if participant is unable to&#xD;
      follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation on this study will be over after the late follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will have the following tests/procedures while participant is in the hospital. If&#xD;
      participant begins to take the study drugs by mouth, participant will no longer have these&#xD;
      study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each day for up to 2 weeks, if the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 tablespoon) or&#xD;
      urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 2 days for up to 2 weeks, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to check for&#xD;
      infection. Participant will stop having these blood draws when there is no longer a sign of&#xD;
      infection and participant does not have a fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twice each week for up to 2 weeks, participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 72 hours (3 days) after participant's last dose of participant's assigned study&#xD;
      treatment and before starting the second antibiotic therapy (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will have a physical exam. Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected&#xD;
      for routine tests. If participant tested positive for infection at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to check for infection. The study doctor will&#xD;
      tell participant if participant will have this blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 21-28 days (3-4 weeks) after participant's first dose of study drug, participant will&#xD;
      return to MD Anderson for the following tests/procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will have a physical exam. If participant tested positive for infection at the&#xD;
      beginning of the study, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to check for infection. The&#xD;
      study doctor will tell participant if participant will have this blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for a pregnancy&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 35-42 days (5-6 weeks) after participant's first dose of study drug, a member of the&#xD;
      study staff will call participant to ask about any new drugs participant may have started and&#xD;
      if participant is having any side effects. If participant is called, it should last about 10&#xD;
      minutes. If the doctor or study staff thinks it is needed, participant will be asked to come&#xD;
      back to the clinic for the following tests/procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will have a physical exam. If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1&#xD;
      tablespoon) will be drawn to check for infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At any of these follow-up visits, if participant's doctor thinks it is needed, participant&#xD;
      will have a chest x-ray or CT scan to check participant's lungs.&#xD;
