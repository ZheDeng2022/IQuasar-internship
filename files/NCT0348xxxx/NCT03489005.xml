  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to evaluate the effect of single therapeutic (400 mg) and supratherapeutic&#xD;
      (1200 mg) doses of BIA 5-1058 on the time-matched change from baseline in placebo-adjusted&#xD;
      interval corrected (QT) for heart rate (HR)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and open-label, active&#xD;
      controlled, 4 period, crossover study in healthy male and female subjects under fed&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be double blinded for BIA 5-1058 and placebo and open label for moxifloxacin.&#xD;
      The central ECG laboratory and ECG readers will be blinded to study treatment sequence,&#xD;
      timepoint, and subject. All subjects will receive each of the following 4 treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  400 mg BIA 5 1058&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1200 mg BIA 5 1058&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  400 mg moxifloxacin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study between 28&#xD;
      and 3 days prior to the first treatment administration. For each treatment period, subjects&#xD;
      will be admitted into the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) on Day 2 and be confined to the CRU&#xD;
      until Discharge on Day 4. Each subject will receive a single dose of study medication on Day&#xD;
      1 of each treatment period. There will be a washout of at least 10 days between doses, and&#xD;
      subjects will return to the CRU for a Follow-up visit 14 ± 2 days after Period 4 Discharge.&#xD;
      The total duration of study participation for each subject from Screening through Follow-up&#xD;
      visit) is anticipated to be approximately 80 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The start of the study is defined as the date the first enrolled subject signs an Informed&#xD;
      Consent Form (ICF). The point of enrollment occurs at the time of subject number allocation.&#xD;
      The end of the study is defined as the date of the last subject's last assessment (scheduled&#xD;
      or unscheduled).&#xD;
