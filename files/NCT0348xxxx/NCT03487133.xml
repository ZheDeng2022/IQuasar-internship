    <textblock>
      In a Phase II study in patients with previous T-cell lymphoma, bortezomib was administered at&#xD;
      a dose of 1.6 mg / m 2 on Day 1 and Day 8, and combined with CHOP (cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) chemotherapy . The 1.6 mg / m2 dose of bortezomib&#xD;
      was obtained through phase 1 studies, and the Phase II study included five patients with skin&#xD;
      T-cell lymphoma, with an overall response rate of 87%. In addition, there was no significant&#xD;
      increase in toxicity when bortezomib was administered at 1.6 mg / m2 every week. The fact&#xD;
      that there was no increase in toxicity in combination with a drug commonly used to induce&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy, such as vincristine, / m2 suggests the safety of the dosage at 1 week&#xD;
      intervals.Therefore, in order to improve the convenience of administration with once-weekly&#xD;
      dosing, this study combined 1.6 mg / m2 every week for 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks in a&#xD;
      4-week cycle, The dose was determined by a single dose.In addition, it is known that the main&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity of subcutaneous injection is significantly reduced in peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy, so the route of administration was determined to be via subcutaneous&#xD;
      administration (18).Considering that one of the major difficulties in remediation of skin&#xD;
      T-cell lymphoma is the short duration of the response after termination of treatment, the&#xD;
      subjects who were considered to have a response to the test drug, that is, those who acquired&#xD;
      a stable lesion response after 8 cycles of induction therapy The test was designed so that&#xD;
      maintenance therapy can be performed up to one year.Even with one year of maintenance&#xD;
      therapy, there is no safety concern since the cumulative dose of the test drug is not higher&#xD;
      than the cumulative dose currently used as the primary treatment for multiple myeloma.&#xD;
