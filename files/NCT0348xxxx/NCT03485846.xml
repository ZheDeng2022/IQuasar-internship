    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm that combination of Narlaprevir, Ritonavir and&#xD;
      Daclatasvir is safe and highly effective regimen in treatment-naїve patients with chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis C (HCV) genotype 1b infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate effectiveness and safety of treatment with Narlaprevir, Ritonavir and Daclatasvir&#xD;
      combination will be selected 105 treatment-naїve patients with chronic HCV genotype 1b&#xD;
      without genetic variants coding for the NS5A-Y93 С/H/N/S and/or L31 F/M/V/I amino acid&#xD;
      substitutions, eligible as per protocol criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will participate in the trial approximately up to 38 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 weeks are expected for screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  up to 12 weeks for treatment period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24 weeks for follow-up period&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment period all patient will receive equal drug combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy and safety parameters will be assessed as per primary and secondary endpoints. Also&#xD;
      Ctrough for Narlaprevir and Daclatasvir on day 14 will be evaluated as pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will provide new information about treatment of patients with&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 with Narlaprevir/Ritonavir in combination with Daclatasvir&#xD;
      during 12 weeks.&#xD;
