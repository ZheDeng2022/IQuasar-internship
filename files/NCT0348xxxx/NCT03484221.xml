  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of totally neoadjuvant FOLFOXIRI chemotherapy&#xD;
      (irinotecan, oxaliplatin and fluorouracil) followed by short-course radiation therapy and&#xD;
      XELOX chemotherapy in the patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy with double cytotoxic agents is the standard treatment for&#xD;
      the patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Conventional treatment reduced the local&#xD;
      recurrence but did not prolong the long-term survival. Furthermore, the patients with&#xD;
      pathological complete response (pCR) did not benefit from double cytotoxic chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Therefore, we chose triple cytotoxic agents FOLFOXIRI as the neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We&#xD;
      will evaluate the efficacy and safety of totally neoadjuvant FOLFOXIRI chemotherapy&#xD;
      (irinotecan, oxaliplatin and fluorouracil) followed by short-course radiation and XELOX&#xD;
      chemotherapy in the patients with locally advanced rectal cancer to achieve more pCR and&#xD;
      longer survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective study, 30 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer will be recruited.&#xD;
      Firstly, 4 cycles of neoadjuvant FOLFOXIRI chemotherapy were administered. Subsequently, a&#xD;
      short-course radiation therapy (5Gy*5) will be performed. After that, 4 cycles of XELOX&#xD;
      chemotherapy will be administered followed by TME surgery. PET-CT examination will be&#xD;
      performed before and after the 4 cycles of neoadjuvant FOLFOXIRI chemotherapy to assess the&#xD;
      SUVmax changes. In addition, the dynamic changes of ctDNA in peripheral blood will be&#xD;
      monitored at the PET-CT examination. In the course of treatment, safety evaluation will be&#xD;
      carried out according to the standard of adverse reaction classification (CTCAE) 4.0.&#xD;
