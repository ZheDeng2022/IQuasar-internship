  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of 4 g Swisse High Strength Deep Sea Krill Oil (Superba BOOST)&#xD;
      daily on pain reduction in adults with mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the knee compared&#xD;
      to placebo over a 6 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-arm study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applicants will be eligible to participate if they have mild to moderate OA of the knee.&#xD;
      Diagnosis of OA of the knee will be made according to clinical diagnosis, using the American&#xD;
      College of Rheumatology (ACR) Criteria for the classification of Idiopathic OA of the Knee&#xD;
      and the Kellgren-Lawrence grading scale. In addition, eligible applicants will have been&#xD;
      experiencing knee pain on at least 4 days per week, for at least 3 months and they will&#xD;
      report knee pain between 4 and 8 cm (inclusive) on a visual analogue scale (VAS) for the 7&#xD;
      days prior to Day 1 of the trial (Baseline). Severity of OA of the knee will be assessed&#xD;
      based on X-ray performed at the Screening Visit using the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) radiographic&#xD;
      criteria, and participants with severe radiographic knee OA (KL joint space narrowing (JSN)&#xD;
      above grade 3) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applicants will attend a screening visit following pre-screening assessments to assess their&#xD;
      general health and eligibility for inclusion into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 eligible participants will be randomly allocated to receive one of two study&#xD;
      treatments. Participants will take the assigned treatments daily for six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return to the clinic at 3 months and 6 months for study assessments.&#xD;
      Participants will complete an online survey at 1, 2, 4 and 5 months to assess protocol&#xD;
      compliance, adverse events and use of concomitant medications. Any queries from the survey&#xD;
      will be followed up by phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A final participant online survey and phone call (if needed) will be conducted 28 days after&#xD;
      the 6 month visit for a final safety assessment.&#xD;

    <measure>The primary outcome is the change in The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), Pain subscale (Numeric Rating Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>from Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC scale is widely used in the evaluation of Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis. It is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 24 items divided into 3 subscales:&#xD;
Pain (5 items); Stiffness (2 items); Physical Function (17 items):&#xD;
Questionnaire scores on a scale of 0-4, None (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2), Severe (3), and Extreme (4).&#xD;
The primary outcome related to the Pain subscale and will therefore be scored between 0 and 20.</description>

Questionnaire scores on a scale of 0-4, None (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2), Severe (3), and Extreme (4).&#xD;
This outcome is measured on the stiffness subscale and will be therefore scored from 0 to 8.</description>

    <description>Krill oil is sourced sustainably from the Southern Ocean and is extracted from the Antarctic Krill, the most abundant marine biomass. Krill oil is a source of omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for the maintenance of good health. Omega-3, EPA and DHA are also found in phospholipid form which are much easier absorbed than triglyceride form of omega-3 which is found in fish oil. Omega-3 supports cardiovascular health, brain health and eye health. Preliminary research suggests krill oil can provide temporary relief from symptoms of mild arthritis, help reduce joint inflammation and increase joint mobility.</description>
