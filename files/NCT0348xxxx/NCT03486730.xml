  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is looking at a drug called BT1718 in adult patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumours. The main aim of the study is to find the maximum dose of BT1718 that can be given&#xD;
      safely to patients; learn more about the potential side effects of BT1718 and how they can be&#xD;
      treated and also what happens to BT1718 inside the body.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BT1718 is a type of drug called a 'bicycle drug conjugate' which is designed to target and&#xD;
      inhibit the function of the protein 'membrane type 1 metalloproteinase' (MT1-MMP). MT1-MMP is&#xD;
      involved in breaking down the proteins that usually surround a cell; however in cancer cells&#xD;
      it can allow a cancer to grow and spread. MT1-MMP is usually found at a low level in normal&#xD;
      cells, but can reach higher levels in cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BT1718 has been designed to recognise and attach itself to the MT1-MMP protein. Once attached&#xD;
      a segment of BT1718 is taken into the cancer cell which causes it to die (DM1 toxin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a first in human clinical study which has two phases. A 'dose escalation' phase where&#xD;
      groups of patients will receive increasing doses of BT1718 to find a safe dose that best&#xD;
      targets the cancer cells. In this phase it is expected that approximately 50-60 patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumours will be entered in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An 'expansion phase' where larger groups of patients will receive the selected dose of BT1718&#xD;
      to allow us to find out more about how the drug is working.In this phase at the optimal&#xD;
      dose/schedule(s), patients will be enrolled with tumour types known to commonly overexpress&#xD;
      MT1-MMP and where MT1-MMP overexpression is confirmed during prospective selection at&#xD;
      enrolment (i.e. squamous non-small cell lung cancer). It is expected that up to an additional&#xD;
      70 patients will be required to complete this phase.&#xD;

    <description>Dose escalation will consist of Stage 1 and 2. Stage 1 patients will receive BT1718 intravenously twice a week (D: 1,4,8,11,15,18) for 3 out of 4 weeks. Starting dose will be 0.6mg/m2. Single patient cohorts will be explored, but it will change to 3 to 6 patients cohorts. Stage 2 patients will receive BT1718 intravenously once a week (D: 1,8,15) for 3 out of 4 weeks. This stage will have 3 to 6 patient cohorts until the recommended dose is established. The expansion phase will consist of two or more expansion cohorts to include tumour types known to commonly over-express MT1-MMP and where MT1-MMP overexpression is confirmed during prospective selection at enrolment. A squamous NSCLC and basket cohort will include approximately 16 patients each with high MT1-MMP levels. In the expansion cohorts BT1718 will be administered intravenously at the once weekly RP2D established in Phase I, Stage 2.</description>

             before enrolment and agree to use two forms of contraception (one effective form plus&#xD;
             a barrier method) [oral, injected or implanted hormonal contraception and condom;&#xD;
             intra-uterine device and condom; diaphragm with spermicidal gel and condom] or agree&#xD;
             to sexual abstinence, effective from the first administration of BT1718, throughout&#xD;
             the trial and for six months afterwards are considered eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Male patients with partners of child-bearing potential (unless they agree to take&#xD;
             measures not to father children by using a barrier method of contraception [condom&#xD;
             plus spermicide] or to sexual abstinence effective from the first administration of&#xD;
             BT1718, throughout the trial and for six months afterwards. Men with partners of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential must also be willing to ensure that their partner uses an&#xD;
             effective method of contraception for the same duration for example, hormonal&#xD;
             contraception, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicidal gel or sexual&#xD;
             abstinence). Men with pregnant or lactating partners must be advised to use barrier&#xD;
             method contraception (for example, condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent exposure of&#xD;
             the foetus or neonate.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  more)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Presence of symptomatic or severe valvular heart disease (severe by local&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. History of a clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia up to six months prior to&#xD;
                  trial entry (asymptomatic atrial fibrillation or asymptomatic first-degree heart&#xD;

             administration of an IMP and which would not place an unacceptable burden on the&#xD;
             patient in the opinion of the Investigator and Medical Advisor would be acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a&#xD;
             good candidate for the clinical trial.&#xD;
