  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In our daily clinical practice, one of the most frequent reasons for consultation&#xD;
      physiotherapists is low back pain. Regardless of the origin of the problem, the approach from&#xD;
      physiotherapy contemplates the reduction of pain through different procedures, among which&#xD;
      all those included in electrotherapy stand out, as commented by McKenzie et al. The use of&#xD;
      electric currents for therapeutic purposes is widespread and studied in the field of&#xD;
      physiotherapy. However, the use of medium frequency currents, and more specifically&#xD;
      interferential currents, provides participants with a series of important advantages, both&#xD;
      for the patient and for the therapist.The study of low back pain in relation to treatment&#xD;
      with interferential currents has a series of obstacles, among which the quantification of&#xD;
      such pain and the establishment of the different parameters of the therapeutic procedure&#xD;
      stand out. The first problem the investigators face are to objectify something that, in&#xD;
      itself, is completely subjective: pain. In addition, pain measurement is our only guide to&#xD;
      follow the evolution of the patient who suffers it. Another important problem, as discussed&#xD;
      by Ward and Lucas-Toumbourou, has to do with the controversy between the different studies&#xD;
      related to the treatment of low back pain with interferential currents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all the above, the approach to low back pain is complex and affects the social, labor and&#xD;
      economic scale of the individual and society. Low back pain is the main cause of public&#xD;
      spending for welfare and work concepts. It suffers at some point in life up to 80% of the&#xD;
      general population and each year generates a cost equivalent to approximately between 1.7 and&#xD;
      2.1% of its gross domestic product in a European countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a lack of valid scientific studies on some aspects of the clinical management of low&#xD;
      back pain and the usual clinical practice does not seem to be based strictly on the results&#xD;
      of the researches carried out. The available data suggest that there are abuses of procedures&#xD;
      whose benefits and risks are uncertain, while others that have proven to be more effective,&#xD;
      safe, effective and / or efficient are underutilized. For this reason, clinical practice&#xD;
      guidelines for non-specific low back pain have been developed in several countries in recent&#xD;
      years. Since the first clinical practice guidelines developed in America and the United&#xD;
      Kingdom (Quebec Task Force in 1987. In 1994, more than 30 guides who claim to be based on&#xD;
      scientific evidence have been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroanalgesia is a set of procedures consisting of the application of an electric current&#xD;
      through electrodes placed on the skin of the patient in order to stimulate myelinated nerve&#xD;
      fibers, fast driving. This activation triggers, at the central level, the implementation of&#xD;
      descending analgesic systems of an inhibitory nature on nociceptive transmission, transported&#xD;
      by small-caliber unmyelinated fibers. In this way, a reduction in pain is obtained. In other&#xD;
      words, it is a question of carrying out a &quot;differential&quot; sensory stimulation,&#xD;
      transcutaneously, of the tactile proprioceptive fibers, with a high speed of conduction, with&#xD;
      the minimum response of the nociceptive fibers, of slow conduction, and of the efferent motor&#xD;
      fibers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of medium frequency interferential currents (4,000 Hz), in addition to&#xD;
      reducing the pain caused by the stimulation of thick nerve fibers, produces the normalization&#xD;
      of the neurovegetative balance. According to De Domenico, this means a cushioning of the&#xD;
      orthosympathetic system, which is reflected in muscle relaxation and improved circulation,&#xD;
      which also helps to reduce pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But the clinical impact of interferential currents on non-specific chronic low back pain&#xD;
      remains poorly studied. Thus, clinical trials show some controversy and support its efficacy&#xD;
      in combination with other treatments. A systematic review found that the interferential&#xD;
      current demonstrates advantages over placebo and without treatment when associated with&#xD;
      exercises and massages. In contrast, the European clinical practice guideline for the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic low back pain concluded that there was no evidence of its effectiveness&#xD;
      compared to sham intervention or placebo. However, recent studies of a randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial with interferential currents on patients with nonspecific chronic low back pain report&#xD;
      very favorable results in terms of the reduction of perceived pain and functional disability.&#xD;
