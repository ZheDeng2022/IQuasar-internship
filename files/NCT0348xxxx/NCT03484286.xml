  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel tool for self-care enhancement for heart failure (HF) patients has been developed. In&#xD;
      this randomized controlled trial, patients will be randomized 1:1 to either receive the&#xD;
      home-based tool (OPTILOGG) or standard care. The intervention will go on for 8 months, and&#xD;
      outcomes are self-care, cardiovascular events (including emergency visits, admissions, number&#xD;
      of in-hospital days).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be recruited using continuous sampling, and will be approached either in&#xD;
      connection with being discharged after a heart failure (HF) related event or upon visiting an&#xD;
      out-patient HF clinic if the patient has been admitted for HF at least once the last year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After written consent has been given, demographical data will be noted, and the patient will&#xD;
      complete forms: the European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour scale 9-item questionnaire&#xD;
      (EHFScB-9) and self-assessment of symtoms (NYHAclass). Expected time for this is 20 minutes.&#xD;
      The baseline demographical data will include age, gender, ejection-fraction, New York Heart&#xD;
      Association (NYHA)-class, blood pressure, heart rate, HF aetiology, and other routine tests&#xD;
      for HF visits as outlined in the European guidelines for HF treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patient has filled out the forms, the patient will be randomized to the control&#xD;
      group (CG) meaning standard care, or the intervention group (IG). Patients allocated to the&#xD;
      IG will be equipped with the home based self-care enhancement tool OPTILOGG. OPTILOGG assists&#xD;
      the patient with symptom monitoring and flexible diuretics regimen, as well as education&#xD;
      about living with HF. It consists of a specialized tablet computer wirelessly connected to a&#xD;
      weight scale. OPTILOGG is CE-marked. The intervention will be deployed for eight months.&#xD;
      After the eight months, the patients will be called to a follow-up visit. During the visit&#xD;
      all data that was collected at baseline/recruitment will be collected again. All&#xD;
      cardiovascular events for each patient will be retrieved, for the eight months during which&#xD;
      the intervention was deployed, but also for the following 12 months. These events include&#xD;
      hospital admissions, ER-visits and number of in-hospital days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based off of previous findings in the literature, target for enrollment was set at 70 + 70&#xD;
      patients, to achieve statistical significance with 80% power.&#xD;

    <description>Registered using the European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour Scale (EHFScB), a validated instrument for measuring heart failure (HF) self-care behaviour. The questionnaire is made up of 9 items, where the respondent can choose between 5 different answers to each of the 9 statements. Each item thus generates a score between 1 and 5. The total score for the instrument is between 9 and 45, with 9 constituting the best, or most desireable self-care behaviour and 45 the worst.&#xD;
Data will be analyzed on a group level using Mann-Whitney-U test for independent samples.</description>

    <description>OPTILOGG is a CE marked class 1m medical device. It consists of a tablet computer and a wirelessly connected weight scale. The system will have some patient specific information regarding the flexible (loop-) diuretics scheme.&#xD;
The patient will be asked to step on the weight scale daily, and will be shown to some brief information on how to live better with HF, as well as the recommended dose of diuretics that specific day. Every five days the patient will answer three questions about his/her symptoms, namely shortness of breath, fatigue and peripheral edema. The system also contains information that the patient can study at his/her leisure. If the system detects a deterioration in HF status, the patient is encouraged to contact his/her health care provider via telephone.</description>
