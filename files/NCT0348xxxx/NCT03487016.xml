      The overarching hypothesis of this trial is that the NAPOLI regimen and alternating cycles of&#xD;
      NAPOLI and mFOLFOX6 (seq-NAPOLI-FOLFOX) are superior to the current standard of care&#xD;
      gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel. Furthermore, we propose that the NAPOLI regimen and&#xD;
      seq-NAPOLI-FOLFOX display favourable safety profiles and allow for longer first line&#xD;
      treatment and higher rate of transition into the second line setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains an almost uniformly lethal disease. Although&#xD;
      there has been significant progress in understanding of the underlying molecular biology of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer, this progress has not translated into substantially better outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alarmingly, the number of pancreatic cancer cases is constantly rising and pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      will be the second most frequent cause of cancer related death by 2030.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, novel therapeutic strategies for patients with pancreatic cancer are desperately&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel proofed to be superior when&#xD;
      compared to single agent gemcitabine (overall survival [OS] 8.7 months in the&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine group versus 6.6 months in the gemcitabine group; hazard ratio for&#xD;
      death, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62 to 0.83; P&lt;0.001). Consequently, this&#xD;
      combination therapy is now regarded as a standard treatment option for patients with&#xD;
      metastatic pancreatic cancer and should therefore serve as control for future clinical&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), irinotecan and oxaliplatin&#xD;
      (FOLFIRINOX) was found to be more effective in the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      when compared to gemcitabine monotherapy (overall survival 11.1 month in the FOLFIRINOX group&#xD;
      versus 6.8 months in the gemcitabine group - hazard ratio for death, 0.57; 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval [CI], 0.45 to 0.73; P&lt;0.001). However, this increased activity came at the cost of&#xD;
      higher treatment-related side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the NAPOLI-1 trial yielded promising results for the combination of liposomal&#xD;
      irinotecan (nal-Iri) in combination with 5-FU/folinic acid (FA) in patients pretreated with a&#xD;
      gemcitabine-based first-line regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, Phase II data show promising efficacy and favorable toxicity with conventional&#xD;
      FOLFIRI.3 in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, studies in colorectal cancer demonstrated a comparable efficacy and favorable&#xD;
      toxicity when comparing conventional FOLFOXIRI (+ bevacizumab) and sequential FOLFOXIRI&#xD;
      (alternating FOLFOX and FOLFIRI) in combination with bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With these novel treatment options at hand it is imperative to define the optimal first-line&#xD;
      treatment modality in order to allow for an optimized treatment sequence to ensure for&#xD;
      maximal success with acceptable toxicity.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of life will be assessed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ).&#xD;
The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale.&#xD;
All of the scales ands ingle-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.&#xD;
Scoring is done based on the following document: EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual</description>
