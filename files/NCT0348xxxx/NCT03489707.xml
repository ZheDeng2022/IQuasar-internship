  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find ways to screen for anal cancer among gay,&#xD;
      bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender persons. This study will&#xD;
      try to find out if persons will do annual anal cancer screening, what factors are associated&#xD;
      with repeated screening, and how this affects a person's decision to have high-resolution&#xD;
      anoscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, two-arm clinical study to evaluate compliance with annual&#xD;
      home-based vs clinic-based DNA screening of anal canal exfoliated cells among Milwaukee HIV+&#xD;
      and HIV- men who have sex with men and transpersons aged â‰¥25 years. At study entry, persons&#xD;
      randomized to arm 1 will receive a home-based collection kit in the mail at 0 and 12 months&#xD;
      and those in arm 2 will attend a clinic where a clinician will collect the exfoliated cell&#xD;
      specimen at 0 and 12 months. Then, persons will receive HRA-directed biopsy to assess&#xD;
      precancerous lesions by study arm. We hypothesize that a majority of persons will comply with&#xD;
      annual screening with increased compliance among persons in the home-based arm vs&#xD;
      clinic-based arm. The proposed research could indicate that annual HPV DNA screening and&#xD;
      subsequent HRA are acceptable to MSM and transpersons; thus, we will determine how high-risk&#xD;
      persons are identified for HRA in light of limited HRA resources. The duration of each&#xD;
      participant's activities is expected to be 12 months. The study is expected have participant&#xD;
      activity from 2019 to 2023.&#xD;
