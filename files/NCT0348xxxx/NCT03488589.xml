  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis E is the fifth known human viral hepatitis and is probably the most common cause of&#xD;
      acute viral hepatitis in the world. The incidence of acute hepatitis E is estimated at 3&#xD;
      million human cases per year worldwide, with around 70,000 deaths. Most cases occur in&#xD;
      endemic countries, but the number of cases in low-endemic areas has increased. HEV&#xD;
      seroprevalence is high in developing countries, such as India and Southeast Asia, ranging&#xD;
      from 27-80%. Acute disease mortality is 1-4%, with risk being higher in pregnant women and&#xD;
      immunodeficient patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The four more prevalent genotypes are allocated into two groups. Epidemic hepatitis E&#xD;
      includes genotypes 1 and 2, which are considered human viruses and have caused the epidemics&#xD;
      of hepatitis. These forms are transmitted mainly by contaminated water and the fecal-oral&#xD;
      route. endemic hepatitis E includes genotypes 3 and 4, which are considered swine viruses&#xD;
      (common in domestic and wild pigs), capable of infecting humans as an accidental host and&#xD;
      therefore considered zoonotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The course and clinical presentation of hepatitis E is highly variable. The detailed&#xD;
      mechanisms that lead to the different clinical outcomes in hepatitis E are only partially&#xD;
      understood. It is known that both viral factors (genotype and dose of inoculum) and host&#xD;
      factors (presence of previous liver disease, pregnancy and distinct genetic polymorphisms)&#xD;
      determine the course of infection. In most cases, hepatitis E causes self-limited illness,&#xD;
      lasting from a few days to weeks, with an average of 4-6 weeks. However, in developed&#xD;
      countries it can cause chronic disease with rapid progression to cirrhosis, especially in&#xD;
      patients who are transplanted, have hematological malignancies requiring chemotherapy, or&#xD;
      have infection with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatitis E is an underdiagnosed disease, partly due to the use of serological tests with low&#xD;
      sensitivity. Diagnosis can be made indirectly by detecting antibodies against HEV in the&#xD;
      serum, or directly by detecting the genome of the virus in blood or other body fluids. The&#xD;
      tests for anti-hepatitis E antibody screening are commercially available, but none of them&#xD;
      has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Unfortunately, the sensitivity&#xD;
      and specificity of these tests vary greatly and this could explain the discrepancies in rates&#xD;
      of anti-hepatitis E antibodies published for the various populations studied. The tests for&#xD;
      viral RNA in serum and feces are confirmatory, but still experimental.&#xD;
