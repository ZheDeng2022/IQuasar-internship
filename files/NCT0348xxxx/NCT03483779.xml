      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary heart disease has become a serious challenge to China with its high prevalence and&#xD;
      mortality. The impaired glucose regulation is prevalent in patients with cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. However, there are few drugs that interfere early with impaired glucose regulation.&#xD;
      Ginkgo biloba extract is not only a commonly used drug for cardiovascular diseases, but also&#xD;
      has a significant effect in reducing blood sugar. Therefore, this study used a single case&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to explore the efficacy of Ginkgo biloba pills in the treatment&#xD;
      of coronary heart disease patients with impaired glucose regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-period crossover trial for a&#xD;
      single subject.A total of 12 subjects will be recruited in this trial. The trial is divided&#xD;
      into three cycles, one cycle has two treatment periods. Ginkgo biloba pills and placebo will&#xD;
      be randomized during the treatment period. The test period will be lasted 58 weeks and&#xD;
      subjects will take 48 weeks. Subjects will be selected by the researcher strictly in&#xD;
      accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;

    <description>Questionnaires will be completed (SAQ - Seattle Angina Questionnaire) at the end of each treatment period.&#xD;
The Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) is a self-administered, 19-item questionnaire, a cardiac disease-related quality-of-life measure. The SAQ is well validated and sensitive to clinical changes. It has five subscales: physical limitation, angina stability, angina frequency, treatment satisfaction, and quality of life. The possible range of scores for each of the five subscales is 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Symptoms of angina pectoris</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms of angina pectoris, including frequency, duration, attack severity, and the doses of nitroglycerin were recorded, and an angina pectoris symptom score will be calculated. The effect index is determined according to the following formula:&#xD;
Effect index (n) = [(symptom score before treatment - symptom score after treatment) / symptom score before treatment] × 100%.&#xD;
A value of n ≥ 70% suggested a significant effect; 70% &gt;n ≥ 30% suggested an effect; 30% &gt;n ≥ 0 suggested no effect; n &lt; 0 suggested a worsening effect.</description>
