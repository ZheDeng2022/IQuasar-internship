  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal lithiasis affects a wide range of the population, ranging from 4 to 15% according to&#xD;
      the population sample studied. Among all stones, it is estimated that uric stones account for&#xD;
      between 10 and 15% of all cases and especially affects men over 50 years, while mixed&#xD;
      lithiasis of calcium oxalate monohydrate and uric acid affects a 2.5% of all cases. Lithiasis&#xD;
      generated by uric acid is a highly recurrent pathology, even repeating itself several times&#xD;
      during the year, and is related to other pathologies such as diabetes and obesity. It is&#xD;
      evident that the medical problem that lithiasis originates should not be treated only by&#xD;
      eliminating the calculus formed, through the different surgical techniques available, but&#xD;
      also that the alterations responsible for its formation should be modified and corrected. If&#xD;
      these alterations are not modified, the risk of the genesis of new calculations persists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacological treatments used until now to treat uric lithiasis are based on the&#xD;
      powerful alkalinization of the urine (through the use of citrate or bicarbonate); These&#xD;
      treatments tend to have a low rate of adherence and, taken long term, can cause the&#xD;
      development of stones of another composition (eg, Phosphate), which are much more difficult&#xD;
      to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are natural substances, such as theobromine (natural component of cocoa) that has been&#xD;
      found to have the ability to inhibit the formation of uric acid crystals: this substance has&#xD;
      been tested in laboratory experiments and therefore would be useful to prevent the formation&#xD;
      of uric acid stones and / or mixed calcium oxalate monohydrate / uric acid stones.&#xD;
      Theobromine corresponds to a phytocomponent alkaloid that is found in high concentrations in&#xD;
      chocolate. The starting hypothesis of this study corresponds to the possible increase in the&#xD;
      capacity of inhibition of the crystallization of uric acid by urine in subjects who have&#xD;
      ingested food or food supplements containing cocoa or cocoa extract. Therefore, the&#xD;
      relationship between the intake of a specific food supplement and the ability to inhibit the&#xD;
      crystallization of uric acid by the urine will be studied. An increase in the ability to&#xD;
      inhibit the crystallization of uric acid from urine would be useful to prevent the formation&#xD;
      of uric acid crystals in urine, which are the origin of uric acid stones or mixed calcium&#xD;
      oxalate monohydrate / acid uric.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is no information on the relationship between the ability to inhibit the&#xD;
      crystallization of uric acid in the urine due to the intake of certain foods or food&#xD;
      supplements and the concentration of theobromine in urine and urinary pH. The present study&#xD;
      is carried out to evaluate the relationship between the intake of a specific food supplement&#xD;
      and the ability to inhibit the crystallization of uric acid by urine, which would be useful&#xD;
      to prevent the formation of uric acid stones and / or mixed calculations of calcium oxalate&#xD;
      monohydrate / uric acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in two stages. The first will consist in the intake of 1&#xD;
      capsule of a food supplement based on citrate and plant extract without cocoa extract, twice&#xD;
      a day for 14 days. The second will consist in the intake of 1 capsule of a food supplement&#xD;
      based on citrate and plant extract with cocoa extract, twice a day for 14 days. Before the&#xD;
      start of the study a blood sample will be obtained and on the last day of each stage, the&#xD;
      patient will be asked to collect the 24-hour urine and another 2-hour morning urine sample.&#xD;
      Between each stage will be a period of 7 days without receiving any food supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study there will be no risk due to the tests that will be performed, since they&#xD;
      are among those performed in routine clinical practice. Regarding the possible risks&#xD;
      associated with the intake of food supplement, to minimize them, any patient with chocolate&#xD;
      or theobromine allergy, pregnant or lactating women and patients with insufficiency are&#xD;
      excluded from the study participation. chronic kidney The daily amount of theobromine&#xD;
      ingested as cocoa extract is similar to a quantity of dark chocolate between 11-25 g. This&#xD;
      consumption of chocolate can be considered normal within a diet. In fact a piece of 50 g of&#xD;
      dark chocolate contains between 237 and 519 mg of theobromine and daily many people consume&#xD;
      more of this amount without presenting side effects to be a food.&#xD;

      Background Urolithiasis is a pathology known since antiquity although they are not known&#xD;
      totally the causes of the formation of all the different types of calculus existing As a&#xD;
      consequence of this, only in some cases has it been possible to develop an efficient&#xD;
      treatment. Renal lithiasis affects a wide range of the population, varying from 4 to 15%&#xD;
      according to the population sample studied. It is important to highlight the high morbidity&#xD;
      associated with this pathology, since between 10 and 15% of cases require surgical treatment&#xD;
      and between 20 and 30% it requires hospitalization. Among all lithiasis, it is estimated that&#xD;
      uric lithiasis accounts for between 10 and 15% of all cases and especially affects men over&#xD;
      50 years old, while mixed lithiasis of calcium oxalate monohydrate and uric acid affects 2.5%&#xD;
      of all the cases. Lithiasis generated by uric acid are a highly pathology recurrent, even&#xD;
      repeating several times during the year, and is related with other pathologies such as&#xD;
      diabetes and obesity. This implies a high cost estimated in billions of euros per year,&#xD;
      especially for its incidence in medical emergencies. It should be noted that between 50 and&#xD;
      70% of people who do not receive treatment or do not change their nutritional habits develop&#xD;
      new calculus in a period of time less than 5 years. Is a contracted fact that the type and&#xD;
      characteristics of the feed will determine the functioning of the acid-base metabolism and&#xD;
      the characteristics of the urine as it can be its pH, the greater or lesser concentration of&#xD;
      substances, as well as a set of characteristics that can determine the crystallization&#xD;
      capacity of the different substances contained in it such as uric acid. It is evident that&#xD;
      the medical problem that lithiasis originates should not be treated so only eliminating the&#xD;
      same one, by means of the different surgical techniques available, but also the alterations&#xD;
      responsible for its use must be modified and corrected training. If these alterations are not&#xD;
      modified, the risk of genesis of new calculus persists. The pharmacological treatments used&#xD;
      so far for treat uric lithiasis are based on the powerful alkalinization of urine (by using&#xD;
      of citrate or bicarbonate) increasing the urinary pH to avoid crystallization of the uric&#xD;
      acid and the formation of new kidney stones. These treatments can present a long-term problem&#xD;
      and as a consequence there is a low- 2 - percentage of adherence to the treatment of uric&#xD;
      acid stones. These long-term treatments can increase urinary pH above 6 units and end up&#xD;
      causing a different type of renal lithiasis, the phosphatic, a lot more difficult to treat,&#xD;
      by increasing the possibility of total calcification of the kidney that it implies.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is evident that new alternatives should be sought in substances of food source&#xD;
      that could facilitate the dietary treatments of said pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently citrate-based food supplements on the market plant extracts that&#xD;
      contribute to the normal functioning of the metabolism acid-base of the organism alkalizing&#xD;
      the urine (for example Lit control pH up). But there are also other approaches to the problem&#xD;
      of lithiasis based on avoiding or decreasing the crystallization capacity of urine developed&#xD;
      by the Renal Lithiasis Research Laboratory of the University of the Illes Balears. These&#xD;
      approaches consist in looking for inhibitors of the crystallization of natural origin A&#xD;
      crystallization inhibitor corresponds to a substance that is able to prevent, delay or hinder&#xD;
      the crystallization of insoluble compounds. This approach was already started with the work&#xD;
      of Bliznakov in 1965, showing that certain molecules were able to slow down the growth rate&#xD;
      crystalline nature of certain substances as a result of their adsorption (binding) on growth&#xD;
      surfaces and the corresponding alterations that this caused. During this time Vermeulen et&#xD;
      al., Fleisch et al. and Howard and cols showed that a series of substances present in the&#xD;
      urine, including pyrophosphate, were capable to prevent the crystallization of the calcium&#xD;
      salts. These ideas too were later developed by the Lithiasis Research Laboratory Renal&#xD;
      observing that said inhibitory capacity of the crystallization of calcium salts It was also&#xD;
      made by phytate, a substance that is present in all unrefined seeds (legumes, cereals, nuts,&#xD;
      ...). This process led to the search for natural substances that presented said ability to&#xD;
      inhibit, not on the crystallization of calcium salts but on the crystallization of uric acid.&#xD;
      Among numerous substances used in the tests In vitro it was observed that theobromine,&#xD;
      natural component of cocoa produces said effect concentrations similar to those produced&#xD;
      after the usual chocolate intake. In Europe chocolate intake is approximately between 6 and&#xD;
      12 kg per person and year. For this reason, it is intended to reduce the inhibition capacity&#xD;
      of the uric acid from the urine by an in vitro test after the intake of a supplement&#xD;
      determined food For this purpose, urine samples from patients will be used volunteers who&#xD;
      will supply to the Renal Lithiasis Research Laboratory assigned to the IUNICS (University of&#xD;
      the Balearic Islands) before and after the intake of- 3 - a certain food supplement food for&#xD;
      a time settled down.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification The Renal Lithiasis Research Laboratory since 1998 has as one of its its&#xD;
      purpose is to study the relationship between the characteristics of urine and the different&#xD;
      types of existing lithiasis. As we have indicated one of the lithiases with a large incidence&#xD;
      is lithiasis of uric acid or calcium oxalate monohydrate / uric acid. Currently, the&#xD;
      relationship between the ability to inhibit crystallization of uric acid from a urine after&#xD;
      ingestion of certain food Complements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine is a product of blood filtration that reflects its composition, including water and low&#xD;
      molecular weight molecules such as salts, vitamins, minerals, etc. accordingly the intake of&#xD;
      certain foods, such as the chocolate, cocoa or an extract thereof, will be reflected in an&#xD;
      increase in urinary excretion of theobromine, an inhibitor of the crystallization of uric&#xD;
      acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to this, the modification of the crystallization capacity of uric acid in the urine&#xD;
      should be clearly reflected. Naturally, apart from this main variable, urine must be&#xD;
      determined in series of secondary variables such as urinary pH, concentration of Theobromine&#xD;
      and all other important urinary parameters in the pathology lithiasic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective and secondary objectives Currently, the relationship between the ability to&#xD;
      inhibit crystallization of uric acid by urine due to the intake of certain food or food&#xD;
      supplements and theobromine concentration and pH urinary. Therefore, the main objective is to&#xD;
      evaluate the inhibition capacity of the crystallization of uric acid by urine in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with uric lithiasis or calcium oxalate monohydrate / uric acid, after ingestion of&#xD;
      a food supplement with cocoa extract. This would allow to use the capacity of inhibition of&#xD;
      the crystallization of uric acid by urine, as a possible indicator of the prevention of uric&#xD;
      lithiasis or calcium oxalate monohydrate / acid uric due to the effect of food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The starting hypothesis of this study corresponds to the possible increase in&#xD;
      ability to inhibit the crystallization of uric acid by urine from subjects who have eaten&#xD;
      foods that contain cocoa or cocoa extract. Thus the relationship between the intake of a&#xD;
      specific complement will be studied nutritional status and the ability to inhibit the&#xD;
      crystallization of uric acid by the urine. An increase in the ability to inhibit the&#xD;
      crystallization of uric acid of urine would be useful to prevent the crystallization of uric&#xD;
      acid, which is the origin of uric acid stones or mixed calcium oxalate monohydrate / acid&#xD;
      uric stones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work design and methodology Study group The inhibitory capacity of the uric acid&#xD;
      crystallization of urine will be studied in two groups of patients who will be proposed to&#xD;
      take the food supplement based on citrate and plant extracts and the citrate-based food&#xD;
      supplement and extracts of plants with cocoa extract during a period of 14 days. To these&#xD;
      groups will be supplied with the food supplement that they should consume during the period&#xD;
      of 14 days along with your usual diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary intervention The food supplement to be consumed will be Lit Control pH Up without dry&#xD;
      extract of ginseng (Panax ginseng, root) and the same Lit Control pH Up with dry cocoa&#xD;
      extract (Theobroma cacao, fruit) that correspond to the capsules with cocoa extract. The dose&#xD;
      will be 2 capsules of 750 mg per individual, dosed at a rate of one during the breakfast and&#xD;
      another during dinner. Each participant will be provided with free the necessary number of&#xD;
      nutritional capsules of the nutritional intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Composition of nutritional supplements of the nutritional intervention (capsule of 750 mg of&#xD;
      weight)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lit control pH up (with dry cocoa extract): Potassium citrate, citrate magnesium, dry&#xD;
           extract of cocoa (Theobroma cacao, 60 mg of theobromine), maltodextrin (bulking agent),&#xD;
           silicon dioxide (anticaking), magnesium stearate (fluidizing), zinc gluconate, vitamin&#xD;
           A. Coverage: gelatin, titanium dioxide (opacifier), rust yellow iron (dye),&#xD;
           indigotine-FD &amp; C Blue2 (dye). CN: 172249.2. Weight capsule 750 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lit control pH up (without dry cocoa extract): Potassium citrate, citrate magnesium,&#xD;
           maltodextrin (bulking agent), silicon dioxide (anticaking), magnesium stearate&#xD;
           (fluidizing), zinc gluconate, vitamin A. Coverage: gelatin, titanium dioxide&#xD;
           (opacifier), rust yellow iron (dye), indigotine-FD &amp; C Blue2 (dye). Weight 750 mg&#xD;
           capsule Absence of adverse / secondary effects of the food supplement Theobromine&#xD;
           corresponds to a phytocomponent alkaloid found in high concentrations in chocolate, in&#xD;
           fact a piece of 50 g of chocolate black contains between 237 and 519 mg of theobromine&#xD;
           and daily many people consumes more than this amount without presenting side effects as&#xD;
           it is a food. It is evident that the daily amount of theobromine ingested as an extract&#xD;
           of cocoa would roughly correspond to a quantity of chocolate located between about 11-25&#xD;
           g, amount of consumption that can be considered normal on a diet. In a paper by Birkett&#xD;
           et al (1985) where 200 mg of theobromine was ingested orally Three times a day, no&#xD;
           clinical symptoms or pharmacological activity were observed. Nor the intake of&#xD;
           theobromine as sweet chocolate at a dose of 6 mg / kg · day (for a person of 70 kg&#xD;
           correspond to 420 mg / day of theobromine) causes effects Clinical trials in human&#xD;
           subjects (Shively et al., 1985). There are different studies that determine the effect&#xD;
           of theobromine on mood and use amounts of theobromine located around 700 mg / day as&#xD;
           described in Mitchell et al. (2011). Finally, in a study that compared the ingestion of&#xD;
           theobromine at doses 250 mg compared to placebo, there were no significant differences&#xD;
           in the increased heart rate neither in systolic or diastolic blood pressure (Baggott et&#xD;
           al., 2013).The WHO report (1991) describes that the ingestion of high doses of&#xD;
           theobromine in human daily intakes of chocolate from 50-100 g of cocoa (0.8-1.5 g of&#xD;
           theobromine) may be associated in some cases with sweating, trembling and pain of head&#xD;
           This is a dose about eight times higher than that used in the intervention dietetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all the exposed data it is evident that the theobromine existing in the extract of cacao&#xD;
      that they will ingest in the dietetic intervention is far from any effect toxic. This&#xD;
      nutritional dosage corresponds to a normal intake of Theobromine in the form of chocolate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main goal The present observational research project aims to evaluate the activity of a food&#xD;
      supplement Lit Control pH Up without dry ginseng extract compared to another Lit Control pH&#xD;
      Up with dry cocoa extract in lithiasic subjects normouricemic with uric acid lithiasis and /&#xD;
      or COM / Ac. demonstrated uric acid, during a period of 14 days of intervention. The main&#xD;
      variable of study will be the capacity of inhibition of the crystallization of uric acid in&#xD;
      the first morning urine of 2 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective Know the profile of the blood and urinary biochemical parameters of the&#xD;
      patients recruited in the nutritional intervention.&#xD;

        -  Chronic renal failure Population sample of the intervention The number of patients will&#xD;
           be 60 (see the justification for the number of patients in the section Study sample).&#xD;
           This intervention will be carried out in a sample of patients with uric lithiasis or&#xD;
           urinary COM / Ac uric acid, as it is a sample of patients available. This corresponds to&#xD;
           a preliminary study and its use does not allows a direct extrapolation of the data&#xD;
           obtained to the general population. This available sample will be described sufficiently&#xD;
           to be able to make a cautious extrapolation to the population that could be represented&#xD;
           by that sample. The studies with these population samples are the ones that are used to&#xD;
           make specific studies on the same samples and to carry out studies experimental with few&#xD;
           subjects as is this case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment route The sample of voluntary patients will be recruited by the Urology Service&#xD;
      of Hospital de Manacor among its patients who meet the inclusion criteria and not the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation period The investigator must recruit a minimum of 60 patients from observational&#xD;
      form and with the data collected from the existing clinical histories, during a period of 36&#xD;
      months, considering the time required for the recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the nutritional intervention Stage 1. The nutritional exposure will consist in&#xD;
      the intake of 1 capsule of the food supplement based on citrate and plant extract without&#xD;
      cocoa extract dosed at the rate of one during breakfast and another during dinner, during a&#xD;
      period of 14 days to a group of 30 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2. The nutritional exposure will consist in the intake of 1 capsule of the food&#xD;
      supplement based on citrate and plant extract with cocoa extract dosed at the rate of one&#xD;
      during breakfast and another during dinner, during a period of 14 days to a group of 30&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each stage, a week of bleaching will be carried out and the Initial assigned&#xD;
      nutritional intervention. Each patient is assigned randomly from successive to Stage 1 or&#xD;
      Stage 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of the control group In this intervention there is no control group, the own The&#xD;
      individual will be evaluated before and after the nutritional intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sample. Predetermination of sample size The fact that it is a pilot study and carried&#xD;
      out under conditions of clinical practice usual and have little information about the action&#xD;
      of the complement food complicates the realization of the hypothesis. For what has not been&#xD;
      done initial sample size calculation, because it is an observational pilot study Initial&#xD;
      post-marketing modification of the urine characteristics of the patient. The choice of 60&#xD;
      subjects is decided in agreement with the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects withdrawn due to intolerance will not be replaced and will be included in the&#xD;
      analysis of data. Patients who leave the study due to any other circumstance, they must be&#xD;
      replaced and will not be included in the statistical analysis. No relevant factors influence&#xD;
      such as inclusion and exclusion criteria, since each patient serves as his own control.&#xD;
      Variability is reduced, which is why you need a smaller sample size, in order to detect&#xD;
      statistical difference between the intervention group and the control group. The cross study&#xD;
      allows to evaluate the response to treatment in a short period of time, and the first&#xD;
      intervention did not interferes with that of the second stage. The period of bleaching or&#xD;
      &quot;washing&quot; (wash-out) between the two stages allows to avoid possible interferences between&#xD;
      interventions of the first stage and the second.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection notebook In research projects where the characteristics of samples are&#xD;
      studied and that do not correspond to clinical trials of new drugs is not needed the CRF so&#xD;
      it is not used in this research project (Law 14/2007, of July 3, of Biomedical Research).&#xD;
      This study does not create personalized data file since only the urine sample is used will be&#xD;
      anonymized by not using any personal data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process The study will involve for each patient the following operations not included in the&#xD;
      usual clinical practice. Obtaining morning urine for 2 hours and collecting urine for 24&#xD;
      hours according to the instructions before each dietary intervention. Obtaining the 2-hour&#xD;
      morning urine collection of 24-hour urine according to the instructions the last day of the&#xD;
      dietetic intervention for each of the two study groups. The Patients will deposit their&#xD;
      samples in the Urology Department of the Regional Hospital of Manacor to your usual doctor.&#xD;
      The recruited patients will voluntarily cede to the Renal Lithiasis Research Laboratory of&#xD;
      the UIB its urine samples for the realization of the test of the inhibition capacity of acid&#xD;
      crystallization uric acid, the main variable of study and the determination of theobromine by&#xD;
      high pressure liquid chromatography technique and annualized detection through an ultraviolet&#xD;
      detector. The other biochemical determinations shall be carried out according to the&#xD;
      protocols established in the usual clinical practice at the Hospital Comarcal of Manacor.&#xD;
&#xD;

                be recorded when they appear in the clinical history or when in the clinical&#xD;
                history there are clinical signs and symptoms that make it possible to define them&#xD;
                as such.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical variables The study variables will be the following blood biochemical parameters&#xD;
      and urinals that correspond to the standardized controls of lithiasic patients: 24-hour urine&#xD;

        -  pH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ability to inhibit the crystallization of uric acid. Main variable of study Blood plasma&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Uric acid The blood and urine analysis of 24 hours will be performed at the Hospital de&#xD;
           Manacor (within usual clinical practice), the surplus will be destroyed according to the&#xD;
           protocols established for the samples analyzed as in any other patient. The analytical&#xD;
           carried out on the urine for 2 hours (which is the one that will be carried out in the&#xD;
           Laboratory of research in renal lithiasis of the University of the Balearic Islands&#xD;
           IUNICS), I do not know foresees that there are surpluses of urine samples. In case it&#xD;
           exists, it will will be destroyed according to the protocols established for said&#xD;
           samples by the Renal lithiasis research laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule of activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Planned start corresponds to the second quarter of 2017 (conditioned final authorization&#xD;
           CEIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The planned completion corresponds to the third quarter of 2018. Statistic analysis A&#xD;
           descriptive analysis of all the demographic and analytical data of the volunteers. The&#xD;
           continuous quantitative variables will determine the average as measure of&#xD;
           centralization while the variability will be defined by the deviation typical and the&#xD;
           coefficient of variation. The statistical analysis of the variables will be carried out&#xD;
           by means of the Student t test for paired samples for the determination of differences&#xD;
           between the two sample means and for the construction of the interval of trust. The test&#xD;
           checks whether the means of two samples distributed in a normal shape are the same.&#xD;

        The number of patients will be 60 (see the justification for the number of patients in the&#xD;
        section Study sample). This intervention will be carried out in a sample of patients with&#xD;
        uric lithiasis or urinary COM / Ac uric acid, as it is a sample of patients available. This&#xD;
        corresponds to a preliminary study and its use does not allows a direct extrapolation of&#xD;
        the data obtained to the general population. This available sample will be described&#xD;
        sufficiently to be able to make a cautious extrapolation to the population that could be&#xD;
        represented by that sample. The studies with these population samples are the ones that are&#xD;
        used to make specific studies on the same samples and to carry out studies experimental&#xD;
        with few subjects as is this case.&#xD;
