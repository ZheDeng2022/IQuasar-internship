  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HCV infection is treated with oral drugs, termed as 'direct-acting anti-viral agents' (DAAs).&#xD;
      In India, four DAAs are available (sofosbuvir [SOF], daclatasvir [DCV], ledipasvir [LDV] and&#xD;
      velpatasvir [VEL]). Globally, DAA based regimens have obtained excellent rates of cure. Cure&#xD;
      of HCV infection is defined as undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after stopping drugs, also&#xD;
      referred to as sustained virological response at week 12 (SVR12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using these DAA based treatment regimens, a small number (up to 5%) of people fail to achieve&#xD;
      SVR12 and HCV RNA reappear after a few weeks of stopping the drugs (virological relapse).&#xD;
      Data on management of virological relapse are extremely limited, especially in genotype 3,&#xD;
      and no guidelines exist regarding re-treatment options for such group. Hence, we plan to&#xD;
      re-treat such people using what appear to be the best combination treatment in each situation&#xD;
      and to review our experience over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with chronic HCV infection who relapsed following standard DAA-based treatment&#xD;
      regimen will be invited to participate. We propose to re-treat them with the anti-HCV drug&#xD;
      combination which appears to be the most suited to his/her clinical profile, based on the&#xD;
      current empiric knowledge - the choice of drugs will be based on HCV genotype, the previous&#xD;
      treatment regimen and the presence/absence of liver cirrhosis, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During anti-HCV treatment, participants will be given expected standard of care and HCV RNA&#xD;
      will be tested at 4-week intervals starting from week 4 and till RNA becomes undetectable,&#xD;
      and then at the end of treatment and 12 weeks after the treatment was stopped - as is the&#xD;
      usual practice during such treatment. Relevant clinical, laboratory and treatment details&#xD;
      will be recorded in a pre-defined data collection form. Treatment outcome will be categorized&#xD;
      as success (SVR12), treatment failure (any detectable HCV RNA at the end of 24 weeks&#xD;
      treatment duration) or relapse (HCV RNA negative at the end of treatment, but positive at 12&#xD;
      weeks after stopping treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If possible, a 5-ml blood specimen will be collected before starting re-treatment from all&#xD;
      participants; in addition, another similar specimen will be collected following the treatment&#xD;
      in those in whom the re-treatment is unsuccessful. These will be stored and may be used in&#xD;
      future for virological studies to look for drug-resistance variations.&#xD;

      -Introduction Oral drugs, termed collectively as 'Direct-acting anti-viral agents' (DAAs),&#xD;
      are the standard-of-care for HCV treatment. In India, four DAAs, namely sofosbuvir (SOF),&#xD;
      daclatasvir (DCV), ledipasvir (LDV) and velpatasvir (VEL), are marketed. Initially, people&#xD;
      were treated using SOF in combination with ribavirin with or without pegylated-interferon&#xD;
      (Peg-IFN). Thereafter, HCV treatment was switched to use of two DAAs with or without&#xD;
      ribavirin and discontinuation of Peg-IFN. All these combinations of DAAs have obtained&#xD;
      excellent rates of cure - defined as undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks after stopping&#xD;
      DAA-based HCV, also referred to as sustained virological response at week 12 (SVR12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though DAAs-based anti-HCV treatment has shown generally excellent results, globally some&#xD;
      patients fail to achieve SVR12. The rate of such failure is higher in patients with advanced&#xD;
      liver disease and HCV genotype 3 infections. In India, genotype 3 is the most prevalent HCV&#xD;
      genotype (~65%), followed by genotype 1 (~30%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on management of the people who relapse after DAA treatment are extremely limited, and&#xD;
      no guidelines exist regarding retreatment options for them. Hence, physician need to re-treat&#xD;
      such people with the best combination available in a given situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective To study the re-treatment response in people with chronic HCV infection and&#xD;
           relapsed to prior DAA based treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rationale for the proposed treatment regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, investigators attempted to tried to combine drugs to give the best chance of virus&#xD;
      clearance to those with prior treatment failure by following the following principles, as&#xD;
      have emerged from the experience worldwide:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prolongation of treatment duration to 24 weeks if previous treatment was for 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Addition of pegylated interferon (previous standard of care for HCV, and which acts by a&#xD;
           different mechanism) if person has previously failed 24 weeks of dual-DAA treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Addition of ribavirin, if it appears that the participant can tolerate this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Use of sofosbuvir (a NS5b inhibitor) as the backbone of re-treatment, since drug&#xD;
           resistance to this drug is the least common&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Use of a pangenotypic drug (velpatasvir) if the previous treatment was with a&#xD;
           genotype-specific NS5a inhibitor (daclatasvir or ledipasvir)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Use of genotype-specific drug (daclatasvir or ledipasvir) if the previous treatment was&#xD;
           with a pan-genotypic NS5a inhibitor (velpatasvir)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Methods Relevant clinical, laboratory and treatment details will be recorded in&#xD;
                pre-defined data collection form, used for monitoring patients with HCV infection&#xD;
                as part of their clinical care. Treatment outcome will be categorized as successful&#xD;
                (SVR12), treatment failure (any detectable HCV RNA at the end of pre-defined 12-24&#xD;
                weeks treatment duration) or relapse (HCV RNA negative at the end of treatment, but&#xD;
                positive at 12 weeks after stopping treatment). The data will be analyzed for the&#xD;
                entire group and for specific subgroups, such as: (i) those without cirrhosis; (ii)&#xD;
                those with compensated cirrhosis; (iii) those with decompensated cirrhosis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood specimen collection If possible, a 5 ml blood specimen will be collected&#xD;
                before starting anti-HCV retreatment from all the participants. If the HCV&#xD;
                retreatment also fails, then a repeat 5 ml blood specimen will be collected for&#xD;
                virological studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Follow-up plan During anti-HCV treatment: HCV RNA will be tested at 4-week&#xD;
                intervals starting from week 4 till RNA reports are negative, and then at the end&#xD;
                of treatment and 12 weeks after stopping treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sample size Considering usual clinical load, investigators expect to treat around&#xD;
                1000-1200 DAA treatment naive people with chronic HCV infection between during the&#xD;
                study period. considering a 5% relapse rate, HCV relapse is expected in about 50&#xD;
                people.&#xD;
