  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this project is to discern how closure of Fontan fenestrations in&#xD;
      patients with single ventricle heart disease will affect hepatic congestion, a major&#xD;
      determinant of chronic liver disease. We will employ transient elastography (Fibroscan) to&#xD;
      obtain liver stiffness measurements (LSM) before and after fenestration closure to study the&#xD;
      impact of this intervention on hepatic congestion.&#xD;

      Methods Eligible patients will be contacted in advance of hospitalization for catheterized&#xD;
      fenestration closure to introduce goals of study and review risks and benefits of&#xD;
      participation. At the time of catheterization, the study objectives and consent forms will be&#xD;
      explained, allowing sufficient time for questions. To ensure full comprehension of the study,&#xD;
      the parent or guardian will be asked to describe his or her participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the Fibroscan (Echosens, Paris, France), a transient elastography device, a liver&#xD;
      stiffness measurement (LSM) will be obtained prior to the catheterization. On the&#xD;
      post-catheterization day, a repeat measurement will be obtained. Transient elastography will&#xD;
      be performed by trained study investigators who were certified by the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain an LSM, the appropriate-sized Fibroscan probe must be selected and then aimed in&#xD;
      the right upper quadrant space through an intercostal space. For patients with heterotaxy or&#xD;
      situs inversus, adjustments in probe positioning may be needed to obtain reliable&#xD;
      measurement. Probe selection (small, medium, or large) will be directed by manufacturer&#xD;
      guidelines, based on thoracic perimeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operator is guided by an image to locate an appropriate section of liver. The Fibroscan&#xD;
      device transmits an elastic shear wave through the hepatic parenchyma and then measures the&#xD;
      propagation of the wave through a known distance of liver tissue to calculate a transmission&#xD;
      velocity. Using the shear velocity and the mass density of the liver parenchyma, the&#xD;
      principles of Young's modulus are invoked to estimate the Elasticity of the tissue. The&#xD;
      elasticity is summarized as a liver stiffness measurement (LSM), which is a continuous&#xD;
      variable that is reported in kilopascals (kPa). Each LSM outcome value is based on a minimum&#xD;
      of ten valid assessments measured in succession. The validity of each individual measurement&#xD;
      is determined by the device and the interquartile range of the measurements should fall&#xD;
      within 30% of the median LSM. The Fibroscan data collection method is non-invasive and&#xD;
      efficient. LSM will be obtained after fasting for a minimum of three hours and without&#xD;
      administration of sedating agents/anesthetics.&#xD;
