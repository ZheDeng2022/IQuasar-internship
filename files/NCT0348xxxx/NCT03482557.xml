  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating whether contrast enhanced mammography can be used as an&#xD;
      alternative to breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for cancer screening&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mammography is the main way to help find breast cancers early so they can be treated.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, mammography does not work as well in women who have dense breast tissue or who&#xD;
      are at high-risk for breast cancer. In these women, breast MRI is also used to help find&#xD;
      breast cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrast enhanced mammography is a new type of mammogram. It uses contrast material combined&#xD;
      with the mammogram to highlight areas that might be breast cancer and that could be missed on&#xD;
      the mammogram alone. This is similar to breast MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, participants who are already getting a breast biopsy will have a contrast&#xD;
      enhanced mammogram and a breast MRI before the biopsy. The participant's contrast enhanced&#xD;
      mammogram and breast MRI images will then be included within a large collection of images.&#xD;
      Radiologists will compare the images to see if the contrast enhanced mammograms and the&#xD;
      breast MRI find the same number of breast cancers. If the investigators find they perform&#xD;
      similarly, then contrast mammography may be used to aid in breast cancer screening in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;

    <description>Each enrolled participant will receive both a CESM and MRI exam prior to the breast biopsy, if they had not been performed already as part of clinical care.&#xD;
MRI: Breast MRI will be performed, if not already performed as part of clinical care.&#xD;
CESM: After the MRI is complete, patients will be brought to the mammography department for the contrast enhanced mammogram. The CESM will only occur if not already performed as part of the patient's clinical care.&#xD;
Biopsy: Patients will then have their biopsy. Any additional findings seen on the CESM or MRI will be worked up also.&#xD;
Reader Study: The CESM and the MRI images will be included in a case set that is ready by 10 study radiologists at a later date, after the biopsy is performed. These radiologists will look at the images to see if CESM and MRI find the same number of breast cancers.</description>

             screening exam (mammogram, tomosynthesis, ultrasound, or MRI) that was within 3 months&#xD;
             of biopsy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants who are pregnant. Pregnant women are excluded from this study due to the&#xD;
             radiation dose from the CT scan and its potential teratogenic effects on the fetus.&#xD;
