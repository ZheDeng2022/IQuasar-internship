  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most existing medical research has focused on patients with well-established COPD and poor&#xD;
      lung function. Whilst this is important because such patients have lots of symptoms and&#xD;
      problems, in some respects a better way of reducing health problems in the future would be to&#xD;
      develop a strategy which focuses on patients with milder disease, and identifies which ones&#xD;
      will go on to develop more severe problems and why these problems occur. The research in this&#xD;
      application is designed to investigate these issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the Partnership is to study the very early stages of the development of&#xD;
      COPD. The investigators will do this by recruiting a novel cohort of smokers (age 30-45), in&#xD;
      whom the investigators will follow the trajectories of lung function decline to identify&#xD;
      prospectively those at risk of excess decline. This programme forms a unique UK consortium of&#xD;
      8 academic centres with excellent high quality publication records and broad experience in&#xD;
      mechanistic, translational, clinical and epidemiological studies in COPD with key&#xD;
      capabilities including primary care.&#xD;

      -  Blood samples will be collected to determine full Blood count,. Blood serum, plasma and&#xD;
           a blood pellet (DNA) will be stored for further analysis of markers of inflammation and&#xD;
           infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sputum samples (either spontaneous or induced) will be collected and stored and used for&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects eligible for enrolment in the study must meet all the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed Consent: Subjects must give their signed and dated written informed consent&#xD;
             to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gender: Male or female subjects&#xD;
