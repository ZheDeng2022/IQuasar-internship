      This is a Phase I study to assess feasibility. There will be no impact on clinical care based&#xD;
      on this study. The ultrasound system is FDA approved and could be used for clinical care&#xD;
      independent of this research study. When a subject receives an ultrasound examination as part&#xD;
      of standard of care or within another clinical research trial, such an examination may serve&#xD;
      for an intra-individual comparator examination between conventional and new, ultra-portable&#xD;
      ultrasound imaging. Patients will be identified in the clinical setting when appropriate and&#xD;
      will be appropriately approached for consent for a combination of ultrasound with the&#xD;
      physical exam, for medical student education, IV access, and novel application. Patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled and accounted for in the appropriate sub-population. Additionally, to understand&#xD;
      the impact of ultraportable ultrasound, survey tools will be used to understand the workflow&#xD;
      and clinical care applications and integration of these devices. All staff and student&#xD;
      members will be appropriately consented; however, the investigators anticipate that this&#xD;
      portion of the study will be minimal risk with online consent waivers. Finally, the volunteer&#xD;
      population will allow us to practice the use of this equipment and understand the limitations&#xD;
      and applicability. The results will be the images acquired as well as surveys from the&#xD;
      volunteers and those performing the scans, who will be enrolled in the staff population of&#xD;
      this study. No significant risk is identified for subjects in this study. The largest risk,&#xD;
      although still minimal, is an incidental finding. For this study, subjects will have the&#xD;
      choice if they would like to be informed of an incidental finding. Reporting of incidental&#xD;
      findings will be conducted by designated study staff after appropriate consultation and&#xD;
      examination of the images by the PI or designee. While there are no direct benefits for&#xD;
      subjects in this study, the study hopes to improve the implementation of ultrasound into the&#xD;
      clinical setting into the future. This Phase I study aims to examine the feasibility of&#xD;
      implementation and the impact on the clinical setting. Additionally, this study hopes to&#xD;
      examine the utility and usefulness of ultrasound in medical education and thereby hopes to&#xD;
      improve the physical exam skills of clinicians for the future.&#xD;

      Ultrasound is a non-invasive, effective imaging methodology that is being used for many&#xD;
      applications. The clinical availability of an ultra-portable app-based ultrasound system is a&#xD;
      technology leap that has the potential to completely change the way ultrasound is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate feasibility of use of a new app-based ultra-portable, ultrasound system in the&#xD;
           clinical setting&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Review image quality and consistency of quality&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine the use of new app-based ultra-portable ultrasound as an extension of the&#xD;
           physical exam and implementation into medical education&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine potential clinical applications, opportunities, and limits&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Perform intra-individual comparison to current clinical use ultrasound device&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Exam the perception and integration of new, ultra-portable ultrasound systems&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Determine the potential educational value to medical student experience&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental activities performed as a part of this research study are divided into three&#xD;
      different categories based on participant population: Patient population: For these patients,&#xD;
      the non-research activities will be their standard of care ultrasound examination or their&#xD;
      ultrasound examination within another clinical research trial. For these participants, the&#xD;
      experimental activities could involve four different scenarios: 1) Patient having a standard&#xD;
      of care US and participates in the comparator assessment using the new or ultra-portable US&#xD;
      technology, 2) Patient having a physical examination by a medical student, resident or&#xD;
      physician, 3) Patient requiring vascular access, 4) Patient has a medical diagnosis and&#xD;
      within this clinical trial the investigators will use and evaluate the new ultrasound&#xD;
      technology regarding its potential of enabling novel application. For each of these&#xD;
      scenarios, in addition to the investigational ultrasound examination, the patient will be&#xD;
      given a questionnaire to give feedback from his or her perspective. Staff population: For the&#xD;
      staff population, research activities will involve a questionnaire to provide feedback&#xD;
      regarding the experience and perception of the ultraportable ultrasound technology at the&#xD;
      completion of each ultrasound imaging session. Volunteer population: For these participants,&#xD;
      all activities will be performed solely for the research study (i.e. there is no standard of&#xD;
      care ultrasound examination). The investigators plan to have the volunteers involved in two&#xD;
      different scenarios, which would all take place after informed consent has been given and&#xD;
      documented: 1) Participation in a single ultrasound exam session, 2) Participation in&#xD;
      multiple ultrasound exams and multiple operator sessions. In addition to receiving one or&#xD;
      more ultrasound examinations, the volunteers will be asked to complete a questionnaire to&#xD;
      provide feedback from his or her perspective regarding the ultraportable ultrasound&#xD;
      technology.&#xD;
