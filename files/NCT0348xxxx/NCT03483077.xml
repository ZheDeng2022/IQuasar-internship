  <brief_title>This Study in Healthy Volunteers Determines the Amount of BI 730460 in the Blood When Taken as Tablet. It Looks at How Different Doses of BI 730460 Are Taken up in the Body and How Well They Are Tolerated. The Study Also Tests How Food Influences the Amount of BI 730460 in the Blood.</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Partially Randomised, Single-blind, Placebo-controlled Trial to Investigate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Single Rising Doses of BI 730460 Administered as Tablets to Healthy Subjects, and a Randomised, Open-label, Single-dose, Two-way Cross-over Bioavailability Comparison of BI 730460 as Tablet With and Without Food</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the single-rising dose (SRD) part (trial part 1) is to investigate&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of BI 730460 in healthy subjects following oral administration of&#xD;
      single rising doses. The secondary objective is the exploration of the pharmacokinetics (PK)&#xD;
      including dose proportionality, and pharmacodynamics of BI 730460 after single dosing.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, based on a&#xD;
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood Pressure&#xD;
             (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age of 18 to 45 years (incl.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)&#xD;

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood Pressure (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)&#xD;
             or Electrocardiogram (ECG)) is deviating from normal and judged as clinically relevant&#xD;
             by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,&#xD;
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the&#xD;

             repeatedly greater than 450 ms in males) or any other relevant Electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
             finding at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,&#xD;
             because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a&#xD;
