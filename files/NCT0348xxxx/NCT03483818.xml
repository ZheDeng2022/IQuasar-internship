      DOT-C is a cluster randomised trial of a pharmacist-led, directly observed anti HCV therapy&#xD;
      pathway versus the conventional care pathway within community pharmacies. The primary trial&#xD;
      outcome is to evaluate the effect of pharmacist-led anti-HCV directly observed therapy on the&#xD;
      proportion of patients reaching a sustained virological response.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      DOT-C is a cluster randomised trial of a pharmacist-led, directly observed anti HCV therapy&#xD;
      pathway versus the conventional care pathway within 8 community pharmacies. Patients&#xD;
      attending an individual pharmacy are the cluster. Pharmacies who are participating in the&#xD;
      trial will be allocated to the pharmacist-led pathway or the conventional care pathway. The&#xD;
      pilot trial aims to recruit 40 patients into the both the pharmacist-led and the conventional&#xD;
      care pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 2,000 patients are prescribed OST within the Tayside region of North East&#xD;
      Scotland. Around 85% of these patients receive daily or regular supervision of their OST&#xD;
      consumption through one of the 92 community pharmacies. It is expected that at least 40% of&#xD;
      these patients will be infected with HCV and that around 40% of infections will be with&#xD;
      Genotype 1 virus. The 8 pharmacies acting as cluster sites for this trial have around 400&#xD;
      patients attending for supervised OST administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a cluster randomised trial of directly observed anti HCV therapy versus&#xD;
      conventional care in HCV positive patients, who are in a pharmacist delivered OST program,&#xD;
      where the patients attending an individual pharmacist are the cluster. Pharmacies&#xD;
      participating in the trial will be allocated to conventional care pathway or the DOT pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entry into the trial will be following a positive HCV test at which stage the patient will be&#xD;
      allocated to a pathway, dependent on the pharmacy they are attending. The pathways are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacy DOT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conventional care pathway&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does a pharmacist-led HCV treatment pathway increase the uptake of testing and treatment&#xD;
           by OST users and result in a higher proportion of patients achieving a sustained&#xD;
           virological response (SVR) compared to the conventional pathway?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Can a pharmacist-led pathway be introduced in a way that is feasible and acceptable to&#xD;
           users and service providers and are there any unintended consequences?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional Care Pathway In pharmacies randomised to the conventional care pathway, the&#xD;
      pharmacist will opportunistically discuss with the patient the possibility of HCV infection.&#xD;
      Information will be provided verbally and by offering standard leaflets about HCV and local&#xD;
      services for testing and or treatment. Patients who seek referral for testing and/or&#xD;
      treatment will be managed according to the standard local treatment pathway. The pharmacist&#xD;
      will record on a screening log which OST patients they have had the discussion with. If the&#xD;
      patient achieves a referral and attends treatment at one of the dedicated treatment centres,&#xD;
      the treatment nurses will enquire about any methadone prescription and which pharmacy is&#xD;
      providing the methadone. The participant's medical regimen will be as standard but that there&#xD;
      will be some additional data collection. As this is a real world study patients may be&#xD;
      referred into treatment by other agencies (e.g. drug keyworker) after a positive test; if&#xD;
      tested within pharmacy their data will be captured for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacist-Led Pathway In pharmacies randomised to the Pharmacist pathway, the staff training&#xD;
      and educational materials on HCV testing, HCV treatment, and behaviour change will be&#xD;
      delivered. At the start of the pathway pharmacists will discuss HCV infection with their OST&#xD;
      patients. Those with unknown HCV status will be offered testing using DBS in the pharmacy. In&#xD;
      pharmacies where dried blood spot testing for HCV is not available this will be established.&#xD;
      Patients identified as HCV positive will have a post-test discussion with the pharmacist.&#xD;
      During this discussion the pharmacists will obtain informed consent, explain about HCV&#xD;
      treatment. Next, the pharmacist will offer them anti-HCV therapy in the pharmacy. The&#xD;
      patients who decline study participation will be entered in the screening log. For the&#xD;
      patients who do consent, the pharmacist will complete a pre-treatment checklist of medical&#xD;
      co-morbidities, medical history, concomitant medication to look for drug-drug interactions,&#xD;
      and blood tests including viral parameters. This will also include a set of blood tests to&#xD;
      check full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function testing, including markers of&#xD;
      liver fibrosis (Fib4, APRI, AST:ALT ratio) and viral parameters (genotype and load), this&#xD;
      will be performed outside the pharmacy at a local health care facility that provides a&#xD;
      routine phlebotomy service. These bloods are standard of care for HCV treatment and are not&#xD;
      research specific (i.e., they are also part of the Conventional pathway). If there are no&#xD;
      contra-indications to therapy, the patient will commence the treatment. In patients where&#xD;
      there are contraindications or queries about suitability, the pharmacist will contact the&#xD;
      central clinical co-ordinator for advice. Unsuitable patients will be referred to local&#xD;
      hospital services for assessment outside the study as standard clinical care. The suitable&#xD;
      patients entering treatment will have daily dispensing of therapy drugs with consumption of&#xD;
      antivirals observed at the same time as the OST within the pharmacy (usually 5 or 6 days, so&#xD;
      a modified version of DOT). For doses that patients have to self-administer and the weekend&#xD;
      doses when there is no OST distribution), the pharmacist and patient will make a brief&#xD;
      if-then action plan (an implementation intention) and coping plan (to overcome anticipated&#xD;
      barriers)(19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Patients in OST attending participating pharmacies will be recruited after a new&#xD;
      HCV diagnosis or patients with a previous known diagnosis would be systematically approached&#xD;
      to participate in the trial. Those that agree to enter the trial would provide consent and at&#xD;
      this point be randomised to the different pathways dependent on the pharmacy they are&#xD;
      attending. For the study there would be no further adjustment of the groups so the trial will&#xD;
      be testing the whole pathway of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those patients attending a pharmacy within the DOT cluster, a Pharmacist-led,&#xD;
      protocol-driven checklist for therapy suitability, with medical review available for&#xD;
      participants who fall outside protocol, would be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting Participants Potential participants will be approached by pharmacy staff familiar&#xD;
      with the trial methodology and trained in obtaining informed consent in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation Eight pharmacies will be enrolled to this study. They will be split into two&#xD;
      matched groups based on geography and patient numbers. Four will be allocated to pharmacist&#xD;
      DOT. The four pharmacies allocated to conventional care will refer patients to the local BBV&#xD;
      services. Randomisation will be carried out using http://www.randomization.com . The subjects&#xD;
      are randomized into 1 block. To reproduce this plan, use the seed 12576 along with the number&#xD;
      of subjects per block/number of blocks and (case-sensitive) treatment labels as entered&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Allocation All participants will have HCV testing and genotyping and will be&#xD;
      allocated to conventional BBV treatment based on the HCV genotype. Only those patients who&#xD;
      are genotype 1 will be enrolled in this study. Participants will be allocated to pharmacist&#xD;
      led or conventional pathway; contingency management or not, according to the cluster pharmacy&#xD;
      that they normally use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size - Since this a pilot study no sample size calculation has been performed Overview&#xD;
      of Qualitative Research Components The qualitative research will take the form of a process&#xD;
      evaluation designed to inform aspects of the proposed phase III trial. It will contribute to&#xD;
      assessing the feasibility and acceptability to service users and service providers of using&#xD;
      pharmacies to deliver testing and treatment alongside OST delivery (including identification&#xD;
      of barriers and facilitators); identifying any unintended consequences of participation;&#xD;
      exploring responses to randomization approaches; providing guidance on how the intervention&#xD;
      might be modified for the Phase III randomised controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will be conducted with small samples of (i) service users and (ii) relevant&#xD;
      professionals. This work will expand on qualitative research already undertaken with clients&#xD;
      and professionals in the pilot work and modelling that preceded this study. Qualitative&#xD;
      interviews will be conducted with service users and professionals using semi-structured topic&#xD;
      guides developed in line with the research aims. Topics will not be explored in a&#xD;
      prescriptive manner but as part of an open discussion. This flexible format will enable&#xD;
      additional salient topics and insights to emerge. In broad terms, the focus for the different&#xD;
      respondent groups will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health Economic Assessments - Economic analysis will be undertaken alongside the trial,&#xD;
      utilising the costs, resource use and effectiveness data generated within the trial. For&#xD;
      example, the cost service delivery, staff time, will be collected and combined with other&#xD;
      resource use data. The number of patients achieving SVR at the end of the trial will be&#xD;
      combined with the cost data to calculate the incremental cost per cure for each pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase II trial will establish a workable design and approach in order to reduce the&#xD;
      risks associated with a future definitive phase III multicenter randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      and establish a framework to assess the costs and benefits of using a community pharmacy&#xD;
      pathway to treat HCV in patients participating in an OST program&#xD;
