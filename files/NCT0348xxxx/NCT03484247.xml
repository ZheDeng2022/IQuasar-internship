  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In upper extremity surgery, brachial plexus block (BPB) is routinely applied successfully as&#xD;
      general anesthesia (GA). However, BPB is less invasive technique than GA. Peripheral nerve&#xD;
      blocks have some potential benefits, such as lower risk of nausea and vomiting, early&#xD;
      ambulation, early discharge, and better control of postoperative pain. The BPB is applied to&#xD;
      various areas such as axillary, supraclavicular, infraclavicular and interscalene areas under&#xD;
      the guidance of ultrasound and nerve stimulator. Among these methods, BPB administration&#xD;
      success rates are around 95-100%. The other condition is anesthetic time which is important&#xD;
      for the turnover of operating room. Anesthetic time is the sum of the performance time and&#xD;
      onset time. In addition performance time and number of needle attempts also associated with&#xD;
      patient satisfaction. The primary aim of this study is to determine the number of attempts&#xD;
      and the performance time with the onset time and anesthetic time. If the procedure is simple,&#xD;
      the performance time may be shorter. Therefore, the investigators aim that comparison of two&#xD;
      different procedures which are single injection infraclavicular brachial plexus block and&#xD;
      multiple injection axillary brachial plexus block by ultrasound guidance. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators will examine the duration of anesthesia and surgery, the duration of sensory&#xD;
      and motor block endings, patient comfort and pain scales in the postoperative period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      60 participants who underwent forearm or hand surgery with the axillary or infraclavicular&#xD;
      brachial plexus block method and who have an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical&#xD;
      status classification (ASA) score of I-II-III between the ages of 18-75 will be followed up.&#xD;
      Number of needle attempts, block performance time, sensorial and motor block onset time,&#xD;
      total anesthetic time, surgical duration, duration of sensory block formation, and duration&#xD;
      of motor block formation will be evaluated with the information obtained from participants&#xD;
      with axillary block or infraclavicular block. After surgery, participants satisfaction,&#xD;
      visual analogue scales (VAS), sensory block ending times, motor block ending times and first&#xD;
      analgesic requirement time will be assessed at postoperative 2. -8. -12. -24. hours by&#xD;
      physical examination and questions. As a result of these evaluations, both groups will be&#xD;
      compared statistically. (After the patients are informed in detail, the volunteer certificate&#xD;
      will be obtained from the patients who agree to participate in the study.)&#xD;
