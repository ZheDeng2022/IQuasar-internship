      Phase 1 Open-Label Dose Escalation Study of BDB001 as a Single Agent and in combination with&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab in Subjects with Advanced Solid Tumors&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a study of an experimental drug called BDB001. BDB001 is a Toll-like&#xD;
      receptor (TLR) agonist that activates the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BDB001 as&#xD;
      a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab and to determine the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) when given in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation/dose expansion Phase 1 study of BDB001 as&#xD;
      a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with&#xD;
      histologically-confirmed, incurable, unresectable or metastatic solid tumors that have&#xD;
      relapsed or are refractory to standard therapies or for whom there is no approved therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two separate but independent dose escalation arms: a single&#xD;
      agent arm (BDB001 alone) and a combination arm (BDB001 in combination with pembrolizumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be allowed to continue treatment beyond study termination until occurrence&#xD;
      of significant treatment-related toxicity, progressive disease or discontinuation criteria&#xD;
      are met.&#xD;

Then dosage escalation will follow a traditional 3+3 dose escalation design.&#xD;

When the MTD or RP2D of single agent BDB001 is reached, the first dose level cohort of the combination arm will begin. Once the MTD or RP2D in combination has been determined, twenty additional subjects will be enrolled in the expansion phase of the study.</description>
