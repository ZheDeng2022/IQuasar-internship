      It is a prospective descriptive study to evaluate TMJ disc-condyle-fossa relationship using&#xD;
      MRI scan following functional appliance therapy in skeletal Class II Division 2 malocclusion&#xD;
      in adolescent females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All records, including MRI scans will be collected at three stages and will be traced for&#xD;
      various angular and linear measurements to document the alterations within the condyle&#xD;
      glenoid fossa complex&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stage- I (pre-treatment),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stage- II (after pre-functional therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stage-III (After 6-8 months of functional appliance therapy that is after correction to&#xD;
           Class I molar relation&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Angle's class II division 2 malocclusion is relatively rare. Its frequency lies between 1.5&#xD;
      and 5% of all occlusion in white western population while in north Indian population it is&#xD;
      5.8% Generally in Class II division 2 malocclusion mandibular denture is more distally placed&#xD;
      in relation to maxillary denture, a compensating effect in this type of mandibular retrusion&#xD;
      , which offsets some of the disharmony of the facial profile is that the chin point is&#xD;
      usually very pronounced3. It has been stated that patients with skeletal class II division 2&#xD;
      malocclusion ,when compared with normal class I or class II division I subject have larger&#xD;
      masticatory muscles that in addition are oriented in a more anterior direction. These&#xD;
      characteristics results in significant differences regarding their mechanical advantage and&#xD;
      magnitude of occlusal forces.5 Several investigators have also stated that the mandible is&#xD;
      locked posteriorly in Angle's Class II division 2 malocclusion with deep bite and the&#xD;
      treatment which unlocks the bite during an active growth period can allow the mandible to&#xD;
      grow or be repositioned forward much more than if treatment of unlocking of a bite were not&#xD;
      undertaken. In class II division 2 malocclusion the condyle is positioned posteriorly while&#xD;
      the disk is positioned anteriorly in relation to glenoid fossa. The articular disc in Angle's&#xD;
      class II Division 2 patients could take a relative protrusive position in comparison with the&#xD;
      other Angle's classes of malocclusion .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful treatment of many orthodontic problems depends to a great extent on the amount of&#xD;
      mandibular growth patients experience during treatment. Functional appliances have been used&#xD;
      for nearly 100 years in an attempt to induce mandibular growth by changing muscle function&#xD;
      and condyle glenoid fossa relationships. Several studies have shown that the treatment of&#xD;
      skeletal Class II patients with functional appliances is more successful when initiated&#xD;
      during the adolescent growth spurt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI a multiplanar imaging technique, has the advantage of giving an accurate assessment of&#xD;
      both the bony and the soft tissues.It has high sensitivity for visualization of position and&#xD;
      configuration of disc . This technique is believed to be non-invasive, radiation free and&#xD;
      gives more superior contrast resolution than any other imaging modality. Recent studies have&#xD;
      shown that we can have greater confidence in MRI as diagnostic tool because of improved&#xD;
      quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS- It is a prospective descriptive study to evaluate TMJ&#xD;
      disc-condyle-fossa relationship using MRI scan following functional appliance therapy in&#xD;
      skeletal Class II Division 2 malocclusion in adolescent females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will be conducted in the Department of Orthodontics and Dentofacial&#xD;
      Orthopedics, PGIDS, in association with the Department of Radiology, PGIMS, and Department of&#xD;
      Oral Radiology, PGIDS, Pt B. D. Sharma University of Health Sciences, Rohtak.&#xD;

      Source of data:- The sample size consists of 15 subjects who were selected from the patients&#xD;
      attending regular OPD at the Department of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics for&#xD;
      orthodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TARGET SAMPLE SIZE Sample size on= 13 for present study Calculation based on effect size of&#xD;
      1.23 with standard deviation of 10.5 at 95% confidence interval and 80% power n=2.{Z(&#xD;
      1-α/2)+Z(1-β)} 2/ ∆2 To compansate for 10 % dropout the final sample size will be 15&#xD;
&#xD;
      . INFORMED CONSENT OF THE PATIENT AND AGREEMENT TO BE RANDOMISED A valid, informed written&#xD;
      consent of the patient or parent/ guardian and an agreement to be randomized was obtained&#xD;
      from the patient before registering the patient in this clinical study. Patient or parent/&#xD;
      guardian was informed about all the theoretical risks and benefits of the intervention under&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION AND DESIGN OF STUDY The study sample will consist of 15 growing females with&#xD;
      skeletal class II and Angle's Class II division 2 malocclusion indicated for functional&#xD;
      appliance therapy using Twin Block appliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients attending the regular OPD at the Department of Orthodontics and Dentofacial&#xD;
      Orthopedics will be screened to match the inclusion criteria. Lateral Cephalograms will be&#xD;
      taken to assess CVMI stage and growth pattern. Skeletal Class II Div 2 adolescent females&#xD;
      with growth phase CVMI stage 2-4 having average to horizontal growth pattern as assessed by&#xD;
      SN-MP (Go-Gn) angle will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following detailed clinical examination, cephalometric analysis and treatment planning , the&#xD;
      patients who will be ready to receive treatment will undergo pre-treatment MRI of&#xD;
      condyle-glenoid fossa complex,then these patients will be treated with pre-functional therapy&#xD;
      to correct retroclined incisors. After this, MRI of the TMJ of all these patients will be&#xD;
      taken, that is after unlocking of mandible. Then these patients will undergo functional&#xD;
      appliance therapy to achieve class 1 occlusion for an average of 6-8 months. After that, post&#xD;
      fuctional MRI of the TMJ of all the patients will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI protocol will include T1 weighted (T1W) spin echo sequences (TR 450/TE 15/Fov 160*160&#xD;
      mm), Proton density weighted spin echo sequences (TR 1500/TE 30/Fov 150*150) in coronal&#xD;
      oblique and sagittal oblique planes of 3 mm slice thickness with no interslice gap. All&#xD;
      records, including MRI scans will be collected at three stages and will be traced for various&#xD;
      angular and linear measurements to document the alterations within the condyle glenoid fossa&#xD;
      complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stage- I (pre-treatment),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stage- II (after pre-functional therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stage-III (After 6-8 months of functional appliance therapy that is after correction to&#xD;
           Class I molar relation ANGULAR AND LINEAR MEASUREMENTS The eminence angle and the&#xD;
           sagittal disc position measured in relation to two reference lines: the posterior&#xD;
           condylar line (PC line) and the Frankfurt Horizontal plane (FH Plane). The PC line to be&#xD;
           drawn directly on the MRI scan, while the FH plane transferred from the lateral&#xD;
           cephalogram to the MRI scan, according to the method given by Nebbe et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transfer of FH plane Determination of long axis of the condyle will be done by two step&#xD;
      circle center method by Nebbe et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANGULAR MEASUREMENTS 1-2) The eminence angle and the coronal disc position will be evaluated&#xD;
      by the method described by Chintakanon et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) The sagittal disc position will be evaluated using PC line and FH plane as described by&#xD;
      Chintakanon et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) Sagittal condylar concentricity will be evaluated using the method described by Pullinger&#xD;
      et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5) The glenoid fossa angle will be measured on the sagittal films as the angle between the&#xD;
      tangents to the anterior and posterior slopes of the glenoid fossa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LINEAR MEASUREMENTS 6) Condyle and glenoid fossa displacements: The position of the glenoid&#xD;
      fossa, and that of the condyle, will be evaluated with respect to the centre of the external&#xD;
      auditory meatus (c-EAM). by marking one point at the centre of condyle (c-CH) and the linear&#xD;
      distance of the c-CH from the c-EAM will be evaluated as the shortest distance from the&#xD;
      constructed FH perpendicular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7) Distance between c-PGS (crest of the post-glenoid spine ) &amp; c-EAM : One point will be&#xD;
      marked at the crest of the post-glenoid spine (c-PGS) and the linear distance of the c-PGS&#xD;
      from the c-EAM will be evaluated as the shortest distance from the constructed FH&#xD;
      perpendicular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8) Superior joint space will be measured from the shortest distance between the most superior&#xD;
      point of the condyle and the most superior point of the mandibular fossa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:-The data recorded will be processed by standard statistical analysis&#xD;
