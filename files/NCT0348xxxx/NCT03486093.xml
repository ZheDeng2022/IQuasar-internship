  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central Line-Associated BloodStream Infections (CLABSIs) are responsible for many deaths in&#xD;
      the United States annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several collaboratives have demonstrated the preventability of these infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educational interventions decrease rates of CLABSIs. In addition to training, education, and&#xD;
      surveillance, important prevention practices include the use of chlorhexidine skin&#xD;
      antiseptics and maximal sterile barrier precautions at catheter insertion. Other maintenance&#xD;
      practices include hand hygiene before handling catheters or catheter sites, chlorhexidine for&#xD;
      skin antisepsis with dressing changes, and disinfecting catheter hubs or injection ports with&#xD;
      an appropriate agent before accessing the catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antimicrobial catheter locks, including nonantibiotic antiseptic locks (such as alcohol or&#xD;
      trisodium citrate), have also demonstrated some success in reducing CLABSIs. In particular,&#xD;
      alcohol-impregnated port protectors and needleless neutral pressure connectors significantly&#xD;
      reduced rates of CLABSIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory semi-intensive care units (RICUs) usually work as &quot;step-up&quot; units within acute&#xD;
      care hospitals to manage patients with respiratory failure with non-invasive ventilation.&#xD;
      These units may provide multidisciplinary rehabilitation and serve as a bridge to home-care&#xD;
      programs or long-term care facilities. Some of these RICUs may work also as &quot;step down&quot; units&#xD;
      for difficult to wean patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators performed a single-centre prospective randomized clinical trial with the&#xD;
      aim to assess the efficacy of educational interventions alone and combined with port&#xD;
      protector as adjuvant tool on rate of CLABSIs. Moreover, the investigators evaluated the&#xD;
      effects of previously mentioned interventions on rates of CVC colonizations and contaminated&#xD;
      blood cultures.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study enrolled patients admitted to RICU and it lasted 18 months. Patients were enrolled&#xD;
      when a CVC: 1) was placed during hospitalization in RICU; 2) had already been placed at&#xD;
      admittance and patients didn't show signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)&#xD;
      during first 48h from admission to RICU; 3) had already been placed at admittance without&#xD;
      evidence of microbiologic contamination of blood cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient gave written informed consent. Patients enrolled underwent blood cultures&#xD;
      sampling whenever they showed SIRS signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIRS is defined as 2 or more of the following variables: 1) fever of more than 38°C (100.4°F)&#xD;
      or less than 36°C (96.8°F), 2) heart rate of more than 90 beats per minute, 3) respiratory&#xD;
      rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) of less&#xD;
      than 32mm Hg, 4) abnormal white blood cell count (&gt;12,000/µL or &lt; 4,000/µL or &gt;10% immature&#xD;
      [band] forms). Septic shock was defined as sepsis associated with organ dysfunction and&#xD;
      persistent hypotension despite volume replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to international guidelines, blood cultures were collected simultaneously from both&#xD;
      central line and peripheral blood. So doing, five different mutually exclusive conditions&#xD;
      were identified: 1) significant different time to positivization of blood cultures (at least&#xD;
      2 hours) between central line sample and peripheral sample (sepsis related to CVC - CLABSIs);&#xD;
      2) not significant different time to positivization of blood cultures (sepsis not related to&#xD;
      CVC); 3) positive blood cultures from central line sample and negative from peripheral one&#xD;
      (CVC colonization); 4) negative blood cultures from central line sample and positive from&#xD;
      peripheral one (contaminated blood cultures); 5) negative blood cultures from both peripheral&#xD;
      and central line samples (SIRS not sustained by sepsis). CVCs were removed when conditions 1&#xD;
      and 3 occurred. Catheter tips were collected and prepared for subsequent microbiological&#xD;
      analysis and identified microbial species have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each catheter was designated by type of vessel used (peripheral versus central); site of&#xD;
      insertion (subclavian, femoral, internal jugular, peripheral, and Peripherally Inserted&#xD;
      Central Catheter [PICC]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, for each patient, data concerning provenance, parenteral nutrition, presence of&#xD;
      tracheostomy tube and mechanical ventilation were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, in order to measure the severity of clinical condition of each patient, APACHE III&#xD;
      score and Charlson's Comorbidity Index score were calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological methods The entire medical center is served by a central microbiology&#xD;
      laboratory, which is open from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM, Monday through Saturday.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For adult patients with suspected BSIs, the center's standard of care requires the sequential&#xD;
      collection at 30-min intervals of at least three sets of aerobic and anaerobic BCs (CLSI).&#xD;
      For each set, a 20-mL blood sample is collected via a single venipuncture or intravascular&#xD;
      line access. Skin or access ports are disinfected with alcohol and povidone iodine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood sample is used to inoculate one BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F and Anaerobic bottles (10 mL&#xD;
      of blood each) (Becton Dickinson Instrument Systems, Sparks, Md). The bottles are brought to&#xD;
      the laboratory and incubated up to five days in the BACTEC FX automated blood culture&#xD;
      instrument (Cultures arriving when the laboratory is closed are stored at room temperature in&#xD;
      accordance with manufacturers' instructions). When the growth index of a bottle was positive,&#xD;
      broth aliquots were collected for standard identification studies, which entailed Gram&#xD;
      staining (the results of which were immediately reported to the patient's physician), routine&#xD;
      subculture, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass&#xD;
      spectrometry (MALDI BioTyper, Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Leipzig, Germany) analysis of culture&#xD;
      samples, supplemented when necessary with additional biochemical methods and/or 16S rRNA gene&#xD;
      sequencing. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed using the Vitek 2 system&#xD;
      (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Confirmatory MIC testing for oxyimino-cephalosporins&#xD;
      and carbapenems was carried out by Etest (bioMérieux). Results were interpreted according to&#xD;
      the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints (EUCAST&#xD;
      table).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The study was divided in two periods of equal duration time (9 months): a&#xD;
      preliminary prospective observational period (phase I) and a subsequent prospective&#xD;
      interventional period (phase II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During phase II, two interventional strategies have been adopted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. at the beginning of interventional study and then every 45 days, physicians and nurses&#xD;
           of RICU have been trained and retrained to GAVECELT (&quot;Long Term Venous Central Lines&quot;&#xD;
           Open Group - www.gavecelt.it) &quot;bundle&quot; recommendations concerning the management of CVC.&#xD;
           The bundle includes: hand hygiene and precautions for protection and safety, adequate&#xD;
           insertion site, echo-guided placement of central venous line, use of clorexidine 2% for&#xD;
           skin disinfection of insertion site chosen and subsequent continuous or discontinuous&#xD;
           disinfection of exit site, use of suture-less devices, use of transparent semi-permeable&#xD;
           dressing whenever applicable and immediate removal of catheter when no longer needed.&#xD;
           Moreover, in order to reduce the use of unnecessary catheters, the investigators&#xD;
           regularly evaluated the need for CVCs for both patients admitted to RICU and patients&#xD;
           moved out of the ICU and unnecessary catheters were promptly removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After the first training meeting, the use of Curos® Disinfecting Port Protector for&#xD;
           needleless valves port-protector (CUROS, 70% isopropyl alcohol-impregnated, Ivera&#xD;
           Medical, San Diego, California, US) has been introduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ruled in during the interventional period have been randomized into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. patients with CVC managed by healthcare workers trained/retrained to GAVECELT&#xD;
           recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with CVC managed by healthcare workers trained/retrained to GAVECELT&#xD;
           recommendations with the aid of port protector devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curos® Disinfecting Port Protector is a passive disinfection device that luer-locks securely&#xD;
      onto needleless IV ports to disinfect in 3 minutes. If not removed, ports stay clean and&#xD;
      protected for 7 days. The Curos® is intended for use on swabbable luer access valves as a&#xD;
      disinfecting cleaner prior to line access and to act as a physical barrier to contamination&#xD;
      between line accesses. Curos disinfects the valve three minutes after application and acts as&#xD;
      a physical barrier to contamination for up to seven days if not removed.&#xD;
