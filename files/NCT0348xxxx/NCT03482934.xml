      To recognize predictors of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients in Assiut&#xD;
      government &amp; to recognize the prognostic effect of central blood pressure measurement versus&#xD;
      office brachial blood pressure measurement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many cohort studies have demonstrated that hypertension is a strong risk factor for total&#xD;
      mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in both developing and developed countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although brachial blood pressure (BP) mea¬surements have been used for over a century more&#xD;
      and more data suggest that measuring of brachial BP has important limitations. First, a few&#xD;
      office BP readings may not be representa¬tive of BP during a patient's daily life. Second,&#xD;
      brachial BP may differ from systolic BP mea¬sured at the level of the ascending aorta, i.e.&#xD;
      central BP, which is responsible for left ventri¬cle afterload and determines blood flow&#xD;
      through coronary and brain arteries .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data from the Strong Heart Study confirm earlier results from smaller studies on&#xD;
      high-risk patients that central pulse pressure is superior to brachial pulse pressure in the&#xD;
      prediction of further cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the Conduit Artery Function Evaluation (CAFE) study reminded clinicians of the&#xD;
      importance of CBP. Those results demonstrated significant differences in CBP (central SBP and&#xD;
      PP) between patient groups treated with different antihypertensive regimens even though&#xD;
      peripheral BP levels were comparably lowered, and suggested the potential superiority of CBP&#xD;
      to cuff brachial BP in cardiovascular prognostic predictive value in hypertensive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modifiable risk factors for CVD that are common among adults with hypertension include&#xD;
      cigarette smoking/tobacco smoke exposure, DM, dyslipidemia (including high levels of&#xD;
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or hypercholesterolemia, high levels of triglycerides,&#xD;
      and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), overweight/obesity, physical&#xD;
      inactivity/low fitness level, and unhealthy diet .&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are clear examples around the world of ethnic variations in response to drug therapies&#xD;
      epitomized by the benefits of thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers in lowering BP&#xD;
      in blacks and perhaps in older people of all races, whereas blockers of the renin angiotensin&#xD;
      system and β-adrenoceptor receptor blockers are just as effective in some other populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urbanization is a factor that profoundly affects BP patterns. In developed countries,&#xD;
      hypertension is more common in rural populations than in urban. This pattern is reversed in&#xD;
      developing, lower-, and middle-income countries where the first impact of rising rates of&#xD;
      hypertension is seen in urban communities.&#xD;
