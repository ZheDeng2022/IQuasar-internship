  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Three pieces of information lead to the basis for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Individuals with Type-2 diabetes commonly develop peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increased production of the hormone amylin occurs in individuals who have Type-2&#xD;
           diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Aggregations of amylin was found in the peripheral vasculature of rats that&#xD;
           overexpressed human amylin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a correlation exists between the amount of&#xD;
      amylin present in the upper extremities of human subjects with Type-2 diabetes and the extent&#xD;
      to which symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are expressed in those subjects. The investigators&#xD;
      will be testing this by initially collecting blood and skin biopsy samples from subjects,&#xD;
      followed by measuring patient sensation and pain responses to heat, cold, and pressure in the&#xD;
      upper extremities.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Impaired blood flow through microvessels (arterioles and capillaries) leads to irreversible&#xD;
      damage to cells within the affected watershed. In addition to hypertension and age, Type-2&#xD;
      diabetes (DMII) independently contributes to microvascular disease. Distinct from other&#xD;
      diabetic complications, the impact of diabetes on neurovascular function has not clearly been&#xD;
      shown to correlate with measures of hyperglycemia or peripheral glucose regulation. The&#xD;
      pathophysiology underlying the association between type-2 diabetes, vascular injury and&#xD;
      neural damage, including CNS parenchymal loss and PNS neuropathy, remains uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normally amylin, a byproduct of the synthesis of insulin by pancreatic Î²-cells, crosses the&#xD;
      blood brain barrier and binds to neurons in feeding centers where it is believed to induce&#xD;
      anorexic effects. Amylin aggregates are found in microvessels of pancreas, brain, hearts and&#xD;
      kidneys of individuals with DMII or obesity. The investigators have demonstrated amylin&#xD;
      aggregates in microvessels of peripheral nerves in rats overexpressing human amylin&#xD;
      (unpublished). It is unknown whether amylin deposits are a consequence or a trigger of&#xD;
      vascular injury, but they are clearly associated and may present a potential target for&#xD;
      reducing diabetes-associated microvascular disease. Furthermore, their accumulation in&#xD;
      peripheral nerve microvasculature and red blood cells (RBCs) offers possible foci for a&#xD;
      peripheral biomarker of diabetes-induced CNS microvascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients with DMII have significant amylin deposition in the peripheral vasa&#xD;
      nervorum and on RBCs that correlates with severity of clinical peripheral polyneuropathy and&#xD;
      reduction of peripheral nerve conduction velocities (NCVs); these amylin measures thereby&#xD;
      become surrogates of microvascular disease and may serve as metrics of disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: Obtain serum HbA1c, skin punch biopsy, RBCs, NCVs and clinical sensory examination from&#xD;
      forty consenting adults previously diagnosed with DMII. Skin biopsy from volar forearm and&#xD;
      red blood cell samples will be processed for amylin deposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will provide preliminary data to fuel a larger, potentially multi-center,&#xD;
      clinical trial investigating the utility of peripheral amylin or RBC amylin as a quantitative&#xD;
      biomarker of microvascular disease that would include monitoring the effect of potential&#xD;
      therapies. Measuring serum HbA1c will allow for possible correlation to chronic extracellular&#xD;
      glucose concentration. Based on our preliminary data from a rat model of type-2 diabetes that&#xD;
      expresses human amylin in the pancreas, the investigators anticipate an increased amylin&#xD;
      deposition in the skin blood vessels with the progression of type-2 diabetes as measured by&#xD;
      sensory examination and NCVs. Although not directly measured in this study, our preliminary&#xD;
      data from the analysis of amylin deposition in cerebral blood vessels of patients with type-2&#xD;
      diabetes suggest that APOE 4 carriers, at risk for developing dementia, may have an increased&#xD;
      propensity to accumulate amylin deposits in blood vessels. Thus, the ability to easily&#xD;
      identify and target a potential driver of microvascular disease may help prevent the&#xD;
      devastating effects of the vascular complications of DMII, including cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      retinopathy, nephropathy and dementia.&#xD;
