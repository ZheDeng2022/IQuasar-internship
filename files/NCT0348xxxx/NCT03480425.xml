    <textblock>
      A study of a new approach to determining if, following endotracheal intubation, the&#xD;
      endotracheal tube (ETT) is in the trachea or the esophagus. The test for correct placement&#xD;
      consists of inflating the cuff to a pressure of 50 (to be determined by the study) and&#xD;
      tugging the ETT gently up and out of the mouth. The investigators hypothesize that if it is&#xD;
      in the esophagus, it will slide easily all the way out; if in the trachea, the cuff will be&#xD;
      impeded by catching on the lower surface of the cricoid ring, and that this will require a&#xD;
      greater force to extubate with cuff inflated than that required for the esophagus.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Correct endotracheal tube (ETT) placement is important. Ideal ETT position is achieved when&#xD;
      the distal tip is in mid-trachea with the head in neutral alignment. Unrecognized tube&#xD;
      misplacement is an uncommon but significant cause of hypoxemia and death during general&#xD;
      anesthesia and emergency intubation of critically ill patients. It is commoner in&#xD;
      out-of-hospital intubations, where it is reported to occur in 1 to 15% of cases, often with&#xD;
      disastrous results. 1, 2 Three types of malpositioning can occur: one outside the trachea&#xD;
      (esophageal), and two within the trachea: too shallow (hypopharyngeal), or too deep&#xD;
      (endobronchial). Esophageal intubation results in rapid hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and inflation&#xD;
      of the stomach as the patient receives no ventilation at all. 3 Too-shallow placement of the&#xD;
      ETT can result in inadvertent extubation, especially with manipulation of head and neck. 4&#xD;
      Endobronchial intubation occurs when the ETT is advanced into a mainstem bronchus, which&#xD;
      results in hypoxia and the potential for barotrauma in the hyperventilated lung. 5, 6&#xD;
      Confirmation of correct ETT depth is currently performed by several methods. In the operating&#xD;
      room, simple measurement of the length of the tube at the corner of the mouth is rapid but&#xD;
      not reliable. One study improved on this by using additional anatomical landmarks to&#xD;
      determine ETT tube length as measured at the mouth.7 It enabled a reduction in the incidence&#xD;
      of too-deep placement of the ETT from 58.8% to 24%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cuff ballottement at the level of the suprasternal notch is a technique that has been studied&#xD;
      with cuffed tubes in adults. Ballottement as described in these papers involves moving the&#xD;
      fingers in a direction normal to the long axis of the ETT in order to alternately compress&#xD;
      and release the finger pressure on the cuff, while feeling and watching the corresponding&#xD;
      movement of the pilot balloon. Ease of palpation of ballottement was inconsistent, and in one&#xD;
      study 15 of 82 patients had ETT tips &lt;2.5 cm above the carina. 8-10 Studies to date of&#xD;
      ballottement do not comment on its ability to prevent esophageal intubation. Ultrasound&#xD;
      guided intubation has been shown to provide correct placement, but requires training and&#xD;
      machine availability. 11-14 We proposed to refine methods of palpating the trachea that we&#xD;
      studied in previous experiments. We found that palpation of the anterior trachea with the&#xD;
      fingertips during intubation enabled us to feel the tip of the endotracheal tube sliding into&#xD;
      the trachea and improve correct depth compared to measurement at the teeth. 15 That study was&#xD;
      undertaken to determine whether palpation of the trachea could enable correct position of the&#xD;
      endotracheal tube with respect to depth. Esophageal intubation was studied subsequently, but&#xD;
      the study was stopped when it became clear that we could not determine esophageal intubation&#xD;
      by anterior tracheal palpation (unpublished).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, during two instances of inadvertent esophageal intubation, we accidentally&#xD;
      discovered a technique that may be able to detect inadvertent esophageal intubation as well&#xD;
      as ensure correct endotracheal tube depth. Following tracheal intubation, with the cuff&#xD;
      inflated to 50cm water pressure in the trachea, there was a sudden marked increase in the&#xD;
      force necessary to gently tug the endotracheal tube proximally as the inflated cuff impinges&#xD;
      on the rigid, encircling cricoid cartilage. When the increased force is sensed, then pushing&#xD;
      the ETT down 2cm will ensure it is correctly positioned. If the cuff is in the esophagus, it&#xD;
      will slide out without the sudden increased force being felt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan a clinical pilot study of intubation of esophagus versus trachea with initial&#xD;
      intubation of the esophagus flowed by intubation of the trachea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses. The force required for esophageal extubation with cuff inflated will be that&#xD;
      required for tracheal extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome. To assess the reliability and accuracy of TETT as a method to determine&#xD;
      tracheal versus esophageal intubation by measuring the force needed to slowly pull the ETT&#xD;
      from the esophagus versus from the trachea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes. To find the optimal cuff-inflation pressure to distinguish trachea from&#xD;
      esophagus and to assess the reliability and accuracy of TETT as a method to determine depth&#xD;
      of endotracheal tube in the trachea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design. A clinical trial with an objective measure of the difference in force of&#xD;
      tugging between esophagus and trachea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient safety. Intentional esophageal intubation has been reported in three previous airway&#xD;
      studies with no harm coming to 275 patients. 16-18 Intentional intubation of the esophagus&#xD;
      has been practiced routinely for gastroscopy in millions of patients. Mortality attributable&#xD;
      to esophageal endoscopy is exceedingly low (0.005-0.01%), includes very sick patients, and&#xD;
      occurs only with interventions such as biopsy and cautery of esophageal varices.19 In a&#xD;
      prospective study of resident trainees performing upper G.I. endoscopy (N = 4,490), there&#xD;
      were no complications attributable to insertion of the gastroscope in the upper third of the&#xD;
      esophagus.20 The manoeuvre takes only about 10 seconds, then the opposite orifice can be&#xD;
      intubated, with mask oxygenation between intubations if indicated. In a just-completed study&#xD;
      of moving and ETT upward in the trachea with the cuff inflated to 50cm H2O pressure we found&#xD;
      no increase in sore throat as a surrogate for tracheal damage in patients who had the ETT&#xD;
      moved with cuff inflated compared to standard care (manuscript in preparation). 21 A recent&#xD;
      study conducted at University of Saskatchewan showed that there is great variance in cuff&#xD;
      inflation pressures clinically (manuscript in preparation), with pressures often exceeding&#xD;
      120 cm H2O pressure with no apparent adverse effects for inflation during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Utility. If this technique proves reliable, it can decrease the risk of ETT&#xD;
      misplacement. Further, if it is reliable, it is particularly useful because it takes no&#xD;
      special equipment, can be performed in less than 10 seconds anywhere from operating room to&#xD;
      battlefield, and may make xray confirmation of ETT depth unnecessary, avoiding radiation and&#xD;
      expense.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients: Following University of Saskatchewan Research Ethics Board and Saskatoon&#xD;
           Health Region approval, informed consent will be obtained from 20 patient participants.&#xD;
           The collection, use and disclosure of patients' private information will conform to the&#xD;
           Health Information Protection Act (HIPA). A convenience sample of American Society of&#xD;
           Anesthesiologists (ASA) Class I and II patients â‰¥18 years, undergoing elective surgical&#xD;
           procedures in the Saskatoon acute care hospitals of the Saskatoon Health Region and&#xD;
           requiring endotracheal intubation as a component of the anesthetic plan, will be&#xD;
           recruited. 22 Recruitment will take place in the Pre-Admission Clinic (PAC); in the Same&#xD;
           Day Surgery and Day Surgery admission areas; and in the Operating Room (OR) Holding&#xD;
           Area. Excluded patients will be those who are physiologically unstable, if there is&#xD;
           urgency to proceed with surgery, patients requiring rapid sequence induction, and those&#xD;
           with respiratory distress. The anesthesiologists will be encouraged to exclude patients&#xD;
           if for any reason they feel that inclusion puts them at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Testers: we will recruit and explain the manoeuvre to willing anesthesia staff,&#xD;
           residents, and anesthesia assistants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Intubation will be by the attending anesthesiologist, who will choose the&#xD;
      intubating anesthetic and equipment on clinical grounds. The anesthesiologists will intubate&#xD;
      the esophagus first, and inflate the ETT cuff to their customary pressure, which we will then&#xD;
      measure. An apparatus including a force transducer (LoadStar F-152217557 S-beam sensor run on&#xD;
      LoadVue software; Loadstar Sensors Ltd., Fremont CA, USA) will be attached to the ETT&#xD;
      connector and the testers will perform the gentle tugging while recording the force of pull&#xD;
      until the ETT comes out of the esophagus. The process will be repeated with the trachea. At&#xD;
      this point the anesthesiologist will intubate the trachea and proceed with surgical&#xD;
      anesthesia. Only one set of intubations will be tested on any participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: Data will be recorded on paper data sheets for later transcription to a&#xD;
      computer spread sheet for analysis. Usual demographics (age, gender, height, weight, type of&#xD;
      surgery) will be recorded. Force transducer data will be digitally recorded on a computer for&#xD;
      later analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size. Assuming that the anesthesiologist is able to intubate the esophagus&#xD;
      successfully 100% of the time in this population, and the palpation technique is able to&#xD;
      detect the esophageal intubation correctly only 50% of the time, we will need 15 participants&#xD;
      assuming an alpha value of 0.05 and a beta value of 0.2 with Yates correction. Therefore,&#xD;
      accounting for unforeseen exigencies, we will plan to recruit 20 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Demographics will be reported. Forces will be compared with paired&#xD;
      t-tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1. Diagnosis of esophageal intubation. Test â†“ Truth â†’ T E totals T E totals&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will plot and subtract the force change from esophagus from the force change from trachea&#xD;
      at the various pressures and construct a receiver operating curve to show the optimal cuff&#xD;
      inflation pressure.&#xD;

          <description>Esophagus is intentionally intubated with a cuffed endotracheal tube, the cuff inflated to &gt;30cm water pressure, a force transducer attached, and force of extubation recorded. Then Trachea is intentionally intubated the cuff inflated to &gt;30cm water pressure, and force of extubation recorded.&#xD;
Measuring extubation force: Intubation of the esophagus of anesthetized participants who are having planned endotracheal intubate for surgery; inflation of the cuff; attachment of a force transducer to the tube connector; and gently tugging the tube out of the mouth. Then intubating the esophagus and repeating the tugging procedure. Meanwhile, the force of resistance to tugging is measured with a force transducer.</description>
