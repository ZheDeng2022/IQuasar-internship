  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well neutron radiation therapy and pembrolizumab work in&#xD;
      treating participants with urothelial carcinoma that has spread to other places in the body.&#xD;
      Neutron radiation therapy uses high energy neutrons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Giving radiation therapy and pembrolizumab may work better than radiation alone in&#xD;
      treating participants with urothelial carcinoma that has spread to other places in the body.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the overall response rate to neutron radiation (with high relative biological&#xD;
      effectiveness relative to standard photon radiation) to a metastatic focus in combination&#xD;
      with standard of care checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy (pembrolizumab), in patients with&#xD;
      advanced urothelial carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Progression free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Safety and tolerability as evaluated by the incidence, severity, duration, causality,&#xD;
      seriousness, and type(s) of adverse events as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
      Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 22. On day 23,&#xD;
      participants may undergo an optional tumor biopsy and receive 3-5 treatments of neutron&#xD;
      radiation therapy over 2 weeks on days 23-42. Participants receive pembrolizumab IV on day 43&#xD;
      and continue per standard of care in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;
