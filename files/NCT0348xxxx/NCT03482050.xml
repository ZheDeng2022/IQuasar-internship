  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of transplantation of Astrocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells, in&#xD;
      patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no change in the routine ALS treatment of the patients enrolled into the study.&#xD;
      Treatment will be administered in addition to the appropriate standard of care treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that transplantation of Astrocyte(AstroRx) cells can compensate for&#xD;
      the malfunctioning of patients' own astrocytes by restoring physiological capabilities like&#xD;
      the reuptake of excessive glutamate, reducing oxidative stress, reducing other toxic&#xD;
      compounds, as well as by secreting different neuroprotective factors&#xD;
