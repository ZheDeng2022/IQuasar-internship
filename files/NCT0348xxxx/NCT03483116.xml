  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the serum IgA response of three dose levels of the&#xD;
      oral RV3-BB vaccine when administered in a neonatal schedule or when administered as a high&#xD;
      dose in an infant schedule.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the cumulative anti-rotavirus serum IgA&#xD;
      response (defined as a ≥3 fold increase from baseline) 4 weeks after 3 doses of RV3-BB&#xD;
      administered in a neonatal schedule at a High, Mid or low vaccine titre. In addition the&#xD;
      cumulative anti-rotavirus serum IgA response (defined as a ≥3 fold increase from baseline) 4&#xD;
      weeks after 3 doses of RV3-BB administered in an infant schedule at a high dose of vaccine&#xD;
      will be assessed along with cumulative vaccine take and components of vaccine take after 3&#xD;
      doses of RV3-BB administered in a neonatal or infant schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and tolerability of RV3-BB when administered as an infant or as a neonatal&#xD;
      schedule will be described.&#xD;
