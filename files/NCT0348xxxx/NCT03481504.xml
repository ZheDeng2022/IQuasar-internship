  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Chronic pain is a highly prevalent phenomenon with a large impact on the&#xD;
      individual's wellbeing. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) can be used to help patients&#xD;
      relate to chronic pain in a way that helps improve their quality of life. This paper&#xD;
      introduces an ACT protocol specific to chronic pain patients: ACT- Exposure and Perspective&#xD;
      Taking (ACT-EPT). Aspects specific to this therapy are the focus on exposure as a means to&#xD;
      elicit behavioural and emotional change regarding pain experience and it's format as a&#xD;
      compact individual therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Investigators conduct a single case experimental study (ABA design) with a&#xD;
      multiple baseline design, aimed at assessing the effectiveness of the experimental ACT-EPT&#xD;
      protocol (phase B) compared to usual care (phase A) in individual chronic pain patients.&#xD;
      Outcomes include the increase of participation in daily life and health related quality of&#xD;
      life, measured with the Short Form-12 (SF-12). Quantitative results will be combined with&#xD;
      qualitative results from interviews in a mixed methods design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Five adults with chronic pain referred to a rehabilitation centre (≥18 years&#xD;
      old).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Phases A and B together take 16 weeks for each participant, during which weekly&#xD;
      quantitative measurements will be taken. The length of the first phase A will be randomised.&#xD;
      The intervention (phase B) consists of weekly ACT-EPT sessions with a maximum of 3 sessions&#xD;
      of approximately 90 minutes each. Individual interviews will take place after the last&#xD;
      quantitative measurements. These focus on two topics: psychological processes of change and&#xD;
      evaluating the intervention.&#xD;

      Rationale: Chronic pain is a phenomenon with a large impact on the individual's wellbeing and&#xD;
      is a problem with a large global burden of disease, with a prevalence of 19 to 20% in&#xD;
      European adults and an annual cost of €200 billion in Europe. Apart from causing physical&#xD;
      suffering, chronic pain can lead to depression, suicidal thoughts and disrupted social&#xD;
      relationships and can cause impairments in everyday life tasks and activities. Despite the&#xD;
      seriousness of chronic pain, not all chronic pain patients receive adequate treatment. One&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy treatment which is used in the Netherlands for chronic pain&#xD;
      patients is the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). However, the way in which this&#xD;
      therapy is delivered in the Netherlands tends to take many sessions. It therefore seems&#xD;
      attractive to investigate a short version of this protocol, which was developed in Sweden.&#xD;
      This short version, ACT-EPT, is already being used in the Netherlands on a small scale but&#xD;
      its effects have not yet been studied. The current paper proposes a pilot study with an&#xD;
      innovative N-of-1 design to investigate this therapy's effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Investigating the effectiveness of an experimental protocol of Acceptance and&#xD;
      Commitment Therapy-Exposure &amp; Perspective Taking (ACT-EPT) compared to usual care in&#xD;
      individual chronic pain patients on the increase of their participation in daily life and&#xD;
      health related quality of life, as measured with the SF-12 in a study with a single case&#xD;
      experimental methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The randomized n=1 study combines a quantitative and a consecutive qualitative&#xD;
      part (mixed methods). Each participant receives the intervention and serves as his or her own&#xD;
      control in an AB design. In phase A, all participants continue the care they already received&#xD;
      which will be recorded as their care as usual. At a random moment, phase A will end and&#xD;
      participants will start their intervention, thus entering phase B. This study randomizes&#xD;
      participants on the duration of phase A, which means that the lengths of phases A and B&#xD;
      differs among participants. The total study period (A+B) over which participants will receive&#xD;
      weekly measurements is the same for all participants (16 weeks). Results will be presented on&#xD;
      an individual basis according to the single case experimental methodology. In the last week&#xD;
      of the total period, participants will be invited for an interview with a researcher&#xD;
      focussing on their experience living with chronic pain and to evaluate the intervention. This&#xD;
      interview will take place in the participants' own environment. Methodological details of all&#xD;
      aspects of the design will be explained further in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Chronic pain patients of 18 years or older referred the Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Centre Winnock Zorg in Heerlen or Arnhem for treatment (n=5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The ACT-EPT treatment protocol is a type of acceptance-based cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy, aimed to increase patients' participation by improving their level of&#xD;
      coping with chronic pain. The therapy takes between one and three sessions of about an hour&#xD;
      and a half each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome measure of this study is the SF-12.&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures are the AAQ-II-P, PIPS, PSK, PDI, NPRS , IPA, FFMQ-SF and the ELS.&#xD;
      The PSK will only be used for clinical purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: No risks are associated with this study. The load for the participants consists&#xD;
      of the weekly filling out of a limited amount of questionnaires and the participation in a&#xD;
      one hour interview. The number of questionnaires that patients are asked to fill out differs&#xD;
      per week, with a lowest load per week of 8 minutes and the highest load at baseline of 55&#xD;
      minutes. The total time taken to fill out all questionnaires over the 16 week period is 6&#xD;
      hours and 55 minutes, with an average of 26 minutes per week. Detailed information can be&#xD;
      found in the questionnaires table in the protocol. The intervention takes between one and&#xD;
      three sessions of about an hour and a half each, and is given in the rehabilitation centre.&#xD;

    <description>The SF-12 measures overall quality of life and includes items that assess participation. The SF-12 is a frequently used measure and has shown to have good internal consistency, reliability, construct validity and responsiveness in patients with chronic (low) back pain (Luo et al., 2003). The measure is a subset of 12 items from the SF-36 including 6 items from the physical summary measure (PCS) and 6 items from the mental summary measure (MCS).</description>
