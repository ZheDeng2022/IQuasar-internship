  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathogen reduction (PR) system for Whole Blood (WB) using Amustaline (S-303) and&#xD;
      Glutathione (GSH) has a potential to decrease transfusion-transmitted infection. There is&#xD;
      scientific basis to hypothesize, that cells containing DNA and RNA such as bacteria, viruses&#xD;
      and parasites that could be present in blood collected from asymptomatic infected donors are&#xD;
      inactivated in the treated whole blood and therefore reduce the risk of&#xD;
      transfusion-transmitted infections. The aim of the study is to gather data to support the&#xD;
      safety of whole blood products that underwent treatment with amustaline and glutathione and&#xD;
      data to support a larger sufficiently powered efficacy study. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      safety of the system for whole blood in adult patients with anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a randomized, controlled, open-label study. The aim is to explore&#xD;
      the safety of the whole blood product treated with a PR system using amustaline and&#xD;
      glutathione.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 20 patients with anemia. 20 patients will be randomized either to&#xD;
      treated WB (Test) or Standard of Care, either Red Blood Cells or Whole Blood (Control).&#xD;

      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potentially eligible patients at the participating institution will be approached for&#xD;
      study consent prior to study transfusion. Enrolled patients will be asked for consent to the&#xD;
      storage of their samples for a future project in TTI Project. Illiterate patients can be&#xD;
      consented by an impartial witness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who consent to the study will be assigned a study ID number and undergo screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening data collection and procedures will include: Demographics (age, sex), vital signs,&#xD;
      height, weight, indication for anticipated transfusion, medical history including history of&#xD;
      bleeding and transfusion and concomitant medications. A physical examination, including skin&#xD;
      inspection, will be performed. Blood samples will be drawn for a hematological panel&#xD;
      (including complete blood count, blood chemistry, blood type, coagulation (aPTT, PT and/or&#xD;
      INR) and pregnancy test (if applicable). Immunohematology tests will be performed in a&#xD;
      patient's sample at the blood transfusion center. This includes the Direct Antibody Test&#xD;
      (DAT), immune reactivity to RBCs that have been processed with the INTERCEPT Blood System&#xD;
      (IBS RBC), red cell alloantibody screen (Indirect Antibody Test (IAT) / Indirect Coombs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples (pre/post-treatment) for future research on transfusion-transmitted infections&#xD;
      will be archived in a biobank of the Institut Pasteur de CÃ´te d'Ivoire (IPCI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After successful screening, eligible patients will be assigned to a treatment arm by&#xD;
      randomization. Randomization will be performed in the blood center by sequentially selecting&#xD;
      a randomization envelope starting with the lowest number (e.g., 1 for the first eligible&#xD;
      subject in ascending order up to envelope number 20 for the 20th subject).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ratio of patients assigned to the Test and Control group will be 1:1. Each subject will&#xD;
      receive a Test product or SOC. The assigned blood product number must be noted on the&#xD;
      randomization assignment envelope and on the release form. The product number will also be&#xD;
      entered into the case report form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The replacement strategy in this Phase I clinical trial is based on the aim to reach twenty&#xD;
      evaluable patients (&quot;evaluable patients&quot; is defined as those patients who are randomized and&#xD;
      receive any study transfusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a randomized subject withdraws or is withdrawn from the study prior to the administration&#xD;
      of any study transfusion, or does not receive any study transfusion through 7-days&#xD;
      post-randomization, this subject will be replaced by the next eligible subject using the same&#xD;
      randomization envelope. If a randomized subject receives a conventional (untreated) blood&#xD;
      transfusion prior to study transfusion, the patient will be replaced as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who received at least one study product will be included into the analysis of&#xD;
      evaluable patients and followed up to the final study visit on Day 58.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All used and unused randomization envelopes will be kept in the Site File for reconciliation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-transfusion visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs, height, weight, hemoglobin will be assessed and urine dipstick test for&#xD;
      detection of blood will be performed. If the patient consented to future research on TTI, a&#xD;
      sample is drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be transfused with one investigational product or SOC on Day 1. In case he or&#xD;
      she requires further transfusion support to treat anemia, enrolled patients may be treated&#xD;
      with a second study transfusion. A patient who requires a second blood component will receive&#xD;
      a second treatment with a study product from the assigned treatment arm. This patient will be&#xD;
      included into the analysis of evaluable patients and followed up to Day 58, the end of study&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-transfusion visit(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be hospitalized for 24 hours after each study transfusion to allow close&#xD;
      monitoring and data collection uniquely for the study purpose since their condition would&#xD;
      allow an outpatient treatment. 3 hours and 6 hours after initiating each study transfusion&#xD;
      vital signs, skin inspection, and urine dipstick will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24-hours post-transfusion vital signs, concomitant medication/intervention will be assessed,&#xD;
      laboratory samples for hemoglobin, coagulation assays (aPTT, PT and/or INR) and potassium and&#xD;
      a sample for determination of residual S-300 will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject consented to future research on TTI, a second blood sample (post-transfusion)&#xD;
      will be taken and archived in the biobank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case clinical symptoms of transfusion-related bacterial contamination occur, a blood&#xD;
      sample will be taken during the post-transfusion period and sent for microbiological&#xD;
      analysis. Those patients will be treated according to local SOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Follow-up visit Day 28 (+/-3 days after last study transfusion):&#xD;
&#xD;
      At day 28 (+/-3 days) a physical examination, vitals and blood samples will be collected for&#xD;
      laboratory analysis of safety variables (e.g., complete blood count, coagulation, blood&#xD;
      chemistry) and urine dipstick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Adverse Events (AE), Transfusion Reactions (TR) and unanticipated adverse device effects&#xD;
      will be reviewed and recorded for the period from the first study transfusion through day 28&#xD;
      after the last study transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will assess each AE/TR for relation to the study transfusion. Available&#xD;
      clinical diagnostic tools will be used to classify occurring transfusion reactions by the&#xD;
      definitions of Swissmedic grading scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final study visit Day 58 (+/-7 days after last study transfusion) At the final study visit,&#xD;
      the immune reactivity of patient serum to RBCs treated with amustaline/GSH and a DAT test&#xD;
      will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAEs will be reviewed and recorded for the period of 58 days up to the final study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will assess each Serious Adverse Event (SAE) for relation to the study&#xD;
      transfusion. Depending on the availability of clinical diagnostic tools, the transfusion&#xD;
      reactions will be classified by the definitions of Swissmedic grading scale.&#xD;
