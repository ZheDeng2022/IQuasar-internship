    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well copanlisib hydrochloride and nivolumab work in treating&#xD;
      patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma that&#xD;
      has come back (recurrent) or does not responded to the treatment (refractory). Copanlisib&#xD;
      hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's&#xD;
      immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow&#xD;
      and spread. Giving copanlisib hydrochloride and nivolumab may work better in treating&#xD;
      patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma&#xD;
      compared to standard of care.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess overall response rate (ORR) defined as complete response rate (CR) plus partial&#xD;
      response rate (PR) (ORR = CR + PR) of the combination of copanlisib hydrochloride&#xD;
      (copanlisib) and nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma&#xD;
      (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety of the combination of nivolumab and copanlisib in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory DLBCL and PMBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the progression free survival, duration of response, complete response rate&#xD;
      and overall survival of the combination of copanlisib and nivolumab in patients with relapsed&#xD;
      or refractory DLBCL and PMBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE STUDY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the effects of the copanlisib and nivolumab combination regimen on tumor&#xD;
      cells, tumor microenvironment and the immune response in relapsed/refractory DLBCL and PMBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess predictors of response of the combination in relapsed/refractory DLBCL and&#xD;
      PMBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive copanlisib hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8 and 15&#xD;
      of cycles 1-8 and days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles. Patients also receive nivolumab IV over&#xD;
      30 minutes on days 1 and 15 of cycles 1-8 and on day 1 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 100 days.&#xD;

               -  The effects of copanlisib and nivolumab on the developing human fetus are&#xD;
                  unknown; for this reason, and because the study drugs used in this trial are&#xD;
                  known to be teratogenic, females of child-bearing potential must agree to use&#xD;
                  adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)&#xD;

             primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma who develop systemic recurrence&#xD;
             following standard therapy may be included as long as no active CNS disease is present&#xD;
             at the time or enrollment; similarly, patients with secondary involvement of the CNS&#xD;
             from a systemic lymphoma may be included as long as the CNS disease has been optimally&#xD;
             treated and they demonstrate no evidence of active CNS disease&#xD;

             composition to copanlisib and/or nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Co-morbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment&#xD;
             of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or&#xD;
             interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the&#xD;
             prescribed regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;

             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because copanlisib and nivolumab are&#xD;
             agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is&#xD;
             an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with copanlisib or nivolumab, breastfeeding should be&#xD;

             (with minimal systemic absorption); physiologic replacement doses of systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids are permitted, even if =&lt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents; a brief&#xD;
             course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for&#xD;
             treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction&#xD;
             caused by contact allergen) is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had evidence of active or acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal&#xD;
             abscess, and gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction which are known risk factors for bowel&#xD;
             perforation should be evaluated for the potential need for additional treatment before&#xD;
             coming on study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with other active malignancy =&lt; 3 years prior to registration for which&#xD;
             active treatment is required must be excluded; patients with composite lymphomas that&#xD;
             have a non-B-cell component must be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  EXCEPTIONS: Non-melanotic skin cancers or carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Copanlisib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4; therefore, the concomitant use of&#xD;
             strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin,&#xD;
             ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir), and strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g.&#xD;
             rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's Wort) are not permitted&#xD;
             from 14 days prior to enrollment until the end of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important&#xD;
                  to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference; as part of the&#xD;
                  enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk&#xD;
                  of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be&#xD;
                  prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or&#xD;
                  herbal product; other medications that are prohibited while on copanlisib&#xD;
                  treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Herbal medications/preparations (except for vitamins)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Anti-arrhythmic therapy other than beta blockers or digoxin&#xD;
