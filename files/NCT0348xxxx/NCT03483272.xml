  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heptorenal syndrome (HRS) is divided into two types. A non-acute kidney injury (NAKI-HRS),&#xD;
      which is predominantly related to end-stage disease and a more acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI).&#xD;
      HRS-AKI is potentially reversible and develops subsequent to aggravation of a systemic&#xD;
      circulatory vasodilatation, that triggers renal vasoconstriction and deteriorates renal&#xD;
      perfusion and function. The albumin and terlipressin response is evaluated clinically,&#xD;
      routinely for a week and reduces mortality with 23% compared to no treatment. Only 40-50% of&#xD;
      the patients with HRS-AKI respond to the treatment with terlipressin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS-AKI) is aimed at improving blood flow to the&#xD;
      kidneys. Flow changes associated to development of HRS have only sparsely been studied and&#xD;
      not previously by MR technique and no previous studies have evaluated changes in flow induced&#xD;
      by terlipressin. It has been hypothesized that development of HRS is associated to a&#xD;
      deterioration in heart function with development of cardiomyopathy, which together with renal&#xD;
      vasoconstriction leads to renal failure. Simultaneous MR-assessments of cardiac function and&#xD;
      flows (especially the renal flow) in HRS-AKI have not previously been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to develop new, fast and non-invasive methods to evaluate&#xD;
      hemodynamic changes and individual pharmacological terlipressin response in patients with&#xD;
      acute hepatorenal syndrome (type HRS-AKI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect a higher increase in renal blood flow in terlipressin-responders compared to&#xD;
      terlipressin-non-responders and non-responders will generally have a lower basic renal flow&#xD;
      and a decreased cardiac output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and patients The study design is experimental and includes 30 cirrhotic patients&#xD;
      with HRS-AKI. Patients with HRS-AKI are MR scanned before and 17 minutes after their first&#xD;
      dose of terlipressin. ECHO is performed before first dose of Terlipressin and is repeated&#xD;
      after one of the first doses of terlipressin. Clinically efficacy is defined in accordance to&#xD;
      international guidelines at day-7 and 90 days mortality is registered. The screening period&#xD;
      and treatments follow international and national guidelines for acute renal failure in&#xD;
      patients with cirrhosis.&#xD;
