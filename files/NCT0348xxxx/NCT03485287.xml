    <textblock>
      This multi-site, open-label, Phase 2, lead-in study assesses the safety and effect of&#xD;
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy in participants diagnosed&#xD;
      with at least severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Therapy teams that have been&#xD;
      identified and trained to work on the sponsor's planned Phase 3 studies will treat at least&#xD;
      one open-label participant in this study. A flexible dose of MDMA (100 to 125 mg), followed&#xD;
      by a supplemental half-dose, unless contraindicated, is administered during the Treatment&#xD;
      Period with manualized therapy in three open-label monthly Experimental Sessions. This&#xD;
      ~12-week Treatment Period is preceded by three Preparatory Sessions. During the Treatment&#xD;
      Period, each Experimental Session is followed by three Integrative Sessions of non-drug&#xD;
      psychotherapy. The primary outcome measure is the change in the Clinician Administered PTSD&#xD;
      Scale for DSM 5 (CAPS-5) total severity scores from Baseline to Visit 19. The secondary&#xD;
      outcome measure is the change in the customized version of the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)&#xD;
      for PTSD for the MAPS studies total scores from Baseline to Visit 19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTSD is a stress-related psychiatric condition that may occur following a traumatic event&#xD;
      such as war, disaster, sexual abuse, violence, terrorism, and accidents. PTSD negatively&#xD;
      impacts a person's daily life, resulting in relationship difficulties, difficulty in finding&#xD;
      and maintaining a job, reduced cognitive and psychosocial functioning, substance abuse,&#xD;
      high-cost healthcare use, and increased depression and suicide risk. Available PTSD&#xD;
      treatments, including medications and therapy, effectively treat only a fraction of people&#xD;
      who try them for adequate dose and duration. People with PTSD can be treated with&#xD;
      psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies. In the past decade, there has been a growing amount of&#xD;
      research into medications and other methods that may augment the effectiveness of&#xD;
      psychotherapy for PTSD&#xD;
&#xD;
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine is a drug that releases serotonin, norepinephrine and&#xD;
      dopamine in the brain and indirectly increases levels of the neurohormones oxytocin, arginine&#xD;
      vasopressin and cortisol. The combined neurobiological effects of MDMA increase compassion,&#xD;
      reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury, and enhance communication and introspection.&#xD;
      MDMA produces anxiolytic and prosocial effects, which counteract avoidance and hyperarousal&#xD;
      in the context of therapy. A combined treatment of MDMA and psychotherapy may be especially&#xD;
      useful for treating PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-site, open-label, Phase 2, lead-in study assesses the safety and effect of&#xD;
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy in participants diagnosed&#xD;
      with at least severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Therapy teams that have been&#xD;
      identified and trained to work on the sponsor's planned Phase 3 studies will treat at least&#xD;
      one open-label participant in this study. A flexible dose of MDMA (100 to 125 mg), followed&#xD;

    <description>The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) is a clinician administered and scored assessment of PTSD symptoms via structured interview based upon PTSD diagnosis in DSM-5. It contains symptom subscales, a CAPS-5 total severity score, and a diagnostic score. The total severity score is a sum of symptom frequency and intensity scores for the subscales B (re-experiencing), C (avoidance) and D (hypervigilance) and ranges from 0 to 136, with higher scores indicating greater severity of PTSD symptoms.</description>

        <description>The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) is a clinician administered and scored assessment of PTSD symptoms via structured interview based upon PTSD diagnosis in DSM-5. It contains symptom subscales, a CAPS-5 total severity score, and a diagnostic score. The total severity score is a sum of symptom frequency and intensity scores for the subscales B (re-experiencing), C (avoidance) and D (hypervigilance) and ranges from 0 to 136, with higher scores indicating greater severity of PTSD symptoms.</description>
