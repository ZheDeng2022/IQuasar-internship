      Synthetic ACTH (Synacthen Depot) has been used in the treatment of Nephrotic Syndrome in&#xD;
      Europe. It has been proven effective in treating idiopathic membranous nephropathy and other&#xD;
      various diagnoses involving the kidneys. However, Synacthen is not available in the United&#xD;
      States. The only preparation available is the H.P. Acthar Gel (repository corticotrophin)&#xD;
      which has been widely used in the treatment of infantile spasms and has been available longer&#xD;
      than Synacthen. Therefore, we are conducting this study to determine if H.P. Acthar Gel&#xD;
      (repository corticotrophin) is as effective in reducing protein in the urine as seen in&#xD;
      synthetic ACTH in Europe.&#xD;
