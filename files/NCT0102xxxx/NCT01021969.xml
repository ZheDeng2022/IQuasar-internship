  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increasing intake of fructose has been associated with an increase in obesity among US&#xD;
      children and adolescents, but its &quot;dose dependent&quot; effects on insulin sensitivity and lipid&#xD;
      metabolism has not been studied in detail. Methods: 36 healthy male adult human subjects will&#xD;
      be included in this study. They will be randomly allocated into a low, moderate or high&#xD;
      fructose, a moderate or high glucose and a sucrose diet for 3 weeks. In randomized order and&#xD;
      with 4 week wash out intervals each subject will receive all six different diets. Three day&#xD;
      food records will be used to measure total fructose and glucose intake. During the low&#xD;
      fructose diet subjects will be instructed to avoid nutrients containing fructose aiming at&#xD;
      consumption of less than 1g fructose/d. During the moderate fructose diet subjects will&#xD;
      receive 3x13.3g of fructose or glucose, respectively. High fructose diet subjects will&#xD;
      receive either 3x26.7g/d of fructose, 3x 26.7g/d of glucose or 3x 26.7g/d of sucrose in the&#xD;
      form of three daily soft drinks taken together with the three main meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      75 g oral glucose tolerance testing will be performed and composite insulin sensitivity index&#xD;
      will be calculated The presence of phosphorylated fructose metabolites in plasma will be&#xD;
      measured by targeted LC-MS/MS. In addition, metabolite biomarkers in plasma will be screened&#xD;
      by untargeted metabolite profiling using both LC-MS and GC-MS. In a subgroup of 10 subjects&#xD;
      an euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp will be performed using [6,6- 2H2]glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the lipogenic potential of fructose in humans will be compared with isocaloric amounts&#xD;
      of glucose. Particularly, the question whether lipogenic effects are continuously dose&#xD;
      dependent or whether there is a lipogenic shunting and if yes, at what level of ingested&#xD;
      fructose will be addressed.&#xD;
