      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Recent research has suggested that prenatal exposure to drugs may affect specific brain&#xD;
      processes, including working memory, stress response, and decision making. However, most of&#xD;
      the research on the effects of prenatal drug exposure in humans has been conducted early in&#xD;
      life, and very little is known about effects of prenatal drug exposure during the crucial&#xD;
      brain development period that takes place during puberty and adolescence. The biological and&#xD;
      psychological changes associated with puberty may increase adolescents' sensitivity to&#xD;
      prenatal substance exposure. Researchers are interested in using functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI) scans to study brain function and learn more about the effects of&#xD;
      prenatal drug exposure on adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To examine the effects of prenatal substance exposure on working memory, decision making,&#xD;
      and normal brain activity in adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adolescents between 12 and 17 years of age who are enrolled in a larger follow-up study of&#xD;
      children exposed to drugs in utero.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will involve a single outpatient session with two fMRI scans that will test&#xD;
           working memory and decision-making processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have brief medical history, a physical examination, and a urine test&#xD;
           for drugs of abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will then be trained on the working memory and decision-making tasks before&#xD;
           having an initial MRI scan to provide a baseline reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The fMRI scans will take 40 to 45 minutes each, and participants will have break in&#xD;
           between as needed.&#xD;

      Objective- To use fMRI to compare brain activity at rest and during working memory and&#xD;
      decision making tasks in normal children and in children exposed in utero to drugs of abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population- All participants will be 12-17 year-olds enrolled in an ongoing&#xD;
      longitudinal follow up study of children exposed to drugs of abuse in utero funded by NIH. A&#xD;
      subgroup of this study cohort will be invited to participate based on added criteria needed&#xD;
      for scanning studies, such as absence of metal in the body, no significant CNS disease, and&#xD;
      ability to tolerate the scanning environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design- Participants will undergo fMRI scans while performing a working memory task, a&#xD;
      decision making task and at rest. Data from participants in the current study will be&#xD;
      combined with those from a previous study (NIDA protocol 417) which now reside in our&#xD;
      repository protocol, 8002.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures- The primary outcome measures will be the difference in BOLD fMRI activation&#xD;
      between drug-exposed participants and those without prenatal exposure to drugs of abuse.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Participants must be enrolled in the current UMB longitudinal study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. All participants will be between 12 and 17 years old (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. All participants must be able to provide informed assent and have a&#xD;
                  parent/guardian who can provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Report of a history of significant medical/neurological illness that might interfere&#xD;
             with imaging data such as HIV positive status, cerebral vascular accident (CVA),&#xD;
             central nervous system (CNS) tumor, head trauma, multiple sclerosis (MS) or other&#xD;
             demyelinating diseases, epilepsy, or movement disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Metallic devices in the body that preclude MRI scanning, as determined by self and&#xD;
             parent (guardian) report.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current use of psychotropic medication that may alter attentional functioning (e.g.,&#xD;
             Clonidine, antipsychotics, Effexor, stimulants).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Currently using respiratory, cardiovascular, anticonvulsant or other medications that&#xD;
             might interfere with the mechanisms producing the BOLD signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Currently abusing street drugs as assessed by history and urine testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnancy, which will be assessed by history during screening and by urine testing on&#xD;
             scan days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Claustrophobia by self and/or parent (guardian) report severe enough to preclude&#xD;
             toleration of the scanning environment.&#xD;
