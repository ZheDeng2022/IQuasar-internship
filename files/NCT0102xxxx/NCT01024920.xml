    <measure>Probability Rates of Progression-free Survival at 9 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>At 9 months after randomisation.</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival rate at 9 months is the estimated probability of being alive and not having progressive disease at 9 months after randomisation.&#xD;
Progression was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameters recorded since the treatment started together with an absolute increase in the sum of the longest diameters of at least 5 mm, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.&#xD;
Tumour imaging was made by investigators using Computed tomography (CT)/Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) every 12 weeks after the first administration of the trial medication.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>An open-label, 2:1 randomised, parallel-arm comparison of nintedanib versus sunitinib in patients with advanced renal cell cancer (RCC) who had not received prior systemic therapy.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects were screened for eligibility prior to participation in the trial. Subjects attended a specialist site which ensured that they (the subjects) strictly met all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. Subjects were not to be allocated to a treatment group if any of the entry criteria were violated.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Nintedanib (BIBF 1120)</title>
          <description>Participants received orally (swallowed) soft gelatine capsules of nintedanib (BIBF 1120) twice daily (bid) starting with a dose of 200 milligram (mg) bid given continuously in 4-week cycles. Nintedanib was to be swallowed unchewed with about 200 milliliter (mL) of water after food intake with a dosing interval of approximately 12 hours. In case of Adverse Events, the dose was to be reduced to 150 mg bid and 100 mg bid, respectively. The dose was continued daily until withdrawal criteria were fulfilled.</description>

          <description>Participants received orally (swallowed) hard capsule of sunitinib starting with a dose of 50 milligram (mg) once daily (qd). In case of Adverse Events the dose was to be reduced to 37.5 mg once daily and 25 mg once daily, respectively. The daily dosing was performed in 6-week cycles (4 weeks on and 2 weeks off) until withdrawal criteria were fulfilled.</description>

        <title>Probability Rates of Progression-free Survival at 9 Months</title>
        <description>Progression free survival rate at 9 months is the estimated probability of being alive and not having progressive disease at 9 months after randomisation.&#xD;
Progression was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameters recorded since the treatment started together with an absolute increase in the sum of the longest diameters of at least 5 mm, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.&#xD;
Tumour imaging was made by investigators using Computed tomography (CT)/Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) every 12 weeks after the first administration of the trial medication.</description>

Progression was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameters recorded since the treatment started together with an absolute increase in the sum of the longest diameters of at least 5 mm, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.&#xD;
Tumour imaging was made by investigators using Computed tomography (CT)/Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) every 12 weeks after the first administration of the trial medication.</description>
          <population>Treated set (TS): All patients who were dispensed trial medication and were documented to have taken at least 1 dose of investigational treatment.</population>

        <description>QTcF interval is the QT interval (electrocardiogram (ECG) interval from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave) corrected for the effects of heart rate by the Fridericia formula. Baseline QTcF measurement at time t was defined as the QTcF measurement collected 1 day prior to the day of the first administration of nintedanib at time t. Time-matched change from baseline to Day 15 in QTcF at time t was defined as the QTcF measurement following administration of nintedanib on Day 15 obtained at time t minus baseline QTcF measurement at time t. 0 h is 5 min prior to dosing on Day 15.&#xD;
Time-matched change from baseline to Day 15 in QTcF was modelled using a linear mixed-effects model for repeated measures which included 'time' as repeated measures and the time-matched baseline value as a covariate. Adjusted means with corresponding 2-sided 90% confidence intervals at 0 h,1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 7 h, 10 h and 12 h after dosing of nintedanib on Day 15 of are reported.</description>

          <description>Progression free survival (PFS) from randomisation to the occurrence of disease progression (by RECIST Version 1.1) or death, whichever occurred first.&#xD;
Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameters recorded since the treatment started together with an absolute increase in the sum of the longest diameters of at least 5 mm, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.&#xD;
Tumour imaging was made by investigators using Computed tomography (CT)/Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) every 12 weeks after the first administration of the trial medication.&#xD;

Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameters recorded since the treatment started together with an absolute increase in the sum of the longest diameters of at least 5 mm, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.&#xD;
Tumour imaging was made by investigators using Computed tomography (CT)/Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) every 12 weeks after the first administration of the trial medication. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the estimates.</description>

        <description>QTcF interval is the QT interval (electrocardiogram (ECG) interval from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave) corrected for the effects of heart rate by the Fridericia formula. Baseline QTcF measurement at time t was defined as the QTcF measurement collected 1 day prior to the day of the first administration of nintedanib at time t. Time-matched change from baseline to Day 1 in QTcF at time t was defined as the QTcF measurement following administration of nintedanib on Day 1 obtained at time t minus baseline QTcF measurement at time t.&#xD;
Time-matched change from baseline to Day 1 in QTcF was modelled using a linear mixed-effects model for repeated measures which included 'time' as repeated measures and the time-matched baseline value as a covariate. Adjusted means with corresponding 2-sided 90% confidence intervals at 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 7 h, 10 h and 12 h after dosing of nintedanib on Day 1 are reported.</description>

        <title>Time-matched Change From Baseline in QTcF Interval (QT Interval Corrected by the Fridericia Formula) at the Time of Each Participant's Maximum Plasma Concentration of Nintedanib (BIBF 1120), Calculated Separately for Days 1 and 15 of Treatment Cycle 1</title>
        <description>QTcF interval is the QT interval (electrocardiogram (ECG) interval from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave) corrected for the effects of heart rate (HR) by the Fridericia formula. Baseline QTcF measurement at time t was defined as the QTcF measurement collected 1 day prior to the day of the first administration of nintedanib at time t. Time-matched change from baseline to Day 1 (Day 15) in QTcF at time t was defined as the QTcF measurement following administration of nintedanib on Day 1 (Day 15) obtained at time t minus baseline QTcF measurement at time t.&#xD;
For each participant 'Time-matched change from baseline to Day 1 (Day 15) in QTcF' at the time of the participant's maximum nintedanib plasma concentration was obtained and the mean across all participants calculated. Corresponding two-sided 90% confidence intervals based on the t-distribution are reported.&#xD;
Time frame: Baseline (Day -1) values were taken at exactly the same time points as on Day 15.</description>
        <time_frame>At 5 minutes (min) before the first dose on Day 15 and at 1 hour (h), at 2 h, at 3 h, at 4 h, at 5 h, at 6 h, at 7 h, at 10 h and at 12 h after the first dose of nintedanib on Day 1 and on Day 15 of the first treatment cycle. Continues in the description.</time_frame>

        <title>Average Time-matched Changes From Baseline in QTcF Interval Over 1 h to 12 h After Dosing on Days 1 and 15 of Treatment Cycle 1</title>
        <description>Average time-matched in QTcF interval (QT interval (electrocardiogram (ECG) interval from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave) corrected for the effects of heart rate (HR) by the Fridericia formula) changes over 1 to 12 hours was evaluated using a t-test for paired observation. The mean differences between post-treatment values (Days 1 and 15) and baseline (Day -1) along with two-sided 90% confidence limits are reported.&#xD;
Time frame: Baseline (Day -1) values were taken at exactly the same time points as on Day 1 and on Day 15.</description>

        <description>QT interval is the electrocardiogram (ECG) interval from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. Baseline QT measurement at time t was defined as the QT measurement collected 1 day prior to the day of the first administration of nintedanib at time t. Time-matched change from baseline to Day 15 in QT at time t was defined as the QT measurement following administration of nintedanib on Day 15 obtained at time t minus baseline QT measurement at time t. 0 h is 5 min prior to dosing on Day 15.&#xD;
Time-matched change from baseline to Day 15 in QT was modelled using a linear mixed-effects model for repeated measures which included 'time' as repeated measures and the time-matched baseline value as a covariate. Adjusted means with corresponding 2-sided 90% confidence intervals at 0 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 7 h, 10 h and 12 h after dosing of nintedanib on Day 15 of Cycle 1are reported.</description>

        <description>QT interval is the electrocardiogram (ECG) interval from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. Baseline QT measurement at time t was defined as the QT measurement collected 1 day prior to the day of the first administration of nintedanib at time t. Time-matched change from baseline to Day 1 in QT at time t was defined as the QT measurement following administration of nintedanib on Day 1 obtained at time t minus baseline QT measurement at time t.&#xD;
Time-matched change from baseline to Day 1 in QT was modelled using a linear mixed-effects model for repeated measures which included 'time' as repeated measures and the time-matched baseline value as a covariate. Adjusted means with corresponding 2-sided 90% confidence intervals at 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 7 h, 10 h and 12 h after dosing of nintedanib on Day 1 are reported.</description>

        <description>Baseline heart rate (HR) measurement at time t was defined as the HR measurement collected 1 day prior to the day of the first administration of nintedanib (BIBF 1120) at time t. Time-matched change from baseline to Day 15 in HR at time t was defined as the HR measurement following administration of nintedanib (BIBF 1120) on Day 15 obtained at time t minus baseline HR measurement at time t. 0 h is 5 min prior to dosing on Day 15.&#xD;
Time-matched change from baseline to Day 15 in HR was modelled using a linear mixed-effects model for repeated measures which included 'time' as repeated measures and the time-matched baseline value as a covariate. Adjusted means with corresponding 2-sided 90% confidence intervals at 0 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 7 h, 10 h and 12 h after dosing of nintedanib (BIBF 1120) on Day 15 of Cycle 1 are reported.</description>

Nintedanib was to be swallowed unchewed with about 200 milliliter (mL) of water after food intake with a dosing interval of approximately 12 hours. In case of Adverse Events, the dose was to be reduced to 150 mg bid and 100 mg bid, respectively. The dose was continued daily until withdrawal criteria were fulfilled.</description>

          <title>Time-Matched Heart Rate (HR) Changes From Baseline to Day 1 at 1 Hour (h), at 2 h, at 3 h, at 4 h, at 5 h, at 6 h, at 7 h, at 10 h and at 12 h After Dosing of Nintedanib (BIBF 1120)</title>
          <description>Baseline heart rate (HR) measurement at time t was defined as the HR measurement collected 1 day prior to the day of the first administration of nintedanib (BIBF 1120) at time t. Time-matched change from baseline to Day 1 in HR at time t was defined as the HR measurement following administration of nintedanib (BIBF 1120) on Day 1 obtained at time t minus baseline HR measurement at time t.&#xD;
Time-matched change from baseline to Day 1 in HR was modelled using a linear mixed-effects model for repeated measures which included 'time' as repeated measures and the time-matched baseline value as a covariate. Adjusted means with corresponding 2-sided 90% confidence intervals at 0 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 7 h, 10 h and 12 h after dosing of nintedanib (BIBF 1120) on Day 1 are reported.</description>

Only participants with non-missing outcomes were included in the analysis.</population>

It reflects conduction through the atrioventricular node (AV) node. The normal PR interval is between 120 - 200 milliseconds (ms) (0.12-0.20s) in duration. Absolute values at baseline (Day-1 prior to the first dosing of nintedanib) and at Day 1 (first drug dose of nintedanib (BIBF 1120)) and changes from baseline to Day 1 at each point in time i.e., 10 time points from 0 to 12 in the PR interval are reported.</description>
        <time_frame>At 5 minutes (min) before the first dose and at 1 hour (h), at 2 h, at 3 h, at 4 h, at 5 h, at 6 h, at 7 h, at 10 h and at 12 h after the first dose of nintedanib on Day 1. Baseline (Day -1) values were taken at exactly the same time points as on Day 1.</time_frame>
        <population>Full analysis set electrocardiogram (FAS-ECG): All patients in the treated set who were treated with nintedanib (BIBF 1120) and had at least 1 time-matched pair of QT interval (electrocardiogram (ECG) interval from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave) measurements available from baseline and from either Day 1 or Day 15 of Treatment Cycle 1 (first 4-week cycle). Only participants with non-missing outcomes were included in the analysis.</population>

            <title>Nintedanib (BIBF 1120)</title>
            <description>Participants received orally (swallowed) soft gelatine capsules of nintedanib (BIBF 1120) twice daily (bid) starting with a dose of 200 milligram (mg) bid given continuously in 4-week cycles. Nintedanib was to be swallowed unchewed with about 200 milliliter (mL) of water after food intake with a dosing interval of approximately 12 hours. In case of Adverse Events, the dose was to be reduced to 150 mg bid and 100 mg bid, respectively. The dose was continued daily until withdrawal criteria were fulfilled.</description>

        <title>Absolute Values at Baseline (Day -1) and Day 15 and Changes From Baseline to Day 15 at Each Point in Time in PR Interval</title>
        <description>The PR interval is an electrocardiogram (ECG) interval and is the time from the onset of the P wave to the start of the QRS complex (combination of the Q wave, R wave and S wave). It reflects conduction through the atrioventricular node (AV) node. The normal PR interval is between 120 - 200 milliseconds (ms) (0.12-0.20s) in duration. Absolute values at baseline (Day-1 prior to the first dosing of nintedanib (BIBF 1120) and at Day 15 (steady state) and changes from baseline to Day 15 at each point in time i.e., 10 time points from 0 to 12 in the PR interval are reported.</description>
        <time_frame>At 5 minutes (min) before the first dose and at 1 hour (h), at 2 h, at 3 h, at 4 h, at 5 h, at 6 h, at 7 h, at 10 h and at 12 h after the first dose of nintedanib on Day 15. Baseline (Day -1) values were taken at exactly the same time points as on Day 15.</time_frame>
        <population>Full analysis set electrocardiogram (FAS-ECG): All patients in the treated set who were treated with nintedanib (BIBF 1120) and had at least 1 time-matched pair of QT interval (electrocardiogram (ECG) interval from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave) measurements available from baseline and from either Day 1 or Day 15 of Treatment Cycle 1 (first 4-week cycle). Only participants with non-missing outcomes were included in the analysis.</population>

            <description>Participants received orally (swallowed) soft gelatine capsules of nintedanib (BIBF 1120) twice daily (bid) starting with a dose of 200 milligram (mg) bid given continuously in 4-week cycles. Nintedanib was to be swallowed unchewed with about 200 milliliter (mL) of water after food intake with a dosing interval of approximately 12 hours. In case of Adverse Events, the dose was to be reduced to 150 mg bid and 100 mg bid, respectively. The dose was continued daily until withdrawal criteria were fulfilled.</description>

        <title>Absolute Values at Baseline (Day -1) and Day 1 and Changes From Baseline to Day 1 at Each Point in Time in QRS Interval</title>
        <description>QRS interval is an electrocardiogram (ECG) interval and is the time interval from the onset to the end of the QRS complex (combination of the Q wave, R wave and S wave). The normal QRS duration is less than 120 milliseconds (ms). Absolute values and changes from baseline (Day-1 prior to the first dosing of nintedanib) to Day 1 (first drug dose of nintedanib (BIBF 1120)) at each point in time i.e., 10 time points from 0 to 12 in the QRS interval are reported.</description>
        <time_frame>At 5 minutes (min) before the first dose and at 1 hour (h), at 2 h, at 3 h, at 4 h, at 5 h, at 6 h, at 7 h, at 10 h and at 12 h after the first dose of nintedanib on Day 1. Baseline (Day -1) values were taken at exactly the same time points as on Day 1.</time_frame>
        <population>Full analysis set electrocardiogram (FAS-ECG): All patients in the treated set who were treated with nintedanib (BIBF 1120) and had at least 1 time-matched pair of QT interval (electrocardiogram (ECG) interval from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave) measurements available from baseline and from either Day 1 or Day 15 of Treatment Cycle 1 (first 4-week cycle). Only participants with non-missing outcomes were included in the analysis.</population>

            <description>Participants received orally (swallowed) soft gelatine capsules of nintedanib (BIBF 1120) twice daily (bid) starting with a dose of 200 milligram (mg) bid given continuously in 4-week cycles. Nintedanib was to be swallowed unchewed with about 200 milliliter (mL) of water after food intake with a dosing interval of approximately 12 hours. In case of Adverse Events, the dose was to be reduced to 150 mg bid and 100 mg bid, respectively. The dose was continued daily until withdrawal criteria were fulfilled.</description>

        <title>Absolute Values at Baseline (Day -1) and Day 15 and Changes From Baseline to Day 15 at Each Point in Time in QRS Interval</title>
        <description>QRS interval is an electrocardiogram (ECG) interval and is the time interval from the onset to the end of the QRS complex (combination of the Q wave, R wave and S wave). The normal QRS duration is less than 120 milliseconds (ms). Absolute values and changes from baseline (Day-1 prior to the first dosing of nintedanib) to Day 15 (steady state) at each point in time i.e., 10 time points from 0 to 12 in the QRS interval are reported.</description>
        <time_frame>At 5 minutes (min) before the first dose and at 1 hour (h), at 2 h, at 3 h, at 4 h, at 5 h, at 6 h, at 7 h, at 10 h and at 12 h after the first dose of nintedanib on Day 15. Baseline (Day -1) values were taken at exactly the same time points as on Day 15.</time_frame>
        <population>Full analysis set electrocardiogram (FAS-ECG): All patients in the treated set who were treated with nintedanib (BIBF 1120) and had at least 1 time-matched pair of QT interval (electrocardiogram (ECG) interval from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave) measurements available from baseline and from either Day 1 or Day 15 of Treatment Cycle 1 (first 4-week cycle). Only participants with non-missing outcomes were included in the analysis.</population>

            <description>Participants received orally (swallowed) soft gelatine capsules of nintedanib (BIBF 1120) twice daily (bid) starting with a dose of 200 milligram (mg) bid given continuously in 4-week cycles. Nintedanib was to be swallowed unchewed with about 200 milliliter (mL) of water after food intake with a dosing interval of approximately 12 hours. In case of Adverse Events, the dose was to be reduced to 150 mg bid and 100 mg bid, respectively. The dose was continued daily until withdrawal criteria were fulfilled.</description>

        <title>Frequency of Patients by Clinical Electrocardiogram (ECG) Measurement Interpretation, Calculated Separately for Days 1 and 15 of Treatment Cycle 1</title>
        <description>Based on the interpretation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) patients were classified in 3 categories:&#xD;
Normal (a normal ECG reading would be a reading that includes the following normal findings: 1) normal general features; 2) no arrhythmia; 3) no conduction delays; 4) T-wave morphology of normal; and 5) normal U-wave morphology) on Day 1 or on Day 15)&#xD;
Not normal and not normal at baseline (an abnormal ECG reading would be a reading that includes one or more of the following abnormal findings: 1) abnormal general features; 2) arrhythmia; 3) conduction delays; 4) T-wave morphology of flat, inverted or biphasic; and 5) abnormal U-wave morphology) on Day 1 or on Day 15)&#xD;
Not normal and new onset of finding; Time frame: Baseline (Day -1) values were taken at exactly the same time points as on Day 15.</description>
        <time_frame>At 5 minutes (min) before the first dose on Day 15 and at 1 hour (h), at 2 h, at 3 h, at 4 h, at 5 h, at 6 h, at 7 h, at 10 h and at 12 h after the first dose of nintedanib on Day 1 and on Day 15 of first treatment cycle. Continues in the description.</time_frame>
        <population>Full analysis set electrocardiogram (FAS-ECG): All patients in the treated set who were treated with nintedanib (BIBF 1120) and had at least 1 time-matched pair of QT interval (electrocardiogram (ECG) interval from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave) measurements available from baseline and from either Day 1 or Day 15 of Treatment Cycle 1 (first 4-week cycle). Only participants with non-missing outcomes were included in the analysis.</population>

            <description>Participants received orally (swallowed) soft gelatine capsules of nintedanib (BIBF 1120) twice daily (bid) starting with a dose of 200 milligram (mg) bid given continuously in 4-week cycles. Nintedanib was to be swallowed unchewed with about 200 milliliter (mL) of water after food intake with a dosing interval of approximately 12 hours. In case of Adverse Events, the dose was to be reduced to 150 mg bid and 100 mg bid, respectively. The dose was continued daily until withdrawal criteria were fulfilled.</description>
