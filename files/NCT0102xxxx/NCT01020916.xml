      Experimental studies and previous clinical trials suggest an improvement in mortality and&#xD;
      neurological function with hypothermia after cardiac arrest. However, the accrued evidence is&#xD;
      inconclusive and associated with risks of systematic error, design error and random error.&#xD;
      Elevated body temperature after cardiac arrest is associated with a worse outcome. Previous&#xD;
      trials did not treat elevated body temperature in the control groups. The optimal target&#xD;
      temperature for post-resuscitation care is not known. The primary purpose with the TTM-trial&#xD;
      is to evaluate if there are differences in all-cause mortality, neurological function and&#xD;
      adverse events between a target temperature management at 33°C and 36°C for 24 hours&#xD;
      following return of spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest.&#xD;

      Detailed statistical analysis plan for the Target Temperature Management after&#xD;
      Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Introduction The Target temperature management after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, a&#xD;
           randomised, parallel-group, assessor-blinded clinical trial (the TTM-trial) is the&#xD;
           largest trial to date in post-cardiac arrest treatment and in temperature management in&#xD;
           the intensive care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To prevent outcome reporting bias and data driven analysis results, the International&#xD;
           Conference on Harmonisation of Good Clinical Practice and others have recommended that&#xD;
           clinical trials should be analysed according to a pre-specified plan [1]. Leading&#xD;
           experts in the critical care community have advocated that this should not only be a&#xD;
           recommendation but rather a prerequisite [2]. Here we describe the statistical analysis&#xD;
           plan that has been finalised while data collection in the TTM-trial still is on going,&#xD;
           and to which all data analyses in the main publication of the TTM-trial results will&#xD;
           adhere. The steering group of the TTM-trial unanimously approved the statistical&#xD;
           analysis plan December 3rd 2012, patient recruitment at 950 patients was completed&#xD;
           January 10th 2013, and the final follow-up is predicted to occur in the beginning of&#xD;
           July 2013, after which the database will be locked and then analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Trial overview The TTM-trial is a multicentre, multinational, outcome assessor-blinded,&#xD;
           parallel group, randomised clinical trial comparing two strict target temperature&#xD;
           regimens of 33°C and 36°C in adult patients, who have sustained return of spontaneous&#xD;
           circulation and are unconscious after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, when admitted to&#xD;
           hospital. The study background, design, and rationale have previously been published [3,&#xD;
           4]. The TTM-trial protocol (current version 3.3) has been available online on&#xD;
           www.ttm-trial.org since the start of the trial. The trial is registered at&#xD;
           clinicaltrials.gov NCT01020916 and is endorsed by the European Clinical Research&#xD;
           Infrastructure Network and the Scandinavian Critical Care Trials Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objective The primary aim of the TTM-trial is to compare the effects of two strict&#xD;
           target temperature protocols for the first 36 hours of hospital stay after resuscitation&#xD;
           from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (4 hours for achieving the target temperature, 24&#xD;
           hours of maintenance of target temperature, and 8 hours of rewarming). The null&#xD;
           hypothesis is that there is no difference in survival until the end of trial (180 days&#xD;
           from randomisation of the last patient) with a target temperature of 33°C compared to&#xD;
           36°C. To demonstrate or reject a Hazard Ratio difference of 20% between the groups,&#xD;
           equivalent to approximately one months difference in median survival time assuming&#xD;
           proportional hazards in the groups during the observation time, a sample size of 900&#xD;
           patients would be necessary with a type-1 error risk of 5% and a type-2 error risk of&#xD;
           10%. To allow for patients lost-to-follow up the target population is set to 950&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Stratification and design variables The only stratification variable used is trial site&#xD;
           (hospital). Pre-defined design variables allowing for an adjusted analysis of the&#xD;
           primary outcome, and pre-defined subgroup analyses are: age, gender, first presenting&#xD;
           cardiac rhythm (shockable or non-shockable), duration of cardiac arrest, and presence of&#xD;
           shock at admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Definition of the efficacy variables The outcomes are defined as primary, secondary and&#xD;
           exploratory (tertiary in the trial protocol). Only primary and secondary outcomes will&#xD;
           be analysed for the first published report of the TTM-trial due to the complexity of the&#xD;
           exploratory outcomes, and thus a need for separate publications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome The primary outcome is survival until end of trial, which will be 180 days&#xD;
      from randomisation of the last patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes including adverse events The main secondary outcomes are the composite&#xD;
      outcomes of&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. poor neurological function defined as Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 3 or 4, or&#xD;
           death (CPC 5); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. poor neurological function defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 4 or 5, or death (mRS&#xD;
           6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      evaluated at 180 days (+/- 14 days) from randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of study participants in each category of CPC and mRS will be reported separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following adverse events are included in the secondary outcomes: bleeding, pneumonia,&#xD;
      electrolyte disorders, hyperglycemia, hypoglycaemia, cardiac arrhythmia, myoclonic or&#xD;
      tonic-clonic seizures, renal replacement therapy. Definitions for the adverse events have&#xD;
      been described earlier [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other secondary outcomes are Cerebral Performance Category at intensive care unit and&#xD;
      hospital discharge, and best Cerebral Performance Category during entire trial period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory outcomes Neurological function at 180 days defined with CPC, mRS, Informant&#xD;
      Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE), Mini mental state exam (MMSE) and&#xD;
      two simple questions: 1a. In the last two weeks, did you require help from another person for&#xD;
      your every day activities? (If yes: 1b. Is this a new situation following the heart arrest?),&#xD;
      and 2. Do you feel you have made a complete mental recovery after your heart arrest? [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life defined with Short-Form 36.&#xD;

      Other descriptive variables Number of days in intensive care unit and days on mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation during the index ICU-admission and days in hospital within the index admission&#xD;
      will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. General analysis principles&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Analyses will be conducted according to the modified intention-to-treat principle [5] if&#xD;
           not otherwise stated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All tests of significance will be two-sided with a maximal type-1 error risk of 5%&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The primary analyses of primary and secondary outcomes will be those of the modified&#xD;
           intention-to-treat population adjusted for the protocol specified stratification&#xD;
           variable [6] and if necessary using data sets generated using multiple imputations (see&#xD;
           below). An unadjusted analysis and an analysis adjusting for both stratification and&#xD;
           predefined design variables will be carried out as sensitivity analyses. Other analyses&#xD;
           may also be done using e.g. a slightly different population. If the results of these&#xD;
           analyses are not consistent with the primary analyses this will be discussed.&#xD;
           Nevertheless, the conclusions of the study will still be those based on the primary&#xD;
           analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The tests for interaction between the intervention and each design variable used to&#xD;
           identify subgroups are exploratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Risks will be reported as hazard ratios or risk ratios with 95% confidence interval (CI)&#xD;
           or with limits as stated under point 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. If there is data missingness for a specified primary or secondary outcome of less than&#xD;
           5% we will perform a complete case analysis without imputing missing values. If there is&#xD;
           a missingness of more than 5% we will perform Little's test. If the test indicates that&#xD;
           the complete case data set is a random sample we will continue without imputing missing&#xD;
           values and analyse the complete cases. If Little's test indicates that the data set of&#xD;
           complete cases is not a random sample of the total data set we will report the point&#xD;
           estimates and their 95% confidence limits applying a worst/best scenario imputation for&#xD;
           the missing values. If the worst/best case analyses allow for the same conclusion we&#xD;
           will not perform multiple imputation. However, if the worst/best case imputation&#xD;
           provides different conclusions, multiple imputation will be performed, creating 10&#xD;
           imputed data sets under the assumption of missingness at random. The result of the trial&#xD;
           will be the pooled intervention effect and 95% CI of the analyses of the data sets after&#xD;
           multiple imputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primarily the observed P-values of the primary and five secondary outcomes will be presented.&#xD;
      However, multiplicity, a possibly reason for spurious statistically significant P-values, may&#xD;
      be a problem when the result of several outcomes are presented. We therefore want to present&#xD;
      a supplemental analysis being the result with P-values adjusted for multiplicity according to&#xD;
      the fall-back procedure [7]. The P-values adjusted for multiplicity will be presented and&#xD;
      discussed in relation to the unadjusted P-values. This adjustment may be needed to control&#xD;
      the overall probability of a type 1 error (rejection of a null hypothesis that is actually&#xD;
      true) and keep the family wise error rate below 0.05 as required by most regulatory agencies.&#xD;
      This will be done by specifying the weights of the hypotheses assigned to them according to&#xD;
      their importance. The sequence in which the hypotheses will be tested and their individual&#xD;
      weights (in parentheses) will be: the primary outcome (0.50), first secondary outcome (0.25),&#xD;
      second secondary outcome (0.0625), third secondary outcome (0.0625), fourth secondary outcome&#xD;
      (0.0625), and fifth secondary outcome (0.0625). The multiplicity problem is further&#xD;
      illuminated in the Discussion section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Statistical analyses Trial profile Flow of study participants will displayed in a CONSORT&#xD;
      diagram as shown in Box 1 [8]. Number of screened patients who fulfilled study inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and the number included in the primary and secondary analyses as well as all reasons&#xD;
      for exclusions in primary and secondary analyses will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome Frequencies and percentages per group, as well as hazard ratios with 95% CI&#xD;
      will be reported. The primary outcome will be analysed using Cox-regression with adjusting&#xD;
      variables indicated below. The proportional hazard assumption across treatment groups will be&#xD;
      checked by testing if there is an interaction between intervention and time and by plotting&#xD;
      cumulative hazard functions for intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The first analysis of the primary outcome, adjusted for the stratification variable,&#xD;
           will be on the patients that met the inclusion criteria and did not meet the exclusion&#xD;
           criteria at time of randomisation. Patients who did not meet inclusion criteria and did&#xD;
           not receive the intervention (temperature management) and was erroneously randomised&#xD;
           will be excluded according to the modified intention to treat principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The second analysis on the primary outcome will be on patients that met the inclusion&#xD;
           criteria and did not meet the exclusion criteria and did not have any major protocol&#xD;
           violations (per-protocol analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The third analysis on the primary outcome will be an analysis adjusted for both the&#xD;
           stratification variable and the design variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The above analyses will be repeated with sites grouped as a variable indicating whether&#xD;
           the patient has been allocated by the 2 sites having allocated most patients or one of&#xD;
           the other sites (which would be approximately ¼ of the trial population).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes including adverse events Frequencies and percentages per group, as well as&#xD;
      risk ratios with 95% CI will be reported. A standard Chi2-test will be used to assess the&#xD;
      effect of treatment on binary and categorical outcomes. For the adjusted primary analyses&#xD;
      logistic regression analysis will be used. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney's test will be used for&#xD;
      continuous outcomes. There will only be reported significance testing on the composite&#xD;
      outcomes mortality and poor neurological outcome versus survival with good neurological&#xD;
      outcome; not on the individual sub-scores of CPC and mRS. For adverse events there will be a&#xD;
      Chi2-test on having one or more adverse events versus having no adverse events. If there is a&#xD;
      significant difference between treatment groups in occurrence of adverse events we will try&#xD;
      to delineate which of the events that drive this difference. However we acknowledge the low&#xD;
      power for performing analyses in this case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characteristics of patients with baseline comparisons Description of baseline characteristics&#xD;
      listed above will be presented by treatment group. Discrete variables will be summarized by&#xD;
      frequencies and percentages. Percentages will be calculated according to the number of&#xD;
      patients where data are available. Where values are missing, the actual denominator will be&#xD;
      stated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be summarised using standard measures of central tendency and&#xD;
      dispersion, either using mean +/- standard deviation for data with normal distribution or&#xD;
      median and inter quartile range for non-normally distributed data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention period variables The mean values of the actual measured temperature in the two&#xD;
      intervention groups will be displayed in a graph with mean, +/- 2 standard deviations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological prognostication and withdrawal of care, concomitant cardiological treatments and&#xD;
      other descriptive variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of baseline characteristics listed above will be presented by treatment group&#xD;
      without significance testing. Discrete variables will be summarized by frequencies and&#xD;
      percentages. Percentages will be calculated according to the number of patients where data&#xD;
      are available. Where values are missing, the actual denominator will be stated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be summarised using standard measures of central tendency and&#xD;
      dispersion, either using mean +/- standard deviation for data with normal distribution or&#xD;
      median and inter quartile range for non-normally distributed data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Outline of figures and tables Figure 1 will be a CONSORT flow chart as specified above.&#xD;
      Figure 2 will be a temperature graph for the two groups with hour 0 to 36 on the x-axis and&#xD;
      mean temperature with +/- 2 standard deviations on the y-axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure 3 will be a Kaplan-Meier plot of survival in the two groups during the trial period&#xD;
      (32 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure 4 will be a Forest plot of intervention effects stratified for the design variables:&#xD;
      age dichotomised around the median, gender, duration of cardiac arrest dichotomised around&#xD;
      the median, initial cardiac rhythm shockable or non-shockable, and presence or absence of&#xD;
      cardiogenic shock at admission to hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tables will report variable according to randomisation groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1 and 2 will report background variables. Table 3 will report intensive care unit and&#xD;
      hospital stay variables. Table 4 will report adverse events. Table 5 will report 180-day&#xD;
      outcomes for survival/mortality and neurological function with CPC and mRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. Discussion With this statistical analysis plan we present the different analyses in the&#xD;
      main publication of the TTM-trial to avoid risks of outcome reporting bias and data driven&#xD;
      results. Of the pre-specified outcomes in the trial we choose to report only primary and&#xD;
      secondary in the main publication, because of the complexity of the detailed neurological&#xD;
      outcomes and quality of life that constitutes the exploratory outcomes, requiring separate&#xD;
      publications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to emphasise that the main secondary outcome being the composite outcome of&#xD;
      poor neurological function and mortality at 180 days after cardiac arrest will be of great&#xD;
      importance in a situation of a neutral outcome in the primary outcome, when interpreting the&#xD;
      results and deriving clinical implications from the TTM-trial. As survival is an outcome with&#xD;
      low risk of bias, not prone to competing risks, and earlier trials and registry data indicate&#xD;
      a lower sample size needed to show the same risk reduction when the composite outcome of&#xD;
      mortality and poor neurological function is used (compared to mortality/survival), this was&#xD;
      the fundament for the order of the outcomes. The composite outcome of poor neurological&#xD;
      function and mortality will hopefully benefit by an increased power with respect to the&#xD;
      possibility of finding or rejecting a significant signal when the trial is powered for&#xD;
      survival, which would require a larger sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comments on the multiplicity problem&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are one primary and 5 secondary outcomes to be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary outcome: survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Neurological (CPC): binary quantity&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Neurological (mRS): binary quantity&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Adverse event: binary quantity&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Cerebral performance category measured at specified point in time: binary quantity&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Best cerebral performance during specified period: binary quantity Thus there are&#xD;
                six significance tests. These have to be adjusted for multiplicity to control the&#xD;
                probability of a type-1-error (rejection of a null hypothesis that is true). One&#xD;
                way to diminish this risk would be to deal with the six outcomes as one group using&#xD;
                a data driven adjustment of the P-values. The most powerful procedure based on the&#xD;
                raw P-values is probably that of Hommel [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative (the fixed sequence procedure) would be to specify the sequence of the&#xD;
      hypotheses testing in advance. (Primary outcome, first secondary outcome, second secondary&#xD;
      outcome, - - -, fifth secondary outcome.) In this latter case no multiplicity adjustment will&#xD;
      be needed. Then each test will be done at the 0.05 level of significance in the specified&#xD;
      order. However, as soon as a test is non-significant the remaining null hypotheses will be&#xD;
      accepted without test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For instance if the primary outcome and the first secondary outcome are significant at the&#xD;
      0.05 level and the second secondary outcome (neurological function measured with mRS) is&#xD;
      insignificant, the null hypotheses corresponding to the secondary outcomes 3, 4 and 5 will be&#xD;
      accepted without test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third approach is the so-called fall back procedure where the fixed hypothesis testing&#xD;
      sequence is also used. However, if a test is insignificant, the procedure does not stop but&#xD;
      the next hypothesis is tested at a reduced level of significance. This procedure also allows&#xD;
      one to weight the hypotheses according to their importance and likelihood of being rejected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hommel's procedure is sensitive to the P-values of the last three tests while the fall back&#xD;
      procedure is not. Since the first and second of the secondary outcomes probably will produce&#xD;
      similar P-values it appears logical to place most of the weights on the primary and the first&#xD;
      secondary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these considerations the analyses in the TTM-trial will be presented with unadjusted&#xD;
      P-values as well as adjusted for multiplicity using the fall back procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11. Conclusion To conclude this article describes the principle for how the TTM-trial will be&#xD;
      analysed and presented in the first and main publication. With this we minimise the risk for&#xD;
      data driven results and outcome reporting bias.&#xD;
