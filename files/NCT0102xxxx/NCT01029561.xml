    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to study the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)&#xD;
      and metabolic syndrome (MS) in a population of obese patients who are candidates for&#xD;
      bariatric surgery. The investigators will study the influence of OSA through hypoxia and&#xD;
      sleep fragmentation on different proinflammatory adipokines and cytokines, on metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome and on insulin resistance, as well as how these respond to treatment with continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure (CPAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first part of the study (part A) the investigators will perform an observational study&#xD;
      of cases and controls. Based on the diagnostic polysomnography the patients will be divided&#xD;
      into two groups depending on their apnea-hypopnea index (AHI): OSA (AHI &gt;= 15/h) and non-OSA&#xD;
      (AHI &lt;15/h). The results will be analyzed depending on the presence or not of OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part of the study (part B), the patients with severe OSA (AHI ≥ 30/h) will be&#xD;
      randomized into two groups: one group will receive CPAP + diet treatment and the other group&#xD;
      will only receive diet treatment. After 3 months of treatment (CPAP + diet vs. diet), the&#xD;
      investigators will analyze the overall effect on metabolic syndrome and the effect on its&#xD;
      individual components, as well as the above-mentioned inflammatory pathways and insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, between the 2 groups. This will be carried out through a randomized controlled&#xD;
      study in which the investigators will compare the effect of CPAP with the effect of&#xD;
      conservative treatment.&#xD;

      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPATING CENTERS: Respiratory Medicine and Endocrinology Services of the Hospital&#xD;
      Universitari de Bellvitge, of the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau and of Hospital Clínic&#xD;
      de Barcelona.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS (recorded in eligibility criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects: All patients will be asked for informed consent in accordance with the&#xD;
      procedures of the Ethical Committee of the hospitals. Patients will be recruited in the&#xD;
      initial stage of the protocol and waiting list for bariatric surgery. Currently the waiting&#xD;
      list is 2 to 3 years long and the patients are screened for OSA in the year before the&#xD;
      intervention, with the aim of treating OSA patients in order to reduce the perioperative&#xD;
      surgical risk. Therefore the protocol will not lead to a delay in the start of treatment,&#xD;
      since treatment will be commenced earlier than usual. Once the study period is over, the&#xD;
      patients in the control group will receive CPAP if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-center study (with the participation of 3 centers), with an initial part (A) that is an&#xD;
      observational prospective case-control study coordinated by the Hospital Universitari de&#xD;
      Bellvitge. Based on the polysomnography performed on all patients who fulfill the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, the patients will be put into two groups: CASES: patients with OSA (AHI &gt;= 15) and&#xD;
      CONTROLS: Non-OSA (AHI &lt; 15). We will analyze whether metabolic syndrome is present or not&#xD;
      and the different determinations depending on whether or not the patients have OSA. In the&#xD;
      second part of the study (B) coordinated by the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau we will&#xD;
      analyze the treatment response of OSA patients with AHI &gt;= 30 to CPAP with a prospective,&#xD;
      controlled and randomized study of parallel groups, in which CPAP treatment will be compared&#xD;
      with conservative treatment in the form of a diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the observational study (part A), based on previous studies and accepting an alpha risk of&#xD;
      0.05 and a beta risk of 0.20 in bilateral contrast, we calculated that 39 subjects are needed&#xD;
      in each group to detect a difference greater than or equal to 0.32 between them. A proportion&#xD;
      of 0.55 is assumed in one of the groups. The dropout rate for the study has been estimated at&#xD;
      10%. The ARCCOSINE approximation has been used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the treatment response study (part B), 63 subjects are needed in each group to detect a&#xD;
      difference that is greater or equal to 1 units of HOMA, assuming a standard deviation of 1.90&#xD;
      based on previous studies. The dropout rate for the study has been estimated at 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY VARIABLES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anthropometric and demographic data: age, sex, weight, height, BMI, neck circumference.&#xD;
           Time between when patient became obese and recruitment date (period of obesity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measures of central obesity: waist circumference (above the superior border of the iliac&#xD;
           crest). The body mass index will be determined by dividing the weight in kilograms by&#xD;
           the height in meters squared. The waist/hip ratio will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Body fat composition will be measured with electrical bioimpedance using the&#xD;
           Bioimpedance Meter BIA 101 (Akern Bioresearch, Florence, Italy), with an analyzer for&#xD;
           bioimpedance of the vectors R (resistance) and Xc (reactance) with reference values for&#xD;
           obese subjects (Piccoli A. et al. Int. Journ. Of Obesity 1998; 22:97-104).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. General clinical questionnaire: cardiovascular risk factors and co-morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Self-assessment of daytime sleepiness. This will be analyzed using the Epworth scale (MW&#xD;
           Johns, Sleep 1991, 14;540).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Degree of sleepiness according to the definition of the American Thoracic Society:&#xD;
           classification into three categories: light, moderate and severe somnolence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Hours of sleep: this will be analyzed using a sleep diary that will be kept during a&#xD;
           period of 15 consecutive days. In addition, basic questions will be asked of each&#xD;
           patient while obtaining the medical history about the usual hours of sleep on working&#xD;
           days and weekends and holidays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Physical activity questionnaire: international self-administered questionnaire of&#xD;
           physical activity, short version. International physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ)&#xD;
           www.ipaq.ki.se.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Questionnaire on quality of life in patients with sleep apnea Quebec Sleep Questionnaire&#xD;
           (QSQ), self-administered, version translated into Spanish. (Y Lacasse, Thorax 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Respiratory Function Study: maximum F/V loop performed with Datospir 500 spirometer&#xD;
           (SIBEL, Barcelona), in accordance with the norms and reference values of the SEPAR (Roca&#xD;
           et al. Bull Eur Physiopathol Respir, 1986, 22: 217-24). In addition to the spirometric&#xD;
           variables (FVC; FEV1, FEV1/FVC,PEF), MIF50, MEF50/MIF50, PEF/FEV1 FEV0,5/FEV1, VVM/FEV1&#xD;
           will also be assessed. Static lung volumes. Helium dilution technique in accordance with&#xD;
           the norms and reference values of the SEPAR (Roca el al. Bull Eur Physiopathology&#xD;
           Respir, 1986, 22: 217-224). Arterial gases will be taken at rest while the subject is&#xD;
           seated and breathing room air and they will be evaluated using the established&#xD;
           recommendations (SEPAR working group for the practice of arterial gasometry (Arch.&#xD;
           Bronconeumol 1998: 34: 142-151).&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Conventional Polysomnography (PSG). This will be performed over an entire night using a&#xD;
           Compumedics Siesta Polysomnograph (Compumedics, Melbourne, Australia). It will include 2&#xD;
           electroencephalogram channels, 2 electro-oculography channels, chin electromyography,&#xD;
           oronasal flow measured by a thermistor and nasal canula, thoracic and abdominal&#xD;
           excursion bands, oxyhaemoglobin saturation (SpO2) measured with a finger probe,&#xD;
           electrocardiogram, anterior tibial electromyogram, sound recording for snores, and a&#xD;
           body position sensor. The criteria of Rechtstaffen and Kales will be used for visual&#xD;
           scoring of sleep stages. The minimum recording time is 6 hours and the minimum sleep&#xD;
           time is 3 hours. Definition of apnea: absence of flow for at least 10 seconds.&#xD;
           Definition of hypopnea: any reduction of flow with a minimum duration of at least 10&#xD;
           seconds that is accompanied by a desaturation (greater or equal to 3%) and/or a&#xD;
           transitory awakening or arousal (with arousal defined according to ASDA criteria: Sleep,&#xD;
           1992; 15: 173-184). Definition of hypoventilation: prolonged periods of arterial&#xD;
           desaturation not preceded by episodes of respiratory events. The following data will be&#xD;
           recorded: number of apnea/hypopnea episodes per hour (AHI), percentage of time in apnea&#xD;
           and/or hypopnea, number of arousals/hour, sleep efficiency (total sleep time/length of&#xD;
           recording), percentage of time in phases 1, 2, 3-4 and REM, initial oxyhemoglobin&#xD;
           saturation, average of oxyhemoglobin saturation, minimum saturation, time with&#xD;
           saturation of oxyhemoblobin under 90 % (CT90) and 85 % (CT85).&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Blood tests: a blood sample will be taken from all patients to determine their&#xD;
           biochemical profile and full general blood count, lipid profile (Triglycerides,&#xD;
           cholesterol (total cholesterol, HDL, VDL, LDL), glycosylated hemoglobin, insulin,&#xD;
           leptin, TNF alpha, TNF alpha soluble receptors 1 and 2, IL-6, IL-8 and adiponectin.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Measurement of blood pressure: The morning after the PSG is carried out 2 blood pressure&#xD;
           measurements will be taken at rest in a supine position, separated by 5 minutes, and&#xD;
           additional measurements will be made if there is a difference of more than 5 mmHg&#xD;
           between them. In accordance with the rules of the Sociedad Española de Hipertensión.&#xD;
           (Hipertension 2005; 22 supl 2: 16-20)&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Calculation of insulin resistance: This will be performed using the HOMA calculation&#xD;
           (Homeostasis Model Assessment) modeled by Matthews et al (Diabetologia 1985; 28:&#xD;
           412-419.).&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. Glucose tolerance measurements: In those patients without recognized diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
           a glucose load will be given after 12 hours of fasting, by administering 75 g of glucose&#xD;
           and determining glucose levels at 0 and 120 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
       16. Metabolic Syndrome: The percentage of Metabolic Syndrome will be defined for each of the&#xD;
           groups, with Metabolic Syndrome defined in accordance with international criteria (Adult&#xD;
           Treatment Panel III. JAMA 2001; 2486-2497) as the existence of the following three&#xD;
           conditions: 1) Central obesity: waist &gt; 88 cm in women, &gt; 102 cm in men, 2) Arterial&#xD;
           hypertension: AHT greater than or equal to 130/85 mmHg or treatment, 3) Hyperglycemia:&#xD;
           plasma glucose &gt; 6.1 mmol/L, 4) Hypertriglyceridemia: TG greater than 1.7 mmol/L, 5)&#xD;
           Hypo-HDL: HDL less than 1.3 mmol/L in men and 1 mmol/L in women. A metabolic index will&#xD;
           be established for each subject that will define the number of individual components of&#xD;
           Metabolic Syndrome they present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: All patients from the obesity surgery program of the Endocrinology service that&#xD;
      fulfill the inclusion criteria will be recruited. Patients will be assigned to groups&#xD;
      according to the result of the polysomnography. Patients with AHI &gt;= 15 will be considered&#xD;
      OSA and all other patients non-OSA until there are 39 patients in each group, in accordance&#xD;
      with the sample calculation. Thus all patients will be evaluated at baseline according to&#xD;
      their condition of OSA/non-OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Subsequently, the patients with severe OSA (AHI&gt;=30) who do not fulfill the specific&#xD;
      exclusion criteria for part B will randomized into the group for treatment with CPAP and diet&#xD;
      or the group for conservative treatment (diet). The patients will be evaluated after 6 and 12&#xD;
      weeks from the start of treatment (CPAP and diet vs. diet). The variables will be determined&#xD;
      at baseline and after 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A descriptive analysis of the sample will be carried out in accordance with central tendency&#xD;
      measures (mean, median) and dispersion measures (standard deviation and interquartile range)&#xD;
      in accordance with normality criteria (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). Then a comparative study&#xD;
      will be performed between the groups using chi-square test or Fisher's exact test as&#xD;
      appropriate to the qualitative variables; and Student's t test or the Mann-Whitney U test&#xD;
      will be used for the quantitative variables according to normality criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percentages of metabolic syndrome in the OSA and non-OSA patients, as well as the&#xD;
      percentages of OSA in the groups with and without metabolic syndrome will be compared. The&#xD;
      differences in metabolic syndrome and the metabolic index will be analyzed according to the&#xD;
      severity of the OSA. This will initially be carried out through the univariate analysis of&#xD;
      the variables gathered in the group of patients and the control groups, and those variables&#xD;
      that have an association with p-value &lt; 0.10, and that do not interact among themselves will&#xD;
      be considered in a binary logistic regression model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part of the study, after 12 weeks of CPAP treatment, the variables from the&#xD;
      baseline and final situation will be compared with the parametric or non-parametric tests as&#xD;
      appropriate depending on their normality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will be carried out using the statistical package SPSS 15.0 (Illinois, Chicago),&#xD;
      and a p-value &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant in all cases.&#xD;
