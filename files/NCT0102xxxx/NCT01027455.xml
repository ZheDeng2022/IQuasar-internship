  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In laparoscopic (key-hole) surgery, the use of cold dry carbon dioxide gas to inflate the&#xD;
      abdominal cavity for the creation a clear operating field, results in damage to the cavity&#xD;
      lining, known as the peritoneum. This has been associated with negative effects on&#xD;
      post-operative recovery. Adult studies using warm humidified insufflation gas have indicated&#xD;
      possible decreased post-operative pain, reduced narcotic analgesia requirements, decreased&#xD;
      fogging of the laparoscopic camera lens, and reduced time to return to normal activities.&#xD;
      Cold dry gas during laparoscopic surgery also has potential to cause abnormal decrease in&#xD;
      body core temperature (hypothermia). This has been established by trials in adult humans and&#xD;
      animal models. The WARMIST study aims to investigate for whether warm humid gas insuflation&#xD;
      during laparoscopic removal of the appendix in children reduces intraoperative temperature&#xD;
      variations, post-operative pain (indicated by morphine usage and pain scores), length of&#xD;
      hospital stay and degree of camera lens fogging, and speed post-operative recovery compared&#xD;
      to using cold dry gas insufflation.&#xD;

      Study Aim/Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does warm humidified carbon dioxide gas compared to cold dry gas for abdominal cavity&#xD;
      insufflation during laparoscopic appendectomy in children reduce variations in intraoperative&#xD;
      core body temperature, reduce post-operative pain, and improve post-operative recovery?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Aim of this study is to investigate whether differences exist in the following outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intraoperative temperature variation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Need for post-operative opiate analgesia (primary outcome of the study);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Post-operative pain scores;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Length of hospital stay;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Post-operative return to normal daily activities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Fogging of laparoscope lens; when warm humidified rather than cold dry gas is used for&#xD;
           intra-abdominal insufflation during laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis in&#xD;
           children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Sample Size and Power Calculations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a retrospective audit of 43 children who underwent laparoscopic appendicectomy at&#xD;
      Starship Children's Hospital in 2006, 70% required opiate-based analgesia for pain relief&#xD;
      during some stage of their admission. To detect a 30% reduction from 70% (i.e. 49% of the&#xD;
      exposure group will require opiates) with power of 0.8 and alpha of 0.05 using 2 tailed&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test, 95 participants will be needed per arm of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children aged 8-14 years presenting to Starship Children's Hospital within the study period&#xD;
      diagnosed clinically with acute appendicitis requiring diagnostic laparoscopy +/-&#xD;
      appendicectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent to participate in study not obtained, partial or total blindness, unable to speak and&#xD;
      read sufficient English, presence of any abdominal prostheses, diagnosis of mental&#xD;
      retardation, developmental delay, neuro-muscular impairment, attention-deficit disorder,&#xD;
      chronic pain, or psychiatric illness, immunosuppression, allergy to morphine, and history of&#xD;
      previous abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Randomised-Controlled Trial involving 190 children aged between 8-14 years&#xD;
      presenting to Starship Children's Hospital with clinical signs of acute appendicitis. After&#xD;
      recruitment, study participants will be randomised to either the intervention group (warm&#xD;
      humidified gas insufflation) or control group (cool dry gas insufflation) before undergoing&#xD;
      laparoscopic appendicectomy as part of the surgical management of acute appendicitis. The&#xD;
      insufflation device used will the the Fisher and Paykel Insuflow MR 860. Other intraoperative&#xD;
      variables will be controlled or standardised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A computer-generated random sequence will be employed to randomise study participants. Group&#xD;
      allocations will be placed in sealed opaque envelopes and these will be opened in sequence&#xD;
      for consecutive participants. Allocations will be concealed until completion of data&#xD;
      collection. To ensure double-blinding (blinding of investigators, operating surgeons, members&#xD;
      of the clinical team, study participants and family), circulating theatre nurses who have no&#xD;
      direct involvement in the care of participants will be unblinded and control the switches to&#xD;
      the insufflation device. Upon opening an allocation envelope, they will set the Insuflow&#xD;
      device on warm humidified or cold dry gas insufflation and place a specially designed cover&#xD;
      over the device before transferring the device into the operating theatre. This cover will be&#xD;
      placed over the insufflation device for the duration of the operation to blind other theatre&#xD;
      personnel. At the end of the operation, the insufflation device will be switched off and&#xD;
      removed from theatre by circulating theatre nurses with the cover intact. It will be&#xD;
      disassembled in the theatre preparation room, out of sight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be measured/collected intraoperatively:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Core body temperature measured every 10 minutes from a nasogastric temperature probe,&#xD;
           placed after anaesthetic induction;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Severity of laparoscopic camera lens fogging: Surgeon's rating of the severity of camera&#xD;
           fogging (scale of 1 to 10 - 10 representing worst degree of fogging);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Surgeon's rating of the operation's technical difficulty (scale of 1 to 10 - 10&#xD;
           representing most difficult);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Total volume of CO2 gas used for pneumoperitoneum creation and maintenance;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Duration of operation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Total amount of analgesia and anti-emetics given intraoperatively;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Pathological appearance of appendix and degree of peritoneal faecal/pus contamination if&#xD;
           appendix perforation is present;&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Temperature and volume of intravenous fluids administered and any peritoneal irrigation&#xD;
           fluids used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard perioperative care protocol will be used to ensure all study patients receive the&#xD;
      same standard of care, reducing risk of performance bias. The protocol will cover&#xD;
      perioperative use of antibiotics, measures to prevent infections including wound infections,&#xD;
      post-operative oral feeding and mobilisation, criteria for discharge, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative opioid-sparing analgesia medication (paracetamol and non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory agents) will be standardised for all study participants in the&#xD;
      post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) and on the surgical ward. The route of administration will&#xD;
      depend on the degree of nausea and vomiting, with both oral and per rectal preparations&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) from 0 to 10 will be used to measure pain and to ascertain&#xD;
      requirements for additional nurse-controlled analgesia. All opiate-based analgesia required&#xD;
      in the first 12 hours post-operatively will be administered intravenously to minimize&#xD;
      variations in gastrointestinal absorption and effects of post-operative nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      (PONV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following outcomes will be measured and recorded post-operatively:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tympanic body temperature at 10-minute intervals for the duration of stay in PACU&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Presence of shivering in PACU&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Post-operative pain scores at rest and with movement, measured using 10-point pictorial&#xD;
           Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)at the following times: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, and 48 hours&#xD;
           from end of operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Total Nurse-controlled Opioid Analgesia required, both oral and parenteral, converted to&#xD;
           Mean Equivalent Daily Dose (MEDD) units of parenteral morphine, in the first 12, 24 and&#xD;
           48 hours post-operatively and during the entire hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The need for opioid analgesia and the total quantity required for the total duration of&#xD;
           hospital stay will be the primary outcome for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The opiate-based analgesia available for this study are: oral morphine, IV morphine, and&#xD;
           IV fentanyl.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Severity of post-operative nausea, number of vomiting episodes and total amount of&#xD;
           anti-emetic medications required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Total length of laparoscopic port site wounds, measured in millimetres during the first&#xD;
           dressing change&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Length of hospital stay (days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Post-operative return of normal activities is measured using a Day-10 Post-operative&#xD;
           Recovery Questionnaire given to participants and family at the time of discharge from&#xD;
           hospital. Participants are asked to complete this questionnaire the morning of Day 10&#xD;
           after their operation and post it back to the investigators in a pre-paid envelope&#xD;
           provided. The Questionnaire is adapted from the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory&#xD;
           Version 4.0. The Principle Investigator will remind participants with a phone call one&#xD;
           to two days before the Questionnaire has to be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All operative and disease-related complications (minor and major) during hospital stay or&#xD;
      reported at the follow-up outpatient clinic will also be recorded. Standard&#xD;
      internationally-recognized definitions of operative complications will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis of Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and Control groups will be compared using Fisher's exact test for categorical&#xD;
      variables and appropriate non-paired parametric or non-parametric statistical tests for&#xD;
      continuous variables, depending of the normality of the data. Statistical significance will&#xD;
      be set at 2-tailed P value &lt;.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analysis of the uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis groups will be&#xD;
      undertaken.&#xD;
