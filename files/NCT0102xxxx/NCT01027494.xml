  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study was to evaluate the effects of a topical&#xD;
      fluoroquinolone (antibiotic) instilled into the otic (ear) canal to treat Acute Otitis Media&#xD;
      through Tympanostomy Tubes (AOMT) on selected bacterial species on the skin near the ear, in&#xD;
      the nose, and in the throat.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pediatric patients with tympanostomy tubes were enrolled into one of two groups: 1)&#xD;
      Treatment, i.e., patients with signs of otic infection, to be treated with CIPRODEX; or 2)&#xD;
      Healthy, i.e., patients without signs of otic infection, to receive no treatment.&#xD;
      Microbiological specimens were collected from four areas (ear canal, skin, nose, throat)&#xD;
      during three study visits (Day 1, Day 8, and Day 42), and the specimens collected from the&#xD;
      Healthy group served as a comparison (control) group for identifying fluoroquinolone (FQ)&#xD;
      resistant bacterial strains.&#xD;
