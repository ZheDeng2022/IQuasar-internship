  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether an intensive computerized intervention&#xD;
      targeted on improving central auditory and visual processing and executive functioning can be&#xD;
      implemented in youths aged 10-19 with psychotic spectrum disorders, what developmental&#xD;
      modifications are needed particularly for the younger participants, and whether it is&#xD;
      possible to develop an appropriate, blinded control intervention.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to provide a foundation for future rigorous study of an&#xD;
      intervention that translates what we know about refinement of synaptic connections in&#xD;
      response to environmental stimuli to an individualized intervention that directly improves&#xD;
      neurocognitive functioning in youths with early onset psychosis(EOP). We will conduct a pilot&#xD;
      randomized control study that determines the feasibility, tolerability and acceptability of&#xD;
      Intensive Computerized Brain Training (ICBT) in youth with EOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Seventy youths, aged 10 years to 19 years inclusive will be assessed in the&#xD;
      study. Forty youths with EOP will be randomly assigned to ICBT or an equally intense&#xD;
      computerized game activity and 20 will be age, gender and race matched youths with no major&#xD;
      psychiatric illnesses. We will allow for up to 5 EOP screen failures and up to 5 healthy&#xD;
      control screen failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): The forty participants with EOP will be randomly assigned to treatment&#xD;
      with ICBT or equally intense video game play that also involves attention to sensory stimuli&#xD;
      and requires increasingly skilled responses. A computer generated randomization schedule will&#xD;
      be used to make assignments. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, completion of the&#xD;
      intervention (typically week 20), 3 after completing the intervention (typically month 8) and&#xD;
      7 months after completing the intervention(typically month 12). The other 20 youths, who&#xD;
      comprise the typically developing comparison group known as healthy controls, will not&#xD;
      participate in the computer activity or regular monthly psychiatric visits and will not&#xD;
      complete satisfaction questionnaires. Up to 10 subjects may not be eligible to participate in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
