    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to perform laboratory based studies to determine if the growth&#xD;
      and development of the malaria parasite is effected by iron status of its host (the person&#xD;
      infected with the malaria parasite). Iron deficiency affects over 500 million people&#xD;
      including many pregnant women and children from areas of the world that are plagued by&#xD;
      malaria. Some population based studies have suggested that iron deficiency protects people&#xD;
      from getting malaria and this has raised questions about the wisdom of public health policies&#xD;
      that provide universal iron supplementation in countries where malaria is common. We will use&#xD;
      red blood cells and sera from patients with iron deficiency anemia, hereditary&#xD;
      hemochromatosis and normal individuals who are taking iron supplements to look at this&#xD;
      question in a very systematic way. This study should provide information for or against a&#xD;
      possible mechanism by which iron deficiency may affect the malaria parasite. The results will&#xD;
      contribute to efforts to develop evidence-based public health policies on iron&#xD;
      supplementation policies in malaria-endemic areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three different types of individuals involved in this study (1) people with iron&#xD;
      deficiency anemia who will be taking iron supplementation (2) people without iron deficiency&#xD;
      anemia who will be taking iron supplementation and (3) people with a condition called&#xD;
      hereditary hemochromatosis who have an excess of iron in their bodies.&#xD;

      Purpose: This proposal is aimed at studying the effect of an individual's iron status and&#xD;
      iron supplementation on the growth and viability of the malarial parasite Plasmodium&#xD;
      falciparum. The overall goal is to provide evidence to support the development of&#xD;
      evidence-based programs to improve global health policy on iron supplementation in areas of&#xD;
      the world with high malaria transmission. Current WHO recommendations include routine&#xD;
      supplementation of women and children. Recently however, the wisdom of this policy when&#xD;
      applied to areas afflicted with high rates of malaria has come under scrutiny. This proposal&#xD;
      will study the effects of red blood cells (RBCs) and sera from iron overloaded patients (with&#xD;
      hereditary hemochromatosis), iron deficient patients, and iron replete individuals taking&#xD;
      oral iron supplements. This proposal will attempt to identify the mechanism by which the&#xD;
      human host's iron status and iron supplement use affects the growth and viability of the P.&#xD;
      falciparum parasite in red blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Healthy adult volunteers, adults with iron deficiency anemia, and patients with&#xD;
      hereditary hemochromatosis will be enrolled in this study. Fifteen individuals will be&#xD;
      recruited under each of the above three settings. This study involves only subjects over 18&#xD;
      years of age and both males and females will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): Participation in the study involves undergoing a series of screening&#xD;
      tests and donation of blood and either a single time point (for hemochromatosis patients) or&#xD;
      a total of three pre-specified time points (for healthy volunteers and those with iron&#xD;
      deficiency). The healthy individuals will be asked to take oral iron supplements once daily&#xD;
      (325 mg ferrous sulfate) for the duration of this study. Patient's blood will be separated by&#xD;
      centrifugation into RBCs and sera, both of which will be used for in vitro studies on the&#xD;
      impact of iron status on the growth and viability of Plasmodium falciparum.&#xD;

  <eligibility>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All study participants will need to meet the following eligibility criteria for&#xD;
        participation in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. 18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Agree to HIV testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No known malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Agree to pregnancy testing (when applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Do not have sickle cell disease or trait&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Do not have thalassemia or thalassemia trait&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Not taking iron supplementation&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have O+ or A+ blood group, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Consent to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition to the above common study screening tests, additional specific eligibility&#xD;
        criteria for the three study groups are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Individuals with iron deficiency:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Iron deficiency will be diagnosed using the biochemical parameters listed below&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum iron: &lt;40 µg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Iron binding capacity (transferrin): &lt;40 µg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Saturation (SI/TIBC): &lt;10 percent&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin: &lt; 9 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Red cell morphology: Hypochromia and microcytosis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Plasma or serum ferritin: &lt;10 ng/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Individuals with Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HH):&#xD;
&#xD;
             In addition to confirmation with genetic testing, it is expected that patients with HH&#xD;
             will have the biochemical parameters listed below. From the genotype standpoint, only&#xD;
             patients homozygous for the C282Y and H63D mutations and those that are compound&#xD;
             heterozygotes for C282Y/H63D will be enrolled. These are the mutations most associated&#xD;
             with iron overload in HH patients. Note that we will have different criteria for men&#xD;
             and women. Since women (with and without hemochromatosis) have greater iron losses&#xD;
             (secondary to menstruation) in comparison to men, they usually have lower iron stores,&#xD;
             lower ferritin levels and lower iron saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Biochemical parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Biochemical markers for patients with HH&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum iron: &gt;65 µg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Saturation (SI/TIBC): &gt; 60% men; &gt;50% women&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Plasma or serum ferritin: &gt;300ng/mL men; &gt;200 ng/mL women&#xD;
&#xD;
             Each study participant will have been diagnosed (via genetic testing) with HH prior to&#xD;
             the enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Healthy volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with HIV, that are pregnant, and those with Sickle cell anemia/trait or&#xD;
        Thalassemia/Thal trait will not be eligible to participate in this study as these&#xD;
        conditions could interfere with the outcomes of the in vitro studies performed in this&#xD;
        proposal.&#xD;
