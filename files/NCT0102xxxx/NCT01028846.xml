    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the ability of the body to regulate&#xD;
      glucose (sugar). When glucose levels are low, the liver can make glucose to increase levels&#xD;
      in the body. This important process is called endogenous glucose production (EGP). Previous&#xD;
      studies suggest that the central nervous system (CNS), including the brain, helps to&#xD;
      coordinate this process by communicating with the liver through potassium channels. Control&#xD;
      of EGP can be impaired in people with type 2 diabetes, which may contribute to the high&#xD;
      levels of glucose seen in these individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to understand how activating these potassium channels in the&#xD;
      control centers of the brain with a medication called diazoxide might inhibit the amount of&#xD;
      glucose made by the liver. This is particularly important for people with diabetes who have&#xD;
      very high production of glucose, which in turn causes hyperglycemia (high levels of sugar in&#xD;
      the blood) that leads to diabetes complications.&#xD;

      In this study, the investigators will study healthy participants through a procedure called a&#xD;
      &quot;pancreatic clamp&quot; study. During the clamp procedure, glucose (a sugar) and insulin (a&#xD;
      hormone produced in the pancreas that regulates the amount of glucose in the blood) are&#xD;
      infused with an intravenous catheter, and blood samples are collected periodically throughout&#xD;
      the procedure to measure blood sugar levels and the levels of several hormones that are found&#xD;
      in the body and are related to glucose metabolism. Endogenous glucose production (the&#xD;
      production of sugar by the liver) will be measured in patients given diazoxide (a medication&#xD;
      that activates potassium channels in the brain that may affect glucose production in the&#xD;
      liver through brain-liver signaling), compared with when a placebo is given.&#xD;
