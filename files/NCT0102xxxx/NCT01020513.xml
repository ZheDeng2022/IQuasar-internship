      This is an observational study examining the workflow dynamics and training requirements that&#xD;
      support effective use of subcutaneous hydration delivery (a newly FDA approved Baxter&#xD;
      product) compared to standard intravenous hydration/medication delivery. Emergency&#xD;
      departments already using both Subcutaneous Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase and standard IV&#xD;
      hydration will be enrolled. Patients will be receiving the hydration method selected by their&#xD;
      emergency department physician and the investigators will then observe:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient Throughput&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Efficiency of patient care and treatment areas&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Safety of patient care and treatment areas&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Support Service processes that impact patient flow&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical Outcomes&#xD;

      SPECIFIC AIMS This study examines the operational consequences and training requirements for&#xD;
      implementing subcutaneous hydration vs. standard intravenous hydration in emergency&#xD;
      departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Emergency departments across the nation are overcrowded.&#xD;
      Emergency department visits hit a new high in 2005, with more than 115 million visits, an&#xD;
      increase of 5 million visits over the previous year, and a 20 percent increase over 10 years.&#xD;
      During the same period the number of hospital EDs decreased more than 9 percent from 4,176 to&#xD;
      3,795. A consequence of the increase in demand occurring during a decrease in capacity,&#xD;
      according to the American College of Emergency Physicians is that 60 percent of EDs report&#xD;
      that the overcrowding has forced their facilities to divert patients and though more than 70&#xD;
      percent of hospitals reported having a goal of admitting patients within two hours of arrival&#xD;
      in the emergency department, almost half of that group routinely fails.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overcrowding not only results in delayed treatment, long patient waiting time, overburdened&#xD;
      working staff, patient elopement, and low throughput, it also results in increased medical&#xD;
      errors due to overloading and significant legal and financial risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These issues have led to a number of initiatives with, potentially the most profound being&#xD;
      the 2007 Joint Commission requirement ( Leadership Standard, LD.3.15) requiring hospital&#xD;
      leadership to:&quot;… develop and implement plans to identify and mitigate impediments to&#xD;
      efficient patient flow throughout the hospital&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Developing processes and procedures that can improve patient ﬂow in EDs, improve efficiency&#xD;
      and reduce crowding is in all parties interests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One potential area of improvement is in the hydration of patients. Twenty-five million&#xD;
      Americans have intravenous catheters placed each year representing significant commitment of&#xD;
      time, personnel, and resources. Several systems have been devised for the effective delivery&#xD;
      of injectable material into a body using intravenous systems, but all suffer from drawbacks&#xD;
      including trauma associated with intravenous needle placement and swelling, infection and&#xD;
      limited, often compromised, placement sites . Furthermore intravenous hydration delivery&#xD;
      require, at minimum, an RN who not only starts the IV but is also expected to monitor rates&#xD;
      of perfusion (Adequate end-organ perfusion is best indicated by urine output of &gt; 0.5 to 1&#xD;
      mL/kg/h) and notify the physician when desired end-states are obtained. In our own studies of&#xD;
      Emergency Departments, this process added significant time to patient stays as well as&#xD;
      increased error rates in the form of either ration fluids running out without replacement or&#xD;
      patients needing to urinate without a Nurse recording that they had reached this end-point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvement in either the rate of hydration and reduction in trauma and complications&#xD;
      associated with typical intravenous systems should be a benefit to both patients and health&#xD;
      care systems. Healthcare has developed a new system of hydration/medication delivery using&#xD;
      Subcutaneous Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase. Subcutaneous Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase&#xD;
      offers several advantages in hydrating emergency department patients over I.V. hydration&#xD;
      methods. These include unlimited placement sites, (providing both psychological and&#xD;
      physiological benefits), more rapid hydration, potentially administered by lower-cost and&#xD;
      more available ED personnel than required for IVs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, new technologies super-imposed on old processes frequently do not generate the full&#xD;
      potential of the new technology. Cars required a paved highway system and cell-phones&#xD;
      required methods for uniquely identifying individual calls in three dimensional space.&#xD;
      Attempting to implement Subcutaneous Hydration in an environment such as an Emergency&#xD;
      Department may find &quot;as is&quot; workflow dynamics and skills do not effectively support the new&#xD;
      technology. It is essential to understand how Emergency rooms function to understand how to&#xD;
      improve the process, and where training in use of new technologies is most appropriately&#xD;
      addressed to realize efficiencies and improved quality of care. Following is our model of&#xD;
      EDs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This is a classic direct observation, workflow study in which&#xD;
      the endpoints are the (potential) time differences in patient throughput, when hydration&#xD;
      occurs via Subcutaneous Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase vs. Intravenous methods. We will also&#xD;
      capture difference in patient and staff satisfaction for the two hydration methods. The&#xD;
      satisfaction survey occurs immediately as part of the workflow observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design employs a Difference within Difference design in which the relative&#xD;
      differences in patient throughput (primary variable of interest) and patient/staff&#xD;
      satisfaction (secondary variable of interest for the various hydration/medication delivery&#xD;
      systems is assessed at each site. It is the relative difference in measures for each site&#xD;
      that is used in the aggregate for analysis. This mitigates the danger of large variations&#xD;
      between sites overwhelming the differences between treatment options within sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this is an observational study, primarily of workflow characteristics, we will not (nor&#xD;
      could we) make any determination of the appropriateness of individual provider's decision to&#xD;
      either initiate or discontinue patient hydration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach Between three and five Emergency Departments (depending on volume) that have already&#xD;
      approved Subcutaneous Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase for their formulary will be included in&#xD;
      this study. Following UCSD (and other relevant participating organizations) IRB approval, the&#xD;
      UCSD P.I. and Project Coordinator will coordinate with identified administrative personnel at&#xD;
      each research site regarding the nature of the study, provide an introduction of field&#xD;
      observers, and what the product of the study will be. In addition, each site will be asked if&#xD;
      there are specific issues they would like the research team to analyze that fit within the&#xD;
      parameters of the study. Once all clearances and permissions are obtained, field observers&#xD;
      will be oriented to the individual facilities and introduced to the staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observations will be conducted in the following manner, field staff will observe ED patients&#xD;
      and record the time they enter the facility. Once ED patients have completed the triage and&#xD;
      are identified as an Acuity Level 3-5, field staff will approach ED patients and offer the&#xD;
      opportunity to participate in the observational study. If signed permission is granted then&#xD;
      field staff will &quot;shadow&quot; patients through the total ED visit using the Observational&#xD;
      Checklist of Patient Encounters (OCPE), which has been published by the Joint Commission. 15&#xD;
      It is a 52 item checklist capturing three types of data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Operational conditions at the time of an encounter (e.g. staffing ratios X number of&#xD;
           patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Whether key procedures occurred (e.g. temperature taken, pain assessment completed)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Time to task completion (e.g. how long from the time an imaging study was ordered until&#xD;
           the patient is taken to imaging) Patient satisfaction data will be collected as part of&#xD;
           each workflow observation. Secondary variables of interest, specifically satisfaction&#xD;
           and assessment of possible iatrogenic effects, occur at the conclusion of each&#xD;
           observation. Patients are directly surveyed about their satisfaction with the encounter.&#xD;
           Preference items (e.g. satisfaction with the provider) use standard 5-point likert scale&#xD;
           while objective items (e.g. &quot;is the care you received the care you expected, did you&#xD;
           have any bruising around the hydration site) are cast as binary answers. Staff and&#xD;
           providers undergo similar direct surveys of satisfaction and observation of iatrogenic&#xD;
           effects, though the interview is not time-dependent as the patient satisfaction surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures The data generated by the workflow observations and satisfaction surveys&#xD;
      produce three distinct types of data sets for analysis. The one of primary interest for this&#xD;
      study is the difference in time sequences and patient throughput between Subcutaneous&#xD;
      Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase vs. Intravenous hydration methods. This type of data not only&#xD;
      provides simple time-motion comparisons, it is also frequently used to generate measures of&#xD;
      efficiency (i.e. how many patients can be hydrated for a given unit of time and labor) and&#xD;
      proficiency (i.e. how many patients can be correctly hydrated for a given unit of time and&#xD;
      labor). Secondary outcomes of interest include the difference in patient and staff&#xD;
      satisfaction, including perception of iatrogenic effects, between Subcutaneous Recombinant&#xD;
      Human Hyaluronidase and Intravenous hydration methods. The third data set includes the&#xD;
      operational conditions requisite for effective use of Subcutaneous Recombinant Human&#xD;
      Hyaluronidase use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Data preparation and analysis will follow standard statistical techniques&#xD;
      appropriate for each method used in this study. For example, McNemar tests will be used to&#xD;
      determine significant changes for dichotomous variables such as errors of commission and&#xD;
      omission (e.g., IV fluid ran out, patient urinates without staff noting). Paired-samples&#xD;
      t-tests will be used to determine significant differences for both discrete continuous&#xD;
      variables (e.g., time required to perform exam, time in waiting room) and ratio variables&#xD;
      (e.g., patient/provider time to all time in clinic, patient/provider time to waiting time in&#xD;
      the exam room). Wilcoxon signed-rank tests will be used to determine significant changes for&#xD;
      variables using Likert scale response options (e.g., provider, staff, and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction ratings on a 5-point scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures of efficiency, such as improved patient throughput or increased adherence to&#xD;
      ED policy and procedures, will use traditional parametric efficiency calculations. Efficiency&#xD;
      is essentially how much of a service can be provided correctly for a given unit of time and&#xD;
      resources (including personnel). Efficiency will be calculated using the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where:&#xD;
&#xD;
      N = individuals who could be hydrated PV = probability of being hydrated with Subcutaneous&#xD;
      Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase PHHR = probability of hydration that has begun evaluated&#xD;
      within time defined by protocol PD = probability of hydration iatrogenic effects L = labor&#xD;
      costs C = capital costs M = material costs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, data will undergo Critical Path Analysis to identifying &quot;inputs&quot; or operational&#xD;
      factors controlling patient flow dynamics and clinical outcomes. This analysis will use&#xD;
      classification and regression analysis using binary recursive partitioning to identify the&#xD;
      variables with the greatest predictive ability to correctly classify patient's lengths of&#xD;
      stay in the ED.&#xD;
