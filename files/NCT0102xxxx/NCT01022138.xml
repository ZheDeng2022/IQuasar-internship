      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Treating a patient's T&#xD;
      cells in the laboratory may help the T cells kill more tumor cells when they are put back in&#xD;
      the body. Giving laboratory-treated T cells after chemotherapy may be an effective treatment&#xD;
      for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving laboratory-treated T cells after&#xD;
      second-line chemotherapy works in treating women with HER2/neu-negative metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine in a phase II trial whether Her2Bi armed ATC infused after ChemoT for&#xD;
           patients with HER2 0-2+ MBC or locally advanced, unresectable breast cancer would&#xD;
           improve median PFS by 2 months beyond the median PFS of 2 months estimated from&#xD;
           published trials in a one stage design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the overall survival (OS) of patients with HER2 0-2+ MBC and locally&#xD;
           advanced, unresectable breast cancer who receive aATC infusion after ChemoT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To confirm the toxicity profile for Her2Bi armed ATC given after ChemoT for patients&#xD;
           with HER2 0-2+ MBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure functional and phenotypic changes in immune cell populations (blood and tumor&#xD;
           sites, if accessible) as a consequence of armed ATC (tumor biopsies done at KCI only).&#xD;
           Cytokine responses, phenotypic markers of differentiation, and anti-tumor cytotoxicity&#xD;
           will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  OUTLINE: Patients receive second-line chemotherapy for 4 courses or 4 months. Beginning&#xD;
           as early as 1.5 weeks and as late as 4 weeks after chemotherapy, the patients will&#xD;
           receive the first infusion of anti-CD3 x anti-HER2/neu bispecific antibody-armed&#xD;
           activated T-cells (ATC) IV over 30-60 minutes once a week for 3 weeks. Low dose&#xD;
           granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (250 µg/m2/twice per week) will start 3&#xD;
           days before the first aATC infusion and end with the last dose of aATC. Patients who are&#xD;
           already on the protocol will be given a choice to add GM-CSF to their treatment regimen&#xD;
           (after reconsenting) or continue to their treatment without GM-CSF. Patients then&#xD;
           receive a boost of anti-CD3 x anti-HER2/neu bispecific antibody-armed ATC at 12 weeks&#xD;
           after the 3rd ATC infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and tumor tissue samples may be collected periodically for biomarker and other&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for ≥ 2 years.&#xD;
