      Background and objectives: There is a general agreement that some types of urban environment&#xD;
      could be the source of psychological stress as opposed to natural-relaxing environment. A&#xD;
      number of aesthetical researches found out that the main cause for stress appearance can be&#xD;
      explained by the complexity and order of the environment. There are also some indications&#xD;
      that the stressing influence of the open environment can be measured by evaluating eye&#xD;
      movements, in particular saccadic movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to characterize eye movements - mainly saccades -while&#xD;
      presenting visual material of different complexity and order and to evaluate the possible&#xD;
      relationship between eye movements and parameters of psychological and physiological stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The research is based on systematic gradual experiments on healthy volunteers, who&#xD;
      will be tested while viewing series of abstract figures and pictures of natural and urban&#xD;
      areas with different level of complexity and order. Each figure or picture will be showed to&#xD;
      subjects for 7 seconds. During the whole experimental session the investigators will measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Saccadic and other eye movements using the magnetic scleral search coil technique. The&#xD;
           magnetic scleral search coil technique is the most sensitive and accurate technique used&#xD;
           in modern ocular motor research for measuring horizontal, vertical and torsional eye&#xD;
           movements. The coils are easy to apply and well tolerated over a wearing period of up to&#xD;
           45 minutes per recording session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Heart rate pulse will be measured using a commercial pulse-meter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Aesthetical evaluation: Following each figure or picture 7 seconds presentation;&#xD;
           subjects will rate it in a scale from 1 (very relaxing) to 10 (very stressful).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible relationship between saccadic eye movements, heart rate and aesthetical rate will be&#xD;
      analyzed using WIN 11 SPSS and MATLAB in statistically accepted ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: A total of about 60 healthy subjects aged 18-60 years old will be recruited for&#xD;
      the study from students, faculty and staff of Tel Aviv University and of Meir Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for inclusion: Healthy subject with normal vision&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for exclusion: Eye disease such as corneal or scleral abrasion or disease, glaucoma,&#xD;
      refractive errors greater than 2 diopters and concurrent medication with CNS-active agents.&#xD;
