      A randomised controlled trial of intubation by inexperienced anaesthetists, comparing the The&#xD;
      Pentax Airway Scope AWS-S100 Rigid Video Laryngoscope(Pentax AWS) and the Macintosh&#xD;
      Laryngoscope.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      General anaesthesia often requires that the trachea be protected by intubation. This involves&#xD;
      placement of a cuffed endotracheal tube into the trachea, after the onset of unconsciousness&#xD;
      and muscle relaxation. Usually this requires the anaesthetist to obtain a direct view of the&#xD;
      patient's vocal cords via the mouth, using a laryngoscope such as the Macintosh laryngoscope.&#xD;
      The endotracheal tube is then guided through the vocal cords into the trachea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difficult or failed intubation, is a potentially serious and occasionally life threatening&#xD;
      complication. This is the unexpected inability to place the endotracheal tube in the correct&#xD;
      place. The commonest cause is a failure to achieve an adequate view of the vocal cords at&#xD;
      laryngoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failed or difficult intubation significantly delays establishment of a secure airway and&#xD;
      therefore can lead to major morbidity from hypoxia and/or aspiration of gastric contents.&#xD;
      Other morbidity can also ensue from delay to the procedure in emergency situations or airway&#xD;
      trauma due the various devices used or the force required to secure intubation. Whilst all&#xD;
      anaesthetists and their assistants are trained to deal with difficult or failed intubations,&#xD;
      disasters do occur. For example, in obstetrics, the previous Confidential Enquiry into&#xD;
      Maternal Deaths reported five of the six deaths directly due to anaesthesia were related to&#xD;
      intubation difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pentax Airway Scope AWS-S100 (Pentax AWS), Rigid Video Laryngoscope for Intubation is a&#xD;
      new self-contained video laryngoscope with an integral colour-viewing screen mounted on the&#xD;
      handle. A camera at the tip transmits an indirect image, which obviates the need to obtain a&#xD;
      direct view of the vocal cords. It requires no prior set-up of equipment and is intuitive to&#xD;
      use for anyone already competent in traditional direct laryngoscopy. Previously conducted&#xD;
      evaluations of the scope have been presented and show that intubation can be secured within a&#xD;
      clinically normal time span by various grades of anaesthetists in various clinical&#xD;
      situations. Authors are currently suggesting it has a role as a back-up device for difficult&#xD;
      intubations and for training. One has been obtained for the Foresterhill site for these&#xD;
      purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE The simplicity of use and intuitive function of the Pentax AWS suggests it may have&#xD;
      a wider role than as a back-up and could possibly be the first-line laryngoscope for&#xD;
      situations where difficulty with intubation is more likely or more hazardous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of difficult or failed intubation for an individual anaesthetist is related to&#xD;
      their experience, decreasing as experience increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the Pentax AWS when used by relatively inexperienced&#xD;
      anaesthetists. Inexperienced anaesthetists are those most likely to encounter difficulties&#xD;
      and thus their practice carries the highest risk. Therefore, this is a setting in which there&#xD;
      would be a particular benefit to patient safety in having the most effective tool for&#xD;
      successful and timely completion of tracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS The study will compare intubation using the Pentax AWS vs. the usual Macintosh&#xD;
      laryngoscope in a sample of patients where 1st and 2nd year specialist trainees in&#xD;
      anaesthesia (ST's) perform the intubation. There will be no other change in routine practice&#xD;
      for the purposes of the trial. Specifically, the trial will recruit only from the population&#xD;
      of patients that the ST's are routinely scheduled to intubate anyway. They will be working&#xD;
      under the direct supervision of a consultant or senior specialist registrar (SpR), at all&#xD;
      times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, data relating to routine intubations with the Macintosh laryngoscope will be&#xD;
      collected. We will conduct training in the method of use of the Pentax AWS with the ST's, to&#xD;
      a pre-determined level (see below) and collect and compare learning data, during routine&#xD;
      clinical work with this laryngoscope. Following on from this, we will determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the Pentax AWS in patients undergoing routine tracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 ST's will perform the intubations within the trial. They fulfil the experience criteria&#xD;
      required of the study, they began anaesthetic training between August 2010 and August 2011,&#xD;
      have reached the required Royal College of Anaesthetists' level of competency in the practice&#xD;
      of intubation and are approved to anaesthetise with indirect supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to commencement of recruitment into this study, it will be necessary for these ST&#xD;
      anaesthetists to demonstrate a safe level of ability with the Pentax AWS. This is in order&#xD;
      not to compromise safety in those patients randomized to undergo intubation with the Pentax&#xD;
      AWS. They will be trained in the use of the Pentax AWS by the principle investigator (PI),&#xD;
      initially using an airway training manikin and then in normal clinical practice. After&#xD;
      gaining basic skill with the Pentax AWS, intubation with this scope will be timed. Supervised&#xD;
      training with the Pentax AWS will continue until the ST anaesthetist is able to intubate in a&#xD;
      clinically safe timeframe and then ST anaesthetists will be required to perform this&#xD;
      successfully without trainer input in ten consecutive procedures. Once assessed as competent&#xD;
      with the Pentax AWS by the PI they will be eligible to intubate patients entering the trial.&#xD;
