    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is defined as a constellation of symptoms in response&#xD;
      to a stressor, including re-experiencing a traumatic event, numbed responsiveness and&#xD;
      symptoms of an increased level of arousal (APA 2000) . In recent years there were many&#xD;
      attempts to connect the brain structure and function to symptoms in PTSD patients (Francati,&#xD;
      Vermetten et al. 2007; Liberzon and Sripada 2008). One of the important technologies in this&#xD;
      regard is the Electroencephalography (EEG) measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EEG is the reflection of the inner brain electrical changing dipole as it is measured on&#xD;
      the scalp. It is measured by electrode that placed on the head according to the international&#xD;
      distribution of electrodes called 10-20. The EEG recording that is the product of the&#xD;
      measurement can be analyzed at least in three different levels: visual inspection of the raw&#xD;
      EEG, quantities analysis of the EEG (QEEG) and based on the QEEG, calculating the electrical&#xD;
      distribution of dipoles inside the brain that creates the EEG signal (Niedermeyer and Lopes&#xD;
      da Silva 2005). Theoretically two EEG measurements could have the same visual EEG and/or QEEG&#xD;
      patterns but the inner brain electrical dipole distribution could be very different. The&#xD;
      mathematical solution to the calculation of the dipole distribution inside the brain, using&#xD;
      the scalp EEG is based on &quot;the inverse problem&quot; concepts. One of the more common and precise&#xD;
      method to solve the inverse problem regarding the EEG is called LORETA (low resolution&#xD;
      topographic analysis) (Pascual-Marqui, Michel et al. 1994; Pascual-Marqui, Esslen et al.&#xD;
      2002). There are many brain image technologies aiming on mapping the connection between brain&#xD;
      function and psychopathology. Each method caries with it both advantage and drawbacks. The&#xD;
      use of the Electroencephalographic mapping technique is no different and it's main advantage&#xD;
      - the temporal resolution is with opposition to the relatively lower spatial resolution.&#xD;
      Modern signal processing tools and software like the LORETA start challenging this equation&#xD;
      and in the last years some articles were published proving the possibilities of using EEG&#xD;
      measurement to localized brain function with high spatial-resolution (Stern, Neufeld et al.&#xD;
      2009) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will focus on the rest QEEG and rest LORETA analysis in PTSD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous QEEG research found conflicting results regarding the spectral distribution of the&#xD;
      EEG waves across the scalp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Begic et al (Begic, Hotujac et al. 2001) compared 18 PTSD veterans to 20 controls. They found&#xD;
      that PTSD patients had increased theta activity over central regions, and they had increased&#xD;
      beta activity over frontal, central and occipital regions. No significant differences were&#xD;
      noted between the PTSD and control group in both the delta and alpha activity. In this study&#xD;
      all the patients were medication free for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another study the same group compared veterans with PTSD to veterans without PTSD. In this&#xD;
      study the PTSD patients had decreased alpha power and increased beta power. No difference was&#xD;
      noted on the theta band in this study (Jokic-Begic and Begic 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study another group studied the hemispheric asymmetries among motor vehicle&#xD;
      survivors with PTSD, with subsyndromal PTSD, survivors without PTSD and nonexposed healthy&#xD;
      controls during rest (baseline) and in response to neutral, positive, negative, and&#xD;
      trauma-related pictures. They focus on the alpha band. They found no group differences in EEG&#xD;
      alpha activity during the baseline condition. In there study all the patients were without&#xD;
      medication for 1 month (Rabe, Beauducel et al. 2006). Shankman et al compared the resting EEG&#xD;
      of PTSD patients to &quot;super- controls&quot; in order to maximized the difference between this two&#xD;
      groups. They found no statistical significant difference in any of the spectral band&#xD;
      (Shankman, Silverstein et al. 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to calculate the QEEG difference and to do LORETA analysis in PTSD&#xD;
      patients compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to avoid statistical multiple compressing problems this study will focus on the&#xD;
      theta band. There are at least two reasons for this: the first is that due to ethical issue&#xD;
      we don't ask our patients to stop there psychotropic treatments therefore all of them are&#xD;
      using SSRI antidepressants which could cause some alpha rhythms changes (Niedermeyer and&#xD;
      Lopes da Silva 2005). Another reason is that the origin of the theta bend is supposed to be&#xD;
      the in limbic system (Niedermeyer and Lopes da Silva 2005) that is long ago connected to PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms (Francati, Vermetten et al. 2007).&#xD;
