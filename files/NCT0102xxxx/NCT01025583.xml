  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypotonic oral rehydration solutions (ORS) containing zinc and/or prebiotics have been&#xD;
      proposed for the treatment of pediatric acute diarrhea but conclusive clinical data about&#xD;
      their effect are scanty, especially for children living in developed countries. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy of a new hypotonic ORS containing zinc and&#xD;
      prebiotics in children with acute diarrhea.&#xD;

      Study Design and Funding Prospective, randomized controlled trial in collaboration with&#xD;
      family pediatricians, who care for children up to 14 years of age in the Italian Public&#xD;
      Health System. The study protocol was illustrated and discussed during 3 meetings. The&#xD;
      research is not funded by any pharmaceutical company and all the authors declared no conflict&#xD;
      of interest. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the&#xD;
      University Federico II of Naples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Children 3-36 months old seen in the pediatrician offices from November 2007 to&#xD;
      March 2008 presenting acute diarrhea lasting less than 48 h are considered eligible for the&#xD;
      study. Exclusion criteria are: diarrhea lasting more than 48 h, malnutrition as judged by a&#xD;
      body weight/height ratio below the 5th percentile, clinical signs of severe dehydration,&#xD;
      clinical signs of a coexisting severe acute systemic illness (meningitis, sepsis, pneumonia),&#xD;
      immunodeficiency, underlying severe chronic disease, malnutrition, cystic fibrosis, food&#xD;
      allergy or other chronic gastrointestinal diseases, use of pre/probiotics in the previous 3&#xD;
      weeks, use of antibiotics or any antidiarrheal medication in the previous 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute diarrhea is defined as a decrease in the consistency of stools (loose or liquid) and/or&#xD;
      an increase of frequency of evacuations (3 or &gt;3 in 24 h), with or without fever or vomiting.&#xD;
      Informed consent is obtained from the parents of all enrolled children. Microbiologic and&#xD;
      other laboratory investigations performed only if required for specific clinical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Enrolled patients are randomly allocated to standard hypotonic ORS (group 1) or&#xD;
      to super-hypotonic ORS containing zinc and prebiotics (group 2). We used two commercial ORS&#xD;
      ORS preparations available on the market as sachets with similar cost and packaging. The&#xD;
      composition of the two ORSs is reported in Table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Blinding Patients are allocated to each group according to a&#xD;
      computer-generated randomization list. The researchers responsible for enrolling patients&#xD;
      allocate the next available number upon entry into the trial. The parents are instructed to&#xD;
      rehydrate orally their children with 30-50 ml/kg of ORS in 3-4 h for mild dehydration and&#xD;
      with 50-100 ml/kg of ORS in 3-4 h for moderate dehydration, and to administer 10 ml/kg/die of&#xD;
      ORS in a graduated glass or bottle for dehydration prevention until cessation of symptoms.&#xD;
      Three to four hours after, children are fed with a normal appropriate-for-age diet including&#xD;
      full strength lactose-containing formula or cow's milk.Treatment allocation is concealed to&#xD;
      maintain the single-blind status. Upon enrolment, the patient's parent receive the envelope&#xD;
      containing a written prescription of the name of the ORS product and instructions about how&#xD;
      it should be administered. To circumvent the problems in performing a double-blind study on&#xD;
      commercially available products in a large population, we use the third-part blind observer&#xD;
      method to assess the efficacy of the ORS preparations. To ensure unbiased efficacy&#xD;
      assessment, the investigators collecting the reporting forms completed by the parent are&#xD;
      blind to the patient's treatment assignment, whereas the family pediatricians in charge of&#xD;
      treatment allocation are excluded from efficacy assessment. The reporting forms are sent to&#xD;
      the coordinating centre at the Department of Pediatrics for analysis. We previously used this&#xD;
      procedure in a study of 5 probiotic preparations in children affected by acute diarrhea&#xD;
      (Berni Canani R et al. BMJ 2007;335-340). Upon enrollment, patients undergo a physical&#xD;
      examination and clinical history taking to identify the patient, to determine the duration&#xD;
      and severity of diarrhea, to assess associated clinical features (fever, vomiting and&#xD;
      dehydration) and to establish nutritional status and previous therapy. The parents of&#xD;
      enrolled children are instructed to record daily on a specific form: i) the number of fecal&#xD;
      outputs and their consistency; ii) the amount of daily ORS assumed by the child; and iii)&#xD;
      possible adverse events. We also record the number of the parent's missed work days, the&#xD;
      number of hospital admissions in each group, the use of other medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures The primary outcome of the study is the rate of resolution of diarrhea 72 h&#xD;
      after starting oral rehydration therapy. We selected this time point because of a study&#xD;
      indicated that the risk of dehydration was highest during this period and that zinc is able&#xD;
      to reduce diarrhea after 72 h of treatment. The latter finding was recently confirmed in a&#xD;
      Cochrane meta-analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diarrhea is considered stopped after a patient had passed the last abnormal (loose or liquid)&#xD;
      stools preceding a normal stool output, as applied in a previous study. Secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures are the total amount of ORS intake in the first 24 h, the number of missed work days&#xD;
      of the parent, the number of hospital admissions in each group, and the use of other&#xD;
      medications. Safety was also investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Fifty-seven patients in each group are required to obtain a power of the study =&#xD;
      80%, type 1 error = 0.05, 2-tailed test considering a difference of 25% (75% vs 50%) in the&#xD;
      rate of resolution of diarrhea at 72 h between the study groups. This estimation is based on&#xD;
      our preliminary data and on previous results obtained in children with acute diarrhea treated&#xD;
      with zinc. We decide to enroll 65 patients per group considering a possible drop out up to&#xD;
      15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analysis is performed by a statistician blind to individual&#xD;
      ORS preparations received by children in the two groups. Continuous variables are expressed&#xD;
      as means ± standard deviation (SD). For categorical variables, the Pearson chi-square test is&#xD;
      performed. The two groups are compared for continuous variables by t-test for equality of&#xD;
      means. After checking for assumptions, linear regression analysis with stepwise method is&#xD;
      used to study the effect of different variables (age, sex, body weight, duration of symptoms&#xD;
      before enrollment) on the presence of diarrhea after 72 h of treatment. Analyses are&#xD;
      conducted on an intention-to-treat and per-protocol basis. All tests of significance are&#xD;
      two-sided. A p value of less than 0.05 is considered significant. The statistical analysis is&#xD;
      performed using the SPSS software package for Windows (release 16.0.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago,&#xD;
      IL, USA) and Starts Direct (release 2.6.6).&#xD;
