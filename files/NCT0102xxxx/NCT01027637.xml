  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of Alloderm tissue regenerative matrix used&#xD;
      in many breast reconstruction operations. When this material is used in the abdomen it often&#xD;
      stretches and sometimes needs to be replaced. Although we see good clinical results when used&#xD;
      for breast reconstruction, there is no research regarding if or how the material changes in&#xD;
      this location. The Alloderm is placed in the breast at the time the expander is placed,&#xD;
      post-mastectomy. The expansion is started at the time of surgery and completed during a&#xD;
      series of office visit. This process stretches the skin, underlying muscle and presumably the&#xD;
      Alloderm. The goal of this study is to better understand the natural history of this material&#xD;
      when used for breast reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective is to measure changes in the dimension of the tissue matrix material after it&#xD;
      has been placed in the breast. These objective findings will be supplemented with a patient&#xD;
      questionnaire specifically designed for breast surgery patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive the standard preoperative work up, intraoperative procedures, and&#xD;
      postoperative care indicated for patients undergoing implant breast reconstruction after&#xD;
      mastectomy. Some of these patients will require use of the Alloderm to reconstruct the lower&#xD;
      half of the breast pocket. This is already being done by plastic surgeons here at Henry Ford&#xD;
      Hospital. The difference will be that the Alloderm tissue matrix used to reconstruct the&#xD;
      lower part of the breast pocket for the study patients will have 4 millimeter metallic clips&#xD;
      placed in it. Postoperatively these clips will be tracked by ultrasound done in the clinic.&#xD;
      As the breast implant is normally expanded by adding saline, we believe the Alloderm matrix&#xD;
      will stretch. The movement of these imperceptible clips will be tracked and measured to map&#xD;
      the expansion of the matrix in response to the underlying implant stretching the overlying&#xD;
      breast pocket and the skin envelope. The pattern of expansion will allow us to develop a&#xD;
      mathematical model to describe the stretch pattern of Alloderm matrix used in breast&#xD;
      reconstruction. This information will be supplemented with a validated questionnaire&#xD;
      specifically designed by breast surgery patients. This will give us both an objective&#xD;
      dimensional change in the breast reconstruction as well as a patient-centered evaluation of&#xD;
      the reconstruction process.&#xD;

      1. Describe the experimental design/methodology.Prospective consecutive case series.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Outline the protocol, corresponding it to the specific aims; identify the data or&#xD;
           endpoints to be analyzed to reach the specific aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The first 3 candidates will serve as the prototypes for the model. There may be&#xD;
                some unanticipated modifications to the setup, patient care, imaging or data&#xD;
                analysis. We plan to follow these 3 cases more deliberately and not proceed until&#xD;
                all 3 are followed for at least 3 months. After these 3 cases, we anticipate the&#xD;
                rest will proceed more smoothly. Placement of the clips to provide the most data is&#xD;
                the primary question for these 3 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The above schematic shows the presumed change is Alloderm size and shape post&#xD;
                expansion and corresponding change in location of the vessel clips. The inferior&#xD;
                borders is the fixed point. By positioning the clips at regular intervals along the&#xD;
                top border, we can measure transverse and horizontal changes. The timing of&#xD;
                ultrasound studies is designed to coincide with when these changes are most likely&#xD;
                to be visualized during the postoperative period. We may change the dates of the&#xD;
                studies. We do not anticipate the the total number of studies will increase because&#xD;
                changes after full expansion (completed by postoperative week 4) are slower and&#xD;
                smaller in magnitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. 30 patients enrolled in the study will be studied for position of the metallic&#xD;
                markers on postoperative day 1, week 4, month 6, month 12. The location of each&#xD;
                clip relative to the fixed anchor point will be recorded and each timepoint. The&#xD;
                fixed anchor point is the medial-inner attachment point of the Alloderm® to the&#xD;
                chest wall fascia. This is the most inferior/medial point of the Alloderm® tissue&#xD;
                matrix. With expansion of the breast expander the chest wall fascia does not move.&#xD;
                Only the overlying skin, pectoralis muscle and Alloderm stretch in response to&#xD;
                breast prosthesis expansion. We can therefore track movement of the clips embedded&#xD;
                in the matrix over time. For each clip we can develop a best fit curve for the 30&#xD;
                subjects studied. This will allow us to develop a mathematical model of the final&#xD;
                position and shape of the reconstructed breast at one year out. This model will be&#xD;
                compared to existing mathematical models for breast tissue expanders (Mentor Corp.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. A standardized validated questionnaire Breast-Q is a patient reported outcomes data&#xD;
                instrument. The Breast-Q is conceptually grounded in patient perceptions, able to&#xD;
                span the continuum of impact of surgery or validated against appropriate&#xD;
                psychometric benchmarks. It allows for quantification of patient satisfaction and&#xD;
                health-related quality of life experienced by women undergoing breast surgery. The&#xD;
                questionnaire will be administered preoperative, one month postoperative and one&#xD;
                year postoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The BREAST-Q scoring software, QScore, gives clinicians and researchers a simple and&#xD;
           accurate way to analyze their data. It features a powerful scoring engine based on RUMM&#xD;
           2020; a data analyzing program developed by Rasch Unidimensional Measurement Models&#xD;
           Laboratory in Perth, Australia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each pre and postoperative BREAST-Q module comes with a Microsoft Excel template. The&#xD;
           templates help to organize your data for import into the QScore program. Once imported,&#xD;
           QScore automatically transforms your raw data into summary scores ranging from 0 (very&#xD;
           dissatisfied) to 100 (very satisfied) for each scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Discuss potential limitations and difficulties in the protocol. Potential limitations&#xD;
           include displacement of the vessel clips. If this happens, the patient's results and&#xD;
           aesthetic outcome are not compromised. The clips do not cause any harm. These patients&#xD;
           will be followed by standard of care protocol but removed from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Provide a tentative schedule for conducting and completing this project and, if&#xD;
           applicable, the multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patients will be seen in the office at study enrollment and post surgery at one&#xD;
           week, one month, six months and one years for evaluation ultrasound study. The Breast Q&#xD;
           questionnaire will be completed preoperatively and then after surgery at one month and&#xD;
           one year. one month and one year post surgery. We anticipated all patients enrolled&#xD;
           within 6 months of study initiation. Total project should less than 2 years after last&#xD;
           patient enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Data collection: Submit a copy of the data collection tool or list the data fields to be&#xD;
           collected (review IRB policy, Access to Medical Records for Research on intranet at&#xD;
           http://henry.hfhs.org).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data entry points that will be collected include: The patient's name, age, history of steroid&#xD;
      use, past medical history, date of surgery, size of graft used, thickness of the graft used.&#xD;
      Also implant size, pre-surgery bra size, distance from each clip to inferiolateral anchor&#xD;
      point on ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. DATA ANALYSIS: Describe the analysis of the data and relate this to the specific aims.&#xD;
      Describe the statistical analysis in detail (referral to analysis by a multicenter sponsor is&#xD;
      not acceptable). The Committee recommends free consultation with the Division of&#xD;
      Biostatistics and Research Epidemiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two types of outcome measurements: the alloderm increased size and stardardized&#xD;
      validated questionnaire. We will compare the difference between baseline and each time point&#xD;
      after implant. For the alloderm increased size, the student paired-t statistic wil be used to&#xD;
      test if there is any stretch in size. For questionnaire outcome, one-sample wilcoxon rank sum&#xD;
      test will be used to test the difference in patient satisfication. Bonferrnoi correction is&#xD;
      used for multiple comparison and the familywise type I error rate is set at 0.05.&#xD;
