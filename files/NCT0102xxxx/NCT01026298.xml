  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common but under-diagnosed form of sleep disordered&#xD;
      breathing (SDB). Asthma is a common disease with rising prevalence, which continues to pose&#xD;
      significant morbidity and costs. In spite of considerable progress in our understanding of&#xD;
      asthma, a large number of individuals with asthma continue to have symptoms and subsequently,&#xD;
      have a poor functional status, poor quality of life and increased health care costs. In many&#xD;
      cases no apparent cause is found and optimal therapy does not achieve its goal. While recent&#xD;
      data suggests that OSA is common in severe asthma, the prevalence of OSA and its predisposing&#xD;
      factors have not been studied.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  presence of not well-controlled (NWC) asthma (National Asthma Education and Prevention&#xD;
             Program Guidelines step 2, 3, 4), as diagnosed by an asthma physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  stable doses of standard therapy for 2 months prior to enrollment. These regimens will&#xD;
             include: inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for mild-persistent step; ICS and inhaled&#xD;
             long-acting β-adrenergics (LABA) or ICS and leukotriene modifier (LTMs) agents for&#xD;
             moderate-persistent step; high doses of ICS, LABA or LTMs, with or without oral&#xD;
             steroids at stable doses, for patients in severe step&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  adherence to the current asthma medications regimen, demonstration of a proper inhaler&#xD;
             technique; agreement for maintaining the same asthma regimen (except rescue&#xD;
             bronchodilators) as clinical condition permits (if an exacerbation occurs during the&#xD;
             first 4-week period, the subject will be excluded as discussed below), and willingness&#xD;
             to complete diaries of asthma symptoms, rescue bronchodilator use, peak flow meter&#xD;
             (PEF) recordings as well as asthma-related urgent doctor's and emergency room visits&#xD;
             and hospitalizations for the 3 months duration of the study&#xD;

          -  moderate to high probability for OSA (SA-SDQ scores ≥31 for males and ≥28 for females)&#xD;
             or high clinical suspicion for OSA&#xD;

             OSA is identified and current CPAP treatment criteria are met [patients with moderate&#xD;
