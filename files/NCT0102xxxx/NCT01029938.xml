  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial aneurysm treatment with coil embolization is associated with relatively low&#xD;
      complete occlusion and high recanalization rates. The investigators evaluate whether Willis&#xD;
      covered stent implantation yields angiographic and clinical results superior to those with&#xD;
      coil embolization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms with detachable coils has been widely used&#xD;
      since the introduction of GDCs in 1991 and has been proven to be effective in preventing&#xD;
      rebleeding after aneurysmal rupture. The clinical and angiographic results of endovascular&#xD;
      coil occlusion of intracranial aneurysms are positive, with an initial and final overall&#xD;
      complete occlusion rate of 35.9%-76.8% and 38.3%- 87.8%. In the mid- and long-term, however,&#xD;
      aneurysm recanalization may occur in as many as one-third of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The natural history of aneurysm recurrence after coil treatment is often benign, but bleeding&#xD;
      from incompletely coiled aneurysms is a well-documented threat, moreover, the degree of&#xD;
      aneurysm occlusion after treatment was strongly associated with risk of rerupture. Even if&#xD;
      100% occlusion of the aneurysms after the initial treatment was obtained on immediate&#xD;
      postembolization angiography, there was still a relatively high recanalization rate (26.4%)&#xD;
      on long-term follow-up angiography. In a recent study, we have confirmed that there was still&#xD;
      aneurysm perfusion of the aneurysm sac in a complete occluded aneurysm no matter on initial&#xD;
      or follow-up rotate digital angiography. In addition, some authors have demonstrated that&#xD;
      endothelialization of the aneurysm orifice following placement of GDCs can occur; however, it&#xD;
      appears to be the exception rather than the rule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome these disadvantages, the Willis covered stent, specially designed for&#xD;
      intracranial vasculature, has been developed by our institution and the MicroPort Medical&#xD;
      Company (Micro-Port, Shanghai, China). Our preliminary results demonstrated good flexibility&#xD;
      and efficacy of the Willis covered stent in the treatment of cranial internal carotid artery&#xD;
      aneurysms (CICA) in patients without an extremely tortuous ICA (Radiology 2009; 253:470-7),&#xD;
      and also the covered stents have been proved to be more effective than re-coiling with regard&#xD;
      to complete occlusion of recurrent aneurysms (J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2009;16:[Epub&#xD;
      ahead of print]). Since 2005, we have performed a nonrandomized prospective trial of&#xD;
      endovascular treatment CICA aneurysms with a covered stenting or coil embolization. So, we&#xD;
      evaluate whether implantation of a primary Willis covered stent yielded angiographic and&#xD;
      clinical results that superior to those with the currently recommended approach of coil&#xD;
      embolization.&#xD;
