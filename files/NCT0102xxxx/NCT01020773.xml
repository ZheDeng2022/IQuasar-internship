      Spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) has long been thought to be a essential process before&#xD;
      extubation. In this study,the investigator hypothesized that SBT could be not essential&#xD;
      during weaning from ventilator and investigated whether weaning could be better done without&#xD;
      a spontaneous breathing trial in non-COPD（COPD, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease）&#xD;
      critically ill patients. This study has revealed, for the first time, that compared with use&#xD;
      of SBT in discontinuing ventilator process, patients underwent successful extubation without&#xD;
      SBT. For this subset of patients the findings suggest that SBT may be excluded preceding&#xD;
      extubation in a general intensive care population.&#xD;

      In this 1000-bed primary teaching hospital, the study was conducted in the 8-bed adult&#xD;
      general ICU over the course of 13 months. All patients enrolled in this study were&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated for more than 48 hrs via endotracheal tubes during the study period.&#xD;
      The investigation was approved by the hospital ethics committee, and informed written consent&#xD;
      was obtained from the next of kin of every patient. Patients were ventilated in pressure&#xD;
      support (PS) during the entire weaning period. The levels of inspiratory PS and positive&#xD;
      end-expiratory pressure （PEEP) were progressively reduced depending on the patient's clinical&#xD;
      assessment and blood gas values. Patients enrolled in this study had to meet all of the&#xD;
      following readiness criteria: show significant improvement or resolution of the underlying&#xD;
      cause of acute respiratory failure; be fully awake; require bronchial toilet less than twice&#xD;
      in the 4 hours proceeding the assessment; stable hemodynamics without further need of&#xD;
      vasoactive agents; arterial oxygen tension (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio&#xD;
      &gt;200 at a PEEP of 4.0 cm H2O with a maximal FiO2 of 0.40; core temperature &lt;38.0℃; systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg; respiratory rate to tidal volume ratio (RVR) &lt;105 breaths/min/L. The&#xD;
      RVR was calculated after 1 min of spontaneous breathing.The maximal inspiratory PS of 12 cm&#xD;
      H2O and no mandatory machine breaths supplied from the ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol The investigators investigated the weaning process with and without SBT. All&#xD;
      patients were continuously assessed according to the readiness criteria and were screened for&#xD;
      enrollment once a day. As soon as the patient was ready for weaning, he or she was randomly&#xD;
      assigned to SBT or no-SBT study groups. Randomization was carried out in a blinded fashion&#xD;
      using opaque and sealed envelopes. All patients in the study breathed through the ventilator&#xD;
      circuit with flow-triggering (2L/min) and pressure support ventilation mode. In the SBT&#xD;
      group, the patients underwent a 1 hr SBT with inspiratory PS of 7 cmH2O with other settings&#xD;
      remaining constant (FiO2, PEEP, trigger sensitivity). For patients showing poor tolerance to&#xD;
      the SBT, full ventilation support was immediately recommenced. This was defined by the&#xD;
      following failure criteria: a decrease in oxygen saturation to &lt;90%; respiratory rate &gt;35/min&#xD;
      for more than 5 min, in the presence of diaphoresis or thoraco-abdominal paradox; sustained&#xD;
      increase in heart rate (&gt;140/min), or significant change in systolic blood pressure (&gt;180 or&#xD;
      &lt;90 mmHg). The patients who tolerated the SBT underwent immediate extubation and received&#xD;
      (breathed in) supplemental oxygen via a facemask. In no-SBT group, as soon as a patient met&#xD;
      readiness criteria, he or she underwent extubation without SBT process and received&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen via a facemask. Following extubation, noninvasive ventilatory support was&#xD;
      introduced in the following circumstances: hypoxemia (SaO2&lt;90% for &gt;15mins) under receiving&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen; presence of respiratory acidosis (arterial PH&lt;7.35 with arterial carbon&#xD;
      dioxide tension (PaCO2)&gt;45mmHg; and respiratory rate &gt;25 breaths/min for 1 hr. The mode of&#xD;
      ventilation was Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP). When such support was deemed&#xD;
      inadequate (hypoxemia, hypercapnea, or respiratory distress), the patient was reintubated and&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SBT and extubation were performed by two doctors who are members of the research team.&#xD;
      Decisions regarding reintubation were made by doctors who were blinded for the treatment&#xD;
      group. Extubation failure is defined as reintubation within 48 hrs. The reasons for&#xD;
      reintubation were prospectively recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Results are expressed as mean ± SD. Mean values of selected demographic&#xD;
      variables and physiologic parameters of patients who underwent SBT were compared by student's&#xD;
      t tests to those who underwent extubation directly. The differences in proportions between&#xD;
      the two groups were determined using chi square test (X2-test).&#xD;

          <description>In the Spontaneous Breathing Trial(SBT) group, the patients underwent a 1 hr SBT with Inspiratory Support Pressure(PS) of 7 cmH2O with other settings remaining constant (FiO2, PEEP, trigger sensitivity).
