  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gefitinib is an orally active epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor&#xD;
      (EGFR-TKI) and produces 8-20% of response rates in patients with advanced non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC). Vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid [SAHA]) is a small-molecule&#xD;
      inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC) and induces cell differentiation, cell cycle arrest,&#xD;
      and apoptosis in several tumor cells. There is a strong synergistic antiproliferative effect&#xD;
      of vorinostat in combination with gefitinib in NSCLC cells. Vorinostat increases expression&#xD;
      of E-cadherin and ErbB-3, which results in increased sensitivity to gefitinib. Moreover,&#xD;
      In-vitro studies have shown that vorinostat leads to acetylation and disruption of Hsp90,&#xD;
      which may lead to decreases in activity of pro-growth and prosurvival client proteins (J Bio&#xD;
      Chem 2005;280:26729, Br J Cancer 2006;95:S2). These findings suggest that combination of&#xD;
      vorinostat with gefitinib may improve the efficacy of gefitinib in NSCLC.&#xD;

      Phase I design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three patients will be treated per cohort for one cycle (28 days per cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If no DLTs are recorded, treatment will continue and three patients will be treated in&#xD;
           the subsequent cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  However, if a patient develops a DLT, another three patients will be treated in this&#xD;
           cohort for one cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there are no more DLTs, dose escalation continues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If more than one of three patients develop a DLT in any cohort, another three patients&#xD;
           will be treated in the next lower dosage cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If no DLTs are recorded in any of the cohorts, cohort 3 will be expanded to six&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 12 patients will be enrolled at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The phase II dose for this combined treatment will be therefore defined as the highest&#xD;
           dosage cohort in which six patients had been treated and there are less than three DLTs.&#xD;
