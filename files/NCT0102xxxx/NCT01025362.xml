      The Norwegian Action Plan on Nutrition aim at increasing the prevalence of breastfeeding. The&#xD;
      initiative &quot;Baby-Friendly Community Health Services (BFCHS)&quot; is an initiative to reach this&#xD;
      goal. BFCHS is developed from the concept &quot;The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative&quot; by&#xD;
      WHO/UNICEF, and the intention is to increase the quality of breastfeeding counseling at&#xD;
      Norwegian well-baby clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study seeks to answer the following research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What effect does the process of being certified as a BFCHS have on the proportion of&#xD;
           mothers who exclusively breastfeed their children for 5 months?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What effect does the process of being certified as a BFCHS have on the proportion of&#xD;
           mothers who exclusively breastfeed for 4 months?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What effect does the certification process have on the proportion of mothers who&#xD;
           breastfeed at 11 months of age?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What effect does the certification process have on the differences in breastfeeding due&#xD;
           to social inequality?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What effect does the certification process have on the mothers impression of the quality&#xD;
           of the well-baby clinics lactation counseling?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What effect does the certification process have on mothers satisfaction with the&#xD;
           breastfeeding experience?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What effect does the certification process have on perceived pressure to breastfeed?&#xD;
           Methods Cluster randomized controlled study Sampling The survey unit, cluster, will be&#xD;
           the community health services. All community health services in six counties in Norway&#xD;
           will be invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Norwegian speaking mothers who have 5 month and 11 month old children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Respondents are identified through the National Population Register (DSF).&#xD;
      The data collection takes place using a postal questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline: Data collection before the intervention is implemented to assess breastfeeding&#xD;
      prevalence and distribution of covariates in the two study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-survey: The post-survey to assess the effect, will take place about two years after&#xD;
      baseline when the community health services have been certified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size It is expected that the project could increase the breastfeeding prevalence with&#xD;
      5 percentage points. This assumption is the basis for the sample size. The initial aim is to&#xD;
      recruit about 50 well-baby clinics.&#xD;

      In 2007 the Norwegian Government launched &quot;The Norwegian Action Plan on Nutrition&quot;&#xD;
      (2007-2011) which emphasizes breast milk as optimal nutrition as well as being one of the&#xD;
      most effective ways to promote health and prevent disease. It is well known that breast milk&#xD;
      reduces the prevalence and severity of infectious diseases like diarrhoea, lower respiratory&#xD;
      tract infections, ear infections, urinary tract infections as well as bacterial meningitis&#xD;
      and necrotic enterocolitis. Current research suggests that breast milk can have long term&#xD;
      health effects such as reduced risk of overweight, leukemia and diabetes type I and type II.&#xD;
      Breastfeeding is associated with better cognitive development. Women who breastfeed also have&#xD;
      significant added health benefits such as a reduced risk of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Almost all women produce breast milk, but the act of breastfeeding is a complicated&#xD;
      interaction between mother and child and is affected by a number of factors. A large number&#xD;
      of mothers have breastfeeding difficulties, and a significant number stop before they had&#xD;
      intended to. If women were given qualified help it is possible that many of these problems&#xD;
      could have been prevented or treated. In the Norwegian subsidiary study to The WHO&#xD;
      Multicentre Growth Reference Study, where mothers received qualified breastfeeding&#xD;
      instruction, 86% of children were exclusively breastfed at the 4 month stage as compared with&#xD;
      the norm of 44%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today mothers are discharged earlier from hospital than ever before. Many of these women have&#xD;
      not managed to properly establish breastfeeding. Due to this, many problems which were&#xD;
      previously discovered in the maternity ward are now relegated to the primary health care&#xD;
      services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disparity in breastfeeding between different socioeconomic groups in Norway primarily&#xD;
      follows the same pattern as that found in health generally.For example, the chance that a&#xD;
      mother with higher education will be breastfeeding her child at the age of 6 months is twice&#xD;
      as high compared to a mother with only primary school education. Improving health service&#xD;
      access to the entire population would contribute to advancing the health and health promoting&#xD;
      behavior in those groups with the poorest prospects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Resource Centre for Breastfeeding (NRCB) is cooperating with Norwegian Public&#xD;
      Health Nurses Association and the Norwegian Directorate of Health in the initiative&#xD;
      Baby-Friendly Community Health Services (BFCHS). The purpose of this initiative is to improve&#xD;
      the quality of breastfeeding advice at Norwegian community health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While WHO has developed an international standard for breastfeeding counseling for maternity&#xD;
      wards, there is no similar standard for primary care services as yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A newly updated Cochrane-overview about the effect of offering support to breastfeeding&#xD;
      mothers identified 16 studies which assessed the effect of support from health workers. The&#xD;
      studies showed a small effect on all breastfeeding at the four month stage, but could not&#xD;
      show any difference at other stages. An American survey identified 38 randomized controlled&#xD;
      studies on the effect of initiatives in primary care services to promote breastfeeding, all&#xD;
      from industrialized countries.This review indicates that initiatives to increase the&#xD;
      competency of health workers can have a positive effect on the prevalence of breastfeeding.&#xD;
