      Parathyroid hormone (PTH) gland calcium sensing receptor (CASR) regulates PTH secretion. CASR&#xD;
      is also expressed in nephron thick ascending limb (TAL). Bartter syndrome (BS), a&#xD;
      normotensive hypokalemic tubulopathy, may be due to mutations in different TAL channels,&#xD;
      including the potassium channel ROMK. Mutations in CASR may also cause BS through its effects&#xD;
      on ROMK function. However, it is unknown whether ROMK mutations exert any effects on CASR&#xD;
      function and PTH physiology. Preliminary data from our center shows that PTH levels were&#xD;
      specifically elevated in type II (where ROMK is mutated) and not in type IV (where another&#xD;
      gene, Barttin is defective) BS, without a common explanation. We assume that the mutation in&#xD;
      ROMK may cause a dysregulation of PTH secretion via possible interaction with CASR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is: to investigate the PT-gland function and regulation in BS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients with BS type II and IV and normal controls will undergo a standard protocol&#xD;
      of controlled ionic hypo- and hypercalcemia, during which PTH secretion, phosphate balance&#xD;
      and calcium excretion will be followed. Calcium Vs PTH response curves will be generated and&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected impact and benefit: the results of this study will help understand the mechanisms of&#xD;
      PTH regulation beyond CASR.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The parathyroid glands play a pivotal physiological function by maintaining blood calcium&#xD;
      levels, specifically blood ionized calcium concentrations, within a very narrow range. They&#xD;
      do so by modulating the minute-to-minute release of parathyroid hormone (PTH) into the&#xD;
      circulation. Such changes have almost immediate effects on calcium excretion in the urine and&#xD;
      on calcium efflux from bone and, if sustained for hours or days, affect renal vitamin D&#xD;
      metabolism and ultimately the efficiency of intestinal calcium absorption. The capacity of&#xD;
      chief cells of the parathyroid to detect small changes in blood ionized calcium levels,&#xD;
      modify PTH release accordingly, and initiate these adaptive responses is mediated by a&#xD;
      calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) located at the cell surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of the CaSR in parathyroid tissue extends beyond its traditional role as a&#xD;
      modifier of calcium-regulated PTH secretion to involve other key components of parathyroid&#xD;
      gland function that are frequently abnormal in clinical disorders characterized by excess&#xD;
      parathyroid gland activity such as hyperparathyroidism. These include disturbances in the&#xD;
      control of PTH gene transcription and hormone synthesis and the development of parathyroid&#xD;
      gland enlargement due to tissue hyperplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTH acts mainly on renal proximal tubule phosphorus (Pi) reabsorption and bone osteoclast&#xD;
      calcium and Pi resorption. CASR is also expressed in nephron thick ascending limb (TAL),&#xD;
      where it interacts with luminal potassium ROMK channel. Mutations in several TAL channels and&#xD;
      proteins (including ROMK, NKCC2, ClCKb, Barttin and CASR) cause Bartter syndrome (BS), a&#xD;
      normotensive hypokalemic tubulopathy. Whereas the effects of CASR mutations on ROMK function&#xD;
      in the kidney have been described , it is unknown whether ROMK mutations exert any effects on&#xD;
      CASR function or PTH regulation. We describe here a group of children and adolescents with&#xD;
      type II BS (due to mutations in ROMK) with abnormal PTH homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We compared laboratory data of 12 children with type II BS (4M, 8F) and 17 children (7M, 10F)&#xD;
      with type IV BS (d/t mutations in the Barttin gene, a beta subunit of the ClCKb basolateral&#xD;
      chloride channel in the TAL ), followed in our center over the past 10 years. A total of 86&#xD;
      and 105 datasets of blood and urine analyses (average datasets/pt: 7.3±4.1 and 6.9±2.9), for&#xD;
      type II and IV BS respectively, were analyzed.Potassium levels were normal in all BS-II&#xD;
      children without additional salt supplementation, whereas BS-IV children were usually mildly&#xD;
      hypokalemic. Estimated GFR remains normal in all children. There was no hypomagnesemia.&#xD;
      Average PTH values were significantly higher in BS-II (102±39 Vs 46±24 pg/ml in BS-IV,&#xD;
      p&lt;0.001) and were above upper normal limit in 93% of cases Vs 13% in BS-IV (p&lt;0.001). Levels&#xD;
      of 25(OH) vitamin D were not different. Total serum calcium was mildly decreased (within the&#xD;
      normal range) and serum Pi increased in BS-II, both in absolute values or when normalized for&#xD;
      age (PiSDS). The threshold for phosphate excretion (TpGFR) was slightly higher in BS-II.&#xD;
      There was no difference in the degree of hypercalciuria between groups. Based on these&#xD;
      preliminary data we concluded that the elevated PTH levels only in type II BS are not related&#xD;
      to a decrease in GFR or vitamin D levels or decreased serum calcium or hypercalciuria. The&#xD;
      elevated Pi levels are associated with a decrease in phosphate excretion, but are not&#xD;
      correlated with PTH levels. The possibility that a mutation in ROMK may cause a dysregulation&#xD;
      of PTH secretion via possible interaction with CASR should now be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigative protocol has been submitted to the local Committee for Human&#xD;
      Experimentation. Informed consent will be obtained from affected children (or young adults)&#xD;
      and their parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to recruit 5 patients from each BS subgroup. In addition we will recruit 5 normal&#xD;
      volunteers to serve as an additional control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated during 2-day admissions to the General Pediatric Ward as&#xD;
      previously described . On the first day of study, 2-h I.V. infusions of sodium citrate will&#xD;
      be done to gradually lower blood ionized calcium concentrations to a level of at least 0.2&#xD;
      mmol/L below preinfusion values; the dose of sodium citrate ranges usually from 28-118&#xD;
      mg/kg/h. Blood samples for measurements of ionized calcium and PTH will be obtained 30, 15,&#xD;
      and 0 min before and every 10 min during sodium citrate infusions. The following day, 2-h IV&#xD;
      infusions of 10% calcium gluconate will be done to gradually raise blood ionized calcium&#xD;
      concentrations to a level at least 0.2 mmol/L above preinfusion values. The dose of calcium&#xD;
      gluconate usually ranges from 2-8 mg/kg/h. Blood samples for measurements of ionized calcium&#xD;
      and PTH will be obtained as described previously for infusions of sodium citrate. The average&#xD;
      of measurements obtained 30, 15, and 0 min before starting each infusion will be used to&#xD;
      determine basal values for blood ionized calcium and serum PTH for each day of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood ionized calcium levels will be monitored during calcium infusions using a&#xD;
      calcium-specific electrode (Radiometer ICA-II, Copenhagen, Denmark); blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected anaerobically, and measurements will be obtained immediately thereafter. Serum&#xD;
      samples for PTH determinations will be separated by centrifugation immediately after&#xD;
      collection, snap frozen on solid CO2, and stored at -70 oC until assay. Ionized calcium&#xD;
      levels will be monitored after stopping calcium infusions until values returned to baseline&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sigmoidal curve that describes the relationship between blood ionized calcium and serum&#xD;
      PTH levels will be determined for each study subject using the combined results obtained&#xD;
      during sodium citrate and calcium gluconate infusions. According to the four parameter model,&#xD;
      the set point for calcium-regulated PTH release represents the ionized calcium concentration&#xD;
      at which serum PTH levels are midway between the maximum value achieved during hypocalcemia&#xD;
      and the minimum value attained during hypercalcemia, as reported previously .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results obtained during calcium gluconate infusions will be separately analyzed to assess the&#xD;
      inhibitory effect of increasing blood ionized calcium concentrations on PTH release. To&#xD;
      improve the linear fit of the data, serum PTH levels, expressed as the natural logarithm (ln)&#xD;
      of percent preinfusion values, will be plotted against the corresponding blood ionized&#xD;
      calcium concentration at each 10-min interval as previously described .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linear regression analysis will be done using the method of least squares, and slope and&#xD;
      y-intercept values will be compared using the t statistic. A mono-exponential curve fitting&#xD;
      algorithm of the form y =A e-2kt + B will be also used to examine the curvilinear&#xD;
      relationship between blood ionized calcium and serum PTH levels during I.V. calcium&#xD;
      infusions; these results will be presented as mean values with 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
