    <textblock>
      Asparaginase is an important drug in the treatment of childhood leukemia including in infant&#xD;
      (&lt;1 year). The prognosis for infants is bad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about drug metabolism in neonates and infants is scarce as well as the reactions&#xD;
      of an immature immune system to foreign proteins. The aims of this study is to describe the&#xD;
      metabolism (pharmacokinetics) of asparaginase after administration intramuscularly and to&#xD;
      evaluate the formation of antibodies against the drug (enzyme) during treatment in order to&#xD;
      optimize the asparaginase treatment in infants in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Combination chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) usually includes a bacterial&#xD;
      L-asparaginase enzyme derived from Escherichia coli or Erwinia species. Several studies have&#xD;
      described the pharmacokinetics in children above 1 year of age of asparaginase given&#xD;
      intramuscularly as well as intravenously. The development of anti-asparaginase antibodies to&#xD;
      these foreign proteins has also been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy for infant ALL also includes L-asparaginase. However, the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      asparaginase and antibody formation in infants is needed to be described to optimize therapy&#xD;
      for this group of patients who have a doubtful prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background In general the information about drug metabolism in neonates and infants is scarce&#xD;
      as well as the reactions of an immature immune system to foreign proteins. Several&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in children above one year of age, but no data is&#xD;
      available about pharmacokinetics and antibody formation during treatment with any&#xD;
      asparaginase preparation in infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asparaginase is used in the treatment of childhood ALL since it depletes the blood of&#xD;
      asparagines, which can be synthesized by normal cells but not by leukemic lymphoblasts. It&#xD;
      has been shown that serum activities above 100 IU/l ensure depletion of asparagine in serum&#xD;
      and CNS. In many cases even values considerably lower than 100 IU/l will deplete asparagine&#xD;
      from the serum1-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Interfant-06 protocol the doses of asparaginase are adopted from childhood&#xD;
      ALL-protocols without scientific foundation. Infants may metabolise asparaginase differently&#xD;
      and thus may not achieve amino acid depletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibody formation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asparaginase is a foreign protein for the human body, so patients may develop antibodies&#xD;
      against it, resulting in allergic reactions (probably mediated by IgE-antibodies) or silent&#xD;
      antibodies (IgG antibodies, blocking the effect of the enzyme). In the first case treatment&#xD;
      most often is stopped and in the second case treatment is insufficient6-7, and thus giving&#xD;
      the patient a poorer prognosis in both cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Interfant-06 patients are treated with native E.coli asparaginase for a period followed by&#xD;
      PEG-asparaginase later during their treatment. Studies in older children have shown that&#xD;
      approximately 1/3 of the patients develop IgG-antibodies against native E.coli after 5-6&#xD;
      doses7. Other studies have shown that IgG-antibodies against native E.coli asparaginase&#xD;
      cross-react with PEG-asparaginase, resulting in a faster clearance of the enzyme8. Allergic&#xD;
      reactions (any grade) to native E.coli asparaginase are encountered in approximately 30 % of&#xD;
      children11-12. There is no knowledge about the frequency of antibody formation during&#xD;
      asparaginase therapy in infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has the purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to describe the pharmacokinetics of intramuscular native E.coli and PEG-asparaginase in&#xD;
           children below 1 year at diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate antibody formation during asparaginase treatment with E.coli followed by&#xD;
           PEG-asparaginase in infants&#xD;
