      This is a prospective open labeled trial examining the efficacy of ACTHar Gel (porcine ACTH)&#xD;
      on the level of proteinuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy and nephrotic range&#xD;
      proteinuria.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetes Mellitus is a significant and growing health problem in the United States and other&#xD;
      developed countries. Despite improving public awareness, end-organ complications including&#xD;
      diabetic nephropathy and coronary atherosclerotic heart disease continues to grow by 5-10%&#xD;
      per year. While improvements in the control of blood pressure and the wide-spread use of&#xD;
      antagonists of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system have significantly improved renal&#xD;
      outcomes, therapies designed to disrupt the more central pathogenic mechanisms of diabetic&#xD;
      nephropathy are still needed. Recent observations have shown that effacement of podocyte&#xD;
      foot-plate processes and accelerated apoptosis, are central to the pathogenesis of diabetic&#xD;
      nephropathy. The resulting increase in glomerular permeability leads to nephrotic range&#xD;
      proteinuria and interstitial fibrosis from local synthesis of transforming growth factor b&#xD;
      (TGF-b) and direct toxicity to the renal epithelium. Recent studies have shown that synthetic&#xD;
      forms of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) are able to achieve sustained reductions in&#xD;
      proteinuria in non-diabetic glomerulopathies. Moreover, while the numbers of patients are&#xD;
      quite limited, preliminary studies also suggest that pharmacologic administration of ACTH can&#xD;
      reduce proteinuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy. The observation that ACTH can&#xD;
      reduce proteinuria in a variety of glomerulopathies suggests that ACTH may be important for&#xD;
      podocyte function and viability independent of the primary disease. Interestingly, recent&#xD;
      studies confirm that melanocortin receptors are expressed in non-adrenal tissues including&#xD;
      the circulating T and B cells and most recently the glomerular podocyte. Previous studies&#xD;
      investigating the effect of diabetes and insulin therapy on ACTH levels have given mixed&#xD;
      results. It is therefore unclear how podocytes in patients with diabetic nephropathy could&#xD;
      become functionally deficient in ACTH. However, studies in adrenal cortical cells finds that&#xD;
      TGF-b is able to down regulate the expression of ACTH receptors. Moreover, TGF-b is able&#xD;
      block an ACTH-induced stimulation of melanocortin receptors. This intriguing link between&#xD;
      TGF-b and ACTH signaling raises the question of whether impaired signaling of ACTH in the&#xD;
      glomerulus leads to podocyte dysfunction, accelerated detachment and ultimately podocyte&#xD;
      apoptosis. Moreover, we postulate that a complex interaction between TGF-b and ACTH&#xD;
      expression exists within the glomerulus such that restoration of ACTH function will lead to a&#xD;
      reduction in renal TGF-b expression. We therefore propose to study the effect of increasing&#xD;
      doses of exogenous ACTH on rates of albuminuria and urinary TGF-b expression in diabetics&#xD;
      with nephrotic range proteinuria. In addition to TGF-b we will examine whether a similar&#xD;
      effect occurs on the 3 major isoforms of vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF120, 164,&#xD;
      and 180. We will also determine the duration of the effect and whether it is additive with&#xD;
      ACE/ARB therapy inhibition.&#xD;
