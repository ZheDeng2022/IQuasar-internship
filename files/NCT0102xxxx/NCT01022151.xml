    <textblock>
      Early postoperative recovery of neurologic and cognitive functions is especially advantageous&#xD;
      after fast-tracking ambulatory procedures to hasten home discharge after surgery.1 It is well&#xD;
      known that volatile anaesthetic agents may generate adverse postoperative cognitive effects&#xD;
      and even traces of it may affect task performance in healthy volunteers.2Hence, rapid&#xD;
      elimination of the volatile anaesthetics may help reduce postoperative confusion and&#xD;
      cognitive impairment in surgical patients by facilitating a faster recovery from general&#xD;
      anaesthesia.3 Sevoflurane has been advocated for the routine anesthesia for ambulatory&#xD;
      surgery patients. It activates adenosine A1 receptors in primary rat hippocampal cultures&#xD;
      through the liberation of adenosine secondary to the interaction of with adenosine transport&#xD;
      or key enzymes in adenosine metabolism.4 However; sevoflurane anaesthesia is associated with&#xD;
      slower emergence and delayed early postoperative cognitive recovery than desflurane5 and&#xD;
      xenon2 anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aminophylline, which is a hydrophilic cyclic adenosine mono-phosphate (cAMP) dependent&#xD;
      phosphodiesterase inhibitor has been used for long time to antagonize the sedative effects of&#xD;
      morphine, diazepam, and barbiturates.6-7Aminophylline in doses of 2-5 mg/kg shortens the&#xD;
      recovery from sevoflurane anaesthesia and improves bispectral index scores (BIS) with&#xD;
      concurrent increases in heart rate which might have a detrimental effect in patients with&#xD;
      ischaemic heart disease.8-11However, the use of smaller doses of 2-3 mg/kg is associated with&#xD;
      less increases in heart rate. 10-11 The use of 1 mg/kg of Doxapram is comparable to 2 mg/kg&#xD;
      of aminophylline in improvement of early recovery from sevoflurane anaesthesia secondary to&#xD;
      its central nervous system stimulating effect rather than increased ventilatory elimination&#xD;
      of sevoflurane.11 Currently, there is no available published studies have investigated the&#xD;
      effects of either theophylline or doxapram on early postoperative cognitive recovery after&#xD;
      balanced anaesthesia with sevoflurane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that the use of small doses of aminophylline [2-3 mg/kg] may be comparable to&#xD;
      larger doses in improvement of the early postoperative cognitive recovery from sevoflurane&#xD;
      anaesthesia with associated non-significant increases in heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study investigated the effects of 1 mg/kg of doxapram, and 2, 3, 4, and 5 mg/kg&#xD;
      of aminophylline on the early postoperative cognitive recovery using the Short Orientation&#xD;
      Memory Concentration Test (SOMCT), response entropy (RE) state entropy (SE), difference&#xD;
      between RE and SE (RE-SE), end-tidal sevoflurane concentration, haemodynamics, the times to&#xD;
      eyes opening and to extubation and degree of sedation after sevoflurane anaesthesia in&#xD;
      patients undergoing ambulatory surgery.&#xD;

      One-hundred-eighty ASA I-II patients aged 18-55 years scheduled for elective ambulatory&#xD;
      general surgery with a duration &gt;1 h under general anaesthesia were enrolled in this&#xD;
      double-blinded placebo-controlled randomised study after obtaining of the approval of&#xD;
      Institutional Ethical Committee of author's centre and a written informed consent from the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based upon our preliminary data, a prior power analysis indicated that 27 patients in each&#xD;
      group was a sufficiently large sample size to detect a 20% difference on the Short&#xD;
      Orientation Memory Concentration Test (SOMCT)12 at 30 minutes after extubation, with a type-I&#xD;
      error of 0.05 and type II error of 0.2. We added 10% more patients to account for patients&#xD;
      dropping out during the study. Participants were allocated randomly to six groups (n=30 for&#xD;
      each) to receive saline [group P], 1 mg/kg of doxapram [group D] or 2, 3, 4 or 5 mg/kg of&#xD;
      aminophylline [groups A2, A3, A4, and A5, respectively] at the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with history of significant cardiovascular, respiratory, cognitive dysfunction,&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disease, neurological or psychiatric diseases, pregnancy, and obesity (body&#xD;
      mass index ≥ 30 Kg/m2), recent history of infection or recent fever, or adverse reaction to&#xD;
      aminophylline or sevoflurane, alcoholism, drug dependence or those receiving xanthines,&#xD;
      ß-agonist, anticholinergic, tranquilizers, anticonvulsants or antidepressants or those who&#xD;
      has habitual coffee consumption exceeding 2 cups per day, are unable to read, or are&#xD;
      suffering from serious hearing or vision impairment were excluded from the study. All&#xD;
      operations were performed by the same surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome variable included early postoperative cognitive function. Secondary outcome&#xD;
      variables included changes in entropy variables, end-tidal sevoflurane and recovery pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SOMCT is a patient-based test designed to assess cognitive function in terms of level of&#xD;
      orientation, memory, and concentration, The SOMCT requires subjects to recall the current&#xD;
      year, and one sentence, and to repeat in numerical order and reverse order the sequence of&#xD;
      the months through the year. These six variables yield scores ranging from 0 to 28, with&#xD;
      higher scores indicating better function and scores more than 20 were considered normal&#xD;
      (Appendix 1).12 A blind investigator who was not involved in the management of the patient&#xD;
      and who was blinded to the study drugs explained the SOMCT to the participant and applied it&#xD;
      30 min before induction. All patients received the same explanation of the test by the same&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No premedications were given. A cannula was inserted in a forearm vein and Lactated Ringer's&#xD;
      solution was infused at a rate of 2-3 mL/kg/h. Patients monitoring included&#xD;
      electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure and nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      temperature monitoring (Datex-OhmedaTM S/5TM, Helsinki, Finland). RE and SE were monitored&#xD;
      with the Datex-OhmedaTM S/5 Entropy Module using a specific entropy sensor (M-EntropyTM,&#xD;
      Datex-Ohmeda Division, Instrumentarium Corporation, Helsinki, Finland). The sensors were&#xD;
      applied appropriately to the patient's forehead according to the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
      Neuromuscular block were monitored by a train-of-four (TOF) stimulation of the ulnar nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The attending anaesthesiologists who gave the anaesthetic were not involved in the collection&#xD;
      of the patient's data. General anaesthesia was induced with propofol (2-3 mg/kg) and fentanyl&#xD;
      (2-3 µg/kg). Rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) was given and tracheal intubation was carried out at the&#xD;
      development of maximum block of the TOF. After tracheal intubation, the minimum alveolar&#xD;
      concentration (MAC), the end-tidal concentrations of sevoflurane (EtSevo) and end-tidal&#xD;
      concentrations of carbon dioxide (EtCO2) were monitored. Anaesthesia was maintained with&#xD;
      0.5-1 MAC of sevoflurane in combination with 50% air in oxygen in a semi-closed circuit with&#xD;
      total gas flow of 1 L/min, based on entropy reading where the end-points were SE of ≤ 50 and&#xD;
      SE-RE difference less than 10.13 The patient's lungs were ventilated mechanically to maintain&#xD;
      the EtCO2 at 35-40 mm Hg. Rocuronium increments were given to maintain suppression of the&#xD;
      second twitch using a train-of-four stimulation. Normothermia was maintained using forced-air&#xD;
      warming blankets. No supplementary dose of muscle relaxant was administered 30 minutes before&#xD;
      the end of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery, patients received lornixicam 16 mg and paracetamol 15 mg/kg for postoperative&#xD;
      pain relief and granisetron 1 mg for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During skin closure, neuromuscular blockade was antagonized with 50 µg/kg neostigmine and 10&#xD;
      µg/kg glycopyrrolate when the train of four ratio (TOF ratio) ranged between 0.3 and 0.5. At&#xD;
      the last skin suture, sevoflurane was discontinued (T0) and the patient's lungs were&#xD;
      ventilated with 100% oxygen at 5 litres/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were allocated randomly to six groups (n=30 for each) by drawing sequentially&#xD;
      numbered sealed opaque envelopes containing a computer-generated randomisation code to&#xD;
      receive intravenous injection of 0.2 mL/kg of a study solution containing either saline 0.9%&#xD;
      solution [group P], doxapram 5 mg/mL [group D], or 10 mg/mL [group A2], 15 mg/mL [group A3],&#xD;
      20 mg/mL [group A4], or 25 mg/mL [group A5] of aminophylline. All study solutions were&#xD;
      injected within 1 min at T0 after discontinuation of sevoflurane. No stimulation was applied&#xD;
      to patients during this period. The test solutions looked identical and contained normal&#xD;
      saline, doxapram or aminophylline. They were prepared in identical syringes labelled 'study&#xD;
      drug', before induction of anaesthesia by an independent anaesthesiologist who was not&#xD;
      involved in the study. The attending anaesthesiologists who were blinded to the study&#xD;
      protocol and the patient's randomization code gave the anaesthetic, study solution and&#xD;
      established awakening. All staff in the operating room, post anaesthesia care unit (PACU),&#xD;
      and day-case surgery ward was unaware of the randomization code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measurements were made by the same investigator who was not involved in the management of&#xD;
      the patient and who was blinded to the study drugs. Therefore, the patient did not know&#xD;
      his/her assigned treatment group. All data, including RE, SE, (RE-SE), the MAC and end-tidal&#xD;
      concentration (EtSevo) of sevoflurane, heart rate (HR), and mean arterial blood pressure&#xD;
      (MAP) was recorded every 1 min after administration of the study drug (T0) for 15 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tracheal extubation was performed immediately after suctioning when all extubation criteria&#xD;
      were achieved (TOF ratio ≥ 0.9, spontaneous ventilation and the ability to follow verbal&#xD;
      commands, eye opening, head lift ≥ 5 seconds, and handgrip), at the discretion of the&#xD;
      anaesthetist who was involved in the intraoperative management of the patient. The level of&#xD;
      consciousness was assessed using simple verbal commands ('open your eyes', 'move your hand')&#xD;
      and was repeated up to three times with increasing forcefulness if the subject failed to&#xD;
      respond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recovery from anaesthesia was assessed by the times to eyes opening (time from T0 to&#xD;
      spontaneous eye opening), response time (time from T0 to squeeze the investigator's hand on&#xD;
      command), and the time to extubation (time from T0 to tracheal extubation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After awakening, patients were transferred to the PACU and physical recovery was assessed&#xD;
      using the modified Aldrete score14 every 5 minutes after extubation until it reached at least&#xD;
      9 points and the time to reach a score ≥ 9 was recorded. Postoperative analgesia was provided&#xD;
      with 0.5 mg/kg intravenous boluses of meperidine as needed to achieve a visual analog pain&#xD;
      scale less than 4 points. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), respiratory&#xD;
      rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, and the degree of sedation (four-point verbal rating&#xD;
      scores (VRS): awake, drowsy, rousable or deep sleep) were recorded on the patient's arrival&#xD;
      and every 15 min until discharge to the ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early postoperative cognitive function was assessed using the SOMCT test, 30 min before&#xD;
      induction and 30, 60 and 90 minutes after extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge of patients from the PACU was determined by clinical criteria at the discretion of&#xD;
      the attending anaesthetists and no attempt was made to speed up this process. These criteria&#xD;
      included alertness and orientation to time and place, conversant and cooperative, stable&#xD;
      vital signs for at least 0.5 hour, able to sit up without dizziness and/or nausea, tolerable&#xD;
      pain, and a modified Aldrete score ≥ 9. Home readiness was determined by specific clinical&#xD;
      criteria, included stable vital signs for at least 1 h, controllable pain by oral analgesics,&#xD;
      absent or mild nausea or emesis, ability to walk without dizziness, and ability to retain&#xD;
      oral fluids. Actual discharge time was also recorded.15 Times to reach a PACU discharge, home&#xD;
      readiness and home discharge and the cost of the study medications were recorded.&#xD;
      Postoperative complications included arrhythmia, tremors, vomiting, nausea, seizures,&#xD;
      shivering, agitation, or hypoxemia (SpO2&lt;90%) were recorded.&#xD;
