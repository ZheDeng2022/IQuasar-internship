      Objective: The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Pascal Laser&#xD;
      Iridotomy and Pascal Laser Peripheral Iridoplasty in lowering intraocular pressure and&#xD;
      opening up the angles in patients with narrow angles, primary angle closure and primary angle&#xD;
      closure glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives are to evaluate the pain and inflammation associated with the&#xD;
      procedure and its possible adverse effects on the lens and corneal endothelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Prospective, interventional case series Study Population: Healthy males and&#xD;
      females with appositional angle closure aged 21 y/o and above Methods: Potential participants&#xD;
      are evaluated by a glaucoma specialist in National University Hospital. If they are&#xD;
      identified as having appositional angle closure they are invited to participate in the study&#xD;
      and assigned to either iridotomy or iridoplasty depending on the mechanism of angle closure&#xD;
      present. Pupil block for Pascal Laser Iridotomy and plateau iris and angle crowding for&#xD;
      Pascal Laser Peripheral Iridoplasty. If they agree to participate they will undergo visual&#xD;
      acuity, slit lamp examination, intraocular pressure determination by Goldmann Applanation&#xD;
      Tonometry, gonioscopy, optic nerve head evaluation by indirect ophthalmoscopy and lens&#xD;
      evaluation by LOCS III opacity grading system. Humphrey visual field examination using 24-2&#xD;
      SITA standard algorithm and stereodisc photos will be obtained if not done within the past 12&#xD;
      months. Anterior segment OCT and laser flare meter will also be performed prior to the&#xD;
      procedure. Enrolled patients will be divided into 2 groups. The first group will be assigned&#xD;
      to Pascal Laser Iridotomy. The primary mechanism of angle closure in this group is pupillary&#xD;
      block. The second group will be assigned to Pascal Laser Peripheral Iridoplasty. This group&#xD;
      has non-pupil bock mechanisms which include plateau iris or angle crowding. After the laser&#xD;
      procedure, follow-up examinations will be done 1 hr post laser, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and&#xD;
      6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures are the intraocular pressure difference pre&#xD;
      and post laser and the opening of angles. Secondary outcome measures are pain and&#xD;
      inflammation associated with laser procedure, lens and corneal endothelial changes.&#xD;

      PLANNED INTERVENTIONS Potential study participants are seen by a glaucoma specialist at&#xD;
      National University Hospital. If they are identified as having primary angle closure and have&#xD;
      met the inclusion criteria mentioned above, they will be invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Potential risks and benefits will be explained. After which, they will sign an informed&#xD;
      consent when they agree to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual acuity, slit lamp examination, intraocular pressure determination through Goldmann&#xD;
      Applanation Tonometry, gonioscopy, optic nerve head examination through indirect&#xD;
      ophthalmoscopy and lens evaluation using LOCS III lens opacity grading system will be done on&#xD;
      baseline visit. Humphrey visual field exam using 24-2, SITA standard algorithm and stereodisc&#xD;
      photos will also be obtained if not done within the past 12 months. Anterior segment OCT,&#xD;
      laser flare meter of the anterior chamber and corneal endothelial cell count will also be&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on gonioscopy and anterior segment OCT findings, the primary mechanism of angle closure&#xD;
      will be analyzed. Depending on the major mechanism, they will be assigned to either Pascal&#xD;
      Laser Iridotomy and Pascal Laser Peripheral Iridoplasty. Patients identified as having pupil&#xD;
      block will be assigned to Pascal Laser Iridotomy and those identified as having plateau iris&#xD;
      configuration, plateau iris syndrome or angle crowding will be assigned to Pascal Laser&#xD;
      Peripheral Iridoplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post laser follow up will be done after 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PASCAL LASER IRIDOTOMY Prior to laser procedure 1 drop each of Alphagan-P and 4% Pilocarpine&#xD;
      are instilled 15 minutes prior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Scanning Laser Parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Set the pattern mode to square array, 2 x 2 spots, 0.25 distance between spots.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Set pulse duration to 20 ms&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Adjust spot size to 100 um.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Apply spots to peripheral iris preferably in the area between 11:00 and 1:00 o'clock&#xD;
           position, positioning within an iris crypt until there is thinning of the iris stroma&#xD;
           with a honeycomb apearance is obtained. The desired result is the appearance of a small&#xD;
           hole with a dark brown base at the base of the burn and dispersion of debris into&#xD;
           anterior chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Penetrating Burn with Yag Laser&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Set power to 2-3 mJ&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Apply laser burns to center of the hole until a mushroom cloud admixed with aqueous&#xD;
           balloons into the anterior chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Enlarge the hole until approximately 300 um or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Lens: Abraham lens&#xD;
&#xD;
      PASCAL LASER PERIPHERAL IRIDOPLASTY Prior to laser procedure 1 drop each of Alphagan-P and 4%&#xD;
      Pilocarpine are instilled 15 minutes prior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Titrate Average Laser Power&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Set the pattern mode to single spot&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Set the pulse duration to 100 ms&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Adjust spot size to 100 um&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Apply spots at the peripheral iris one at a time while increasing average power until&#xD;
           adequate contraction of peripheral iris is seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Scanning Laser Parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Choose the number of rows of spots (2-4) depending on dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Choose spot separation between arcs from -0.25 to 0.25 spot diameter. One spot diameter&#xD;
           = 100 um.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Choose spot spacing within each arc from 0 to 1 spot diameter depending on dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Set radius of the arc to match the curvature of the peripheral iris.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Contact lens: CGIL lens&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treat 360 degrees of peripheral iris with a total of 20-24 burns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEFINITION OF OUTCOMES The main outcome measures are the difference in the pre laser and post&#xD;
      laser intraocular pressures and the opening of angles documented by gonioscopy and anterior&#xD;
      segment OCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures are the pain and inflammation associated with the procedure as&#xD;
      seen through slit lamp examination grading of anterior chamber cells and flares and laser&#xD;
      flare meter analysis, and the possible changes in the corneal endothelium as seen in the&#xD;
      specular microscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of Examination Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Visual Acuity Visual acuity: This will be assessed using a logMAR chart under standard&#xD;
           lighting: best corrected visual acuity will be recorded (using the subjective refractive&#xD;
           correction obtained above). Subjects will start reading at the 6/12 equivalent line&#xD;
           (0.3) and if unable to read at least three letters, they will begin to read the line&#xD;
           above and continue this process until at least three letters on one line have been read.&#xD;
           This line will be recorded as the visual acuity. If the subject is able to read at least&#xD;
           three letters on the first line, they will proceed on to the next line below, until they&#xD;
           are unable to read further down the chart. If unable to read the chart at 4 m, the&#xD;
           subject will be moved to 2m, and then 1m from the chart. If unable to see/achieve&#xD;
           minimum recordable logMAR acuity, the vision will be recorded as perception or&#xD;
           non-perception of light.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Goldman Applanation Tonometry The IOP will be measured by Goldman Applanation Tonometry&#xD;
           after instillation of a topical anesthetic. The IOP at every visit will be taken using&#xD;
           the same slit lamp and tonometer. Three consecutive readings will be taken and the mean&#xD;
           of the three values used in the statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Slit lamp Biomicroscopic Examination Slit lamp biomicroscopic examination will be&#xD;
           performed on the same slit lamp every visit. Examination of the conjunctiva, cornea,&#xD;
           anterior chamber and lens will be done and any abnormalities noted. The lens will be&#xD;
           graded using the Lens Opacity Classification Scale III (LOCS III). The anterior cells&#xD;
           and flares will be graded as follows: A parallelepiped about 2 mm wide and 4 mm high at&#xD;
           45 degrees will be directed into the pupil. The following table will be used9.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Grade Aqueous Cells Grade Flare 0 None 0 Complete absence 1 5-10 cells per field 1 Faint&#xD;
           flare (barely detectable) 2 10-20 per field 2 Moderate flare (iris and lens details&#xD;
           clear) 3 20-50 cells per field 3 Marked flare (iris and lens details hazy) 4 50 + cells&#xD;
           per field 4 Intense flare (fixed, coagulated aqueous humor with considerable fibrin)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Gonioscopy Gonioscopy will be performed on all patients using Sussman 4-mirror&#xD;
           gonioscopy lens to facilitate indentation gonioscopy. Findings in each quadrant will be&#xD;
           graded using the Shaffer System and recorded in a goniogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. LOCS III Lens Opacity Grading System LOCS III lens opacity grading system will be used&#xD;
           to assess if there will be developing cataract or increasing degree of cataract&#xD;
           associated with the laser procedure. It will be done on the baseline visit as well on&#xD;
           all follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Visual Field Testing Humphrey Visual field Analyzer will be used with the program of&#xD;
           SITA standard, 24-2 test. For the visual fields to be reliable, the following criteria&#xD;
           should be followed: fixation losses of less than 33%, false positive errors of less than&#xD;
           20% and false negative errors of less than 20%. Mean deviation and pattern standard&#xD;
           deviation will be compared on each test to determine progression of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Anterior Segment OCT Anterior segment OCT using Carl Zeiss Visante is an non-contact&#xD;
           imaging system used to assess the anterior chamber anatomy especially the anterior&#xD;
           chamber angles. It will be performed prelaser, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months&#xD;
           post laser.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Flare Meter The Kowa FM-600 Laser flare meter will be used to assess anterior chamber&#xD;
           inflammation. Five measurements will be taken and the average will be recorded as the&#xD;
           correct value. Results will be expressed in photons/ms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Corneal Specular Microscopy Non-contact specular microscopy will be performed at the&#xD;
           central and peripheral regions of the cornea using Topcon SP-2000P.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This method measures the state of the corneal endothelium, the parameters to be determined&#xD;
      are endothelial cell density, cell area, coefficient of variation (CV) in cell area and&#xD;
      hexagonality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCHEDULE OF STUDY VISITS Recruitment visit Baseline assessment will be done upon referral for&#xD;
      inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Visit Pascal Laser Iridotomy or Pascal Laser Peripheral Iridoplasty will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visits Follow-up examinations will be performed 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6&#xD;
      months after the laser procedure. The following examinations will be done on each postlaser&#xD;
      visit: visual acuity, slit lamp examination, intraocular pressure determination, lens opacity&#xD;
      evaluation, gonioscopy, anterior segment OCT, laser flare meter examination of anterior&#xD;
      chamber inflammation, Humphrey visual fields(baseline &amp; six months) and corneal endothelial&#xD;
      cell count.&#xD;
