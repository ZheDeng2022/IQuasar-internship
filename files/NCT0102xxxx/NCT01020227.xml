      Background: This randomized controlled trial investigates the effectiveness of an Integrative&#xD;
      Therapies (IT) health education intervention in improving physical and psychological&#xD;
      functioning in female patients after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: One hundred female cardiac surgery patients were assigned to either an intervention&#xD;
      or standard care control group. Patients in the intervention group were given a cardiac yoga&#xD;
      video, a guided imagery audiotape, instruction in diaphragmatic breathing, and an educational&#xD;
      booklet outlining recommendations for dietary change. Patients were followed for 6 months by&#xD;
      a health educator who provided ongoing education and encouragement and were assessed at 6&#xD;
      weeks and 6 months post surgery to determine between group differences on physical&#xD;
      functioning and psychological distress using the SF-36 and the Profile of Mood States&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease is the most frequent cause of death for women in the United States.&#xD;
      Increasingly coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is used for women as a treatment for&#xD;
      this disease and women now account for nearly 30% of patients undergoing CABG surgery. Women&#xD;
      are reported to have higher morbidity and mortality after CABG surgery than men. In addition&#xD;
      to this higher complication and death rate, recent studies suggest that women experience more&#xD;
      fear, stress, depression and anxiety before and after surgery than men. This randomized,&#xD;
      controlled study was developed to research the feasibility and possible effects of providing&#xD;
      health education and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) tools to women after they&#xD;
      have undergone cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized controlled clinical trial of 150 women from the Columbia campus of&#xD;
      New York Presbyterian Hospital who recently had cardiac surgery. Baseline information on risk&#xD;
      factor status, psychosocial status, quality of life, and CAM usage and expectancy will be&#xD;
      obtained on all participants. Women will be randomized to CAM health education or standard&#xD;
      care and will be followed for 6 months. Patients randomized to CAM health education will&#xD;
      receive a three-tiered program in CAM education by a certified or trained practitioner in&#xD;
      Yoga, Guided Imagery, and Nutrition. Patients will receive both personalized instruction in&#xD;
      use of these CAM therapies and custom-designed instructional material including a:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. videotape on cardiac yoga,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a guided imagery audiotape and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. a booklet on micronutritional approaches to cardiac care (developed by Dr Oz and the&#xD;
           Columbia Integrative Medicine Program)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women randomized to CAM health education will be contacted at 2, 4, and 6 weeks, 3 months,&#xD;
      and 6 months post surgery to assess progress toward reaching prevention goals, their&#xD;
      utilization of CAM therapies, and their impact on psychological and physical health. The&#xD;
      health educator will problem solve with the patient to overcome barriers toward reaching&#xD;
      prevention and CAM goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments of the following outcomes will be made at 6 weeks and 6 months post intervention:&#xD;
      overall mood as measured by the Profile of Mood States12, perception of stress as measured by&#xD;
      a single-item, likert stress scale, psychological and mental health status as measured by the&#xD;
      SF36, and the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (cardiovascular disease death,&#xD;
      nonfatal myocardial infarction, myocardial revascularization procedure, stroke, non-coronary&#xD;
      arterial revascularization, cardiovascular hospitalizations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the CAM education intervention is a feasible mode of disseminating&#xD;
      information and encouraging the use of CAM tools to women post cardiac surgery. It is also&#xD;
      hypothesized that the CAM intervention will increase overall mood (POMS), will decrease&#xD;
      perceived stress (self report stress score), will increase self report of physical and mental&#xD;
      functioning (SF36, PH and MH scales) and will decrease episodes of major adverse cardiac&#xD;
      events at 6 months postsurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will include evaluation of the following within group outcomes: overall&#xD;
      adherence and utilization of CAM tools, overall frequency of use by tool (yoga, guided&#xD;
      imagery, dietary changes), time point of initiation of CAM use, frequency of use by&#xD;
      demographics (age, ethnicity, surgery type, previous CAM exposure, employment status, marital&#xD;
      status), most frequent barriers to use, rate of refusal, rate of dropout. In addition,&#xD;
      comparisons of the between group outcomes (Mood, Stress, and Physical and Mental Functioning)&#xD;
      will be evaluated.&#xD;
