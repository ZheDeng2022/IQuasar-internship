  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy and safety of influenza vaccine&#xD;
      in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) receiving immunosuppressive therapy with&#xD;
      patients not receiving immunosuppressants .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the humoral immunogenicity of influenza&#xD;
      vaccination in patients with IBD&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Annual vaccination against influenza is recommended for those at high risk of complications,&#xD;
      particularly among patients with immunodeficiency including those resulting from&#xD;
      immunosuppressive treatments administered for a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).&#xD;
      However, published data showing that influenza vaccination coverage is low in this population&#xD;
      (&lt;30%) due to lack of data on the effectiveness of vaccination in these patients and the&#xD;
      theoretical risk of negative impact on the evolution of IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve influenza vaccination coverage of the population treated by immunosuppressants for&#xD;
      a chronic IBD, it is essential to have data on the effectiveness of vaccination in these&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research aims to evaluate the immunogenicity of influenza vaccination in patients&#xD;
      followed for a chronic IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factors in choice of study population were as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. IBD is a common disease. Among the inflammatory diseases treated with immunosuppressants&#xD;
           and reaching patients under 65 years, IBD are among the most frequent. They result from&#xD;
           an abnormal immune response to gut flora and their management often requires the&#xD;
           prescription of immunosuppressive drugs (azathioprine, methotrexate, in particular) and&#xD;
           more recently TNF-blockers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the existence of vaccine recommendations published recently for specific patients on&#xD;
           immunosuppressive therapy at greatest risk of complications related to influenza;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the fact that vaccinations have not been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. data showing that vaccination recommendations are poorly followed in this population. A&#xD;
           recently published work found vaccination coverage against influenza of only 28% in a&#xD;
           cohort of 169 patients treated for IBD;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology chosen is a phase III, prospective, open, vaccine trial. The primary endpoint&#xD;
      is the humoral immunogenicity induced by the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is scheduled on 2 successive years to assess the value of annual vaccination&#xD;
      repeated in this population treated with immunosuppressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a benefit for patients to participate in this study because they are all vaccinated&#xD;
      against influenza and will benefit from a clinical and laboratory monitoring in this study.&#xD;
      Moreover, these patients are taken to be vaccinated in the event of a pandemic influenza&#xD;
