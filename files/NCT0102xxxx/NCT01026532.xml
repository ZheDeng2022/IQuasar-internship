  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how a special white blood cell, the eosinophil, can&#xD;
      contribute to asthma. One of the characteristics of asthma is airway inflammation. Airway&#xD;
      inflammation in asthma may occur when an allergen is inhaled and sets up an allergic reaction&#xD;
      in the bronchial tubes. This reaction may lead to chest tightness, cough and wheeze. To&#xD;
      better understand the way in which the eosinophil can cause inflammation, the investigators&#xD;
      plan to study eosinophils that move in to the lung following an allergic reaction.&#xD;

    <description>Segmental allergen challenge: Briefly, this procedure will be done during a bronchoscopy. Two airway tubes of the lung will have about 1 teaspoon of allergen put in it while the scope is wedged in an airway tube segment. The allergen will stimulate this portion of the airway tube to produce eosinophils. The scope will then be removed. The bronchoscopy will be repeated two days later to collect lung fluid and biopsy samples from the parts of the lung where the allergen solution was placed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18-50 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of allergic rhinitis and/or mild asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-albuterol forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) of &gt;70% predicted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Skin test positive to house dust mite (D. farinae), short ragweed or cat hair&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented negative Tuberculin skin test (PPD) within the last 12 months or a medical&#xD;
             history that is consistent with a low probability of exposure to tuberculosis (i.e.&#xD;
             the subject is not a health worker, has not traveled to endemic areas, and has no&#xD;
             pre-existing medical or social risk factors for tuberculosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least a 20% decrease in FEV1 during the immediate response following inhaled&#xD;
             antigen challenge&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Safety laboratory assessments within normal ranges (labs to include complete blood&#xD;
             count with differential, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, Prothrombin time, Partial&#xD;
             Thromboplastin Time and platelet count)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential (WCBP) must have a negative urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             (urine HCG) within 48 hours of the methacholine challenge at Visit 2, within 48 hours&#xD;
             of the inhaled allergen challenge at V3 and on the day of the segmental allergen&#xD;

             the duration of the study (reliable methods of birth control can include abstinence,&#xD;
             barrier methods, oral contraceptives, injection contraceptives or skin absorption&#xD;
             contraceptives).&#xD;
