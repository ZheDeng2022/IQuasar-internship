        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a non-hematologic malignancy (radiographic, histologic, or cytologic&#xD;
             confirmation), or hematologic malignancy (histologic or cytologic confirmation) that&#xD;
             is either: relapsed or refractory to standard therapy, failed at least one prior&#xD;
             therapy or no known effective therapy exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the investigator's opinion, the subject's life expectancy is at least 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If clinically indicated, (e.g., subjects over the age of 70) subjects must have&#xD;
             documented brain imaging (MRI or CT) negative for subdural or epidural hematoma within&#xD;
             28 days prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with brain metastases must have clinically controlled neurologic symptoms,&#xD;
             defined as surgical excision and/or radiation therapy followed by 21 days of stable&#xD;
             neurologic function and no evidence of CNS disease progression as determined by CT or&#xD;
             MRI within 21 days prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of or is clinically suspicious for cancer-related central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an underlying, predisposing condition of bleeding or currently exhibits signs of&#xD;
             bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has active peptic ulcer disease or other hemorrhagic esophagitis/gastritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has active immune thrombocytopenic purpura or a history of being refractory to&#xD;
             platelet transfusions (within 1 year prior to the first dose of study drug).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant history of cardiovascular disease (e.g., MI, thrombotic or thromboembolic&#xD;
             event in the last 6 months), renal, neurologic, psychiatric, endocrinologic,&#xD;
             metabolic, immunologic, or hepatic disease. Female subject is pregnant or&#xD;
             breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of or an active medical condition(s) that affects absorption or motility&#xD;
             (e.g., Crohn's disease, celiac disease, gastroparesis, short bowel syndrome, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exhibits evidence of other clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s) including,&#xD;
             but not limited to: active systemic fungal infection; diagnosis of fever and&#xD;
             neutropenia within one week prior to study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received any anti-cancer therapy including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy,&#xD;
             hormonal (with the exception of hormones for hypothyroidism or estrogen replacement&#xD;
             therapy [ERT], or agonists required to suppress serum testosterone levels [e.g., LHRH,&#xD;
             GnRH, etc.] for subjects with prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently receiving or requires anticoagulation therapy or any drugs or herbal&#xD;
             supplements that affect platelet function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently receiving or requires anti-fungal treatment or CYP3A inhibitors. In the&#xD;
             opinion of the Investigator, the subject is an unsuitable candidate to receive&#xD;
             ABT-263.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of or is clinically suspicious for cancer-related central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
