    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) who are free&#xD;
      of any cardiovascular disease will have early microcirculatory changes that are unique to&#xD;
      OSA, and therefore would resolve with treatment of OSA.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Impaired vascular regulation of the microcirculation is a consequence of Obstructive Sleep&#xD;
      Apnea (OSA). Nitric Oxide (NO) related endothelial dysfunction occurs in OSA as the earliest&#xD;
      vascular abnormality prior to the manifestation of vascular disease and it results in&#xD;
      impaired vasodilatory response to hypoxia. These abnormalities have already been described in&#xD;
      OSA patients. The role of oxidative stress in endothelial dysfunction is present in vascular&#xD;
      disorders. The presence of oxidative stress in OSA patients is also well established. The&#xD;
      effect of increased superoxide on endothelial function has also been described in the&#xD;
      literature. The mechanism of this effect is unknown and is the focus of this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) who are free of any&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease will have early microcirculatory changes that are unique to OSA, and&#xD;
      therefore would resolve with treatment of OSA.&#xD;
