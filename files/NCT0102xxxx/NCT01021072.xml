  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to block interleukin-1 alpha activity with a True Human&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody, thus interrupting the inflammatory response that supports tumor&#xD;
      growth/metastasis and which drives the cachexic process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adaptive design will be employed which will allow for the exploration of different dosing&#xD;
      regimens, as well as tumor types that show preliminary evidence of efficacy.&#xD;
