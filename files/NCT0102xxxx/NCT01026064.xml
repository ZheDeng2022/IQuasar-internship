  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the utility of the cantharidin-induced skin&#xD;
      blister assay for evaluation of the anti-inflammatory effects of macrolides in healthy male&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 3 parts. Part A of the study will assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      different cantharidin blister induction/sampling timepoints (challenge options) ranging from&#xD;
      16/16 hours to 48/48 hours, including the ability to evaluate the acute and resolving phase&#xD;
      of acute inflammation. In Part A, 4 to 8 healthy male volunteers will be included. This will&#xD;
      be followed by Part B (in up to 12 subjects), aimed to select the optimum challenge option&#xD;
      based on the reproducibility of read-outs across two challenge sessions. This option will be&#xD;
      applied in Part C in up to 24 subjects in order to evaluate the utility of the assay to&#xD;
      demonstrate anti-inflammatory effects of a standard macrolide (azithromycin). Part C is&#xD;
      designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial. Following the first&#xD;
      cantharidin challenge and blister evaluation, subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive azithromycin or placebo. Skin blister induction and assessment will be repeated&#xD;
      immediately after treatment completion and, potentially, approximately 3 weeks later. The&#xD;
      inflammatory response to cantharidin and its modulation by azithromycin will be evaluated by&#xD;
      total and differential cell counts in blister fluid, monocyte/macrophage phenotyping and the&#xD;
      measurement of selected inflammation mediators in blister fluid and serum.&#xD;
