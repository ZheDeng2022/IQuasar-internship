      This is a prospective, open, non-randomized, non-controlled study. 20 patients with&#xD;
      hypertension on chronic maintenance hemodialysis will be enrolled in the study. All patients&#xD;
      had mild to moderate hypertension and are receiving antihypertensive agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed to investigate effects of Adalat GITS on hemodialytic blood pressures&#xD;
      in patients with chronic hemodialysis by using ABPM and measuring the drug plasma&#xD;
      concentrations. For the purpose of investigating the influence of hemodialysis on the drug&#xD;
      plasma concentration as well as its efficacy, it should be necessary to assign the subjects&#xD;
      with the Adalat monotherapy. Since most patients in the hemodialysis center will be those who&#xD;
      need and already receive combination therapy, it would be practical to start Adalat 60mg/day&#xD;
      monotherapy to remain similar antihypertensive effect when discontinuing the previous&#xD;
      treatment in this study population to be screened and enrolled. And taking into the&#xD;
      consideration of clinical practice, few patients undergoing hemodialysis could be well&#xD;
      controlled by low dose Adalat 30mg/day alone. So this study will evaluate the effect and&#xD;
      safety of Adalat GITS 60mg/day alone and thereafter the influence of hemodialysis on the drug&#xD;
      plasma concentration without any other possible drug interaction. The agents are given orally&#xD;
      once a day at 08:00h and patients are followed for at least 4 weeks. After that,the patients&#xD;
      whose blood pressure are well controlled by Adalat GITS 60mg/day by office blood pressure&#xD;
      would be enrolled for further ABPM assessment and plasma concentration evaluation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Calcium channel blockers are widely used to reduce blood pressure in hypertensive patients on&#xD;
      hemodialysis. They are useful I patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction and stable angina pectoris. Adalat GITS, a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium&#xD;
      channel blocker, has been used as one of first choices to treat the hypertension because of&#xD;
      its effective hypotensive potency and relative absence of side effects compared with the&#xD;
      short-acting agent. Antihypertensive effects of calcium channel blockers largely depend on&#xD;
      their plasma concentrations, a rapid increase in blood pressure may occur as circulating&#xD;
      levels of such blockers decrease after hemodialysis. This rapid fluctuation in blood pressure&#xD;
      may evoke rapid alteration in hemodynamics. Luik et al. show that pre- or post-dialysis blood&#xD;
      pressure measurements in patients with hemodialysis may be misleading for determining the&#xD;
      blood pressure. Ambulatory pressure monitoring (ABPM) may be more useful for estimating blood&#xD;
      pressure control in the dialysed patients. For most patients on dialysis, the goal office&#xD;
      blood pressure is less than an average value below 150/90 mmHg on no medication. The&#xD;
      reasonable target goal of mean ambulatory blood pressure is less than 135/85 mmHg during the&#xD;
      day and less than 120/80 mmHg at night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is need of more convincing data to demonstrate the effect of Adalat GITS on&#xD;
      hemodialytic patients by using ABPM and investigating the plasma concentrations. This study&#xD;
      was designed to investigate effects of Adalat GITS on hemodialytic blood pressures in&#xD;
      patients with chronic hemodialysis by using ABPM and measuring the drug plasma&#xD;
      concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, open, non-randomized, non-controlled study. 20 patients with&#xD;
      hypertension on chronic maintenance hemodialysis will be enrolled in the study. All patients&#xD;
      had mild to moderate hypertension and are receiving antihypertensive agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All antihypertensive agents received by patients screened were withdrawn and patients are&#xD;
      assigned to receive only nifedipine controlled release tablets 60mg/day. The agents are given&#xD;
      orally once a day at 08:00h and patients are followed for at least 4 weeks. After 4 weeks of&#xD;
      antihypertensive treatment, 20 patients with adequate blood pressure achieved&#xD;
      (pre-hemodialysis office blood pressure &lt; 140/90 mmHg) will be recruited into the study. If&#xD;
      adequate blood pressure is not achieved, the patients will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After patients have achieved adequate blood pressure (pre-hemodialysis office blood pressure&#xD;
      &lt; 140/90 mmHg) at enrollment, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is&#xD;
      immediately performed on the day of hemodialysis within the subsequent two days. The&#xD;
      administration of Adalat will continue as previously until the morning of the hemodialytic&#xD;
      day with AMPM and blood samplings for study. The blood was sampled just before, 1 hour after,&#xD;
      2 hour after and 3 hour after the start of hemodialysis, and immediately after hemodialysis&#xD;
      to measure circulating levels of nifedipine and the corresponding time points on the next&#xD;
      hemodialysis-free day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 24-hour ABPM is performed in each enrolled patient on the day of hemodialysis. The&#xD;
      monitoring is started at 08:00 h when the drugs are given. The device is programmed to&#xD;
      measure blood pressure every 30 min (from 08:00 h to 21:00 h) and every 60 min (from 21:00 h&#xD;
      to 08:00 h).&#xD;
