  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Everolimus indirectly inhibits angiogenesis by reducing VEGF production. VEGF can be&#xD;
      non-invasively visualized and quantified with serial 89Zr-bevacizumab PET imaging in&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a decline in VEGF early during everolimus treatment in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma predicts treatment efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      89Zr-bevacizumab PET scans will be performed at baseline, after 2 and 6 weeks of everolimus&#xD;
      treatment in 14 adult patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;

      Background of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of renal cell carcinomas (RCC) is characterized by profound angiogenesis because&#xD;
      of inactivation of the Von Hippel Lindau gene. Angiogenesis inhibitors are established first&#xD;
      line treatment options in the metastatic setting. Patients with progressive disease during or&#xD;
      after treatment with angiogenesis inhibitors can benefit from treatment with everolimus, an&#xD;
      oral mTOR inhibitor that resulted in doubling of progression free survival in a phase III&#xD;
      study. Currently it is not possible to predict which patient will benefit from treatment with&#xD;
      mTOR inhibitors. A predictive biomarker for efficacy of mTOR inhibitors is urgently needed as&#xD;
      it may spare the patients unnecessary side effects, safes costs for the society as mTOR&#xD;
      inhibitors are very expensive agents, and may speed up research on new drugs, drug&#xD;
      combinations and drug dosing. One of the actions of mTOR inhibitors is blockage of production&#xD;
      of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and this is thought to be the primary mechanism&#xD;
      that is responsible for antitumor activity in RCC. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      non-invasive measurement of VEGF in the tumour and its surroundings by 89Zr-bevacizumab PET&#xD;
      imaging before and shortly after start of everolimus is a good readout of efficacy of&#xD;
      everolimus in patients with RCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of 89Zr-bevacizumab PET&#xD;
      imaging as a biomarker before and during treatment with everolimus in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic RCC. 89Zr-bevacizumab PET imaging will be regarded a promising biomarker if uptake&#xD;
      changes after institution of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study for evaluation of 89Zr-bevacizumab PET imaging as a biomarker during&#xD;
      treatment with everolimus in patients with mRCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      89Zr-bevacizumab PET imaging will be performed before start of treatment and after 2 and 6&#xD;
      weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      14 patients who will start treatment with everolimus for metastatic RCC will be included in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is change in 89Zr-bevacizumab uptake in tumor lesions between the&#xD;
      baseline scan and the scan during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study parameters The secondary endpoint is progressive disease according to&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, after 3 months of treatment.&#xD;
      Progression is defined as the appearance of new disease or an increase of 20% in the sum of&#xD;
      the longest diameters of the target lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be intravenously injected at 3 time points with 37MBq resulting in a cumulative&#xD;
      radiation dose of 54 mSv. According to ICRP 62 this radiation dose falls in category III&#xD;
      (moderate risk).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Life expectancy of the patients is limited because of their incurable renal cell carcinoma,&#xD;
      making the risk of development of a secondary malignancy clinically likely not relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients have to pay 3 extra visits to the hospital for tracer injection. PET scans will be&#xD;
      performed on regular visit days. Blood samples for biomarkers will be drawn during routine&#xD;
      blood investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no direct benefit for the patients in this study. If 89Zr-bevacizumab PET imaging&#xD;
      however is a predictive biomarker for angiogenesis inhibitors, many patients can be spared&#xD;
      unnecessary side effects and society can be spared costs of futile treatment in the future.&#xD;
