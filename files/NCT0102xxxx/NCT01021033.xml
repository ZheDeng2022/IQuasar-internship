      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stroke, also known as acute cerebrovascular attack, is the leading cause of long-term&#xD;
           disability worldwide. Stroke survivors are often left with permanent physical and mental&#xD;
           disabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Many stroke patients receive different therapies in an attempt to improve their&#xD;
           independence and quality of life. However, current strategies are focused on the acute&#xD;
           stage after stroke and are of limited influence in improving stroke outcome. One of the&#xD;
           main problems of patients who have suffered a stroke is the difficulty in using the hand&#xD;
           on the opposite side of the affected hemisphere of the brain; to date, researchers have&#xD;
           no successful means to improve the hand function in chronic stages of stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers are interested in developing a pool of individuals for further research into&#xD;
           hand and motor function after a stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To perform a screening evaluation of patients referred with stroke to determine their&#xD;
      eligibility for current and future protocols studying the effects of stroke on the nervous&#xD;
      system and motor function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals who have experienced a single stroke on only one side of the brain that&#xD;
      occurred at least 3 months prior to participation in the screening study. Individuals must&#xD;
      have some residual hand motor function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in this study will be recruited from patient referrals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will undergo a 4- to 5-hour screening with a medical history,&#xD;
           physical and neurological examination, stroke evaluation, and an anatomical magnetic&#xD;
           resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. The screening visit may be done over the course of&#xD;
           more than one day, if needed for patient convenience or test availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition to the initial outpatient visit, subjects may remain enrolled in this study&#xD;
           for up to 15 years and may be contacted to see if they qualify for new branch studies.&#xD;
           Subjects may be re-examined up to once per year while they remain in this protocol to&#xD;
           confirm ongoing eligibility. The re-examination visits will involve a neurologic&#xD;
           evaluation and possible repeat MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No clinical care will be provided under this protocol..&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is intended to identify stroke patients for the studies investigating parameters&#xD;
      of peripheral and central nervous system stimulation, possible combination of behavioral&#xD;
      parameters, and physical therapy to enhance motor recovery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is to perform a screening evaluation of patients referred with&#xD;
      stroke to determine their eligibility for current and future protocols aimed at understanding&#xD;
      the mechanisms underlying plastic changes in the human central nervous system after brain&#xD;
      lesions like stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measure is the number of subjects who are eligible to subsequently enroll in HCPS&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to Twelve hundred adult patients with history of stroke that occurred at least three&#xD;
      months prior to participation and meeting the eligibility criteria, below will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol utilizes the NIH Clinical Center Outpatient Clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      15 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One main screening visit that may be remote, in-person or both lasting approximately 4-5&#xD;
      hours with periodic optional return visits as needed.&#xD;
