      Subjects who eventually undergo treatment for HCV, we will gather treatment data (start and&#xD;
      stop dates), and repeat CB-CAP analysis at weeks 4, 12, 24 and 72 (+/- 2 week window allowed&#xD;
      at each time point) to determine whether CB-CAPs levels predict virologic response in treated&#xD;
      subjects. Routine laboratory data will also be collected at these time points.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit consecutive HCV infected subjects from the Center for Liver&#xD;
      Diseases (CLD) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) who are scheduled to&#xD;
      undergo a liver biopsy as part of their routine clinical care. The liver biopsies will be&#xD;
      read concurrently by a single study pathologist who is blinded to the subjects' clinical&#xD;
      status. At the time of liver biopsy, blood will be drawn to perform CB-CAP assays. The CB-CAP&#xD;
      levels will be correlated with the liver biopsy result to assess their ability to predict&#xD;
      degree of liver injury. The investigators will retrieve labs done for routine clinical care&#xD;
      closest to the time of liver biopsy, including complete blood count, serum aminotransferase&#xD;
      levels, and a biochemical profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 250 subjects will be recruited for this study. Data gathered would include&#xD;
      demographic and clinical information, risk factors for HCV, information about drug and&#xD;
      alcohol use and anthropometric measurements (height, weight, abdominal circumference, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the subset of subjects who are then initiated on treatment for HCV by their healthcare&#xD;
      providers, we will gather treatment information (start date, stop date, treatment regimen and&#xD;
      dosage, etc.) and blood will be drawn at treatment weeks 4, 12, 24 and 72 (+/- 2 week window&#xD;
      allowed at each time point) to determine whether CB-CAPs levels predict virologic response in&#xD;
      treated subjects. Routine laboratory data will also be collected at these time points. The&#xD;
      +/- 2 week time window is allowed so that the blood draw can be done at a routine clinical&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Able to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed HCV infection by standard antibody testing any time prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Detectable HCV RNA in routine clinical testing any time prior to enrolment (since our&#xD;
             aim is to determine the correlation between CB-CAPs and histologic activity in chronic&#xD;
             HCV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undergoing liver biopsy as part of their routine clinical care&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any previous treatment for HCV&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other chronic or active liver disease that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             can affect liver histology (history of alcohol use in itself will not be an exclusion&#xD;
             criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV coinfection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic Hepatitis B infection (HBsAg+ or HBeAg+ or HBV DNA+ upon last testing)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute Hepatitis A infection (HAV IgM+ upon last testing)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of medications that may cause increase in serum aminotransferase levels (e.g. HMG&#xD;
             co-A reductase inhibitors, anti-epileptics, etc.) within 30 days prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any chronic or active inflammatory disease that may potentially be associated with&#xD;
             higher inflammatory markers (examples include, but not limited to: tuberculosis,&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease, pneumonia, autoimmune disease)&#xD;
