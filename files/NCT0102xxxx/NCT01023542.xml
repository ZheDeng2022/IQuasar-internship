      The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate efficacy and safety of delayed introduction&#xD;
      (up to 30 days post-transplantation in patients without signs of acute rejection that had&#xD;
      received an aIL-2 induction and MMF) of either cyclosporine or everolimus versus a 5-day&#xD;
      delay of cyclosporine in combination with MMF.&#xD;

      The risk of developing chronic renal failure after liver transplantation (LT) in the pre-MELD&#xD;
      era was approximately 20% after 5 years, associated with the use of CNI and a 4-fold&#xD;
      increased mortality risk. Besides pre-transplant factors associated with end-stage hepatic&#xD;
      disease that influence renal function (hepatorenal syndrome [HRS]), there are major risk&#xD;
      factors associated with early post-transplant renal impairment: preexisting diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, time on the waiting list with end-stage hepatic disease, requirement for blood&#xD;
      products, liver allograft dysfunction, HCV-infection and toxicity of Calcineurin-inhibitors&#xD;
      (CNI) (1-8). The introduction of the MELD-based allocation system in the Eurotransplant area&#xD;
      in December 2006 led to an increase of the proportion of liver transplant recipients with&#xD;
      renal dysfunction before and at the time of liver transplantation (LT), since creatinine&#xD;
      became a key component for the allocation of liver allografts (9). Data from 2 recent&#xD;
      publications indicate an incidence of pre-transplant renal impairment with an eGFR ≤&#xD;
      60ml/min. of approximately 50%. Renal impairment and MELD-scores ≥ 24 as well as the&#xD;
      requirement for renal replacement therapy before LT result in a significantly unfavorable&#xD;
      outcome after LT (10,11). An additional problem in this specific patient group (impaired&#xD;
      renal function at the time of LT and MELD-scores ≥ 25), is a high risk for developing&#xD;
      infectious complications (12). Studies indicate that early infections are present in almost&#xD;
      85% of all patients, and become the most common cause of death early after transplantation.&#xD;
      Notably, two-third of infections in liver transplant patients occur within the first 3 months&#xD;
      after transplantation with a very high percentage (67%) of severe infections (13,14). In&#xD;
      general, the inflammatory response associated with infection is impaired by immunosuppressive&#xD;
      drugs. This disturbed regulation increases the susceptibility for a broad range of normal and&#xD;
      of opportunistic infections (15). Therefore, patients with high lab-MELD scores&#xD;
      hypothetically should require a rather low amount of immunosuppressive (IS) drugs during the&#xD;
      first days to weeks after transplantation, while they are in a state of SIRS (systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response syndrome)-like state (16,17). In Regensburg a collective of 30 patients&#xD;
      with renal impairment (creatinine of 1.5 g/dL or higher and/or eGFR of 50 ml/min or lower) at&#xD;
      the time point of LT, or on day 1 after LT, was treated with either standard CNI + MMF +&#xD;
      basiliximab + steroids (control-arm; group 2) or with a CNI-free protocol consisting of MMF +&#xD;
      basiliximab + steroids (treatment-arm; group 1). Baseline renal function was similar: serum&#xD;
      creatinine (SCr) median 1.8 mg/dL (1.5 to 4.0 mg/dL) (group A) vs. 2.4 mg/dL (1.5 to 4.0&#xD;
      mg/dL) (group B) [p=0.24]. Results from our retrospective case-control study show that the&#xD;
      cumulative requirement for renal replacement therapy was significantly lower in group B&#xD;
      (p=0.032). Ten of 15 patients received additional immunosuppression (4 CNI and 6 mTOR&#xD;
      inhibitor) beyond day 30. By month 6 (1.3 mg/dL vs. 1.1 mg/dL) and month 12 (1.6 mg/dL vs.&#xD;
      1.2 mg/dL), group B patients showed significantly better SCr (and eGFR) values than group A&#xD;
      (p=0.006). Rates of BPAR were similar, but pulmonary complications were higher in group A&#xD;
      resulting in a significantly longer stay on ICU (9 vs. 21 days; p=0.04). The investigators&#xD;
      concluded from this collective that CNI-free-&quot;bottom-up&quot; immunosuppression in severely ill&#xD;
      patients with renal impairment prior to LT is feasible and may be an innovative approach to&#xD;
      improve outcome (18). Based on these initial findings the investigators initiated a&#xD;
      prospective uncontrolled two-step pilot-trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      CNI-free de novo &quot;bottom-up&quot; immunosuppression in patients undergoing LT with existing renal&#xD;
      impairment (PATRON07-study, clinicaltrials.gov-identifier: NCT00604357) (19). In the first&#xD;
      step of this pilot trial, nine patients were treated with MMF 2x1g i.v./day, including&#xD;
      induction therapy with basiliximab 20 mg i.v. on days 0 and 4, and center-specific steroids;&#xD;
      sirolimus was introduced into the regimen at least 10 days after LT. The primary endpoint was&#xD;
      the incidence of steroid-resistant biopsy-proven acute rejections at 30 days after&#xD;
      transplantation, as an early detector of safety and efficacy. Analysis of the first nine&#xD;
      patients confirmed our findings in the retrospective analysis summarized in section 2.1. Only&#xD;
      one biopsy proven acute rejection occurred. No patient lost their allograft, and no patient&#xD;
      died within one year after LT. Renal function improved significantly from baseline to 30&#xD;
      days, and to 3 and 6 months after transplantation (p=0.004). At 3 and 6 months, 72% of all&#xD;
      patients were still CNI-free. All side-effects observed were expected for treatment with&#xD;
      mTOR-inhibitors. Although the median lab MELD-score at baseline was 29 (range: 10 to 40), and&#xD;
      the initial Karnowsky-index was 20 (range: 10 to 80), patients recovered quite quickly and&#xD;
      had a Karnowsky-index of 60 (range: 20 to 80) at day 30 and 80 (range: 50 to 100) at 3 months&#xD;
      after LT. These findings indicate the feasibility of CNI-free de novo &quot;bottom-up&quot; IS without&#xD;
      increased risk for acute rejection, graft-loss and mortality but a beneficial impact on&#xD;
      short- and long-term renal function as independent risk-factor for long-term mortality after&#xD;
      LT.&#xD;
