  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of a natural health product, as compared&#xD;
      to placebo (an inactive substance), in managing the symptoms of ADHD. The natural health&#xD;
      product contains the nutrients zinc, magnesium, vitamin B6 and vitamin C. Each of these&#xD;
      nutrients has some evidence to suggest that children with ADHD might be lacking them. As&#xD;
      such, children with ADHD might benefit from supplementing their diets with these nutrients,&#xD;
      especially ADHD children who have below average levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will measure whether the severity of ADHD symptoms is greater in children with low&#xD;
      levels of zinc, magnesium, and vitamin B6, and whether the severity of ADHD symptoms will&#xD;
      decrease with supplementation of these nutrients. This study will also monitor for any&#xD;
      adverse reactions or side effects from taking these nutrients in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although these natural health products are commercially available, the use of them as a&#xD;
      supplement or placebo in this study has been approved for use in this study by the Natural&#xD;
      Health Products Directorate of Health Canada.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized control, double blinded trial. A population of 30 children&#xD;
      diagnosed with ADHD (n=30) will be randomly assigned to the NHP group (n=15) or a placebo&#xD;
      group (n=15). The NHP group will be provided with a weight-based dose of a chewable natural&#xD;
      health product containing zinc, magnesium, vitamin B6 and vitamin C for 10 weeks, with an&#xD;
      additional follow-up post intervention at 20 weeks. The placebo group will be administered a&#xD;
      chewable placebo tablet and will follow the same regimen. Severity of ADHD symptoms will be&#xD;
      measured at baseline, week 5 and week 10 using the Connor-3 Parent and SNAP-IV validated&#xD;
      questionnaires. Nutritional status will be monitored at baseline and week 10 for changes in&#xD;
      serum zinc and erythrocyte magnesium. Children will be monitored for any adverse reactions&#xD;
      that may occur using the investigational product.Following the informed consent process,&#xD;
      participants will undergo a structured psychiatric interview prior to enrollment and will&#xD;
      have 4 30 minute study visits and 2 10 minute telephone calls throughout the study. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be taken 2 times with the use of a topical anesthetic to decrease sensation&#xD;
      during the blood draw. Once enrolled, children can withdraw from the study at any time if&#xD;
      assent to participate is withdrawn.&#xD;
