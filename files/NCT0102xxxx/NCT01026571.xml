  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BAVgenetics is a partnership between Investigators at Boston University, Brigham and Women's&#xD;
      Hospital, and Massachusetts General Hospital dedicated to discovering the genetic causes of&#xD;
      bicuspid aortic valve disease and associated aortic disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators at BAVgenetics are dedicated to discovering the mechanisms of bicuspid&#xD;
      aortic valve disease and why individual genetics seem to play such an important role in&#xD;
      generation of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have, or have had, a bicuspid aortic valve, we seek your help in this effort by&#xD;
      volunteering to donate DNA to the BAV Registry, so that this disease can be better understood&#xD;
      and therapies for it can be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BAV Registry is comprised of patients who have donated DNA collected from saliva (spit)&#xD;
      and have provided us with personal health information that tells us about their bicuspid&#xD;
      aortic valve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals in the Registry have signed the consent form, filled out the medical history&#xD;
      questionnaire and the authorization form, and provided DNA via our saliva sample kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will send you the requisite forms so that you receive the most up-to-date information&#xD;
      about the study as older forms may be outdated. We also need paper copies of the forms;&#xD;
      therefore, we send all the forms via ground mail along with a pre-paid return envelope for&#xD;
      your convenience.&#xD;

        The investigators wish to identify genetic variation that is associated with BAV in&#xD;
        Americans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a diagnosis of bicuspid aortic valve will be enrolled. Patients who have had&#xD;
        their bicuspid aortic valve previously replaced will also be enrolled. Relatives of&#xD;
        patients with a diagnosis of bicuspid aortic valve are also welcomed to be enrolled&#xD;
        regardless if they have BAV or not, as it is helpful to examine the DNA of first degree&#xD;
        relatives.&#xD;
