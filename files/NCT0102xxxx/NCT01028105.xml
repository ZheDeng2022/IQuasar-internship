  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of pre-surgical patients who are MRSA&#xD;
      carriers. From an evidence-based practice perspective, findings from this study can be&#xD;
      considered in the evaluation of the hospital SOP mandating pre-surgical MRSA screening&#xD;
      requirements for patients with scheduled surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis to be addressed in this study is whether the MRSA colonization and&#xD;
      subsequent post-operative infection are the equivalent in these populations.&#xD;

      Design and Methods: Subjects in this study of 975 pre-operative, scheduled surgical patients&#xD;
      are in one of the three following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 (N=325): Allocation sample of surgical patients required to be MRSA screened per&#xD;
           hospital SOP (including patients having a positive MRSA history, orthopedic surgery,&#xD;
           undergoing dialysis, or transfer from another hospital, nursing home, skilled nursing&#xD;
           facility, or jail).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 (N=650): Randomized sample (1:1 ratio) of surgical patients not required to be&#xD;
           MRSA screened per hospital SOP, to one of the following two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  2a (N=325): MRSA screening; or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  2b (N=325): No MRSA screening. All subjects were followed for 30 days&#xD;
                post-operatively to determine the incidence of post-operative infection. Treatment,&#xD;
                diagnostic, and hospitalization data were collected for patients diagnosed with&#xD;
                post-operative infection.&#xD;
