      This study is an open label non randomized study of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with histone&#xD;
      deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Vorinostat in patients with advanced solid tumors to determine&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be at least 16 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed non-hematological malignancy. Patients&#xD;
             must have received and failed standard treatment for their malignancy; patients for&#xD;
             whom no standard treatment is available will also be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an ECOG PS at 0, 1, or 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate hematologic, renal and liver function (i.e. absolute&#xD;
             Neutrophil count &gt; 1000/mm3, platelets &gt; 75,000/mm3); creatinine&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  2 times the upper limits of normal (ULN) total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dl, ALT and AST&#xD;
                  £ 3 times above the upper limits of the institutional norm ALT, AST can be &lt; 5&#xD;
                  times upper limits of normal if patients have hepatic involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with the potential for pregnancy or impregnating their partner must agree to&#xD;
             follow acceptable birth control methods to avoid conception. Women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential must have a negative pregnancy test. The anti-proliferative activity of this&#xD;
             experimental drug may be harmful to the developing fetus or nursing infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete supportive and palliative care will continue to be provided to ameliorate&#xD;
             signs and symptoms that were pre-existing or may arise while on study and which do not&#xD;
             interfere with the objectives of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor blocks available from previous surgery/biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        At the tumor specific expansion, only patients with metastatic colorectal and renal cell&#xD;
        cancers will be enrolled. Patients with metastatic colorectal and renal cancer must have&#xD;
        been treated and progressed or intolerant to standard care therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with colorectal cancer must been treated in the past with Irinotecan and/or&#xD;
        Oxaliplatin and/or AvastinIEGFR therapy or intolerant to these agents. No more than 4 lines&#xD;
        of therapy permitted in the metastatic setting. Patients with colorectal cancer may enroll&#xD;
        irrespective of K-Ras mutational status, although this will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with renal cell cancer must have been treated with a VEGF targeted therapy and/or&#xD;
        mTOR inhibitor. No more than 4 lines of therapy permitted in the metastatic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior treatment with Vorinostat and HCQ are not permitted in each tumor type.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Due to risk of disease exacerbation patients with porphyria are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Due to risk of disease exacerbation patients with psoriasis are ineligible unless the&#xD;
             disease is well controlled and they are under the care of a specialist for the&#xD;
             disorder who agrees to monitor the patient for exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with previously documented macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             Nitrosoureas or Mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events to ≤ grade 1 due to agents administered more than 4&#xD;
             weeks earlier. For targeted therapies patients will need to clear for 5 half lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should not have taken valproic acid or another histone deacetylase inhibitor&#xD;
             for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to vorinostat or HCQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery or significant traumatic injury occurring within 21 days prior to&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

             symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  QTc &gt; 500 ms at baseline (average of 3 determinations at 10 minutes interval).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication or a&#xD;
             requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption, or&#xD;
             active peptic ulcer disease. Patients with NJ, J or G tube will not be allowed to&#xD;
             participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because SAHA has the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known hepatitis B or C or HIV infection.&#xD;
