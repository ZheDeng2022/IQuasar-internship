    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multi-center, competitive enrollment and dose-escalation&#xD;
      study of ALT-801 combined with cisplatin. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, determine the Maximum-Tolerated Dose (MTD), and characterize the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      profile of ALT-801 given with cisplatin in patients who are chemotherapy naïve and have&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma that is considered surgically incurable. The anti-tumor responses of&#xD;
      ALT-801 with cisplatin will also be assessed in this trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most current cancer treatment strategies involve the use of chemotherapeutic or biological&#xD;
      drugs that exhibit variable efficacy and considerable toxicity. The limitations are often the&#xD;
      result of the adverse side effects of the therapeutic drug on normal tissues. One approach to&#xD;
      control these effects is to target the therapy to the tumor site. Of the identified tumor&#xD;
      antigens, the human p53 tumor suppressor protein is overexpressed in a wide range of human&#xD;
      malignancies. p53 is an intracellular tumor suppressor protein that acts to arrest the&#xD;
      proliferation of cells. When mutated, it loses its ability to suppress abnormal proliferation&#xD;
      and exhibits a longer half-life than the wild-type protein, allowing for its accumulation in&#xD;
      tumors. In addition, p53 overexpression correlates with tumor transformation and aggression&#xD;
      and is associated with lower overall survival rates and resistance to chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      intervention in cancer patients. Therefore, p53 appears to be a marker for a considerable&#xD;
      number of human malignancies and represents a good target for immunotherapeutics. However,&#xD;
      p53 cannot be used as a target for antibodies because it is not displayed independently on&#xD;
      the cell surface. Instead, the p53 protein is processed intracellularly into peptide&#xD;
      fragments that are then displayed on the cell surface in the context of MHC. These&#xD;
      peptide/MHC complexes are recognized by T-cells via their T-cell receptors (TCRs). Recently&#xD;
      it has been confirmed that a p53 peptide fragment is significantly elevated in a wide range&#xD;
      of human tumor tissues, particularly in melanoma, renal, lung, breast, colorectal, and&#xD;
      osteosarcoma cancers. As a result, the feasibility of using soluble TCRs to target therapies&#xD;
      against tumor cells that overexpress p53 is being investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a well-characterized growth factor for immune effector cells which&#xD;
      play critical roles in tumor control and rejection. As a result, recombinant human IL-2&#xD;
      (e.g., Proleukin®, Chiron Novartis) has been approved for treatment of metastatic melanoma&#xD;
      and renal cell carcinoma. IL-2 treatment provides significant benefit to a subset of patients&#xD;
      with some maintaining durable responses for over ten years post-treatment. However, the major&#xD;
      drawbacks of IL-2 therapy are its limited half-life and severe systemic toxicity. Hence, the&#xD;
      use of high dose IL-2 is limited to specialized programs with experienced personnel, and it&#xD;
      is generally offered to patients who are responsive and have excellent organ function. The&#xD;
      low dose IL-2 treatment, while less toxic and more convenient, produces lower response rates&#xD;
      and appears to be less effective in treating metastatic tumors. Thus, there is a critical&#xD;
      need for innovative strategies that enhance the effects of IL-2 or reduce its toxicity&#xD;
      without compromising clinical benefit. Targeted approaches to concentrate therapeutic&#xD;
      cytokines, such as IL-2, at the tumor sites that express p53 could provide considerable&#xD;
      advantages over current treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug, ALT-801, is a biologic compound composed of interleukin-2 (IL-2) genetically&#xD;
      fused to a humanized soluble T-cell receptor directed against the p53-derived peptides&#xD;
      expressed on tumor cells. This study is to evaluate whether directing IL-2 activity using&#xD;
      ALT-801 to the patient's tumor sites that overexpress p53 results in clinical benefits if the&#xD;
      ALT-801 treatment is given with cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platinum-based analogues including cisplatin, alone or in combination with other&#xD;
      chemotherapies, have been shown to be active in patients with metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
      Additionally, it is known that cisplatin, an alkylating agent known to inhibit DNA synthesis&#xD;
      of dividing cells, triggers increased intracellular level of p53. The synergistic effects of&#xD;
      cisplatin and ALT-801 treatment may induce cisplatin-mediated increases in p53 peptide&#xD;
      display on the tumors and subsequently enhance tumor targeting of ALT-801.&#xD;
