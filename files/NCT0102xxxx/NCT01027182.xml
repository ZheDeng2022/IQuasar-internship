      The investigators hypothesize that the concentration-time profile of raltegravir is different&#xD;
      in cells than that in plasma. Intracellular raltegravir concentrations may be higher and its&#xD;
      half-life longer than in plasma. This may explain the efficacy of raltegravir despite&#xD;
      variable plasma concentrations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In less than 15 years, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has reached the level of&#xD;
      a pandemic, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been reported in over 190&#xD;
      countries. By the end of 2001, more than 30 million people were infected with HIV worldwide,&#xD;
      with approximately one million of those infected residing in North America and one million&#xD;
      residing in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant advances have been made in the treatment of HIV disease. The nucleoside reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase inhibitors provided the earliest therapeutic intervention for HIV infection.&#xD;
      This class of antiretroviral agents interferes with the replication of HIV by competitive&#xD;
      inhibition of the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme and by chain termination of new HIV DNA&#xD;
      into which the nucleoside analogue has been incorporated. Subsequent development of other&#xD;
      potent drug classes, such as non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease&#xD;
      inhibitors, has made possible the use of multidrug, multiclass regimens that can achieve&#xD;
      durable suppression of HIV replication. However, extensive resistance has developed to these&#xD;
      classes of drugs, necessitating the development of other potent classes of antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The integrase inhibitors are a new class of antiretroviral drugs. They inhibit the catalytic&#xD;
      activity of HIV integrase, an HIV encoded enzyme that is required for viral replication.&#xD;
      Inhibition of integrase prevents the covalent insertion, or integration, of unintegrated&#xD;
      linear HIV DNA into the host cell genome preventing the formation of the HIV provirus. The&#xD;
      provirus is required to direct the production of progeny virus, so inhibiting integration&#xD;
      prevents propagation of the viral infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Raltegravir (RAL) is a newly approved HIV integrase inhibitor. It is approved in salvage&#xD;
      regimens(Merck &amp;Co Inc. 2007) and shows promise in first line therapy. Raltegravir is potent&#xD;
      in vitro; concentrations of 31 Â± 20 nM resulted in 95% inhibition (EC95) of viral spread&#xD;
      (relative to an untreated virus-infected culture) in human T-lymphoid cell cultures infected&#xD;
      with the cell-line adapted HIV-1 variant H9IIIB. In addition, raltegravir at concentrations&#xD;
      of 6 to 50 nM resulted in 95% inhibition of viral spread in cultures of mitogen-activated&#xD;
      human peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with diverse, primary clinical isolates of&#xD;
      HIV-1, including isolates resistant to reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease&#xD;
      inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RAL plasma concentrations are highly variable even after controlling for food intake and&#xD;
      UGT1A1*28 polymorphisms. Despite this variability, RAL remains efficacious and studies have&#xD;
      shown little correlation between various RAL pharmacokinetic parameters and efficacy(Wenning,&#xD;
      Hwang et al. 2008). This suggests that although RAL exposure may be important, plasma&#xD;
      concentrations may not the best marker of RAL exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RAL exerts its effects in the HIV-infected cells where it inhibits the HIV integrase.&#xD;
      Therefore intracellular concentrations should correlate with efficacy much more than plasma&#xD;
      concentrations. It is possible that RAL could accumulate inside HIV-infected cells or that&#xD;
      intracellular concentrations could be less variable, explaining the sustained efficacy of RAL&#xD;
      despite variable plasma concentrations. Intracellular half-life could also be longer than the&#xD;
      relatively short plasma half-life. This information could be used to justify once daily&#xD;
      administration of RAL, just as zidovudine dosing was changed from five times to twice daily&#xD;
      because intracellular zidovudine triphosphate had a much longer half-life than plasma&#xD;
      zidovudine(Barry, Khoo et al. 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of intracellular raltegravir could also aid in therapeutic drug monitoring and&#xD;
      assessing drug-drug interactions. For example, rifampin reduces plasma concentration of RAL&#xD;
      by almost 50%(Wenning, Hanley et al. 2009). However, dose increases may not be necessary if&#xD;
      intracellular concentrations are maintained, as is thought to be true for zidovudine after&#xD;
      rifampin co-administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, there has been no data on intracellular raltegravir. We therefore aim to&#xD;
      measure the time course of RAL intracellular concentrations after a single dose in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
