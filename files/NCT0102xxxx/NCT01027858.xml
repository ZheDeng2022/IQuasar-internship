    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a proof-of-concept study to provide preliminary evidence of&#xD;
      efficacy of aerobic-based exercise training for maintaining cognitive function, executive&#xD;
      function, and everyday function in adults with mild vascular cognitive impairment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 70 adults diagnosed with Ischaemic Vascular Cognitive Impairment (SIVCI) will be&#xD;
      randomized to either a 6 month thrice weekly walking program or usual care. After 6 months of&#xD;
      intervention, they will be followed for an additional 6 months. There will be three&#xD;
      measurement sessions: baseline, 6 months (end of intervention period); and 12 months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The study will specifically recruit individuals who fulfill the diagnostic criteria for&#xD;
        SIVCI as outlined by Erkinjuntti and colleagues (1), which requires the presence of both&#xD;
        cognitive syndrome (as defined in Section A below) and small vessel ischaemic disease (as&#xD;
        defined in Section B below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Cognitive Syndrome defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Dysexecutive Syndrome: Some impairment in goal formulation, initiation, planning,&#xD;
             organizing, sequencing, executing, set-shifting and maintenance, or abstracting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Memory Deficit: Some impairment in recall, relative intact recognition, less severe&#xD;
             forgetting, benefit from cues.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Progression: Deterioration of A1 and A2 from a previous higher level of functioning&#xD;
             that are not per se interfering with complex occupational and social activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. Small Vessel Ischaemic Disease defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Evidence of relevant cerebrovascular disease by brain imaging (in the last 12 months)&#xD;
             defined as the presence of both:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. Periventricular and deep white matter lesions: Patchy areas of low attenuation&#xD;
             (intermediate density between that of normal white matter and that of intraventricular&#xD;
             cerebro-spinal fluid) or diffuse symmetrical areas of low attenuation with ill defined&#xD;
             margins extending to the centrum semiovale plus at least one lacunar infarct&#xD;
             (correlating to the white matter grading scale greater than 3 from the Cardiovascular&#xD;
             Health Study) (2,3); and ii. Absence of cortical and/or cortico-sub-cortical&#xD;
             non-lacunar territorial infarcts and watershed infarcts, haemorrhages indicating large&#xD;
             vessel disease, signs of normal pressure hydrocephalus, or other specific causes of&#xD;
             white matter lesions (e.g., multiple sclerosis, leukodystrophies, sarcoidosis, brain&#xD;
             irradiation, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence or a history of neurological signs as evidence for cerebrovascular disease&#xD;
             such as hemiparesis, lower facial weakness, Babinski sign, sensory deficit,&#xD;
             dysarthria, gait disorder, extrapyramidal signs consistent with sub-cortical brain&#xD;
             lesion(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, individuals must meet the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (4) score less than 26 at screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. MMSE (5) score of &gt; 20 at screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Community-dwelling;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Lives in Metro Vancouver;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have a caregiver, family member, or friend who interacts with him/her on a weekly&#xD;
             basis;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, and other trial procedures;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must be able to read, write, and speak English in which psychometric tests are&#xD;
             provided with acceptable visual and auditory acuity;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Stable on a fixed dose of cognitive medications (e.g., donepezil, galantamine,&#xD;
             rivastigmine, memantine, etc.) that is not expected to change during the 12-month&#xD;
             study period, or, if they are not on any of these medications, they are not expected&#xD;
             to start them during the 12-month study period;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Provide a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the&#xD;
             individual (or a legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all pertinent&#xD;
             aspects of the trial. In addition, an assent form will be provided at baseline and&#xD;
             again at regular intervals;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Able to walk independently; and&#xD;
&#xD;

             (e.g., multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, etc.) that affects cognition and&#xD;
             mobility;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At high risk for cardiac complications during exercise and/or unable to self-regulate&#xD;
             activity or to understand recommended activity level (i.e., Class C of the American&#xD;
             Heart Risk Stratification Criteria);&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have clinically significant peripheral neuropathy or severe musculoskeletal or joint&#xD;
             disease that impairs mobility;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Taking medications that may negatively affect cognitive function, such as&#xD;
             anticholinergics, including agents with pronounced anticholinergic properties (e.g.,&#xD;
             amitriptyline), major tranquilizers (typical and atypical antipsychotics), and&#xD;
             anticonvulsants (e.g., gabapentin, valproic acid, etc.); or&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Individual who plans to participate or is enrolled in a clinical drug trial concurrent&#xD;
             to this study.&#xD;
