      RATIONALE: Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the&#xD;
      tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing&#xD;
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving stereotactic body radiation therapy&#xD;
      together with gemcitabine hydrochloride may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy when given with or without gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer that can be removed by surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate the feasibility and safety of administering margin-intensive stereotactic&#xD;
           body radiotherapy together with preoperative gemcitabine hydrochloride to patients with&#xD;
           resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of gemcitabine hydrochloride. Patients&#xD;
      receive 1 of 2 treatment regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regimen 1: Patients undergo a single fraction of margin-intensive stereotactic body&#xD;
           radiotherapy (SBRT) on day 1. Patients undergo pancreatoduodenectomy between days 15-43.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regimen 2: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8,&#xD;
           and 15. Patients undergo a single fraction of SBRT between days 21-28 followed by&#xD;
           pancreatoduodenectomy between days 35-63.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.&#xD;
