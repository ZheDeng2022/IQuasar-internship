      OBJECTIVE(S): Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety of the intrahepatic reinfusion of increasing numbers of autologous&#xD;
      highly purified CD133+ stem cells (SCs) to patients with end-stage liver disease. Safety will&#xD;
      be evaluated as the incidence of adverse event (graded according to WHO) and clinically&#xD;
      significant abnormal laboratory value following reinfusion of SCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the feasibility of the immunomagnetic selection of autologous CD133+ cells&#xD;
      collected with leukapheresis from the peripheral blood (PB) of patients with end-stage liver&#xD;
      disease, previously mobilized with G-CSF. To assess the effects of the intrahepatic&#xD;
      reinfusion of highly purified CD133+ cells on residual hepatic function of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve patients will be enrolled. At first, G-CSF at 7.5µg/Kg/b.i.d. will be administered&#xD;
      subcutaneously (sc) from day 1 until the completion of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC)&#xD;
      collection. Harvest of bone marrow (BM)-derived PBSC will begin on day + 4 only if the&#xD;
      concentration of CD133+ cells is &gt; 8/uL and will be continued until the collection of the&#xD;
      target cell dose: 0.5 x 106 CD133+ cells/Kg for the first 2 cohorts of patients; 1 x 106&#xD;
      CD133+ cells/Kg for cohort 3 and 2 x 106 CD133+ cells/Kg for cohort 4 (see below for&#xD;
      definitions). PB mononuclear cells obtained from mobilized standard-volume leukapheresis will&#xD;
      be incubated with Macs colloidal superparamagnetic CD133 microbeads and CliniMacs device will&#xD;
      be used for the positive selection of CD133+ cells under good manufacturing practice (GMP)&#xD;
      conditions. Cryopreservation and storage in liquid nitrogen will be performed according to&#xD;
      standard procedures. At least 4 weeks after SC mobilization and collection, up to 40 mL of&#xD;
      single cell suspension of highly purified autologous CD133+ cells, obtained after rapid&#xD;
      thawing, will be infused through the hepatic artery by transfemoral or transbrachial&#xD;
      arteriography. Infusion time will be lower than 15ml/min to avoid thrombi formation. The&#xD;
      entire procedure will be performed under anesthesiological control. According to modified&#xD;
      Fibonacci's increment rule, highly purified G-CSF-mobilized CD133+ cells will be administered&#xD;
      to patients starting from 5x104/Kg patient's body weight and increased every 3 patients. The&#xD;
      maximum infused cell dose will be 1x106/kg. G-CSF at 5µg/Kg/day will be administered sc for 3&#xD;
      days after the reinfusion of SCs (day 0 to day +2).&#xD;

&#xD;
      CLINICAL PHASE: Phase I&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE(S): Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety of the intrahepatic reinfusion of increasing numbers of autologous&#xD;
      highly purified CD133+ stem cells (SCs) to patients with end-stage liver disease. CD133+ SCs&#xD;
      will be previously collected and cryopreserved after mobilization with granulocyte-colony&#xD;
      stimulating factor (G-CSF) and leukapheresis. Safety will be evaluated as the incidence of&#xD;
      adverse event (graded according to WHO) and clinically significant abnormal laboratory value&#xD;
      following reinfusion of SCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the feasibility of the immunomagnetic selection of autologous CD133+ cells&#xD;
      collected with leukapheresis from the peripheral blood (PB) of patients with end-stage liver&#xD;
      disease, previously mobilized with G-CSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effects of the intrahepatic reinfusion of highly purified CD133+ cells on&#xD;
      residual hepatic function of the patients. In particular, the following values will be&#xD;
      monitored: synthesis of proteins (albumin), synthesis of factors of the coagulation&#xD;
      (prothrombin time, INR, fibrinogen, antithrombin III, thromboplastin time), bilirubinemia,&#xD;
      proliferative activity, biosynthetic capacity (cholesterol, pseudocholinesterase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effects of the treatment on the production of selected cytokines during the&#xD;
      administration of G-CSF and after the intrahepatic reinfusion of highly purified CD133+ SCs&#xD;
      to patients with end-stage liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve patients will be enrolled within 18-24 months in the dose-finding phase. The study has&#xD;
      been designed as follows: at first, G-CSF (Lenograstim, Aventis Pharma or Filgrastim, Amgen)&#xD;
      at 7.5µg/Kg/b.i.d. will be administered subcutaneously (sc) from day 1 until the completion&#xD;
      of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) collection. Harvest of bone marrow (BM)-derived PBSC&#xD;
      will begin on day + 4 only if the concentration of CD133+ cells is &gt; 8/uL and will be&#xD;
      continued until the collection of the target cell dose: 0.5 x 106 CD133+ cells/Kg for the&#xD;
      first 2 cohorts of patients; 1 x 106 CD133+ cells/Kg for cohort 3 and 2 x 106 CD133+ cells/Kg&#xD;
      for cohort 4 (see below for definitions). PB mononuclear cells obtained from mobilized&#xD;
      standard-volume leukapheresis will be incubated with Macs colloidal superparamagnetic CD133&#xD;
      microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and CliniMacs device will be used&#xD;
      for the positive selection of CD133+ cells under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions&#xD;
      (see attachments). Cryopreservation and storage in liquid nitrogen will be performed&#xD;
      according to standard procedures (see attachments).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 4 weeks after SC mobilization and collection, up to 40 mL of single cell suspension&#xD;
      of highly purified autologous CD133+ cells, obtained after rapid thawing, will be infused&#xD;
      through the hepatic artery by transfemoral or transbrachial arteriography. Infusion time will&#xD;
      be lower than 15ml/min to avoid thrombi formation. The entire procedure will be performed&#xD;
      under anesthesiological control. The intrahepatic route of administration is deemed necessary&#xD;
      to avoid the potential massive spleen trapping of CD133+ cells after conventional intravenous&#xD;
      reinfusion in cirrhotic patients. Within 24 hours from the procedure, a doppler&#xD;
      ultrasonography of the celiac trunk will be performed to exclude thrombotic events of the&#xD;
      mesenteric district.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to modified Fibonacci's increment rule, highly purified G-CSF-mobilized CD133+&#xD;
      cells will be administered to patients starting from 5x104/Kg patient's body weight and&#xD;
      increased every 3 patients. The maximum infused cell dose will be 1x106/kg (see below).&#xD;
      Lenograstim or Filgrastim at 5µg/Kg/day will be administered sc for 3 days after the&#xD;
      reinfusion of SCs (day 0 to day +2) for their expansion and to induce a selective&#xD;
      proliferative advantage of reinfused cells in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NUMBER OF PATIENTS AND TIME FRAME: Twelve patients will be enrolled within 18-24 months in&#xD;
      the dose-finding phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIAGNOSIS AND INCLUSION CRITERIA: Signed informed consent. Age &gt;18. Karnofsky score &gt; 70% or&#xD;
      WHO &lt;1. Adequate renal (serum creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dl) and pulmonary (Sat O2 &gt; 96%) function.&#xD;
      Diagnosis of advanced, end-stage liver disease defined by a Mayo Model for End Stage Liver&#xD;
      Disease (MELD) score between 17 and 25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with the following liver disease etiologies will be enrolled in the study: chronic&#xD;
      viral hepatitis B, chronic viral hepatitis C, chronic viral hepatitis D, alcoholic cirrhosis,&#xD;

      clinically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXCLUSION CRITERIA: HIV positivity. Pregnant or nursing females. Current uncontrolled&#xD;

&#xD;
      Budd-Chiari Syndrome with sovrahepatic vein thrombosis and cirrhosis of unknown origin will&#xD;
      not be included in the study.&#xD;
