    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of OPB-31121&#xD;
      that can be given to patients with leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).&#xD;

      The Study Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In studies that have been performed in animals, OPB-31121 has been shown to stop certain&#xD;
      changes to proteins in the body. Stopping these changes may have an effect on tumor cells.&#xD;
      How OPB-31121 works is not fully known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 3 participants enrolled in the study will receive the lowest level of OPB-31121.&#xD;
      Each additional group of 3 or 4 participants will receive a dose level dependent upon how the&#xD;
      previous group responded to the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may have up to 13 study &quot;cycles&quot; (about 273 days). During each 28 day study cycle, you&#xD;
      will receive the study drug for 21 days and then &quot;rest&quot; (no study drug) for 7 days. The cycle&#xD;
      is 28 days, 21 days of drug, 7 days of rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug is a pill that should be taken at the same time each day. You should drink 8&#xD;
      ounces (1 cup) of room temperature, non-carbonated water when you take the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will eat a snack or meal within 30 minutes after taking the study drug. You should remain&#xD;
      sitting upright or standing for at least 30 minutes after taking the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits for AML, ALL, or MDS participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will have the following tests and procedures performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are able to have children will have a urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 6 tablespoons total) will be drawn about 10 times. These blood draws will&#xD;
           be for routine tests, heart, thyroid testing, pharmacokinetic (PK) testing, and&#xD;
           genotyping. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time&#xD;
           points. Genotyping tests are tests that look at pieces of your DNA called genes. These&#xD;
           tests will look at some specific genes that may predict how your body may break down&#xD;
           certain types of drugs. A small needle called a &quot;heparin lock&quot; may be inserted into a&#xD;
           vein to make these multiple blood draws easier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 2 of Cycle 1, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for heart, PK, and biomarker&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 8, 15 and 21 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine, heart, and thyroid testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 6 tablespoons total) will also be drawn for PK testing. Blood will be drawn&#xD;
           a total of 10 times, with the last blood draw about 10 hours after you receive the study&#xD;
           drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1/2 tablespoon) will be drawn for biomarker testing (Day 21 only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 22 of Cycle 1, blood (about 1 tablespoon each time) will be drawn 2 times for PK&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 23 of Cycle 1, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn 1 time for PK testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 28 of Cycle 1, you will have the following procedures performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration sample taken to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
           This sample will be taken after you have taken the study drug and only at the end of&#xD;
           each odd cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 2-13, you will have the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-1/2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine, heart, and&#xD;
           thyroid tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are able to have children will have a urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 3 only, blood (less than 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for&#xD;
           biomarker tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a MUGA scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits for CLL or CML participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will have the following tests and procedures performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 8 tablespoons total) will also be drawn a total of 10 times for routine,&#xD;
           heart, thyroid, biomarker, genotyping, and PK testing. The last blood draw will be 24&#xD;
           hours after you receive the study drug (Day 2). A small needle called a &quot;heparin lock&quot;&#xD;
           may be inserted into a vein to make these multiple blood draws easier.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are able to have children will have a urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 2 of Cycle 1, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn 24 hours after your study drug&#xD;
      dose for heart and PK testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1, blood (about 7 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and PK&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 21 of Cycle 1, you will have an ECG. Blood (about 8 tablespoons in total) will be&#xD;
      drawn about 8 times for PK, routine, heart, thyroid, and biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 22 of Cycle 1, blood (about 1 tablespoon each time) will be drawn 2 times for PK&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 23 of Cycle 1, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn 1 time for PK testing.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG and MUGA scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine, heart, thyroid, and biomarker&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are able to have children will have a urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During Cycles 2-3 only, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you are off study, you will have an end-of-study visit. At this visit, the following&#xD;
      tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 7 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine, heart, thyroid, and PK tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you have AML, ALL or MDS, blood (about 1-1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker&#xD;
           testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your doctor or other study staff will call you about 30 days after your final visit to see&#xD;
      how you have been feeling. The phone call will take about 5-10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
