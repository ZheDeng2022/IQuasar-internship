      The objective of this study in cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) was to demonstrate the&#xD;
      preparation of the patient with panic disorder for agoraphobic exposures. The focus of the&#xD;
      work consisted of interoceptive exposures, in vivo, of body sensations themselves, to feared&#xD;
      places and situations. The sample consisted of 50 individuals. Group 1 undertook 10 weekly,&#xD;
      individual sessions of CBT of one hour duration. Group 2, control, was just follow-up with&#xD;
      supportive therapy. The procedures used for the exposures, especially for induction symptom&#xD;
      exercises, were considered essential in the preparation of patients with panic disorder, to&#xD;
      be able to face up to panic attacks and subsequent agoraphobic situations.&#xD;

      The patients with PDA were diagnosed by medical psychiatrists from the team at the&#xD;
      Respiration and Panic Laboratory of Instituto de Psiquiatria da Universidade Federal do Rio&#xD;
      de Janeiro (IPUB/UFRJ), INCT Translational Medicine, according to the criteria of diagnostic&#xD;
      of the Manual of Diagnostic and Statistics of Mental Disorder (DSM-IV-TR, 2002b) and&#xD;
      according to the evaluation instrument SCID-I (Structured Clinical Interview Diagnostic)&#xD;
      (First et al, 1997). The sample consisted of 50 voluntary patients divided in two Groups. The&#xD;
      1st Group, made up of 25 individuals, received 10 sessions of CBT. The 2nd Group, &quot;control&quot;,&#xD;
      also consisted of 25 patients, who received just supportive psychotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a view to comparing the results of the Groups after the interventions, the following&#xD;
      evaluation instruments were applied at the beginning and at the end of the research: Beck&#xD;
      Anxiety Inventory (Beck et al, 1998a); State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberg et al, 1970);&#xD;
      Sheehan Disability Scale (Sheeham, 1983a); Global Assessment of Functioning (AXIS V)&#xD;
      (DSM-IV-TR, 2002c); questionnaire of fears and phobias (Mark &amp; Mathews, 1979); questionnaire&#xD;
      of cognitive agoraphobias( Chambless, 1984a); questionnaire of body sensations (Chambless,&#xD;
      1984b) and Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (Bandelow, 1999a).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria for inclusion in the research was patients over 18 years old of both sexes with&#xD;
      a diagnosis of PDA, with no serious comorbidities. The patients that presented alcohol or&#xD;
      drug dependency, mental retardation or serious mental disorders were excluded from the&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who agreed to participate in the study, signed a &quot;Term of Free and Clarified&#xD;
      Consent&quot; and were made aware of all the procedures undertaken, approved by the Committee of&#xD;
      Ethics for the research IPUB/UFRJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the evaluation of the tests the Chi-square tests ( χ2 ) or ANOVA, depending on the type of&#xD;
      variable measure, always with 95% of Confidence, or P-Value ≤ 0,05. In the characterization&#xD;
      of the Groups, the tests were undertaken with the values identified at the beginning of the&#xD;
      treatment. Thus, the efficiency of the initiatives undertaken could be perceived. The&#xD;
      objective was to identify the significant statistical differences, between the initial and&#xD;
      final results of the tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 10 CBT sessions were based on the previous study (King et al, 2007a), with some&#xD;
      modifications and adaptations appropriate to the characteristics of the sample of the&#xD;
      patients under study. The content of the sessions were distributed in the following way: PD&#xD;
      education (including the educational concepts of anxiety, agoraphobia, panic,&#xD;
      hyperventilation, respiratory re-education exercises (RR exercises), progressive muscular&#xD;
      relaxation exercises (PMR exercises), preparation of a scale of &quot;patient fears&quot; from the&#xD;
      smallest to greatest to cause anxiety, identification of cognitive distortions, cognitive&#xD;
      restructuring (CR), symptom induction exercises (SIE), IE, IVE, reinforcement of conquests,&#xD;
      observation of the difficulties in the procedures and maintenance of treatment gains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were encouraged to apply cognitive strategies at home, such as expose themselves&#xD;
      to changes of temperature, physical exercise, amongst others, several times, with the purpose&#xD;
      of inducing and tolerating the sensations with no therapeutic assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The learning in the first phase of the treatment that BS related to panic are not really&#xD;
      dangerous is essential to overcoming of agoraphobia and for the control of panic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard model of the 10 CBT sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. st. Session: Education concerning the trajectory of PD and the preparation of a priority&#xD;
           list of feared situations by the patient. Instructions to the patient of relaxation&#xD;
           techniques, repeated whenever necessary. RR exercise: Placing ones hand above ones&#xD;
           stomach, feeling the air passing through the diaphragm, perception of the abdominal&#xD;
           movement at each respiration. Slow inspiration through the nose counting up to three,&#xD;
           holding the respiration, counting up to three, and releasing the air slowly through the&#xD;
           mouth counting up to six. Repetition of the exercise several times in a row. In&#xD;
           continuity, Progressive Muscular Relaxation (PMR) (Jacobson, 1938) is undertaken with&#xD;
           the individual, whereby the instructor seeks to exercise by tensioning four Groups of&#xD;
           muscles for ten seconds and immediately after relaxing for another ten seconds. The&#xD;
           latter are: 1st face; 2nd arms, shoulders, chest and neck; 3rd abdomen, spine, genital&#xD;
           organs and 4th legs and feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nd. Session: explanation concerning the physiological mechanism of &quot;fight and flight&quot;&#xD;
           (Barlow, 1988b), verification of the similarity between the sensation originating from&#xD;
           this mechanism, compared with BS that emerge from panic. Undertake RR exercise, used&#xD;
           constantly during the sessions. When one manages to alter the thoughts referring to the&#xD;
           capacity to deal with feared situations, one is capable of controlling the physical&#xD;
           symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. rd. Session: model of hyperventilation that delineated by the rhythm and depth of the&#xD;
           exaggerated respiration for the needs of the body at a specific given moment. The latter&#xD;
           was undertaken with a patient sitting in a position of SIE hyperventilation: patient&#xD;
           inspires and expires deeply for 90 seconds, observation of patient reactions and&#xD;
           explanation of the reason for the emerging symptoms. Undertaking of RR exercise. The&#xD;
           patient should understand that anticipated anxiety is characterized by anticipated&#xD;
           thought processes, generally negative, of feared situations. Even in a secure situation&#xD;
           if the mind interprets it as insecure, the body will react with a message of danger&#xD;
           producing symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. th. Session: SIE: -sitting, look fixedly at a light for a minute and afterwards standing&#xD;
           up quickly and trying to read something. Analysis with the patient of the sensations&#xD;
           present and the levels of negative, catastrophic and repetitive thoughts that have&#xD;
           occurred. The patient begins to understand the origin of the symptoms and to perceive&#xD;
           that they are inoffensive, learning to deal with them. In continuity, RR exercise is&#xD;
           administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. th. Session: explanation of the concepts of BS that can be accentuated due to a&#xD;
           situation or to substances. Examples: exercising oneself or moving oneself quickly,&#xD;
           brusque changes of temperature, bright light, use of caffeine, alcohol, medicines and&#xD;
           irregular levels of respiration. Panic has it root in the fear of physical sensations&#xD;
           (Rangé, 2001b).&#xD;
&#xD;
           A patient was submitted to SIE: turning around in circles for a minute, afterwards&#xD;
           stopping, understanding and giving a new positive significance to the reactions&#xD;
           verified.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Immediately after, RR exercise is administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. th. Session: in PA some of the patient complaints were: ex: &quot;I cannot breathe&quot;, or &quot;I am&#xD;
           going to suffocate&quot;. It was explained that it is natural to breathe excessively when one&#xD;
           is anxious. The body seeks more energy in the form of oxygen to prepare itself to deal&#xD;
           with danger. When the oxygen is not used in the same proportion in which it is consumed,&#xD;
           the result is hyperventilation. The concepts of hyperventilation are remembered and SIE&#xD;
           of the 4th session is repeated, followed by RR exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. th. Session: education concerning CR - The way events are interpreted is what determines&#xD;
           the nature of the resulting emotional reactions (Rangé, 2001c). The patient should try&#xD;
           to identify and give a new significance to the specific badly-adapted cognations. The&#xD;
           concepts of Anticipated Anxiety (AA) and agoraphobic avoidance (PA-aa) (Beck, 1994) were&#xD;
           clarified. Patients have the custom of myths in relation to PA: &quot;I think I am going to&#xD;
           lose control&quot;, &quot;I think I am going to die&quot;, &quot;I think I am going to have a heart attack&quot;,&#xD;
           I think I am going mad&quot;, amongst others. The patient is instructed to question and&#xD;
           contest his or her conjectures and beliefs concentrating on the realistic probabilities&#xD;
           and gather evidence and forms to deal with the events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. th.Session: The IE refers to the fear learnt of internal state. Certain sensations of&#xD;
           terror, similar to fear previously experienced, have the custom of indicating new&#xD;
           possible PA (Muotri et al, 2007c). The automatic stimulus generated intensifies the&#xD;
           feared sensations, creating a vicious circle. Undertake two SIE: Sitting down, place the&#xD;
           patient's head between his or her legs for 30 seconds, afterwards sit up quickly and&#xD;
           look to the ceiling. And other exercise: the patient holds his or her respiration until&#xD;
           it can no longer be held while turning round in circles for 30 seconds. In continuity,&#xD;
           analysis of the symptoms and trying to understand the originating causes. RR exercise is&#xD;
           undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. th. Session: Undertake three SIE: repeat the exercise of the 5th session and the two of&#xD;
           the 8th session with subsequent administration of RR exercise. The purpose being for the&#xD;
           individual to associate the symptom with the cause, explain that the symptoms emerge&#xD;
           from physiological alterations triggered for some reason, differently from what one&#xD;
           thought that BS emerged from nowhere, with no apparent reason. Previously, the patient&#xD;
           would make a distorted association of the facts, interpreting tachycardia, perspiration,&#xD;
           lack of breath, among others, as a sign of imminent death or loss of control and not as&#xD;
           resulting from specific triggering factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. th. Session: one SIE: the patient standing up turns his or her head from one side to the&#xD;
           other for 30 seconds, stops and tries to fix his or her eyes on a spot on the wall.&#xD;
           Repeat this exercise after SIE of the 3rd session, in continuity; recover the patient's&#xD;
           physical balance and respiration with RR or PMR exercises. Evaluate the IVE concept&#xD;
           regarding confronting the patient with agoraphobic situations or locations. Explain that&#xD;
           agoraphobia is maintained by the fear of panicking or the experience of certain BS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real confrontation with the feared situation is repeated with each item of the priority list&#xD;
      of the patient's fears, beginning with the least anxiety provocative, until reaching the most&#xD;
      feared. Ask the patient to practise IVE whenever there is an opportunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review the IVEs undertaken, encourage the practical repetitions, and discuss the difficulties&#xD;
      in the procedures. The behaviour of exceeding oneself should be encouraged instead of&#xD;
      unnecessary over precautions. Remind the patient that to run away from the IVE reinforces the&#xD;
      maintenance of fear. The therapist stimulates thoughts concerning the avoided tasks and helps&#xD;
      the patient with CR. The fact that the additional diagnostics have the tendency to decline&#xD;
      after PD treatment should be commented. Ex: comorbidities such as depression, generalized&#xD;
      anxiety and social phobia. Reaffirm that the fear response is inoffensive, passing and&#xD;
      controllable, the BS appear and disappear, without the need of being avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of all the stages of the research, the two Groups were re-evaluated with same&#xD;
      initial instruments. The Groups were compared, observing the changes that had occurred, the&#xD;
      benefits, the losses and differences that had occurred because Group 1 had received&#xD;
      accompaniment with CBT and medication, compared to Group 2 control that had only made use of&#xD;
      medication with no CBT.&#xD;
