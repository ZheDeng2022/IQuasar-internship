    <textblock>
      Elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with troponin release in&#xD;
      approximately one third of cases.Troponin release is a sensitive and specific marker of&#xD;
      myocyte necrosis and infarction resulting from a form of ischemia/reperfusion injury,&#xD;
      downstream embolization of atheromatous material, and coronary side-branch occlusion. A&#xD;
      number of studies have demonstrated that procedure-related troponin release is associated&#xD;
      with subsequent cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transient sublethal episodes of ischemia before a prolonged ischemia/reperfusion injury,&#xD;
      known as ischemic preconditioning (IPC), have been shown to reduce the extent of myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (MI).Electroacupuncture (EA) stimulus, as a pretreatment method, limits MI size in&#xD;
      animal models. However, there are limited outcome to demonstrate protection from EA&#xD;
      pretreatment during PCI. The present study investigated the ability of EA pretreatment to&#xD;
      attenuate cardiac troponin I (cTnI) release after elective PCI in a single-center, randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;

    <description>According to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, bilateral Neiguan (PC 6) acupoints were chosen and identified according to traditional anatomical localizations. Once insertion of original needles was made at the acupoints, the needle was stimulated electrically with the intensity of 2-6 mA and frequency of 2/30 Hz using the Electronic Acupuncture Treatment Instrument until the patient felt the so-called 'Teh Chi' sensation of heaviness, numbness and swelling. The pretreatment was individualized based on patients sex, age, weight and felt and given 1 time per day for 5 consecutive days before the heart valve replacement surgeryï¼Ž</description>
