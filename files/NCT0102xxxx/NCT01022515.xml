  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma are tumors generating hypertension as a symptom. Different&#xD;
      biological tests are currently available to diagnose these tumors. However, they all lack&#xD;
      specificity since they do not distinguish cases of hypertension without pheochromocytoma or&#xD;
      paraganglioma. To improve the diagnostic specificity of these tumors, the investigators are&#xD;
      testing a new marker called EM66.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumors (NT) correspond to neoplasms that develop from endocrine and&#xD;
      neuroendocrine cells scattered throughout the body. They are characterized by the occurrence,&#xD;
      in their cytoplasm, of dense-core secretory vesicles containing hormones, neuropeptides and&#xD;
      acidic proteins such as granins. The diversity of NT (from hypophysis, pancreas, adrenal,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract) makes very difficult the identification and evaluation of the&#xD;
      different types of tumors by the diagnostic and prognostic tools currently available. We have&#xD;
      thus established a research program aimed at identifying new biological markers for the&#xD;
      detection, the prognosis and the follow-up of NT by seeking in tumor and plasma samples of&#xD;
      patients, granin-derived peptides. Our program was initiated on one type of NT :&#xD;
      pheochromocytoma. These neoplasms correspond to tumoral chromaffin cells mainly originating&#xD;
      from the adrenal medulla. It is considered that 10 % of pheochromocytoma patients will&#xD;
      develop metastases and, currently, except in the presence of metastases, there are no means&#xD;
      to predict malignancy of the tumor. We setup a radioimmunoassay of EM66 (a secretogranin&#xD;
      II-derived peptide) that allowed us to demonstrate that (i) plasma concentrations of the&#xD;
      peptide are significantly elevated in pheochromocytoma patients, (ii) combined with other&#xD;
      biological tests EM66 measurement increase the diagnostic sensitivity for these neoplasms,&#xD;
      (iii) after surgical removal of the tumor, plasma EM66 concentrations rapidly return to basal&#xD;
      level and, (iv) intra-tumoral EM66 concentrations are higher in benign than in malignant&#xD;
      pheochromocytomas (Yon et al., 2003, Guillemot et al., 2006). These results reveal that EM66&#xD;
      constitutes a novel tool for the diagnosis, prognosis and follow-up of pheochromocytoma. In&#xD;
      the frame of a clinical use of an EM66 measurement test, it is necessary to evaluate the&#xD;
      specificity of this marker. For instance, renal deficiency, hypergastrinemia, reduction of&#xD;
      renal clearance, type A gastritis, Crohns disease, or proton-pump inhibitory treatment, lead&#xD;
      to increase plasma chromogranin A (CgA) concentrations (false-positive cases). In addition,&#xD;
      while hypertension account for one of the symptoms of pheochromocytoma patients, in essential&#xD;
      hypertensive patients, CgA levels are higher than in normotensive individuals. The main&#xD;
      objective of our clinical transfer research project consists to study the specificity of the&#xD;
      measurement of EM66 as a diagnostic and prognostic marker of pheochromocytoma. This&#xD;
      multicentric study will allow us to compare plasma EM66 levels in pheochromocytoma patients&#xD;
      with a cohort of essential hypertensive patients. At the same time, in a long-range prospect,&#xD;
      due to the lack of malignancy markers for these tumors, we will investigate if plasma or&#xD;
      tumor EM66 levels are correlated to the differentiation status of pheochromocytomas, and if&#xD;
      the expression level of a set of genes that we identified by a transcriptomic approach&#xD;
      developed in the laboratory, is associated with the malignant status of the tumors. The&#xD;
      stakes of this transfer research, involving our laboratory and the Center for Clinical&#xD;
      Investigations (CIC) of Rouen and Lille, are to provide an easy and simple novel tool to&#xD;
      practitioners and anatomo-pathologists for the screening, the evaluation and the follow-up of&#xD;
      patients with neuroendocrine tumors.&#xD;
