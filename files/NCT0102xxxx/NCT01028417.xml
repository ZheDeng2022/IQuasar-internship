      LAY ABSTRACT&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Statement of the health problem or issue: Of the estimated 24,000 Canadians who will be&#xD;
           diagnosed with lung cancer in 2008, 21,000 will die of their disease. Based on this&#xD;
           cancer incidence and survival data, the most promising current strategy for improving&#xD;
           outcome is screening and early detection. It is suggested that if lesions are discovered&#xD;
           at an earlier stage of disease, they will have a higher likelihood of being treatable&#xD;
           and therefore, survival will be improved. CT detection of growing small lung nodules,&#xD;
           many of which are non-cancerous (benign), raises the possibility of lung cancer and thus&#xD;
           causes anxiety in patients and referring clinicians. Unfortunately, confident separation&#xD;
           of benign from malignant small lung nodules cannot be reliably achieved using CT or PET&#xD;
           criteria. Pathologic diagnosis using needle or excision biopsy is usually required.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Excision biopsy removes the entire nodule at one setting and eliminates the sampling&#xD;
           error associated with needle biopsy, making it appealing to physicians and patients. To&#xD;
           reduce post-operative pain and breathing difficulties, excision biopsy is often&#xD;
           performed using minimally invasive surgery (video assisted thoracoscopic surgery, VATS).&#xD;
           Finding small pulmonary nodules is often difficult with the minimally invasive camera&#xD;
           (VATS) and a bigger incision (thoracotomy) is necessary in more than 60% of our&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We recently developed a technique of using platinum micro-coils, which are inserted in&#xD;
           the lung nodule using CT guidance, to locate the nodule with fluoroscopy and then excise&#xD;
           it with VATS. We have completed a pilot study (n=75 nodules; 69 patients) to determine&#xD;
           the effectiveness of this technique. Seventy three (97%) 4-24-mm nodules were&#xD;
           successfully removed at fluoroscopically guided VATS excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective of your project: To improve our ability to successfully excise small growing&#xD;
           lung nodules with minimally invasive VATS surgery using CT guided micro-coil&#xD;
           localization techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How will you undertake your work? We propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
           determine if the use of CT guided platinum microcoil markers for VATS excision of&#xD;
           subcentimetre pulmonary nodules can reduce the rate of conversion to open thoracotomy&#xD;
           from 50% to 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What is unique/innovative about your project? New image guided minimally invasive&#xD;
           surgical technique for removing early growing cancers was developed at the Vancouver&#xD;
           General Hospital and the University of British Columbia. This has been published in&#xD;
           peer-reviewed journals and can potentially allow us to accurately locate and excise&#xD;
           suspicious lung nodules&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Relevance to Lung Association's mission statement? Lung cancer remains a major health&#xD;
           problem in Canada. Early detection and screening programs allow for discovery of nodules&#xD;
           when they are still very small and therefore, likely curable. Excision biopsy removes&#xD;
           the entire nodule at one setting and eliminates the sampling error associated with&#xD;
           needle biopsy, making it appealing to patients and physicians. To reduce post operative&#xD;
           morbidity, costs and volume of lung removed, excision biopsy is often performed using&#xD;
           video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) techniques. Using a pilot project grant from&#xD;
           the BC Lung Association we have developed a new technique that allows preoperative CT&#xD;
           marking of the nodule and minimally invasive removal of the lesion. We hope that this&#xD;
           technique will allow earlier treatment of lung cancers and improve survival in this&#xD;
           devastating disease.&#xD;

      Intervention Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-operative CT scan will be reviewed by the surgeon with the radiologist to determine&#xD;
      if the nodule can be excised using thoracoscopic staple wedge techniques. After informed&#xD;
      consent, the patient will be seen by an anesthesiologist to determine risks and benefits of a&#xD;
      general anesthetic. The patient will initially come to the CT scanner suite in the radiology&#xD;
      department. The CT guided percutaneous microcoil nodule localization procedure, will be&#xD;
      performed consciously under local anaesthesia Using sterile technique and local anesthetic, a&#xD;
      biopsy needle (22 gauge) pre-loaded with an 6 cm long platinum microcoil will be placed 10mm&#xD;
      deep to the suspicious pulmonary nodule using CT guidance. The coil will be deployed such&#xD;
      that one end will be adjacent to the nodule and the other end will lie free on the: lung&#xD;
      surface. The patient will be transferred to the Laurel OR where they will be placed under&#xD;
      general anesthesia with a double lumen endotracheal tube in order to allow collapse of the&#xD;
      involved lung during the thoracoscopic excision of the marked lung nodule. The patient's&#xD;
      blood pressures, oxygen levels, pulse and ECG will be monitored. The thoracoscopic excision&#xD;
      of the nodule will be performed using the microcoil as a localizing device. Using the&#xD;
      preoperative CT scan, the study surgeon will mark the insertion sites for thoracoscopic&#xD;
      instruments. Instruments for video-assisted thoracoscopy include a rigid 5 mm thoracoscope, a&#xD;
      light source, a video-camera and monitor, and 5 mm grasping forceps. The patient will be&#xD;
      draped. A 5mm thoracoscopic port is inserted into the thorax percutaneously and the lung is&#xD;
      examined with the thoracoscope. The nodule location will be identified by the end of the&#xD;
      microcoil that sits on the surface of the lung. A second 5 mm port is put in place and the&#xD;
      end of the microcoil grasped under thoracoscopic visualization. Multiple endoscopic are&#xD;
      placed via a third 12mm port and the nodule and coil are completely excised under&#xD;
      fluoroscopic guidance. The resected nodule is placed in an endoscopic bag and brought out&#xD;
      through the large port site. If the lesion cannot be excised by the VATS technique the&#xD;
      patient will undergo an open rib spreading thoracotomy for excision of the marked nodule. The&#xD;
      indications for thoracotomy at this time are:poor visualization of the lung, pleural&#xD;
      symphysis with scarring, uncontrollable bleeding or inability to completely resect the lesion&#xD;
      with the thoracoscopic endostapler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specimen is sent for frozen section pathological examination. If the lesion is benign the&#xD;
      thoracic cavity is irrigated with saline and a small chest tube is put in place and attached&#xD;
      to under water drainage. The incisions are then closed and the lung is re-expanded. The&#xD;
      patient is then transported to the post-anesthetic room similar to other patients undergoing&#xD;
      general anesthesia. If the lesion is a non-small cell cancer of the lung the patient may&#xD;
      undergo a sampling of lymph nodes at that time followed by formal lobectomy. If the patient&#xD;
      has inadequate pulmonary function to tolerate a lobectomy and the lesion has been completely&#xD;
      excised the surgeon may choose to stop the operation at that time and follow the patient.&#xD;
