    <textblock>
      This is study where medical record information will be collected as well as collection of&#xD;
      excess biological samples.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Patients diagnosed with H1N1 will be asked to consent and allow us to collect the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the medical record the research staff will review and record the results of the&#xD;
      test/procedures (x-rays, CT-scans, EKG (electrocardiogram), etc.) that are part of the&#xD;
      subjects clinical care and the results will become part of the research record. We will also&#xD;
      collect and record vitals signs, including temperature, blood pressure, heart rate,&#xD;
      respiratory rate and record the list of medications the subject is taking. We will also&#xD;
      collect information on demographics (address, phone number, etc.) including gender, race and&#xD;
      ethnicity, review and record past medical history and any non medical procedures that the&#xD;
      subject may have had within the past two months. This information will be collected by the&#xD;
      research coordinator from the medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical physician ordered a nasopharyngeal swab or obtained bronchoalveolar lavage fluid&#xD;
      to diagnose novel Influenza A (H1N1). We will collect this swab or fluid after the diagnosis&#xD;
      has been made, to evaluate the genetic material of the virus. This swab or fluid is normally&#xD;
      discarded once the diagnosis is made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      collection of data will be done by the research staff and should not take any longer than&#xD;
      15-20 minutes. The clinical samples that would have been discarded will be collected by the&#xD;
      research staff from microbiology and pathology and delivered to the research lab in Scaife.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will do a 6 month follow up phone call to check the health status of the&#xD;
      participant. This will be done by the research coordinator and take no more than 5-10 minutes&#xD;
      of the subject's time.&#xD;

      All the biologic samples and data will be under the control of the principal investigator .&#xD;
      To protect confidentiality, all personal identifiers will be removed and replaced with a&#xD;
      specific code number. The information linking these code numbers to the corresponding&#xD;
      subjects' identities will be kept in a separate, secure location. The investigators will keep&#xD;
      the samples and data indefinitely. All samples will be stored in the principal investigators&#xD;
      laboratory in Scaife Hall, Room 835.&#xD;
