  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increasing prevalence of obesity in U.S. children and adolescents is a major health&#xD;
      threat to our society, especially among minority and low social economic status (SES)&#xD;
      populations. During adolescence physical activity (PA) decreases and is likely an important&#xD;
      contributor to the increasing trend in childhood obesity rates. Little evidence suggests that&#xD;
      school-based curriculum interventions lead to increases in overall PA. Thus, this proposal&#xD;
      will evaluate the efficacy of an innovative motivational and behavioral skills after-school&#xD;
      program for promoting increases PA among underserved adolescents (e.g., minorities, low SES).&#xD;
      The motivational plus behavioral skills intervention is consistent with Self-Determination&#xD;
      (Motivation) Theory and Social Cognitive Theory in that it emphasizes increasing intrinsic&#xD;
      motivation and behavioral skills for PA. Adolescents in the intervention take part in&#xD;
      developing the program, selecting physical activities that generate fun and interest, and&#xD;
      generating their own coping strategies for making effective PA changes during a videotaped&#xD;
      session. Preliminary data from our group demonstrates the feasibility of the motivational&#xD;
      plus behavioral skills PA program for increasing moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) in&#xD;
      underserved adolescents in South Carolina. The proposed project will use a school-based&#xD;
      nested cohort design to evaluate efficacy of a 17-week motivational plus behavioral skills&#xD;
      program versus typical after-school program (general health education only) on increasing PA&#xD;
      in underserved adolescents. Twenty-four middle schools (70 6th graders per school; N=1,680),&#xD;
      located in South Carolina will be randomly assigned to one of two after-school programs. The&#xD;
      study employs a nested cohort design, with schools, rather than individuals assigned to&#xD;
      condition and will be analyzed using repeated measures analysis of covariance techniques as&#xD;
      outlined by Murray. We will also examine psychosocial variables (PA self-efficacy,&#xD;
      self-concept, motivation, social support, and enjoyment) as potential mediators of the&#xD;
      intervention on changes in MVPA using regression and structural equation modeling techniques.&#xD;
      This study will address an important public health problem that will have implications for&#xD;
      decreasing obesity in underserved adolescents.&#xD;
