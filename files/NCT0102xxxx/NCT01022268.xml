  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal represents a unified programme supported by both clinical and academic staff in&#xD;
      the Departments of Paediatrics at Imperial College and St Mary's Hospital, Southampton&#xD;
      Hospital and John Radcliffe Hospital (Oxford). St Mary's Hospital is the hub of a paediatric&#xD;
      network for West London, and forms part of the Paediatric Intensive Care Network for the&#xD;
      London region, with potential access to a population of 3 million children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to improve diagnosis and understanding of children with infectious, inflammatory and&#xD;
      allergic conditions. Our study will establish well-characterised cohorts of patients with&#xD;
      defined conditions, in whom microbiological and patient samples will be used to understand&#xD;
      the contribution of genetic background, differential gene expression, proteomics and the&#xD;
      pathogen type to the disease process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unwell children coming to hospital through any route will be invited to join the study.&#xD;
      Entering the study will entail the child having blood taken for research purposes in addition&#xD;
      to the clinically indicated tests. We will also recruit well (control) children who are&#xD;
      having blood tests performed for elective purposes, such as surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, children presenting with an illness that is likely to have an infectious&#xD;
      aetiology will also have samples collected for microbiological diagnosis. Those samples taken&#xD;
      for ordinary diagnostic purposes (such as blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),&#xD;
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid or nasal brushings for epithelial cell cultures) would&#xD;
      also be used for state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques, in order to maximise the likelihood&#xD;
      of confirming a microbiological diagnosis. Where healthy, uninfected children are having&#xD;
      invasive procedures, such as lumbar punctures, we would aim to recruit these children as&#xD;
      controls and collect biological samples such as CSF samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This bid addresses the need for translational research in paediatrics, by building on the&#xD;
      world-class basic science and clinical paediatric base at Imperial College and St Mary's&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is currently little understanding of the mechanisms by which respiratory infections can&#xD;
      cause severe illness and death. The emergence of Influenza A subtype (H1N1) as a major cause&#xD;
      of childhood severe illness in 2009 permitted further study of how this virus triggers severe&#xD;
      disease, and how the inflammatory response to H1N1 differs from other infections. It is&#xD;
      likely that host-mediated inflammatory processes triggered by the infecting agent contributes&#xD;
      to severe illness. In addition, viral infection induces profound changes in the innate immune&#xD;
      response to common bacterial pathogens, with increased bacterial colonisation of normally&#xD;
      sterile lower airway. Thus both host and bacterial factors may contribute to lung damage in&#xD;
      severe respiratory infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was initiated to identify the aetiology and immunopathologic mechanisms of&#xD;
      childhood respiratory infection (Immunopathology of Respiratory Infection Study - IRIS),&#xD;
      recruiting children with suspected respiratory infection or respiratory failure (and&#xD;
      controls). This dataset will provide a unique resource for further study of disease&#xD;
      mechanisms in children with a range of infections including H1N1/09 infection, Respiratory&#xD;
      Syncytial Virus (RSV), Rhinovirus, other common respiratory viruses and severe bacterial&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
