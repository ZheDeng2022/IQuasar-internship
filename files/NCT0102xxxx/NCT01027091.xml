    <textblock>
      Hypocalcemia is the complication, after total thyroidectomy, that usually determines the&#xD;
      length of hospital stay.Serum calcium levels is a quick and cost-effective practice to&#xD;
      recognise hypocalcemia in the postoperative follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: The objective of this perspective study is to determine if consecutive&#xD;
      postoperative serum calcium levels early after total thyroidectomy can be used to identify&#xD;
      patients who are unlikely to develop significant hypocalcemia and can be safely discharged&#xD;
      within 24 to 48 hours postoperative.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years there has been a global trend towards more radical and aggressive approach to&#xD;
      thyroid surgery (total or subtotal thyroidectomy against semithyreoeidectomy), almost&#xD;
      regardless of the pathological cause, even for benign diseases. There is also developed, a&#xD;
      serious skepticism as complications of total or subtotal thyroidectomy is neither rare nor&#xD;
      insignificant. In particular, complications of thyroidectomy is the laryngeal nerve paresis&#xD;
      (0.2% bilateral, unilateral 3,7-3,9%, 2% transient, lasting 1%), bleeding (1-2%), infection&#xD;
      of the wound (0, 3-1,6%) and hypocalcaemia (permanent hypocalcaemia in over 6 months follow&#xD;
      up 1,7-4,4%, while transient, manageable with vit D and calcium substitution 8,3-9,9%). The&#xD;
      post total thyroidectomy hypocalcaemia is not only more frequent but also has the most&#xD;
      delayed onset after surgery (up to several 24hours later) in relation to bleeding and paresis&#xD;
      of the laryngeal nerve, which is immediate postoperative complications. This is the main&#xD;
      cause of prolonged hospitalization and monitoring of patients postoperatively which is linked&#xD;
      to increased risk of bacterial infections and increased cost.9, 10 Great effort has been made&#xD;
      in the last 15 years to reduce the length hospital stay of patients in order to perform the&#xD;
      total thyroidectomy as a one day surgery.6, 11 In this way great importance is the prediction&#xD;
      of those patients are more likely to experience post-operative hypocalcaemia. The appearance&#xD;
      of postoperative hypocalcaemia associated with specific diseases such as thyroid disease&#xD;
      Graves, the thyreotoxicosis and thyroid cancer 7.8, and the surgical technique (the extent of&#xD;
      excision, the type of thyroid artery ligation, the number of parathyroid recognized&#xD;
      intraoperative but also those autotransplanted) 12. Moreover, beyond these factors, great&#xD;
      importance is given to methods of monitoring patients to find reliable indicators to allow&#xD;
      safe release out of the hospital after the first 24 hours without risk of hypocalcaemia. The&#xD;
      measurement of parathyroid hormone (PTH) both intraoperative and postoperatively (4 hours) is&#xD;
      a hot topic in contemporary literature and promises accurate predictions 13, but there is&#xD;
      disagreement about the precise time of receiving the specimens and great consideration about&#xD;
      the increased cost 14, 15 (at our hospital is not even available). An older, simple, fast and&#xD;
      economical method is to measure levels of free serum calcium 6,9. Despite that the&#xD;
      correlation of the immediate post-operative levels of free calcium, with the likelihood of&#xD;
      developing hypocalcaemia has variations in different surveys, resulting to early release of&#xD;
      patients directly when free calcium is in normal range, by some departments, while others&#xD;
      follow strict protocols of monitoring patients for days . However, the variation in the&#xD;
      levels of free serum calcium between the first 6 and 12 postoperative hours alone or in&#xD;
      combination with measurement of PTH seems to give some answers and it is under great&#xD;
      consideration in the international community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore, in line with the current literature, important to develop a safe, and also&#xD;
      cost-effective protocol monitoring patients after total thyroidectomy, which, in combination&#xD;
      with predisposing risk factors of hypocalcaemia, will predict low-risk patients for&#xD;
      developing hypocalcaemia and allow secure release from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this perspective study is to correlate the variability of the levels of free&#xD;
      serum calcium (Ca + +), and also the levels of albumin (ALB), phosphorus (PO-3), magnesium&#xD;
      (Mg) and total albumin (TPR), between two measurements on 6 and 12 hours postoperatively, the&#xD;
      incidence of hypocalcaemia in patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for any reason. The aim&#xD;
      is to develop on the basis of variation in levels of free serum calcium, a secure method of&#xD;
      prediction and identification of low risk patients for developing hypocalcaemia providing an&#xD;
      early release from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
