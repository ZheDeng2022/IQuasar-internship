      RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy, such as proton beam radiation therapy, that&#xD;
      delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause&#xD;
      less damage to normal tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the best way to give proton beam radiation therapy&#xD;
      and to see how well it works in treating patients with low grade gliomas.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the feasibility of proton beam radiation therapy in patients with low grade&#xD;
      gliomas. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess late complications from irradiation using proton beam therapy in place of&#xD;
      conventional photon beam therapy for the treatment of low grade gliomas. (Phase II) II. To&#xD;
      assess acute side effects from irradiation using proton beam therapy in place of conventional&#xD;
      photon beam therapy for the treatment of low grade gliomas. (Phase II) III. To compare the&#xD;
      dose distribution to tumor and surrounding normal structures using DVH's (Dose Volume&#xD;
      Histograms) generated from the proton plan used to treat the patient and the photon plan&#xD;
      generated for comparison purposes. (Phase II) IV. To monitor the rates of local control,&#xD;
      overall and disease specific survival using proton radiotherapy. (Phase II) V. To evaluate&#xD;
      the time to progression of low grade gliomas treated with protons. (Phase II) VI. To evaluate&#xD;
      the incidence and severity of fatigue in low grade glioma treated with protons. (Phase II)&#xD;
      VII. To evaluate the effect of proton beam radiation on neurocognitive outcome in patients&#xD;
      with low grade glioma. (Phase II) VIII. To evaluate the quality of life in patients treated&#xD;
      for low grade glioma. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients undergo proton beam radiation therapy for 6 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.&#xD;
