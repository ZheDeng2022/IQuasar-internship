      This study will develop:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Develop the computer-based brief intervention and Contingency Management (CM)&#xD;
           components, with repeated feedback from experts, prenatal clinic staff, and&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recruit 110 pregnant women who are actively smoking, and randomly assign recruited women&#xD;
           to Brief Intervention, CM, combined, or control conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Conduct follow-up evaluation at 12 weeks post-intervention to measure self-reported&#xD;
           smoking, breath carbon monoxide (CO), and urinary cotinine levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Collect data regarding birth outcomes and evaluate the feasibility of various methods of&#xD;
           post-partum follow-up.&#xD;

      Participants &amp; Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be approached while in the waiting room of various clinics at the Detroit Medical&#xD;
      Center. Clinic staff will inform patients of the study and its goals via a flyer that will be&#xD;
      distributed at the reception window as women arrive for their appointments. If the women are&#xD;
      interested, they will answer some questions and provide their contact information on the back&#xD;
      of the flyer. Then they will place the flyer in a ballot box that is locked and only can be&#xD;
      accessed by the Research Staff. Research staff may also be at the clinic to recruit women&#xD;
      from the waiting room. When the research staff meets with potential participants. The study&#xD;
      will be briefly described, and those indicating tentative interest will be screened for age&#xD;
      and language ability (informally). Those indicating tentative interest, reporting age of at&#xD;
      least 18 years, gestation 27 weeks or less, and demonstrating adequate ability to speak and&#xD;
      understand spoken English will be brought to a nearby private room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, informed consent for screening will be obtained using an information sheet; this sheet&#xD;
      will describe the purpose of the screening, and will emphasize that participation in the&#xD;
      initial screening is anonymous. Those who agree will be given a very brief demonstration of&#xD;
      the use of the computer, after which they will complete the brief (10-item) screener. All&#xD;
      interactions with the computer will involve a touch-screen and headphones for private&#xD;
      presentation of all information aurally as well as visually; in many previous studies,&#xD;
      including pilot testing at this clinic, the software has been proven extremely easy to use,&#xD;
      even for women lacking any prior computer experience. Those who endorse smoking cigarettes&#xD;
      (even a puff) in the past week will be told of the full study in detail, and written informed&#xD;
      consent will be sought (with a brief quiz to assure understanding). Those who provide consent&#xD;
      will again interact directly with the computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The computer itself will perform randomization and will gather all research data except for&#xD;
      baseline breath CO (which is higher among persons who smoke), which will be obtained (via a&#xD;
      Micro SmokerlyzerÂ® from Bedfont Scientific Ltd.) and entered into the computer by the&#xD;
      research staff. The entire process, including consent, will take approximately 40 minutes&#xD;
      regardless of experimental condition (to which the research staff will be blind). Research&#xD;
      staff will tell clinic staff of the patient's whereabouts so that the patient is not passed&#xD;
      over when staff call her to an exam room; unfinished study procedures will be completed in&#xD;
      the exam room prior to the physician's entrance, and/or after the appointment is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women (N = 110) who report smoking cigarettes (even a puff) during pregnancy will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to computer-based brief intervention alone, CM alone, brief intervention plus CM, or&#xD;
      attention control conditions. Women randomly assigned to the computer-based intervention&#xD;
      condition will receive an approximately 20-minute intervention modeled after motivational&#xD;
      interviewing (MI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women randomly assigned to the CM condition will be told that, if they choose, they can ask&#xD;
      to be tested (via provision of a urine sample) for smoking, up to five times, at a regularly&#xD;
      scheduled prenatal visit. Research staff will conduct these tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8-Week Follow-Up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who enroll in the study will be contacted via mail and telephone, as necessary, to&#xD;
      schedule a 8-week follow-up at the PI's lab or at the prenatal clinic, depending upon the&#xD;
      participant's preference. Research staff completing follow-up testing will be kept blind to&#xD;
      intervention condition. The primary outcome measure will be urinary cotinine-verified&#xD;
      abstinence at follow-up; birth outcome data will also be gathered from hospital records. At&#xD;
      follow-up, participants will (a) complete all measures on the computer again, (b) provide&#xD;
      breath CO; (c) provide a final urine sample for testing of urinary cotinine (evidence of&#xD;
      smoking).&#xD;
