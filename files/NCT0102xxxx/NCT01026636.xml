      This study will assess the pharmacokinetics (how drugs are absorbed, distributed in the body&#xD;
      and removed over time) and safety of a single dose of ceftobiprole in pediatric patients&#xD;
      undergoing treatment with systemic antibiotics and may be used to guide dosing&#xD;
      recommendations for ceftobiprole in children.&#xD;

      This purpose of this study will be to assess the pharmacokinetics (how drugs are absorbed,&#xD;
      distributed in the body and removed over time) and safety of a single dose of ceftobiprole in&#xD;
      pediatric patients undergoing treatment with systemic antibiotics and may be used to guide&#xD;
      dosing recommendations for ceftobiprole in children. This study is an open-label (all&#xD;
      patients will know the identity of the drug) single-dose, pharmacokinetic study in infants&#xD;
      and children =3 months to &lt;18 years of age who are medically stable as judged by the clinical&#xD;
      investigator and require therapy with antibiotics. Patients will be given a 2-hour i.v.&#xD;
      infusion (given directly into the vein) of 7, 10, or 15 mg/kg ceftobiprole. The study&#xD;
      population will be grouped according to the following 4 age groups: =12 to &lt;18 years of age;&#xD;
      =6 to &lt;12 years of age; =2 to &lt;6 years of age; and =3 months to &lt;2 years of age. Every&#xD;
      attempt will be made to include patients of both sexes in each age group. Safety evaluations&#xD;
      will include clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis),&#xD;
      pregnancy testing, vital signs, physical examination, monitoring of adverse events, and&#xD;
      recording of concomitant medications. Patients will be given a single 2-hour i.v. (given&#xD;
      directly into the vein) infusion of ceftobiprole. The total duration of the study is&#xD;
      approximately 18 days, including screening and posttreatment.&#xD;
