  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mometasone furoate (MF) is a synthetic glucocorticosteroid that, when administered to asthma&#xD;
      patients with a dry powder inhaler (Asmanex® Twisthaler®) at dosages of 100 to 400 mcg twice&#xD;
      daily, has been shown to improve lung function, reduce symptoms of asthma, and reduce&#xD;
      frequency and severity of exacerbations by reducing airway inflammation, with a relatively&#xD;
      low potential to cause systemic side effects such as hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)&#xD;
      axis suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An experimental formulation of MF 100 mcg delivered twice daily via a pressurized&#xD;
      metered-dose inhaler (MDI) also has been shown to be effective in improving lung function of&#xD;
      asthma patients as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). This trial is&#xD;
      designed to verify the effectiveness of twice daily MF MDI 100 mcg in treating asthma in&#xD;
      adults and adolescents previously treated with low dosages of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS),&#xD;
      as measured by improvement in morning FEV1 and time to first asthma exacerbation over 12&#xD;
      weeks of treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An adult or adolescent subject with a diagnosis of persistent asthma of &gt;=6 months&#xD;
             duration may be selected for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both subject (and/or parent/guardian, if appropriate) and investigator must agree that&#xD;
             changing therapy is acceptable and poses no inherent risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must have been using a low daily maintenance dose of inhaled corticosteroids&#xD;
             (ICS), with or without added long-acting β2-agonist (LABA), for &gt;=12 weeks prior to&#xD;
             Screening, and must have been on a stable regimen (daily dose unchanged) for at least&#xD;
             the last 2 weeks of that period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At Screening, the subject must have a prebronchodilator FEV1 between 60% and 90% of&#xD;
             the predicted value when restricted medications have been withheld.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To be randomized, the subjects must be symptomatic with FEV1 at Baseline must be&#xD;
             between 50% and 85% of predicted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A subject must not have been admitted to the hospital for management of airway&#xD;
             obstruction within the last 3 months prior to Screening, and must not have experienced&#xD;
             an occurrence of any clinical deterioration of asthma that resulted in emergency&#xD;
             treatment, hospitalization due to asthma, or treatment with additional, excluded&#xD;
             asthma medication, as judged by the clinical investigator at any time from Screening&#xD;
             to Baseline/Randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In addition, a subject must not have demonstrated a decrease in absolute FEV1 of &gt;20%&#xD;
             at any time from Screening to Baseline, or a decrease in AM peak expiratory flow (PEF)&#xD;
             below the PEF stability limit on any 2 consecutive days prior to&#xD;
             Baseline/Randomization.&#xD;
