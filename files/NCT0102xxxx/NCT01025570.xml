    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out the effects, good and/or bad, of the combination of&#xD;
      two drugs, gemcitabine and bosutinib, in patients with resected pancreatic cancer and whether&#xD;
      this combination can prevent pancreatic cancer from coming back.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete resection by standard pancreaticoduodenectomy (for tumors of the pancreatic&#xD;
             head) or distal pancreatectomy (for tumors of the pancreatic tail). Positive&#xD;
             microscopic margins are allowable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0 - 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥ 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to start adjuvant therapy within 8 weeks after pancreatic cancer surgery (but&#xD;
             no sooner than 3 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CA 19-9 ≤ 2.5 times the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ANC (absolute neutrophil count) ≥ 1500/μL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 gm/dL (may be transfused or may receive epoetin alfa to maintain this&#xD;
             level)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/μL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  INR ≤ 1.5 (except those subjects who are receiving full-dose warfarin)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 times the upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential (serum or urine beta-HCG).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and sign and&#xD;
             give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.&#xD;

          -  Women or men of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective contraceptive&#xD;
             method during treatment and for 6 months afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one paraffin block from patient's pancreatic cancer surgery must be available&#xD;
             for analysis (does not necessarily need to be received by the start of study&#xD;
             treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any prior systemic or investigational therapy for pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Grossly positive surgical margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any of the following post-operative complications: wound dehiscence or infection,&#xD;
             intraabdominal abscess, pancreatic or biliary leak or fistula.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of major psychiatric disorder or other chronic medical illness that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the treating physician, contraindicates the use of the investigational&#xD;
             drugs in this protocol or that might render the subject at high risk of treatment&#xD;
             related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious active ongoing infection, including any requiring parenteral antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin&#xD;
             cancer. Patients are not considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot; malignancy if they&#xD;
             have completed therapy and considered by their physician to be at less than 30% risk&#xD;
             of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known central nervous system disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to swallow pills/tolerate oral intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures.&#xD;
