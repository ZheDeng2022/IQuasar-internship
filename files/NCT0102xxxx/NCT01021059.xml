      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recombinant human interleukin-15 (rhIL-15) is a substance that is naturally produced in&#xD;
           the body that has many properties that increase the activity and strength of the immune&#xD;
           system, the body s natural defense system. It is hoped that rhIL-15 can boost or&#xD;
           strengthen patients immune systems and restore immune responses against cancer and&#xD;
           infectious diseases like HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rhIL-15 is being studied in patients with malignant melanoma, an aggressive type of skin&#xD;
           cancer, and in patients with renal cell carcinoma, a type of kidney cancer that has&#xD;
           spread to other parts of the body. Researchers are interested in determining if rhIL-15&#xD;
           can help stimulate the immune system and aid in the treatment process for cancers that&#xD;
           have not responded well to standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether rhIL-15 is safe and effective in the treatment of metastatic&#xD;
           malignant melanoma or metastatic renal cell carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine how the body processes rhIL-15 after each infusion and determine how it acts&#xD;
           on the treated cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients older than 18 years of age that have been diagnosed with metastatic malignant&#xD;
           melanoma or metastatic renal cell carcinoma that has not responded to standard&#xD;
           treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible patients may not have received prior treatment with interleukin-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to treatment, patients will have baseline blood tests and imaging scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be admitted to an in-patient unit of the NIH Clinical Center for this&#xD;
           treatment. rhIL-15 will be given intravenously once a day for 12 consecutive days, for a&#xD;
           total of twelve doses of the drug. The injection of rhIL-15 will take about 30 minutes.&#xD;
           Patients will be evaluated daily before each treatment and more frequently if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the 12-day treatment and for at least 42 days from the start of the treatment,&#xD;
           patients will be closely followed for possible side effects and for tumor response.&#xD;
           Blood will be drawn frequently for monitoring purposes, and other procedures such as&#xD;
           chest x-rays and imaging scans will be performed to monitor the state of the tumor and&#xD;
           the patient response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After completing the rhIL-15 treatment and discharge from the hospital, patients will&#xD;
           have an evaluation with a member of the research team once a week from the end of the&#xD;
           treatment period to 42 days from the start of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study doctors may ask patients to return for evaluation (including blood draws) at 3 and&#xD;
           6 months after the completion of the treatment, checking for potential long-term effects&#xD;
           or toxicity of the treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a powerful immunostimulatory cytokine with a broad range of&#xD;
           biological activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In contrast to IL-2, IL-15 inhibits the activation-induced cell death (AICD) of T-cells&#xD;
           and is not involved in the maintenance of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells that act as&#xD;
           inhibitory checkpoints on the immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IL-15 is involved in the proliferation, differentiation and activation of CD8+ T-cells&#xD;
           and NK-cells, and the maintenance of long term CD8+ memory T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In preclinical studies, vaccinia-based vaccines expressing IL-15 induced long lasting,&#xD;
           high-avidity cytotoxic CD8+ T-lymphocyte (CTL) mediated immunity, whereas the immunity&#xD;
           mediated by IL-2 expressing vaccines was short-lived. Furthermore, IL-15 can overcome&#xD;
           the lack of CD4 help in CTL induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IL-15 is highly active against a number of syngeneic mouse tumor models and it is also&#xD;
           effective in augmenting the activity of NK-cells and CD8+ T-cells in rhesus macaques&#xD;
           indicating that it may be active against human cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary objective of this trial is to determine the safety, toxicity profile,&#xD;
           dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intravenous recombinant&#xD;
           human IL-15 (rhIL-15) administered as a daily intravenous bolus infusion for 12&#xD;
           consecutive days in subjects with metastatic malignant melanoma and renal cell cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objectives include determination of rhIL-15 pharmacokinetics, in particular&#xD;
           the time course of the decline of rhIL-15 from the serum following intravenous&#xD;
           administration and the definition of the immunogenicity of rhIL-15 in subjects receiving&#xD;
           this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the biological effects of rhIL-15 on the proportions and absolute&#xD;
           numbers of circulating NK-cells, and CD45RO+CD8+ T-cells and central or effector memory&#xD;
           subsets based on expression of CD28, CD95, CCR7 and CD62L by flow cytometry and to&#xD;
           determine its effects on the plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain preliminary information on the antitumor effects of repeat cycles of rhIL-15 in&#xD;
           patients with metastatic malignant melanoma and renal cell cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients greater than or equal to 18 years-old with pathologically confirmed metastatic&#xD;
           malignant melanoma or metastatic renal cell cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with metastatic renal cell cancer must either have refused treatment with,&#xD;
           failed to tolerate, or have progressive disease after receiving sorafenib or sunitinib,&#xD;
           and temsirolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absolute granulocyte count (AGC) of at least 1500/mm(3) and a platelet count of at least&#xD;
           75,000/mm(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a single institution, open-label, non-randomized 3 + 3 design phase I&#xD;
           dose-escalation study to determine the safety, toxicity and MTD of rhIL-15 in patients&#xD;
           with metastatic malignant melanoma and renal cell cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Groups of 3 to 6 patients will receive rhIL-15 at doses of 0.3, 1, 3, 7, 10, 15, 20 or&#xD;
           25 mcg/kg/day for 12 days provided that DLT had not been observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlative protocol studies will be obtained prior to treatment and at specific times&#xD;
           points during and after treatment including pharmacokinetics for the clearance of&#xD;
           rhIL-15 from the serum, immunogenicity testing for the development of neutralizing&#xD;
           anti-rhIL-15 antibodies and immunological study endpoint evaluation for the effect of&#xD;
           rhIL-15 on immune cell subset populations and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the&#xD;
           peripheral blood.&#xD;
