      The investigators propose to assess whether an intervention to build capacity and improve&#xD;
      delivery of drugs and diagnostics at government-run health facilities improves the health of&#xD;
      children and quality of care delivered, as compared to 'standard care' currently available at&#xD;
      health facilities, supplemented by services provided through the private sector and&#xD;
      community-based interventions. The target population will be divided into 20 clusters,&#xD;
      defined as the catchment area of lower-level public health facilities. Clusters will be&#xD;
      randomized to the health facility intervention (HFI) or to standard care delivered from&#xD;
      government-run health facilities, supplemented by services provided through the private&#xD;
      sector and community-based interventions. The intervention is designed to address barriers to&#xD;
      delivering quality care at health centers and will focus on three components: (1) training&#xD;
      in-charges in health center management, (2) providing training to health workers in fever&#xD;
      case management and patient-centered services, and (3) ensuring adequate supplies of&#xD;
      artemether-lumefantrine and RDTs. Outcomes will be measured in three distinct populations:&#xD;
      (1) cross-sectional surveys of children under 15 years randomly selected from households&#xD;
      within the clusters; (2) a cohort of children under five randomly selected from households&#xD;
      within the clusters and followed for 2 years; and (3) patients attending all government-run&#xD;
      health facilities, including children under five and their caregivers participating in exit&#xD;
      interviews on selected days every six months. The primary outcome of the study is prevalence&#xD;
      of anemia in children under five.&#xD;

      Study overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are proposing to evaluate enhanced health facility-based care for malaria and febrile&#xD;
      illnesses in children in Tororo district using a cluster randomized design. The health&#xD;
      facility intervention (HFI) will aim to address barriers to achieving good quality health&#xD;
      care that were identified in our formative research. The focus of our intervention will be&#xD;
      providing RDTs and training health workers in management of both malaria and non-malarial&#xD;
      febrile illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study site:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in Tororo district, an area with very high malaria transmission&#xD;
      intensity. The estimated entomologic inoculation rate (EIR) in Tororo is 562 infective bites&#xD;
      per person-year, and the prevalence of parasitemia among children aged 5-9 years is 63.5%.&#xD;
      The five sub-counties of West Budama North Health Sub-district (Nagongera, Paya, Kirewa,&#xD;
      Kisoko, and Petta), and two sub-counties of West Budama South Health Sub-district (Mulanda&#xD;
      and Rubongi) will be included in the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the seven sub-counties, there are 22 lower-level government run health facilities,&#xD;
      including 17 level II health centers (HC), and 5 level III HCs; 20 will be included in the&#xD;
      randomization scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lower-level government-run health facilities in the study area will be the unit of&#xD;
      randomization. Clusters will be defined as the catchment areas of the health centers,&#xD;
      including households located within a 2km radius of the facilities. The clusters will be&#xD;
      defined prior to randomization using the full census survey database. Households will be&#xD;
      excluded from our sampling frame if they are &gt; 2km from any health facility. The&#xD;
      randomization will be conducted by an investigator who is not directly involved in the&#xD;
      project. Health facilities will be stratified by level (HC IIs and HC IIIs). Because of the&#xD;
      uneven numbers of HC IIs and IIIs, one of the HC IIIs without a laboratory will be 'demoted'&#xD;
      and paired with a HC II to ensure even numbers. Restricted randomization will be employed to&#xD;
      ensure balance on geographical location. Specifically, restrictions will be applied that&#xD;
      exclude the allocation of all clusters originating from a single sub-county, or that are&#xD;
      otherwise in close geographical proximity from being allocated to the same arm of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Health Facility Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is designed to address barriers to delivering quality care at health centers&#xD;
      and will focus on three components: (1) training in-charges in health center management, (2)&#xD;
      providing training to health workers in fever case management and patient-centered services,&#xD;
      and (3) ensuring adequate supplies of artemether-lumefantrine and RDTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Training in-charges:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All in-charges of health centers randomized to the HFI will be trained in health center&#xD;
           management. The purpose of this training is to equip in-charges with the skills and&#xD;
           tools required to effectively and efficiently manage their health center. The training&#xD;
           will include three components: (1) financial management, (2) supply management, and (3)&#xD;
           information management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Health worker training:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A)Training in fever case management and use of RDTs All clinical staff will receive&#xD;
           training in fever case management. Training will be based on the Integrated Malaria&#xD;
           Management training package developed by the Joint Uganda Malaria Training Program&#xD;
           (JUMP) team, and the RDT training guidelines which have been adopted and implemented by&#xD;
           Uganda's MoH 'User's manual: Use of Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) for malaria in fever&#xD;
           case management in Uganda'. The training program will be conducted by the JUMP training&#xD;
           team over two weeks; the first two days will focus on theory, and will be followed by&#xD;
           support supervision at the health facilities the next week. The training will be&#xD;
           conducted in Tororo at a local health facility, and health workers will be trained in&#xD;
           two small groups to ensure that work at the health facilities continues alongside the&#xD;
           training. The impact of training on knowledge will be assessed using a pre-and&#xD;
           post-training evaluation administered by the JUMP team. Additional support supervision&#xD;
           will be conducted at 6 weeks and 6 months after the initial training and refresher&#xD;
           training will be provided as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           B)Training in patient-centered services The purpose of the Patient-Centered Services&#xD;
           (PCS) training module is to identify and improve interpersonal interactions between&#xD;
           health workers and patients. The module builds on the results of our formative research&#xD;
           which identified several barriers to proving good quality health care at health&#xD;
           facilities, including poor interpersonal interactions between health workers and&#xD;
           community members resulting from poor communication skills, discriminatory behaviors of&#xD;
           health workers, poor health worker motivation, and lack of patient-centered thinking.&#xD;
           Through the PCS module, health workers will learn to recognize these challenges and&#xD;
           develop skills for communicating and interacting with patients. The PCS module training&#xD;
           will be implemented in a tiered approach to (1) all clinical staff, and (2) all health&#xD;
           center support staff. All clinical staff, including in-charges, will receive the full&#xD;
           PCS training package which includes self-observation tasks and specific emphasis on&#xD;
           clinical and patient interaction challenges. Support staff including volunteers will&#xD;
           receive a scaled-down PCS training package with specific emphasis on welcoming and&#xD;
           guiding patients at the health facility. All training activities and workshops will be&#xD;
           led by study personnel and trainers with experience in adult learning methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Supply of AL and RDTs for malaria If the amount of AL provided to the intervention&#xD;
           health centers by NMS is not adequate to meet demand, or if the procurement of AL fails,&#xD;
           the project will supply supplemental AL. In addition, we will ensure adequate supplies&#xD;
           of RDTs at all intervention health centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be measured in three distinct populations: (1) cross-sectional surveys of&#xD;
      children under 15 years randomly selected from households within the clusters; (2) a cohort&#xD;
      of children under five randomly selected from households within the clusters and followed for&#xD;
      2 years; and (3) patients attending all government-run health facilities, including children&#xD;
      under five and their caregivers participating in exit interviews on selected days every six&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cross-sectional surveys will be conducted in randomly selected children under-five, and&#xD;
           those between the ages of 5-15 years of age. The number of children sampled will be&#xD;
           weighted according to the total population of each cluster to achieve a harmonic mean of&#xD;
           200 for each age category. A total of 8766 children will be sampled in each survey.&#xD;
           Surveys will be conducted at baseline and then annually for each year; new populations&#xD;
           of children will be selected for each survey. The survey will include a structured&#xD;
           questionnaire administered to the primary caregiver, and a clinical and laboratory&#xD;
           assessment of each child.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A Cohort of children under five will be enrolled from 25 households randomly selected&#xD;
           from each cluster, for a total of 500 households. The cohort will be dynamic, in that&#xD;
           all children within a household, who are under the age of five and who meet selection&#xD;
           criteria, will be included. A household survey will be conducted at the start of the&#xD;
           study. Children will undergo clinical and laboratory assessments at baseline and then&#xD;
           every six months. Primary caregivers will be asked to prospectively collect information&#xD;
           on the clinical symptoms of participating children and expenditures for health care&#xD;
           using pictorial diaries. Study personnel will visit the households monthly to collect&#xD;
           the diaries and administer a monthly questionnaire. Participants will be followed for&#xD;
           approximately 18 months in total, the equivalent of approximately 12 months following&#xD;
           roll-out of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient Exit Interviews will be conducted with children under five and their caregivers&#xD;
           at all health facilities. The purpose of the interviews is to evaluate for rational&#xD;
           prescribing of ACTs, and to determine the level of satisfaction with the health facility&#xD;
           visit. Three rounds of surveys are planned. In the first two surveys, 10 patients will&#xD;
           be selected by convenience sampling from each facility to participate in the interviews&#xD;
           (200 total per survey). In the final survey, 50 patients will be recruited to&#xD;
           participate (1000 total in survey). In total, 1400 patients will participate in the&#xD;
           interviews.&#xD;
