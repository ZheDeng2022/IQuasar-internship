  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer&#xD;
      deaths in western countries. Colonoscopy is a preferred colorectal screening modality since&#xD;
      it has both diagnostic and therapeutic capability. Detection and removal of polyps at&#xD;
      colonoscopy decreases the incidence and mortality from colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typical practice is to insert the colonoscope rapidly until it reaches the cecum (a&#xD;
      pouch-like portion of the intestines, where the large bowel and the small bowel meet). The&#xD;
      physician then withdraws the colonoscope slowly and looks for any polyps or abnormalities&#xD;
      within the large bowel. The purpose of this study is to compare this standard practice to the&#xD;
      approach whereby the physician examines the bowel as the scope is initially inserted AND as&#xD;
      the colonoscope is withdrawn from patients' colons.&#xD;
