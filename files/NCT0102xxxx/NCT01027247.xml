    <textblock>
      Frequently glaucoma is not controlled with clinical treatment (&quot;eyedrops&quot;) or laser surgery&#xD;
      to control your eye pressure. If this raised pressure is sustained over a long period of time&#xD;
      it can lead to permanent damage to the optic nerve (glaucoma) and in severe cases it can&#xD;
      result in blindness. You also have cataracts, an opacification of the natural lens inside the&#xD;
      eye that is impairing your vision. To prevent further vision loss due to glaucoma, your&#xD;
      doctor has recommended glaucoma filtration surgery to lower your eye pressure, and cataract&#xD;
      surgery at the same time to improve your sight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of the anti-metabolite (Mitomycin-C) during the operation is currently the drug of&#xD;
      choice to improve surgical outcome for glaucoma filtration surgery. Mitomycin-C is a potent&#xD;
      antiscarring agent that reduces the amount of scar tissue produced after surgery which leads&#xD;
      to better control of eye pressure. Although this potent drug is effective in increasing&#xD;
      surgical success, its use is related to a higher risk of post surgical complications, some of&#xD;
      which are sight threatening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Collagen Matrix Implant is a biodegradable implant (absorbed naturally by tissue), made&#xD;
      from porcine collagen, which reduces scar tissue formed after glaucoma filtration surgery&#xD;
      without the use of Mitomycin-C. This means that you could be less likely to have a failed&#xD;
      glaucoma filtration surgery, and consequently, a poor eye pressure control. In addition, the&#xD;
      risk of surgical failure may be reduced because with this technique, we will not be using&#xD;
      potent drugs. However, the long-term effect of the OculusGenTm implant in glaucoma filtration&#xD;
      surgery is not fully known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine whether the OculusGenTm implant can equal the success&#xD;
      rate of Mitomycin-C in controlling eye pressure, without the potentially sight threatening&#xD;
      complications associated with Mitomycin use. And at the same time, this study aim to&#xD;
      determine if the implant can reduce potential complications related to glaucoma surgery when&#xD;
      compared to the combined surgery augmented with anti-proliferative agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit 66 subjects from patients attending the Singapore National Eye Centre&#xD;
      over a period of 12-24 months.&#xD;
