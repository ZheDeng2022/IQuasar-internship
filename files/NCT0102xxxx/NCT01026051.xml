  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical trial is evaluating a multi-component active immunotherapy designed to stimulate&#xD;
      an immune reaction to specific tumor associated antigens which are highly expressed on&#xD;
      melanoma&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The multi-component active immunotherapy, MKC1106-MT, consists of 1 plasmid dose and 2&#xD;
      peptides doses designed to stimulate an immune reaction to two tumor associated antigens&#xD;
      (Melan-A and tyrosinase). The plasmid component will be administered on Days 1, 4, 15 and 18&#xD;
      of each treatment cycle followed by administration of peptides on Days 29 and 32 of the&#xD;
      treatment cycle. All components will be administered separately into non-diseased superficial&#xD;
      inguinal lymph nodes under ultrasound guidance&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of regional or distant metastatic melanoma (stage&#xD;
             IIIB, IIIC, or IV) confined to skin, subcutaneous tissue, or lymph nodes that is&#xD;
             refractory to standard of care, or for which no curative standard therapy exists&#xD;
             (Note: Subjects who are therapy-na√Øve will also be eligible.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1&#xD;
             criteria&#xD;

             expression of melanoma specific antigens&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate coagulation function as evidenced by prothrombin time (PT) and partial&#xD;
             thromboplastin time (PTT) values within the normal range&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have recovered to at least baseline or Grade 1 toxicity from the effects&#xD;

             treated CNS metastatic disease [eg, radiation therapy] are eligible.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection requiring treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic inflammatory disease requiring chronic maintenance or suppressive therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive antibody test result for HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allogeneic transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical, sociological, or psychological conditions that may compromise compliance or&#xD;
             participation or that may interfere with the interpretation of the results&#xD;
