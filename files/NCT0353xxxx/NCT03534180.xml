    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and best dose of venetoclax and romidepsin to&#xD;
      see how well it works in treating patients with mature T-cell lymphoma that has come back&#xD;
      (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Venetoclax and romidepsin may stop&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of venetoclax with romidepsin,&#xD;
      including the dose ramp-up, in adults with relapsed or refractory mature T-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
      (Safety Lead-in) II. To estimate the efficacy as measured by the overall response rate (ORR)&#xD;
      of venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory mature T-cell lymphoma. (Phase 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the complete response rate, duration of response, time to response, overall&#xD;
      survival and progression free survival associated with venetoclax and romidepsin in&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory mature T-cell lymphoma. (Phase 2) II. To further characterize the safety&#xD;
      and toxicities of venetoclax and romidepsin combination in relapsed/refractory mature T-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma. (Phase 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine BCL2 protein expression in base line treatment tumor samples and correlatieon&#xD;
      with response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine changes in Bcl-2 gene expression in pre- and post-treatment tumor samples of&#xD;
      mature T- cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a safety lead-in dose-escalation study, followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and romidepsin&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 26 cycles&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

    <description>Defined using by Lugano Classification 2014. Rates and 95% Clopper-Pearson binomial confidence interval (CI) will be calculated for overall response rate (patients that have confirmed CR or PR), as well as for CR rate.

    <measure>Change in Bcl-2 gene expression</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at the end of cycle 1 or 2 (each cycle is 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor tissue samples will be collected from participants for assessment. Summary statistics and plots will be used to describe the pre- and post-treatment gene expression levels and the associated change between the timepoints. Paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used to explore the difference in gene expression levels before and after treatment. Data transformation such as log transformation will be considered if appropriate. For the exploratory correlation of these gene expression level/change with response, analyses comparing groups of participants defined by response may be conducted by two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test. For the exploratory correlation of these endpoints with survival outcomes, survival analysis techniques such as Log rank test will be used.</description>
