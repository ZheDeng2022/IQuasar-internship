    <textblock>
      This research is being done to determine if men with rising PSA after initial therapy for&#xD;
      localized prostate cancer who display the Alanine/Alanine SOD2 genotype of MnSOD and&#xD;
      supplement their diet with MPX have greater decrease in PSA slope following treatment&#xD;
      compared to men that do not supplement with MPX.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a single-chain glycoprotein produced by the epithelial&#xD;
      cells of the prostate. PSA has been used for early detection and monitoring of patients with&#xD;
      prostate cancer who receive a variety of treatments. Due to the widespread use of serum PSA&#xD;
      to monitor for prostate cancer recurrence following primary treatment, there exists a group&#xD;
      of men with a rising PSA as their only evidence of recurrence. These patients may not&#xD;
      demonstrate clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression for an average 8 years&#xD;
      from the time of detectable PSA to detectable metastatic disease by standard imaging.&#xD;
      Currently there are limited treatment options for these patients that may delay disease&#xD;
      progression or improve survival, including salvage radiation for prior surgical patients,&#xD;
      hormonal therapy, and active surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although some surgical patients are candidates for salvage radiation, not all patients will&#xD;
      want salvage radiation. Even the early initiation of hormonal therapy (e.g., luteinizing&#xD;
      hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogs) has not demonstrated a survival benefit, although&#xD;
      Schroder et al suggests an advantage for early hormone therapy in the setting of metastatic&#xD;
      regional lymph nodes. Furthermore, early initiation of androgen ablation is associated with&#xD;
      significant morbidity and impact on quality of life, including fatigue, hot flashes, loss of&#xD;
      libido, decreased muscle mass, and osteoporosis with long term use. This group of relatively&#xD;
      well men with biochemical recurrence are currently offered androgen ablation therapy or&#xD;
      active surveillance (regular PSA monitoring and annual scans) until there is evidence of&#xD;
      metastatic disease, because other options have not been available. These patients are&#xD;
      excellent candidates for innovative treatments hypothesized to slow the progression of&#xD;
      clinical prostate cancer and delay the development of metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the previous section documents, preclinical studies of muscadine grape skin offer evidence&#xD;
      that it may extend the time between biochemical recurrence and development of metastatic&#xD;
      disease. While the Phase II study described above found no significant difference in PSA&#xD;
      doubling time between placebo and either dose of MPX, there was a signal of benefit in the&#xD;
      subgroup analysis of men with the Alanine/Alanine superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) genotype that&#xD;
      received high dose MPX. It is therefore proposed to test the benefits of high dose MPX in&#xD;
      capsule formulation in a randomized, controlled study of men who have failed primary therapy,&#xD;
      either radiation, surgery or cryotherapy, as primary treatment for prostate cancer. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects will have a rising PSA and will have 3 PSA values at least 7 days apart with a&#xD;
      recovered testosterone to be able to calculate a baseline PSA doubling time. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint of this study will be mean PSA slope during the study period.&#xD;

DNA Methyltransferases (DNMTs) are a family of enzymes that regulate chromatin methylation and use S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor. Ellagic acid's metabolite, urolithin-A inhibits the protein complex nuclear factor kappa-light-enhancer of activated B-cells (NFkB), potentially leading to increased rates of apoptosis and decreases in cancer cell proliferation. Extracts from Vitis rotundifolia have shown inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway.</description>

        in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has undergone definitive treatment (surgery, surgery with radiation therapy,&#xD;
             cryotherapy, radiation therapy or brachytherapy) for the primary prostate tumor (prior&#xD;
             chemotherapy is not allowed) .&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. A subject with a rising PSA post-prostatectomy should consider radiation as a&#xD;
             potentially curative alternative. If subject declines radiation or is not a candidate&#xD;
             for radiation, he may be considered eligible in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has a rising PSA on a minimum of 3 time points (2 rises) within the 12 months&#xD;
             prior to study initiation (this will include the PSA measurement taken at the&#xD;
             screening visit, but not at the baseline day 0 study visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
             For purposes of calculating PSADT:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. All PSA values used in the calculation should be ≥ 0.20 ng/ml and overall should&#xD;

                  4 weeks between measurements;&#xD;

                  last PSA measurements must be at least 3 months, and, there is no minimum time&#xD;
                  interval requirement between any two PSA measurements;&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. For radiotherapy only patients, record PSA nadir value and collection date. PSADT&#xD;
                  must be positive according to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Prostate&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. A rise by 2 ng/mL or more above the nadir PSA will be considered the standard&#xD;
                  definition for biochemical failure after radiation therapy with or without&#xD;
                  hormonal therapy. (radiation only)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Subject agrees to abstain from other commercially available MuscadinePlus (MP)&#xD;
             products (Vinetra, MuscadinePlus or MP capsules) while participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject's use of other dietary/herbal supplements (e.g. saw palmetto, selenium,&#xD;
             pomegranate juice or pills, acai concentrated extract, etc) has been stable for at&#xD;
             least 2 months prior to screening and the subject agrees not to stop or change the&#xD;
             dose(s) while participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject has signed a written informed consent document and agrees to comply with&#xD;
             requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             an inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subject agrees to genotyping of manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase 2 (MnSOD2)&#xD;
             gene and any genetic counseling. Only those with Alanine/Alanine SOD2 genotype will be&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects meeting the following conditions are not eligible for participation in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has known radiographic evidence of metastatic disease, except for presence of&#xD;
             positive lymph nodes from the surgical pathology. Pelvic/intraperitoneal lymph nodes&#xD;
             less than 1.5 cm maybe considered nonspecific and the patient would be eligible. If&#xD;
             there is any clinical suspicion for metastatic disease, CT and Bone Scan must be&#xD;
             performed to rule out metastatic disease, within the last four months, per standard of&#xD;
             care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has received any therapies that modulate testosterone levels (e.g., androgen&#xD;
             ablative/anti-androgen therapy, 5 alpha reductase inhibitors) for a minimum of 12&#xD;
             months prior to study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has had prior or concomitant treatment with experimental drugs, high dose&#xD;
             steroids, or any other cancer treatment within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of the&#xD;
             study product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has consumed any Muscadine Plus over the past 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has a known allergy to muscadine grapes, ellagic acid or rice&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or&#xD;
             active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has negative PSA doubling time (negative doubling time corresponds with&#xD;
             decreasing PSA) Doubling time may be computed using the Sloan Kettering prediction&#xD;
             tools posted at&#xD;
