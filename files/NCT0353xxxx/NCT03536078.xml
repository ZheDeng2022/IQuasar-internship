  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a randomised controlled multicenter study.The primary aim is to&#xD;
      investigate if home phototherapy improves parent-child bonding compared to if treatment is&#xD;
      performed at the hospital. The investigators will also istudy how home phototherapy is&#xD;
      perceived by the parents, impact on breastfeeding and parents stress levels, if the method&#xD;
      can be implemented etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are included at 5 hospitals in Sweden. The plan is to include 250 term newborns with&#xD;
      neonatal icterus at a level that needs phototherapy treatment.&#xD;

      Background: Almost half of all newborns develops jaundice, due to elevated levels of&#xD;
      bilirubin. If levels are high phototherapy is needed to reduce the levels of bilirubin.&#xD;
      Presently most children with neonatal jaundice in Sweden receives phototherapy admitted to&#xD;
      hospital. There is fiberoptic equipment available that can be used at home to treat the&#xD;
      newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: Primary aim is to investigate if parent-child bonding is improved with home phototherapy&#xD;
      compared to phototherapy performed at the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:The study is designed as a randomised controlled multicenter study. Eligible parents&#xD;
      and newborns are randomised to either treatment at home or at the hospital. Demographic data&#xD;
      about the newborn such as for example apgar score, gender, time of birth etc are registered.&#xD;
      At time of discharge parents answers questionnaires such as for example the Postpartum&#xD;
      Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EDPS), the Swedish&#xD;
      Parenthood Stress Questionnaire etc. Parents experiences from home phototherapy will also be&#xD;
      investigated through semistructured interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will asked to answer questionnaires at the time of discharge as well as at 4-months&#xD;
      after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of data will be performed by using conventional parametric and non-parametric&#xD;
      statistical methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the study will be reported as scientific articles and as part of a thesis.&#xD;
