  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the overall survival (OS) time of elderly patients who would not&#xD;
      tolerate standard chemotherapy for PCNSL treated with WBXRT together with Optune-TTF to those&#xD;
      treated with whole-brain radiotherapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard treatment of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) for patients with good&#xD;
      performance status involves high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy regimens and&#xD;
      whole-brain radiation therapy (WBXRT). Although up to 20% of patients with PCNSL are 80 years&#xD;
      of age or older, little data exist with regard to optimal treatment of this patient&#xD;
      population and they often do not qualify for clinical trials. In addition, elderly patients&#xD;
      have a poorer rate of complete and partial response and increased risk of toxicity when&#xD;
      treated with standard chemotherapy regimens. Though a consensus does not exist, radiotherapy&#xD;
      alone is often used in these patients to minimize toxic effects of more aggressive&#xD;
      chemotherapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Optune TTF device has proven effective in treating high-grade gliomas and is currently&#xD;
      being investigated to treat meningiomas and metastatic lesions in the brain as well as other&#xD;
      tumor types elsewhere in the body. It is generally well tolerated with no known systemic side&#xD;
      effects, producing only an occasional local skin reaction. The mechanism of action is&#xD;
      independent of tumor type and therefore may be effective in treating lymphoma as well.&#xD;
