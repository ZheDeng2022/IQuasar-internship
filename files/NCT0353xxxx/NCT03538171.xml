  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized phase III trial is to evaluate the clinical benefit of&#xD;
      combining entinostat with exemestane in Chinese patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative,&#xD;
      locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, who have disease progression on endocrine&#xD;
      therapy. Additionally，the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of the treatment combination&#xD;
      are evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies entinostat combination with exemestane to see how&#xD;
      well they work compared to exemestane alone in treating Chinese patients with hormone&#xD;
      receptor-positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estrogen can drive the growth of breast cancer cells. Exemestane may fight breast cancer by&#xD;
      lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes from tissue aromatase. Entinostat may enhance&#xD;
      the anti-tumor effect of exemestane in breast cancer by helping to overcome tumor resistance&#xD;
      via epigenetic modifications. Previous Phase II trial in US breast cancer patients have&#xD;
      demonstrated significant effects of combined therapy in slowing disease progression and on&#xD;
      patient survival when compared to exemestane alone. It is not yet known whether exemestane is&#xD;
      more effective when combined with entinostat in Chinese patients with advanced breast cancer.&#xD;
      In this parallel, randomized, double blind, active controlled study, we will study the effect&#xD;
      of entinostat/placebo in combination with exemestane in Chinese patients with hormone&#xD;
      receptor-positive, HER2 receptor-negative, locally advance or metastatic breast cancer, who&#xD;
      have experienced disease progression with prior endocrine therapies.&#xD;

    <description>Progression Free Survival, defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (v1.1). The distribution of PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method, with 95% confidence intervals calculated using Greenwood's formula.

Stratified univariate and multivariable Cox proportional-hazard models will be built to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) for treatment effect for PFS as a supportive analysis.

             chemotherapeutic regimen，the end of chemotherapy should be at least 4 weeks before the&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The end of previous radiotherapy should be at least 2 weeks before the randomization,&#xD;
             and the patient must have recovered from the toxicity of radiotherapy (grade 1 or&#xD;

             prior to the first administration of treatment in the clinical trial, the same drug&#xD;
             must be used throughout the clinical trial, except that actual clinical situation that&#xD;
             requires amendment to the therapeutic regimen;&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients must have adequate hematological, hepatic and renal function one week (7&#xD;
