      The HEP2 study is designed to better understand the challenges of living with focal seizures&#xD;
      that do not respond to medication, by following 205 people with medication-resistant focal&#xD;
      epilepsy over two years to measure changes in health status, healthcare costs, quality of&#xD;
      life, and biomarkers of epilepsy severity and treatment response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Epilepsy Foundation is launching a partnership, called the Human Epilepsy Project, in&#xD;
      collaboration with the Epilepsy Study Consortium. This study (which is called HEP2 for short)&#xD;
      is designed to better understand the challenges of living with focal seizures that do not&#xD;
      respond to medication. The HEP2 study will follow 200 people with medication-resistant focal&#xD;
      epilepsy (with seizures that occur at least 2 times per month) over two years to measure&#xD;
      changes in their seizure frequency, treatments used, adverse events experienced, presence of&#xD;
      co-morbidities like depression and anxiety, healthcare costs, and quality of life. Blood&#xD;
      samples will also be collected in order to look for biomarkers of epilepsy severity and&#xD;
      treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can join the HEP2 study at any one of nine recruiting study centers. These study&#xD;
      centers were selected because they are epilepsy centers with track records of conducting&#xD;
      high-quality research in epilepsy and efficiently recruiting participants into studies. The&#xD;
      designated sites for the HEP2 study are located in New York, California, Minnesota,&#xD;
      Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. A participant may enroll in the HEP2 study but&#xD;
      continue to receive their standard epilepsy care with their current physician, as long as the&#xD;
      participant is willing to share his or her medical records, and travel to the study center&#xD;
      for two or three in person visits at the beginning of the study, after the first year, and a&#xD;
      final visit after the second year.&#xD;
