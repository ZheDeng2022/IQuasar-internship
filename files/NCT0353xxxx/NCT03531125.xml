  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease. The 1-year and 5-year survival rate is approximately&#xD;
      20% and &lt;5% respectively. The treatment options available are limited. Only around 10-20% of&#xD;
      patients present early enough to undergo surgical resection. Furthermore, chemotherapy for&#xD;
      more advanced pancreatic cancer leads to limited survival benefit and can cause significant&#xD;
      side effects. One of the main obstacles to developing new treatments for pancreatic cancer is&#xD;
      the limited understanding of how pancreatic cancer cells change/evolve/adapt following&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a pilot study to assess whether the investigators can track gene expression&#xD;
      (using a technique called RNA sequencing) in pancreatic cancer cells between two separate&#xD;
      time points. Investigators intend to take a tissue sample (biopsy) of the cancer using&#xD;
      endoscopy ultrasound (EUS) and compare it with samples taken either at the time of surgery in&#xD;
      those patients with resectable disease or follow-up EUS derived biopsies in irresectable&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interval between endoscopy and follow-up EUS or surgery will be approximately 2 to 3&#xD;
      weeks and reflects the standard period of time that patients wait from the time point at&#xD;
      which the cancer is deemed to be operable (in the multi-disciplinary team meeting) to the&#xD;
      actual operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the investigators find that the samples (biopsies) taken at EUS and at surgery or&#xD;
      follow-up EUS are comparable they plan to develop future clinical trials of similar design&#xD;
      but with the addition of drug therapy. The investigators will use RNA sequencing to&#xD;
      interrogate the effects of novel cancer drugs on gene expression within the tumour. This will&#xD;
      give them information on how to select patients for therapy, how resistance develops to these&#xD;
      treatments, and allow the investigators to better understand what treatments can be combined&#xD;
      on a rational basis. However, prior to undertaking such studies it is important to understand&#xD;
      how much variability there is in gene expression between sampling at 2 different time points&#xD;
      at which two different techniques are used.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female, aged 18 years or above&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with pancreatic cancer planned for surgical resection, or patients with&#xD;
             locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. For patients planned for resection the tumour must be within the head of the pancreas&#xD;
             such that the EUS biopsy sites and needle track can be resected surgically&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Adequate blood clotting parameters in order to undergo an EUS with biopsies, evidenced&#xD;
             by the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Platelet count ≥ 75 x 109L&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. International normalised ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients have given written informed consent and are willing and able to comply with&#xD;
             the scheduled visits, laboratory tests and study procedures including endoscopy (e.g.&#xD;
             patients able to lie flat without being breathless and have no evidence of oesophageal&#xD;
             stricture)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Previous histologically or cytologically confirmed pancreatic tumour that is not&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Other psychological, social or medical condition, physical examination finding(s) or a&#xD;
             laboratory abnormality that the investigator(s) considers would make the patient a&#xD;
             poor study candidate or could interfere with protocol compliance or the interpretation&#xD;
             of study results&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Positive screening pregnancy test if woman of child bearing potential&#xD;
