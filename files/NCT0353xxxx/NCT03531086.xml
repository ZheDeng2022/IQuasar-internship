      DaTscanTM Ioflupane I123, a radiopharmaceutical will be used as an adjunct diagnostic tool in&#xD;
      combination with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to evaluate striatal&#xD;
      dopamine transporter (DAT) distribution in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored twice - once at baseline, and again after 1 year - to identify&#xD;
      potential biomarkers for progression of Parkinson's disease.&#xD;

      Background: Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder involving&#xD;
      loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and subsequent dysfunction in the&#xD;
      striatum. The diagnosis of PD remains a clinical diagnosis based on patient history and&#xD;
      physical exam findings. In 2011 the FDA approved the use of DaTscanTM Ioflupane I123, a&#xD;
      radiopharmaceutical to be used as an adjunct diagnostic tool in combination with single&#xD;
      photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to evaluate striatal dopamine transporter (DAT)&#xD;
      distribution in patients with an unclear diagnosis of parkinsonism vs essential tremor (Bajaj&#xD;
      et al., 2013). Because the loss of DAT binding in the striatum reflects the loss of&#xD;
      dopaminergic neurons in parkinsonism, DAT SPECT is considered a highly sensitive test for&#xD;
      these disorders (Ba and Martin, 2015). The major clinical uncertainty with DAT SPECT imaging&#xD;
      is whether or not quantitative analysis can be utilized to determine progressive degeneration&#xD;
      over time and serve as a quantitative biomarker for changes in striatal dopaminergic&#xD;
      integrity in correlation with clinical worsening in patients with idiopathic PD. In 3 small&#xD;
      studies using two other ligands, 18F-dopa and I123Î²-CIT, striatal uptake declined annually by&#xD;
      12.5-13%, and 2.4% - 7.1%, respectively (Morrish et al., 1996; Nurmi et al., 2000; Pirker et&#xD;
      al., 2012). Current analytical methodologies have focused on establishing differences between&#xD;
      the PD and control groups, but have not explored the technology for tracking disease&#xD;
      progression with Ioflupane I123, using the patient as their own control. The goal of this&#xD;
      proposed study is to evaluate the validity of quantitative measurements in DAT SPECT scans in&#xD;
      determining disease progression in subjects with idiopathic PD. Data from this pilot study&#xD;
      would contribute significantly to future applications for investigating translational&#xD;
      research strategies to restore dopaminergic cell function in PD. More specifically, the&#xD;
      ability of autologous peripheral nerve grafts, acting as a source of neuroregenerative growth&#xD;
      factors, is being investigated in PD subjects undergoing deep brain stimulation (Craig van&#xD;
      Horne, PI). As there are no current biomarkers for PD progression, it is critical to evaluate&#xD;
      the potential for DAT SPECT to serve as an analytical tool for the quantification of&#xD;
      dopaminergic functional integrity. This study is designed to test the ability of DAT SPECT to&#xD;
      be used as an effective methodology for tracking disease progression where patients serve as&#xD;
      their own control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The specific aim is to evaluate the ability of DAT SPECT quantification to track&#xD;
      disease progression in subjects with idiopathic Parkinson's disease by comparing baseline&#xD;
      scans to those obtained 12 months later. The quantified DAT SPECT data will be clinically&#xD;
      correlated to the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale&#xD;
      (MDS-UPDRS) motor scores and Hoehn and Yahr stage obtained at baseline and at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This will be an initial phase of a prospective study evaluating DAT SPECT&#xD;
      quantification in subjects with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The clinical severity of PD&#xD;
      will be measured by MDS-UPDRS motor scores and the Hoehn and Yahr scale. Data will be&#xD;
      acquired at baseline, and 12 months. The subject will serve as their own control.&#xD;
