  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trauma is the leading cause of death for individuals ages 1-45 years old, within this cohort,&#xD;
      and uncontrolled hemorrhage is the leading cause of preventable death.1,2 Tourniquets have&#xD;
      been shown to be effective in dramatically decreasing death from uncontrolled hemorrhage on&#xD;
      the battlefield and there is level 4 evidence that EMS application of tourniquets in the&#xD;
      civilian sector is effective though not to the same degree as in the military.3,4 Multiple&#xD;
      national groups have advocated that to further decrease preventable deaths from hemorrhage,&#xD;
      laypersons should apply tourniquets before the arrival of professional first responders. To&#xD;
      this aim, the &quot;Stop the Bleed&quot; campaign has trained over 100,000 individuals in the US in&#xD;
      hemorrhage control techniques and tourniquet use with the Bleeding Control Basic (B-Con)&#xD;
      course.5 The &quot;Stop the Bleed&quot; campaign informs course participants all commercial tourniquets&#xD;
      are equivalent, and improvised tourniquets should be applied if a commercial tourniquet is&#xD;
      not available.6 The investigators are evaluating the ability of the B-Con course participants&#xD;
      to apply three different types of commercial tourniquets, the Rapid Application tourniquet&#xD;
      (RAT), the Stretch-Wrap-And-Tuck tourniquet (SWAT-T), and the Sof Tourniquet (Sof-T) as well&#xD;
      as participants ability to fashion an improvised tourniquet. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      B-Con in its current form does not enable course participants to apply other commercial&#xD;
      tourniquets beyond the specific one taught, the CAT tourniquet, and does not teach how to&#xD;
      apply an improvised tourniquet.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hemorrhage control by rapid application of commercial tourniquets has significantly improved&#xD;
      the survival of military personnel injured on the battlefield.7,8 The U.S. civilian&#xD;
      population has seen a spike in battlefield like injuries in the recent years, a prime example&#xD;
      being the Boston Marathon bombing.9,10 To address this issue, the American College of&#xD;
      Surgeons (ACS) formed a committee comprised of individuals from the fields of healthcare,&#xD;
      law-enforcement, fire department, pre-hospital care and the military. This committee came up&#xD;
      with a set of recommendation regarding first response and capacity building for hemorrhage&#xD;
      control, known as the Harford Consensus.11 These recommendations include educational programs&#xD;
      for lay-people in hemorrhage control with an emphasis on rapid and early tourniquet&#xD;
      application. There is level 4 evidence that after adjustment for covariates, emergency&#xD;
      medical providers' application of tourniquets in civilian trauma decreases mortality, though&#xD;
      not to the same dramatic degree seen in the military setting.12-14 Researchers are working to&#xD;
      show the effect of training of laypersons in hemorrhage control in the real world but no data&#xD;
      beyond the simulation setting is currently presented in the literature.15 Various groups have&#xD;
      developed training programs for hemorrhage control training, the most notable of which is the&#xD;
      ACS &quot;Stop the Bleed&quot; Bleeding Control Basic (B-Con) training.16 B-Con has trained over&#xD;
      100,000 individuals in the US since its implementation.5 Goralnick et. al. have shown that&#xD;
      there is moderate retention for the retention of B-Con specifically for application of the&#xD;
      Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT), which is also the type of tourniquet with the best&#xD;
      evidence for its use as it is the type used by the US military.17 However, the Hartford&#xD;
      consensus and the &quot;Stop the Bleed&quot; campaign state that &quot;(1) commercial windlass-type&#xD;
      tourniquets should be used in the prehospital setting for the control of significant&#xD;
      extremity hemorrhage when direct pressure is ineffective or impractical, (2) improvised&#xD;
      tourniquets should be used only if no commercial device is available.&quot;5,18 This advocacy for&#xD;
      types of commercial tourniquets beyond the CAT and, more significantly, for improvised&#xD;
      tourniquets has not been studied in either a simulated or real setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are multiple different tourniquet types available for which, while the principle is the&#xD;
      same for all, the actual mechanism and steps for application vary. B-Con in its current&#xD;
      iteration informs participants the principle is the same for both other commercial&#xD;
      tourniquets and improvised tourniquets, which is to be tight enough to occlude arterial&#xD;
      bleeding. Other courses which have been widely disseminated have taught how to use&#xD;
      tourniquets other than the CAT, such as the Stretch-Wrap-And-Tuck tourniquet (SWAT-T).19&#xD;
      Currently, the courses being offered typically only teach how to use one, and sometimes two,&#xD;
      different types of tourniquets. Furthermore, as there is not broad consensus statement about&#xD;
      which tourniquet type to use and teach, different groups distribute different types of&#xD;
      tourniquets in publicly available bleeding control kits, and professional first responders&#xD;
      carry different types of commercial tourniquets. A randomized trial has shown that among some&#xD;
      of the available commercial tourniquets, the CAT, ratcheting medical tourniquet (RMT), and&#xD;
      SWAT-T, the proportion of application for those without training ranges from 10.6-23.4%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The B-Con course presumption that participants understand tourniquet principles rather than a&#xD;
      single technique, which would enable them to apply devices they have not seen before, has not&#xD;
      been evaluated. In this context, the investigators would evaluate participants, immediately&#xD;
      after completing the full B-Con course, on their ability to apply different commercial&#xD;
      tourniquets than what they were trained on and their ability to apply a commercial&#xD;
      tourniquet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a) Prospective open-label trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a) Verbal consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. All participants will receive the ACS stop the Bleed training from qualified&#xD;
                instructors. This training is 45 to 60 minutes long, consisting of an audio-visual&#xD;
                presentation with tourniquet application instructions followed by hands-on training&#xD;
                under the supervision of an instructor. The training takes place in groups of 20 to&#xD;
                50 at a time. The audio-visual part of the training takes place in groups of 20,&#xD;
                which are then divided in to subgroups of 4-8 for hands-on training with an&#xD;
                instructor. There is no compensation for the study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The evaluation of hemorrhage control competence will take place individually. A&#xD;
                mannequin, the Hapmed tourniquet trainer, with a traumatic amputation of the leg&#xD;
                just above the knee will be present. A reviewer will provide instructions,&#xD;
                including that the lights on the leg represent continued bleeding and they will&#xD;
                have a maximum of 2 minutes to apply the tourniquet. The participant will be&#xD;
                provided a tourniquet and told to stop the simulated bleeding. Participants will be&#xD;
                tested in all 5 types of tourniquets sequentially using the same method but with&#xD;
                the order of testing varying according to the randomization. The reviewer will&#xD;
                start timing after telling the participant to begin. This will then be repeated for&#xD;
                the other type of tourniquet the individual will need to apply. No feedback will be&#xD;
                given to the participant throughout the testing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
           i) Supplies for the improvised tourniquet will include a T-shirt, long stretch of gauze,&#xD;
           a stick to act as a windlass, and a leather belt c) Parameters measured: i) The&#xD;
           participants will be timed until they feel that they have stopped the bleeding or they&#xD;
           tell the instructor they are done. The maximum amount of time provided to apply the&#xD;
           tourniquet will be 2 minutes based on the results of the investigators prior studies in&#xD;
           which the 90th percentile for time to correct application was 117 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii) Appropriateness of hemorrhage control will be determined by correct placements of&#xD;
           tourniquet as defined by at least 2 inches proximal to the amputation site iii) Adequate&#xD;
           pressure to stop the bleeding which will be set at 250 mmHg. For unsuccessful hemorrhage&#xD;
           control, the reason for failure will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           iv) Correct tourniquet application defined by: (1) Time to application &lt; 120 seconds (2)&#xD;
           Placement of tourniquet a minimum of 2 inches proximal to amputation (3) Tourniquet&#xD;
           application pressure &gt; 250 mmHg d) All the reviewers would be physicians, nurses and&#xD;
           EMTs, trained in hemorrhage-control. The complete test for each individual will not take&#xD;
           more than 15 mins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Randomization for the order of tourniquet application:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a) Permutated block randomization will be used to vary the order for application of the&#xD;
           5 different types of tourniquets (CAT, RAT, SWAT-T, Sof-T, and improvised tourniquet)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Pre-trial questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a) Study subjects will be given a pre-trial questionnaire to gather information&#xD;
           regarding age, gender, and level of education. The questionnaire will also include&#xD;
           questions to assess their knowledge regarding hemorrhage control and to determine their&#xD;
           willingness and self-reported comfort level in acting as a first-responder in a mass&#xD;
           causality scenario. Answers will be presented on a Likert-type scale or dichotomous&#xD;
           yes-no.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Post-trial questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a) After the hemorrhage control training, all participants will be given a questionnaire&#xD;
           to evaluate comfort level, self-efficacy, and other questions relating to hemorrhage&#xD;
           control response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Sample Size calculation was done for paired comparisons with 80% power and&#xD;
                Bonferroni corrected for 4 pairwise comparisons for an alpha level of 0.0125 and&#xD;
                correlation of 0.1. The largest difference was then taken as the sample size for&#xD;
                each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The expected corrected proportions for the different tourniquets are:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. CAT: 80-90% (Control)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. RAT: 10-30%&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. SWAT-T: 10-30%&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4. Sof-T: 20-40%&#xD;
&#xD;
                  5. Improvised: &lt; 10% ii) The smallest presumed difference in correct application&#xD;
                     for the CAT (control) at 80% is to the Sof-T at 40%. To attain 80% power with&#xD;
                     alpha of 0.0125 the required minimum sample size is 34.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. All sample size calculations performed using Stata v14.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Paired statistical tests using McNemars test will be used for the univariate&#xD;
                analysis of the primary outcome of correct tourniquet application comparing the CAT&#xD;
                tourniquet as a control (CAT being type of tourniquet taught in the B-Con course)&#xD;
                to each of the other tourniquet types (RAT, SWAT-T, Sof-T, Improvised) for 4 total&#xD;
                pairwise comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Descriptive statistical analysis (ANOVA, Kruskal-wallis, Mann Whitney U test,&#xD;
                Student T-test) will be used to assess the secondary outcomes of time to tourniquet&#xD;
                application, estimated blood loss prior to tourniquet application, and pressure&#xD;
                applied by the tourniquet.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Multiple Logistic regression will be used to assess for predictors of correct&#xD;
                tourniquet application for each of the different tourniquet types. The model will&#xD;
                include age, gender, education level, any prior hemorrhage control training, and&#xD;
                success in application for each of the other tourniquet types.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Descriptive statistics will also be used to assess participants responses on the&#xD;
                questionnaires. Non-parametric statistical tests (Wilcoxon signed rank test and&#xD;
                generalized estimating equations) will be used to assess 5-point Likert scale&#xD;
                questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. P-value for significance will be set at 0.05 after Bonferroni correction.&#xD;
