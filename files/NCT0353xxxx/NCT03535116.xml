  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been a longstanding teaching in plastic surgery that intra-operative ketorolac use for&#xD;
      postoperative pain control increases hematoma and bleeding in breast reduction surgery.&#xD;
      However, there is no literature that supports this teaching. Ketorolac is used routinely in&#xD;
      free flap reconstruction including breast reconstruction as well as many other surgeries&#xD;
      including hand surgery without increased risks of hematoma or bleeding. Ketorolac has been&#xD;
      shown to give good postoperative pain control. The object of this study is to look at whether&#xD;
      ketorolac increases the rate of hematoma/bleeding in breast reduction. If there is no&#xD;
      increased risk of hematoma, then ketorolac can be used safely for postoperative pain control&#xD;
      with an increased risk of hematoma/bleeding. Normally, without using ketorolac, the hematoma&#xD;
      rates in a breast reduction are 1-2%.&#xD;

      STUDY PROTOCOL&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Effect of Intra-operative Ketorolac on Hematoma Rates in Breast Reduction Surgery: A&#xD;
      Double Blind Randomized Control Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The purpose of this study to investigate hematoma rates of a single dose of&#xD;
      ketorolac given intra-operatively in breast reduction surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There is no statistically significant difference between the ketorolac and&#xD;
      placebo in hematoma rates after intra-operative single use in breast reduction surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Power analysis and sample size estimation was carried out with an alpha=0.05 and a&#xD;
      beta=0.80. This gave the study a power of 0.94 and sample size estimation of 260 patients per&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A consent form will be developed and the University of Saskatchewan ethics approval will be&#xD;
      obtained. The study will be registered as a trial through ClinicalTrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plastic surgeons in the study will start recruiting patients during their initial&#xD;
      consultation for breast reduction. The consultation will determine if the patient is a&#xD;
      candidate for a breast reduction clinically. The candidacy for a breast reduction is&#xD;
      determined strictly on a clinical basis and only then the patient will be considered to&#xD;
      participate in the study. If the patient meets inclusion criteria, the patient will be asked&#xD;
      to participate in the study. The process of the study as it pertains to the patient and the&#xD;
      risks/benefits of the study and the study medication will be discussed with the patient by&#xD;
      the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient agrees to participate in the study, they will be asked to sign the consent&#xD;
      form on the day of surgery. They will have a patient number(1-260) assigned to them. A&#xD;
      computer generated randomization process will determine if the patient will get ketorolac or&#xD;
      saline(placebo). A small piece of paper with either of the words &quot;ketorolac&quot; or &quot;saline&quot; will&#xD;
      be placed in an envelope with the corresponding patient number and sealed. This randomization&#xD;
      and envelope will be administered by the clinic nurse and a computer spreadsheet of the&#xD;
      patient number and medication to administered will be kept by the clinic nurse. The surgeon&#xD;
      or patient will not have knowledge of this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The breast reduction surgery will be performed in the usual manner as clinically dictated.&#xD;
      The anesthetist will be given the sealed envelope at the beginning of the case. Towards the&#xD;
      end of the operation, the anesthetist will open the envelope and administer the medication as&#xD;
      indicated in the content of the envelope, reseal the envelope and record what was given on&#xD;
      their anesthetic record. The surgeon will not have any knowledge of what medication was&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the breast reduction is finished, the patient will be transferred to the recovery room.&#xD;
      The surgeon will examine the patient in the recovery room or day surgery before the patient&#xD;
      is discharged to determine if there is a hematoma. If there is a hematoma, the surgeon will&#xD;
      inform the clinic nurse of such and the treatment of the hematoma(eg. Re-operation,&#xD;
      observation etc). Before the patient is discharged, the day surgery nurse will ask the&#xD;
      patient to indicate on the visual analog scale about their pain level(scale of 1-10). Then&#xD;
      the patient will be discharged home if appropriate. The patient will have instructions on the&#xD;
      signs of hematoma to watch out for in the form of written instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two weeks postoperatively and 6 weeks postoperatively, the patient will be seen for a&#xD;
      followup by the clinic nurse as an independent assessor for a hematoma. The presence or&#xD;
      absence of a hematoma will be recorded. If there is a hematoma, the surgeon will be notified&#xD;
      to assess the patient. The treatment of the hematoma will be communicated to the clinic nurse&#xD;
      by the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 6 week followup, the study for that patient will be finished. If the patient wishes&#xD;
      to know what medication that they received intra-operatively, the clinic nurse can inform&#xD;
      them at that point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be stored in a password protected computer at Dr. Chandran's office at 210-206&#xD;
      Wellman Crescent, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. At no point will any of the identifiable&#xD;
      data in this study's database be transferred off the premises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the collection of data for all patients, the data will be analyzed by the statistician&#xD;
      for the Department of Surgery of the University of Saskatchewan or their equivalent. The data&#xD;
      will be de-identified of patient names before sending to the statistician. A master list with&#xD;
      the patient names and the corresponding patient number will only be kept at Dr. Chandran's&#xD;
      office(above). The results will be discussed by the research team and&#xD;
      publication/presentation shall be determined.&#xD;
