      The Asthma First Aid Management for School Staff eBook has been developed for the purpose of&#xD;
      providing a multimedia self-directed training resource for school staff. The eBook will be&#xD;
      accessible to both primary and secondary school staff; it has the advantage over conventional&#xD;
      face to face training in that it can be used for learning when convenient, regardless of&#xD;
      geographical location. The eBook has been designed to provide school staff with an&#xD;
      alternative training option in contrast to a structured time scheduled face to face asthma&#xD;
      first aid management training session. The content of the eBook is based on the information&#xD;
      from the current Sydney Children's Hospital, Aiming for Asthma Improvement in Children&#xD;
      &quot;School Champion Asthma Management Program&quot; (SCAMP) face to face training course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been designed to determine the effectiveness of the eBook in meeting the&#xD;
      asthma first aid management training needs of school staff, prior to its implementation and&#xD;
      uploading to the Apple iBook store where it will be freely available to school staff&#xD;
      internationally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve school staff being randomized into one of the following two training&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 - a three hour face to face School Champion Asthma Management Program training&#xD;
      session (Standard training; control group) Group 2 - completion of the self-directed Asthma&#xD;
      First Aid Management for School Staff eBook (Technology assisted learning) The school staff&#xD;
      will be required to complete pre and post training validated asthma knowledge questionnaires&#xD;
      which will measure improvements in knowledge and confidence. In addition, demographic data&#xD;
      will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers hypothesize that the eBook will provide school staff with an alternative mode&#xD;
      of training that will effectively increase school staff asthma management knowledge and&#xD;
      confidence. We aim to investigate if this training is superior to the current three hour face&#xD;
      to face School Champion Asthma Management Program training.&#xD;

      1. STUDY SITE&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sydney Children's Hospital High Street Randwick Sydney Australia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. FUNDING AND RESOURCES&#xD;
&#xD;
           Existing funding from the Aiming for Asthma Improvement in Children Program (Chronic &amp;&#xD;
           Complex Care program, Ministry of Health) general cost centre has been used for the&#xD;
           development of resources and to support existing staff FTE's.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND INFORMATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1 INTRODUCTION The Aiming for Asthma Improvement in Children (AAIC) program has been&#xD;
           funded by the Ministry of Health as part of the NSW Chronic Disease Program. Its mission&#xD;
           is to improve the management of paediatric asthma through provision of standardised&#xD;
           resources, education and training, and promotion of best practice strategies, resulting&#xD;
           in a specialist coordinated paediatric asthma management service that facilitates&#xD;
           continuity of care between hospital and community services.&#xD;
&#xD;
           AAIC has well established health professional led asthma management training programs&#xD;
           for hospital clinicians and community groups which include public and private schools;&#xD;
           childcare services; and out of school hours care services. The School Champion Asthma&#xD;
           Management Program (SCAMP), implemented in 2010, is one example.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Based on the work of Professor Richard Henry in the Hunter Region of NSW the SCAMP model&#xD;
           adopts a train the trainer approach with a designated school staff member attending a&#xD;
           face to face SCAMP cluster training session and taking on the role as School Asthma&#xD;
           Champion for their school. With ongoing support from AAIC, the School Asthma Champion&#xD;
           facilitates feedback of asthma first aid information to staff within their school as&#xD;
           well as facilitating the implementation and maintenance of best practice school asthma&#xD;
           management procedures. The designated School Asthma Champion is an important&#xD;
           communication link between the school, student, parent, &amp; AAIC. To date, 138 schools&#xD;
           have participated in SCAMP with 77 schools having a current SCAMP trained School Asthma&#xD;
           Champion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Because the train the trainer is resource intensive and presents a barrier to training&#xD;
           Schools in remote and rural NSW, we have developed an eBook which will be downloadable&#xD;
           from the Apple iBook store. This has the advantage of being more convenient and&#xD;
           accessible to any School in NSW (and internationally) if they have an internet&#xD;
           connection and an Apple tablet or phone. Prior to its launch we propose to undertake&#xD;
           this this study to evaluate its effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 BACKGROUND INFORMATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           Asthma is a very common disease affecting children in Australia. There are over two&#xD;
           million Australians who have been diagnosed with Asthma and 1 in 10 children have been&#xD;
           diagnosed with the disease. The New South Wales Child Death Review Team found that 20&#xD;
           children in NSW alone died from asthma between 2004 and 2013 with the number of deaths&#xD;
           from asthma in children unexpectedly increasing between 2010 and 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
           School teachers are functioning as the carer for children with asthma when they are on&#xD;
           school grounds. As children spend on average 30% of their day in school it is clearly&#xD;
           vital that these teachers have the necessary knowledge and self-confidence to recognise&#xD;
           and manage regarding the symptoms of asthma. This requires both a theoretical&#xD;
           understanding of the disease process and a practical understanding of recognising signs&#xD;
           of disease and administering first aid treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is known that education of both patients and their carers is critical for improving&#xD;
           clinical outcomes. We currently have a face-to-face SCAMP training session for educating&#xD;
           school teachers about Asthma in place. However, it is resource intensive and does not&#xD;
           allow participation of Schools in rural and remote regions. In order to address these&#xD;
           issues, we have developed an eBook educational tool for school teachers based on this&#xD;
           SCAMP training session and is planned for implementation in 2016. The SCAMP program&#xD;
           general feedback has been very positive however we have not formally had the opportunity&#xD;
           of evaluating the program in a research setting, hence this proposed study is timely.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A review of the literature demonstrates that education programs targeting school&#xD;
           teachers can be effective in increasing knowledge and awareness about asthma in school&#xD;
           children, however formal evaluation of school asthma education programs such as SCAMP,&#xD;
           particularly in Australia, is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Furthermore, no evaluation has been undertaken using technology assisted learning, such&#xD;
           as an electronic book to train school teachers in first aid asthma management which is&#xD;
           the aim of this study. There are also no studies directly comparing the efficacy of&#xD;
           asthma education between face-to-face education and technology-assisted education.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If this study demonstrates effectiveness then it is likely to help with uptake from&#xD;
           teachers in Schools in Australia and other English speaking countries. It is crucial to&#xD;
           undertake the evaluation before publishing the iBook in the Apple store in order to&#xD;
           reduce bias during the planned study due to potential access of the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. STUDY OBJECTIVES 4.1 RESEARCH QUESTION Does technology assisted learning using an iBook&#xD;
           increase school staff knowledge and confidence in school asthma first aid management&#xD;
           greater than face-to-face training? The hypothesis of the study is that describing&#xD;
           asthma first aid knowledge by the SCAMP iBook is superior to standard face to face&#xD;
           training.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
           • To determine if the SCAMP iBook increases school staff asthma management knowledge&#xD;
           more than the current face-to-face training.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
           • To evaluate the usefulness of the SCAMP eBook as a self-directed multi-media teaching&#xD;
           resource&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1 STUDY TYPE &amp; DESIGN &amp; SCHEDULE&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a prospective randomised parallel study, coordinated by SCH AAIC and conducted&#xD;
           across NSW schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The target population will be primary and secondary school staff currently employed in a&#xD;
           NSW public or private school, who meet the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will be recruited to the study as outlined below and randomised into one of&#xD;
           two training groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group 1 - a 3 hour face to face School Champion Asthma Management Program training&#xD;
           session Group 2 - completion of the self-directed SCAMP iBook.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomisation will be done within each school to ensure equal matching of schools&#xD;
           demographics in both arms of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To meet the primary objective of the study, the validated Asthma First Aid Knowledge&#xD;
           Questionnaire will be completed prior to and following training.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To meet the secondary objectives, a 4 item 10 point Likert Scale asthma management&#xD;
           self-confidence questionnaire will be completed prior to and following training.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Surveys will be pre-numbered, consecutively i.e. 1, 2, 3 and randomly distributed to&#xD;
           participants, therefore any teacher could get any survey number.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Surveys will be emailed to teachers allocated to Group 2, and the survey number will&#xD;
           initially be recorded against email addresses however, this will be securely destroyed&#xD;
           once all surveys are distributed and returned.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The surveys themselves contain no identifying data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All data will only be accessible by the research team, named on this application. Data&#xD;
           will be saved on a password-protected hospital drive. No identifiable or re-identifiable&#xD;
           data will be published.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For Group 1 the appropriate forms will be provided before and after the education&#xD;
           session. Once completed these forms will be collected and stored as detailed in 11.1,&#xD;
           11.2, &amp; 11.3 of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For Group 2 the Pre Training questionnaires will be sent via email to all participants.&#xD;
           These will need to be completed and returned via email within one week of the sent date.&#xD;
           We will then send the secure link via email to the iBook along with the Post Training&#xD;
           questionnaires. These questionnaires will need to be completed and returned via email&#xD;
           within one week of the sent date. Once completed these forms will be collected and&#xD;
           stored as detailed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study will predominantly be conducted at centralised health care facility venues&#xD;
           and some NSW school locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2 RANDOMISATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           Once the participating schools with at least 2 willing participants have been identified&#xD;
           we will randomize the participating school teachers within each school into either Group&#xD;
           1 or Group 2 using an online randomization tool (HTTPS://www.randomizer.org).&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.3 STUDY METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study does not involve clinical or laboratory assessment. Data will be collected&#xD;
           through self-administered questionnaires, pre and post training. The questionnaires will&#xD;
           be collected before and after the face to face training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. STUDY POPULATION 6.1 RECRUITMENT PROCEDURE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be school staff currently employed in a NSW primary or secondary&#xD;
      school, who meet the inclusion criteria as listed elsewhere in the application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will be coordinated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Engagement of primary and secondary school education key stakeholders (DEC, AIS, &amp; CEC)&#xD;
           to assist in the promotion of the study to NSW school principals and encourage staff&#xD;
           participation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. AAIC to send follow up invitational email to school principals outlining overview of&#xD;
           study, participation involvement and inclusion criteria, and copy of consent form for&#xD;
           perusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. On receipt of acceptance by the school principal for school to participate, AAIC to&#xD;
           forward recruitment form with options of training dates / times / venues, for staff to&#xD;
           select their preferred training date.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Upon receipt of the registrations one of the investigators will contact the participant&#xD;
           by phone or email in order to determine whether they are appropriate for the study (ie&#xD;
           ensure they meet inclusion criteria and do not meet exclusion criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The principle investigator will then randomly assign each participant within each school&#xD;
           using the on-line random number generator to either Group 1 (Standard training; control&#xD;
           group) or Group 2 (Technology assisted learning).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Informed consent to participate in study will then be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.2 CONSENT In addition to receiving HREC approval from SCHN, we will need to receive&#xD;
           HREC approval from each of the Educational bodies. Informed written consent that reflect&#xD;
           both the education agency Ethics Committee Policy and the SCHN Ethics Committee Policy&#xD;
           will be obtained from all participants at the commencement of the study. Participants&#xD;
           can withdraw from the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants who wish to waive their consent at the commencement of training or withdraw&#xD;
           at any time during the study will not be included in the collection or publishing of&#xD;
           data but will be able to continue to undertake training in school asthma first aid&#xD;
           management via SCAMP face to face cluster training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. PARTICIPANT SAFETY AND WITHDRAWAL 7.1 RISK MANAGEMENT AND SAFETY This is a low and&#xD;
           negligible risk study. It will involve school staff participating in either face to face&#xD;
           asthma management training or self-directed technology assisted asthma management&#xD;
           training that they have agreed to undertake for the purpose of professional development.&#xD;
           They will be required to complete questionnaires immediately prior to commencing the&#xD;
           training and immediately at the completion of the training. We do not anticipate any&#xD;
           risks associated with the study as it aims to benefit staff through improved training&#xD;
           and support of participants. All care will be taken to deliver ongoing support to&#xD;
           participants during and following school asthma first aid management training.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.2 HANDLING OF WITHDRAWALS Should at any stage a participant withdraws from the study,&#xD;
           the relevant data collected pertaining to the individual will be securely destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.3 REPLACEMENTS Withdrawn participants will be replaced if the number of total&#xD;
           participants falls below the target number required for statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. STATISTICAL METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.1 SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION &amp; JUSTIFICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           The hypothesis of the study is that describing asthma first aid knowledge by the SCAMP&#xD;
           iBook is superior to standard face to face training.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary outcome measure, asthma first aid knowledge, and will be assessed by the&#xD;
           Asthma First Aid Knowledge Questionnaire which has been developed and validated by Dr&#xD;
           Bandana Saini and Kate Luckie at the University of Sydney. These validation studies have&#xD;
           not yet been published and form part of Kate Luckie's PhD's thesis. In collaboration&#xD;
           with the Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Sydney we will be utilising this&#xD;
           questionnaire with their kind permission to assess the primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.2 POWER CALCULATIONS Based on our current data and information from Dr Saini, the&#xD;
           sample size is 44 participants required both pre and post intervention in both groups.&#xD;
           This calculation is based on the 14-item version of the questionnaire where the&#xD;
           pre-intervention score is 11.18± SD 2.5(n=205). Assuming that post face-to-face training&#xD;
           there is a 10% improvement (i.e. expecting the final score in group 1 to be 12.68± SD&#xD;
           2.5), and that post iBook there is a further 10% improvement (i.e. expecting the final&#xD;
           score in group 2 to be 13.95± SD 2.5), 44 participants in both pre and post intervention&#xD;
           are required to demonstrate a significant change with a 80% power and significant set at&#xD;
           a 2 sided 5% value.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assuming a 15% drop out rate post intervention we aim to recruit 55 participants in each&#xD;
           arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.3 STATISTICAL METHODS TO BE UNDERTAKEN A paired t-test will be utilized to assess&#xD;
           pre-post scores and Likert scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. DATA SECURITY &amp; HANDLING&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.1 DETAILS OF WHERE RECORDS WILL BE KEPT &amp; HOW LONG WILL THEY BE STORED Data collected as a&#xD;
      hard copy will be stored in a locked cupboard, in an office in the Respiratory Department of&#xD;
      Sydney Children's Hospital Randwick. Data entered electronically will be saved in the AAIC&#xD;
      folder on the SCHN Network F drive, which is password protected. All data collected will be&#xD;
      stored for a minimum of 7 years with disposal by secure shredding or electronic erasure&#xD;
      consistent with the SCHN correct disposal of secure information policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.2 CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY Information provided by participants and their associated&#xD;
      schools will only be accessible to members of the research team. Published data will be&#xD;
      de-identified to maintain confidentiality. Written notification of confidentiality and&#xD;
      security will be documented on the consent form of which recruited school staff will have a&#xD;
      copy.&#xD;
