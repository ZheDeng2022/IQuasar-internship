    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem. This is the first cause of&#xD;
      hospitalization and mortality of about 65 years old. This syndrome is characterized by a poor&#xD;
      prognosis and a high cost of care. Thus, new strategies for treatment and prevention of the&#xD;
      HF are among the major challenges facing health sciences today.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of HF requires multimodal approach it involves a combination of&#xD;
      non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment, Besides improvements in pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment, supervised exercise programs are recommended for all patients with HF as part of a&#xD;
      non-pharmacological management but many questions regarding exercise training in HF patients&#xD;
      remain unanswered. Even simple questions such as the best mode of training for these patients&#xD;
      are unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First, to characterize the physiological functions involved in the genesis of exercise&#xD;
           intolerance and dyspnea especially muscle function (respiratory and skeletal), and&#xD;
           cardiopulmonary patients suffering from chronic HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Second, to study and compare the effects of different rehabilitation programs and prove&#xD;
           the superiority of the combination of three training modalities program: aerobic&#xD;
           training (AT), resistance training (RT) and inspiratory muscle training (IMT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These modalities are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aerobic Training: It has been proven effective in improving muscle abnormalities on changing&#xD;
      the ventricular remodeling, dyspnea, functional capacity, increasing the maximum performance&#xD;
      and reducing hospitalization in subjects suffering HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance Training: It has been proven effective in improving skeletal muscle metabolism and&#xD;
      angiogenesis; increasing capillary density and blood flow to the active skeletal muscles,&#xD;
      promoting the synthesis and release of nitric oxide, and decreasing oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selective Inspiratory Muscle Training: It has been proven effective in improving the strength&#xD;
      and endurance of the respiratory muscles and reduction of dyspnea during daily activities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Heart failure is the major cause of mortality and morbidity especially in elderly&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main feature of heart failure is exercise intolerance, which is always associated with&#xD;
      fatigue and dyspnea in exercises of low intensity. Harrigton et al in 1997 demonstrated the&#xD;
      existence of a dysfunction of skeletal muscles. But it is likely that these changes are not&#xD;
      limited to the musculature of the lower limbs but are widespread and may affected the&#xD;
      respiratory muscles. Thus, this dysfunction of the respiratory and skeletal muscles&#xD;
      associated with dyspnea can contribute to the genesis of fatigue and impaired physical&#xD;
      performance in turn reducing the autonomy of individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The guidelines recommend no pharmacologic strategies by specific exercises to relieve&#xD;
      symptoms, improve exercise tolerance and quality of life and reduce the rate of&#xD;
      hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The supervised exercise programs are recommended for all patients who have CHF as part of a&#xD;
      non-pharmacological management. Thus, the exercise remains the pioneer of cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs. The effectiveness of the training of the skeletal muscles against&#xD;
      resistance (RT) and aerobic training (AT) in the rehabilitation HF has been well documented.&#xD;
      However, selective training of respiratory muscles (IMT) is a relatively new technique in the&#xD;
      field of the ICC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1995, Mancini et al. were the first to publish a report on the advantage of selective&#xD;
      training of respiratory muscles in HF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another study showed the superiority of a high-intensity training, 60% of maximal inspiratory&#xD;
      pressure (PI max) on another 15% of PImax by increasing muscle strength and inspiratory&#xD;
      muscle endurance, improved exercise capacity, reduction of dyspnea and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the above studies have investigated the benefits of inspiratory muscle training alone&#xD;
      in CF patients, the question to ask is &quot;If the benefit of the inspiratory muscle training was&#xD;
      added to that observed with aerobic training for the whole body. &quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laoutaris in 2013 showed that the combination of AT with RT and IMT could result in a&#xD;
      significant improvement in peripheral muscle and respiratory function with significant&#xD;
      improvement in exercise capacity, dyspnea and quality of life compared to that of the 'single&#xD;
      AT. However, this study has several limitations. These limits are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients in the combined group suffer longer exercise sessions of 20 minutes compared to&#xD;
           patients alone aerobic group. Thus, the difference in the time to exercise between the 2&#xD;
           groups may have influenced the results of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Furthermore, the authors compared three different modalities of exercising against a&#xD;
           modality which affects so the quality of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In addition, the extent to which the resistance training or selective training of&#xD;
           respiratory muscles contributed to greater improvements in the combined group was not&#xD;
           assessed in this study as this would take several modalities groups different exercises&#xD;
           and a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Till now,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There are no randomized, controlled, double blinding studies that compares different&#xD;
           modalities of exercises to each other and to a control group in patients who have CHF.&#xD;
           Moreover,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. It is not known until now what combination of exercises modalities is the most effective&#xD;
           and more secure, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If there are additional benefits by combining multiple training modalities by comparing&#xD;
           it with other modalities in patients with stable chronic heart failure (CHF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators examined the hypothesis of the efficiency of a combined&#xD;
      program of three modalities: aerobics, resistance, and selective respiratory muscle on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Heart and lung function,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Heart and lung structure,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The function of skeletal and respiratory muscles,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Functional capacity,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Dyspnea, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of this project are defined:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To characterize the physiological functions involved in the genesis of exercise&#xD;
           intolerance and dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparative study of all therapeutic modalities with a control group and each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study muscle function: respiratory and skeletal in HF patients in different training&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To study the muscular structures: respiratory and skeletal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To study the structure and heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. See the influence of these three training modalities on functional capacity, dyspnea and&#xD;
           quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To state the guidelines for heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology and research requirements Protocol All subjects must sign an informed consent&#xD;
      form. Patients will submit a physical examination, and electrocardiographic measurements by a&#xD;
      cardiologist. Approximately 60 patients are divided randomly by investigators who are not&#xD;
      involved in the implementation of the project to eight different groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after the intervention were evaluated all the tests mentioned above by a&#xD;
      physiotherapist who do not know the distribution of patients to different interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups All types of training sessions are individualized and are carried in Beirut Cardiac&#xD;
      Institute. Patients are exerted for twelve weeks at a rate of three times per week, for one&#xD;
      hour. Any missed session will be added to the end of the program, so that the 36 sessions&#xD;
      will be realized. All sessions must be supervised at all times by a physiotherapist and a&#xD;
      cardiologist.&#xD;
