    <textblock>
      This is a Randomized, Double-blind, Multicenter Phase III Study Comparing Efficacy and Safety&#xD;
      of LY01008 (Recombinant Humanized Anti-Human Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Monoclonal&#xD;
      Antibody Injection) and Bevacizumab Combined with Paclitaxel and Carboplatin for Treatment of&#xD;
      Naïve Subjects with Metastatic or Recurrent Nonsquamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives are to compare the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of LY01008 and&#xD;
      bevacizumab combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin for treatment of subjects with&#xD;
      metastatic or recurrent nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will receive the treatment with LY01008 or bevacizumab combined with paclitaxel&#xD;
      and carboplatin for 4-6 cycles, and then both groups of subjects will receive the maintenance&#xD;
      monotherapy with LY01008 until occurrence of progressive disease (PD), intolerable toxicity&#xD;
      reaction, withdrawal of informed consent, loss to follow-up, death, conduct of other&#xD;
      antineoplastic therapy or completion of the whole study. The doses of LY01008 and bevacizumab&#xD;
      are 15 mg/kg in combination therapy. The dose of LY01008 in maintenance monotherapy is 15&#xD;
      mg/kg.&#xD;
