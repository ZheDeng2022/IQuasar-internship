  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, open-labeled pilot pragmatic clinical trial. Patients undergoing&#xD;
      arthroplasty surgery will be recruited for CYP2D6 pharmacogenetic testing from UF Health&#xD;
      Gainesville and the Villages Orthopedic clinics to manage post-surgical pain. Patient will be&#xD;
      randomized to either usual care or genotype-guided care.&#xD;

    <measure>Opioid consumption measured using morphine milligram equivalents (MME)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-weeks post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Opioid consumption calculated as the differences between participant reported opioid pills prescribed at the pre-operative appointment and opioid pills remaining at 2-week follow-up. This difference will be expressed as morphine milligram equivalents (MME) using standard conversion factors and the strength of the prescribed opioid analgesic.</description>
