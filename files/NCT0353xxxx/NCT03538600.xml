      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Laboratory of Immune System Biology (LISB) works with other labs at the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health. They study how parts of living things come together to make a whole.&#xD;
      LISB designs and improves research tests on human samples like blood and cells. In order to&#xD;
      do its work, LISB needs to have a lot of these samples available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect biological specimens to use for designing and improving research tests. Specimens&#xD;
      include blood, stool, saliva, and skin/mucosal swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people ages 18-80&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with an interview about their general health and their medical&#xD;
      history. They will have a physical exam and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the results of the screening are normal, participants will be asked to give one or more of&#xD;
      these samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn from an arm vein with a needle and syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mucus and skin will be collected by rubbing the area with a cotton swab. The areas may&#xD;
      include the top of the tongue, inside the cheek, nostrils, behind the ear, elbow pit, or&#xD;
      vagina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will spit into a tube to collect saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will pass stool into a plastic container that fits in the toilet under the seat.&#xD;
      They will get sampling kits and instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the next 5 years, if more samples are needed, participants will be contacted to set up&#xD;
      another visit to the NIH. These visits will each take about 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About every 2 years, when participants come to NIH for a visit, extra blood will be&#xD;
      collected. It will be tested for HIV and hepatitis B and C.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Laboratory of Immune System Biology plays a major role in fostering the growth of systems&#xD;
      biology efforts across the National Institutes of Health, in large measure through its&#xD;
      development of new tools for high-throughput data generation and complex systems modeling.&#xD;
      The lab s experimental component requires ongoing assay development and optimization, which&#xD;
      depend on the availability of human biological samples for testing. The primary purpose of&#xD;
      this protocol is to obtain biological specimens from healthy volunteers to support the lab s&#xD;
      development and optimization of scientific assays, and to use as control samples for research&#xD;
      tests in other studies. The secondary objective of this study is to track immunologic changes&#xD;
      over time using the assays developed and optimized in this study.&#xD;
