  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tear osmolarity refers to the amount of osmotically active particles in tears and has been&#xD;
      reported as one of the best diagnostic test for dry eye disease. Our research focused on&#xD;
      following changes in tear osmolarity and ocular symptoms in the time-course of one year after&#xD;
      refitting habitual contact lens wearers or fitting novices with modern daily disposable soft&#xD;
      contact lenses. Fifty-six contact lens wearers aged (mean ± standards deviation) 26 ± 4 y/o&#xD;
      were refitted with Silicone-Hydrogel (Delefilcon A) or Hydrogel (Omafilcon A) lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study included seven visits: baseline measurement before the study, two visits for contact&#xD;
      lens fit and control and follow-up measurements after three, six, and 12 months of contact&#xD;
      lens wear followed by measurements on bare eye according to the baseline scheme (post-study&#xD;
      visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An impedance-based osmometer was used to collect samples from the lower tear meniscus. A&#xD;
      standard Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire was used to monitor&#xD;
      subject-reported ocular symptoms. Statistically significant differences were noted in tear&#xD;
      osmolarity in the time course of the study for both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An improvement in tear osmolarity was most prevalent among subjects with high initial tear&#xD;
      osmolarity. Low osmolarity levels were maintained after the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings of this prospective study will reveal that habitual contact lens wearers or&#xD;
      novices may benefit from refitting with modern daily disposable soft contact lenses.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Tear osmolarity refers to the amount of osmotically active particles in tears and is defined&#xD;
      as the number of osmoles per litre of solution. It is mostly determined by the electrolytes&#xD;
      of the aqueous component of tears and less significantly by proteins and sugars. It has been&#xD;
      described as a single clinical measure that gives insight into the balance between tear&#xD;
      production, evaporation, drainage and absorption of tears. Studies support the use of tear&#xD;
      osmolarity as the best single diagnostic test for dry eye disease (DED) and the objective&#xD;
      numerical measure for diagnosing, grading severity, and managing DED. Clinical application&#xD;
      was facilitated after introducing a chip-based osmometer (TearLab® Osmolarity System, TearLab&#xD;
      Corp, San Diego, California, USA)7, which allows collection of a relatively small sample of&#xD;
      50 nL from the inferior tear meniscus and automatic determination of tear osmolarity, based&#xD;
      on the sample's conductivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The osmolarity of 308 mOsm/L is considered to be the most sensitive threshold to distinguish&#xD;
      normal from mild/moderate forms of DED and 315 mOsm/L the most specific cut off. Also the&#xD;
      inter-eye difference in osmolarity increases with DED severity and beyond the threshold of 8&#xD;
      mOsm/L it is considered an indication of the loss of tear film homeostasis. In normal&#xD;
      subjects this variation between eyes is around 6.9 ± 5.9 mOsm/L. Tear film with a contact&#xD;
      lens undergoes biophysical and biochemical changes, which have the potential to influence&#xD;
      tear function and impact comfort and contact lens tolerance. Many factors have been&#xD;
      associated with lowering of comfort and changes in tear dynamics during lens wear, however&#xD;
      the literature is divided over whether or not contact lens wear increases, or has no effect&#xD;
      on tear osmolarity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The differences in reported values are likely a function of the wearer's ability to maintain&#xD;
      tear film homeostasis, overcoming the drying effect of contact lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tear osmolarity was reported as the least variable of all the common signs across a&#xD;
      clinically relevant timeframe, and was the only sign to reduce its variation upon application&#xD;
      of effective therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tear hyperosmolarity is a clinical starting point in the pathogenesis of DED, responsible for&#xD;
      ocular surface damage, both directly and by initiating a chain of inflammatory responses&#xD;
      leading to ocular surface damage. Contact lens wear increases the risk of developing DED from&#xD;
      between 2.01 and 2.96 times. Wearers are much more likely to report discomfort, mostly&#xD;
      described as dryness and end of day dryness, than non-wearers and this factor remains the&#xD;
      single largest cause of contact lens wear discontinuation. However, a multifactorial nature&#xD;
      of DED, disguised as a lack of association between clinical signs and reported symptoms,&#xD;
      leads to underlying cause of contact lens discomfort and remains poorly understood. Contact&#xD;
      lens related DED may be explained by increased tear film thinning times resulting in&#xD;
      increased tear film osmolality or by the loss of corneal sensation particularly associated&#xD;
      with long-standing wear of hard and extended-wear contact lenses. Lowered corneal sensitivity&#xD;
      leads to decreased tear secretion in response to reflex stimuli presumably causing an&#xD;
      increase in tear osmolarity. Tear hyperosmolarity has been reported in daily and extended&#xD;
      wear of both soft and hard contact lens wearers, especially in symptomatic subjects.&#xD;
      Extended-wear soft contact lenses can decrease corneal sensitivity more than daily-wear soft&#xD;
      contact lenses. A significant increase in tear osmolarity could not be confirmed in subjects&#xD;
      wearing daily disposable soft contact lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have been conveyed to investigate the longitudinal effects of soft contact lens&#xD;
      wear on ocular physiology. These studies generally focused on different lens designs and&#xD;
      oxygen permeability and their impact on the ocular surface morphology, tear stability or&#xD;
      ocular surface sensory function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in ocular physiology during contact lens wear are evident, however the effect of&#xD;
      modern daily disposable contact lens on tear film osmolarity still remains unknown. In the&#xD;
      last decade significant advancements have been made in both contact lens technology and DED&#xD;
      diagnosis. Therefore, further evaluation of the influence of modern contact lenses on ocular&#xD;
      physiology is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this research is that the wear of modern daily disposable soft contact&#xD;
      lenses maintains tear film osmolarity in compliant habitual contact lens wearers or novices.&#xD;
      Hence, the objective was to investigate the potential changes in tear osmolarity experienced&#xD;
      during the wear of such lenses across a period of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained&#xD;
      from each participant after the nature and possible consequences of the study were explained.&#xD;
      The study recruited 60 healthy young novices or habitual contact lens wearers (41 F and 19&#xD;
      M), aged (mean ± standard deviation) 26 ± 4 y/o, ranging from 20 to 37 y/o. Habitual contact&#xD;
      lens users were advised to cease wearing their lenses and instilling ophthalmic solutions at&#xD;
      least three days prior to commencing the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was to ensure subjects previously wearing different types of contact lenses achieved a&#xD;
      more consistent baseline (bare eye) result. Subjects were also requested to present an&#xD;
      up-to-date optical prescription. Exclusion criteria were signs and symptoms of severe eye&#xD;
      dryness, inflammation or substantial tear flow impairment and any systemic disorders known to&#xD;
      compromise the ocular surface or tear film quality. Additionally, subjects were excluded if&#xD;
      demonstrated at least two out of the following signs of DED: OSDI higher than 23,&#xD;
      conjunctival staining higher or equal to 2 or/and corneal staining higher or equal to 2&#xD;
      present (Efron grading scale) and fluorescein tear film break-up time of less than 7 seconds.&#xD;
      The refractive error was limited to ±5.00 spherical and ±0.75 cylindrical diopters, as the&#xD;
      spherical equivalent of the correction was provided&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol consisted of a qualifying visit (Baseline), contact lens fitting visit&#xD;
      (following day - Day 2 visit), a control visit at 2 weeks and follow-up visits at 3 months, 6&#xD;
      months and 12 months post-refitting, followed by the visit for the post-study assessment&#xD;
      after three days (post-study visit). Laboratory temperature (°C) and humidity (%Rh) were&#xD;
      monitored with the thermo-hygrometry device (C3121, Comet, Czech Republic). Subjects could&#xD;
      have an environmental adjusting period if they arrived at the laboratory directly from the&#xD;
      outdoors. At each of the visits (except Day 2) OSDI questionnaire was filled-in by the&#xD;
      participants to assess ocular symptoms during the last week preceding each visit and to&#xD;
      distinguish symptomatic subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with OSDI ≥ 13 were reported as symptomatic, as this is the reported threshold&#xD;
      between healthy and mild/moderate DED subjects. The questionnaire was adapted to the&#xD;
      subjects' native language. During the Baseline visit, together with OSDI, the review of&#xD;
      medical history was performed including general and ocular health, refractive correction&#xD;
      type, modality and refractive power, visual acuity (distance and near), the date of last eye&#xD;
      examination and last medical examination, history of previous contact lens wear, family&#xD;
      ocular history, allergies, medication, occupation, driving, visual display unit use, smoking&#xD;
      and hobbies. This was followed by tear osmolarity measurements with TearLab Osmolarity System&#xD;
      (TearLab Corp. San Diego, CA. Measurements performed at Baseline were used for qualifying&#xD;
      subjects to the study and formed the baseline database for comparative analyses with the&#xD;
      measurements performed at follow-up visits. Measurements at Baseline and post-study visit&#xD;
      were performed at the same time of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Day 2 (the following day) subjects were fitted with Silicone-Hydrogel (Si-Hy, Delefilcon&#xD;
      A) or Hydrogel (Hy, Omafilcon A) daily disposable soft contact lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newly-fitted lens was chosen based on contact lens fit, reported subjective comfort after 4&#xD;
      hours of wear and pre-lens tear film surface quality. Contact lens fit assessment included&#xD;
      contact lens centration, corneal coverage, horizontal lag, blink movement, push-up test and&#xD;
      the binocular corrected visual acuity rating for distance and near vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A supply of contact lenses was provided for each subject, with the instruction to wear the&#xD;
      lenses for any five days per week, minimum eight hours and up to 12 hours per day. The same&#xD;
      wearing schedule was followed for the whole duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects were fully instructed on insertion, safe removal and lens care together with the&#xD;
      given written instructions. The purpose of the 2-week control visit was to ensure good&#xD;
      contact lens performance, comfort and fit and to qualify subjects for 12 months of contact&#xD;
      lens wear. At three-, six- and 12-month visits subjects were advised to wear their contact&#xD;
      lenses at least five hours prior to attending. The protocol for these follow-up visits&#xD;
      included OSDI questionnaire filled in during an environmental adjusting break, osmolarity&#xD;
      measurements on bare eye and ocular anterior surface check-up with the slit-lamp&#xD;
      biomicroscope to assess ocular surface health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tear osmolarity was measured for both eyes of each subject from the inferior lateral tear&#xD;
      meniscus. Electronic check cards calibration of the instrument was performed daily according&#xD;
      to the manufacturer's instruction. The calibration using a control solution was performed&#xD;
      every time a new box of test cards was opened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device was powered for the whole duration of the study where diagnostic pens were kept&#xD;
      fully charged. The device and the test cards were stored in the laboratory in which the&#xD;
      measurements were conducted. The same diagnostic pen was used for all measurements, starting&#xD;
      the assessment, every time, with the right eye. Samples were collected by the same&#xD;
      experienced researcher from the eye without contact lens, 10 minutes after subject taking the&#xD;
      lenses off. Subjects were asked to sit with their chin tilted slightly upward and eyes&#xD;
      directed toward the ceiling. The tip of the pen was positioned just above the lower eyelid&#xD;
      and gently applied to the thin line of tears on the lower eyelid margin. Care was taken not&#xD;
      to induce reflex lacrimation. After successful collection, the values were recorded. At least&#xD;
      two measurements for each eye were performed. If the results were not consistent (differed&#xD;
      more than 10 mOsm/L), the third measurements was conducted. The tear film osmolarity was&#xD;
      measured at the Baseline, three-month, six-month, 12-months and the post-study visits.&#xD;
