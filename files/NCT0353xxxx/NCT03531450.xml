  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center pilot study to be conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to examine the non-pharmacological impact of Cognitive Behavioral&#xD;
      Therapy (CBT) on gastroparesis symptoms and other clinical co-comorbidities such as pain,&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, and catastrophizing. CBT trial patients will undergo careful phenotyping&#xD;
      pre- and post- intervention with brain MRI, autonomic function test (AFT), gastric emptying&#xD;
      scintigraphy (GES), wireless motility capsule test (WMC), and nutrient drink test (NDT) to&#xD;
      determine the impact of CBT on these metrics in patients with gastroparesis. Characterization&#xD;
      of these relationships or lack thereof can help guide future development of more targeted&#xD;
      approaches and optimize treatment strategies for gastroparesis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled trial will examine the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      (CBT) on gastroparesis symptoms (including pain related brain circuitry). CBT reduces pain&#xD;
      intensity, negative affect, and disability among patients with chronic pain, though there is&#xD;
      a good deal of individual variability in treatment effects. Treatment gains following CBT are&#xD;
      maintained or enhanced at 6 to 12-month follow-up. This study will examine the brain&#xD;
      circuitry underlying these effects. In addition, as measures of gastroparesis symptoms and&#xD;
      pain are correlated with other, more general, measures of negative affect (e.g., depression,&#xD;
      anxiety), we will evaluate the specificity of the hypothesized effects by running the&#xD;
      proposed statistical models both with and without inclusion of these conceptually overlapping&#xD;
      factors. Based on pervious findings and published data, we expect that treatment-associated&#xD;
      changes in pain and depression will likely share 10-20% of their variance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment sessions will use active, structured techniques to alter distorted thoughts, with a&#xD;
      focus on acquiring and practicing cognitive and emotional modulatory skills. CBT is based on&#xD;
      a pain self-management paradigm, and involves the identification and reduction of maladaptive&#xD;
      pain-related cognitions (i.e., catastrophizing) using techniques such as relaxation,&#xD;
      thought-stopping, distraction, etc. CBT prominently emphasizes in-vivo practice during each&#xD;
      session, and features home practice using written exercises. In particular, cognitive&#xD;
      restructuring is used to help patients recognize the relationships between thoughts, feelings&#xD;
      and behaviors. Patients learn to identify, evaluate, and challenge negative thoughts. In our&#xD;
      protocol, each of the 8 weekly sessions will last for approximately 90 minutes and will be&#xD;
      conducted or supervised by a trained psychologist. Following CBT, negative emotions are no&#xD;
      longer closely linked to pain, suggesting that CBT provides patients with the skills to&#xD;
      modulate and buffer their negative emotions such as catastrophizing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo pre- and post-treatment testing through a variety of methods including&#xD;
      brain MRI with associated physiological data, autonomic function test (AFT), gastric emptying&#xD;
      scintigraphy (GES), wireless motility capsule test (WMC), and nutrient drink test (NDT) to&#xD;
      determine the impact of CBT on these metrics in patients with gastroparesis. Characterization&#xD;
      of these relationships or lack thereof can help guide future development of more targeted&#xD;
      approaches and optimize treatment strategies for gastroparesis.&#xD;
