      A single-institutional cohort to determine the prevalence of new immunohistochemical panel in&#xD;
      advanced triple-negative submitted to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and its association with&#xD;
      response and survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Background/Rationale: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is known to be a heterogeneous&#xD;
      disease, and different molecular sub-classifications are proposed based in specific&#xD;
      biomarkers as immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of the androgen-receptor (AR), Epidermal&#xD;
      growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), Cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6), Cytokeratin14 (CK14), Cytokeratin 17&#xD;
      (CK17), clusters of differentiation 117 (CD 117), p53, Ki67 level, Programmed cell&#xD;
      death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2 in tumor cell membrane and the pattern of tumor infiltrating&#xD;
      mono-lymphocytes (PD-1+, FOXP3+, CD 4+ or cluster designation 8 (CD8 +), CD 3+, cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation 56 (CD56+), cluster designation 68 (CD68+) or CD 14+). Predicting response&#xD;
      and survival to neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced triple-negative breast cancer&#xD;
      remains a major challenge. Many doubts still prevail over the role of new biomarkers in&#xD;
      predicting different outcomes for tumors with the same stage and morphological&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To evaluate the association of the intratumoral lymphocytic infiltrate&#xD;
      (TILs) status profile in the core biopsy with complete pathological response (CPR) outcomes&#xD;
      to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary objectives: To&#xD;
      evaluate the association of the others biomarkers expression profile and the quality of TILs&#xD;
      with PFS and CPR. To determine the prevalence of a large immunohistochemical panel (AR, EGFR,&#xD;
      CK5/6, CK14, CK17, CD 117, p53, Ki67 level, PD-L1 and PD-L2 in tumor cell membrane and the&#xD;
      pattern of tumor infiltrating mono-lymphocytes PD-1+, FOXP3+, CD 4+ , CD8 +, CD 3+, CD56+,&#xD;
      CD68+ and/or CD 14+), before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. To determine if the&#xD;
      negativation of biomarkers after the systemic treatment is associated with CPR and PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A cohort with retrospective data collection and sectional analysis of&#xD;
      pathological material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Source(s): Medical records and pathological material. Study Population: Women with&#xD;
      locally advanced triple negative breast cancer consecutively enrolled at Brazilian National&#xD;
      Cancer Institute (INCA) submitted to neoadjuvant treatment and subsequently operated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure(s): Status of specified biomarkers. Outcome(s): Complete Pathologic Response and&#xD;
      Progression free Survival and Sample Size Estimations: With a type I error of 5% and study&#xD;
      power of 80%, it is estimated that 155 patients are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS (version 18.0 for&#xD;
      windows, statistical package for social science (SPSS) Inc., Chicago, IL). Survival curves&#xD;
      will be constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method.&#xD;

        Women who is biopsied and diagnosed with breast cancer in the public health system is&#xD;
        referred to Brazilian National Cancer Institute (INCA) through a registry and screening&#xD;
        performed by the Municipal Health Department of the city of Rio de Janeiro. Therefore, it&#xD;
        becomes a great field for research of cancer patients by the large number of cases.&#xD;
        Absolutely all patients enrolled in INCA for treatment have their biopsy material reviewed&#xD;
        in DIPAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In this cohort, will be studied women with locally advanced TNBC consecutively enrolled at&#xD;
        INCA between January 2010 and December 2014 that were submitted to neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
        and subsequently operated.&#xD;
