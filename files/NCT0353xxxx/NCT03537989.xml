    <textblock>
      This is a protocol for a trial carried out from 1999 to 2002. At that time, surgical patients&#xD;
      received a large volume of intravenous saline during operations on the colon or the rectum,&#xD;
      often so much fluid that their bodyweight increased by 4-6 kilograms. We hypothesized; that a&#xD;
      restricted fluid regimen could prevent the development of cardiopulmonary complications and&#xD;
      improve wound healing including the healing of an anastomosis of the gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We designed a clinical randomized assessor blinded multi-center trial comparing a restricted&#xD;
      fluid regimen to a standard fluid regimen, the difference being the volume of saline&#xD;
      administered to the patients. Patients undergoing surgery on the colon or the rectum were&#xD;
      included after informed oral and written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The restricted regimen aimed at zero-fluid balance with allowance for a body weight increase&#xD;
      of 1 kg. The standard regimen was a bit &quot;dryer&quot; than the actual standard; our patients in the&#xD;
      standard group received saline causing a body weight increase of only 3-4 kg. The fluid&#xD;
      therapy started at midnight the day of operation, went on through the operation and continued&#xD;
      on the wards until discharge. The patients were encouraged to eat and drink as much and as&#xD;
      soon as possible after the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome was the number of patients who died or suffered a complication measured&#xD;
      within 30 days of surgery. We looked at all complications, but especially heart and lung&#xD;
      complications and complications related to the healing of wounds and anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients was examined in the outpatient clinic after 30 days, and in addition, blinded&#xD;
      assessors were reviewing the medical files for registration of postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results are published in The Annals of Surgery 2003; 238(5)641-48. The restricted regimen&#xD;
      nearly halved the number of patients with complications, and heart and lung complications&#xD;
      were almost eliminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other investigators confirmed the results, and a more restricted approach to fluid therapy to&#xD;
      surgical patients has been implemented worldwide.&#xD;

      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To show the effect of a restrictive fluid regime compared to a standard regime by the&#xD;
      frequency of complications in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have risen suspicions of fluid balance, and especially a large amount of&#xD;
      water and NaCl administration, can be a significant factor in developing postoperative&#xD;
      complications (1, 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1990 in Critical Care Magazine, Lowell et al. described patients who in transferring to&#xD;
      intensive therapy had an increased weight of &gt; 10% of their preoperative weight, had a&#xD;
      significantly higher mortality rate of 31.6 % than patients with an increased weight of &lt;&#xD;
      10%, who only had a mortality rate of 10.3 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies, have described, how all patients undergoing gastroenterological operations&#xD;
      increase their body weight by 2-4% of the preoperative weight during the first 24 hours&#xD;
      following surgery due to the perioperative saline intravenously (2, 3). The patients have&#xD;
      been given a median of 6-7 L saline intravenously during the day of operation. This is fully&#xD;
      comparable to other studies (3, 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous guidelines in anesthesiological departments, a volume of saline of 15 ml/kg&#xD;
      bodyweight was administered during the first hour of surgery, and 7.5 ml/kg during the&#xD;
      following hours. Furthermore, any blood loss was replaced by 2.5 ml saline per ml blood lost&#xD;
      (6-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in the study by Beier-Holgersen et al. returned to their preoperative weight&#xD;
      after 4-5 days. In this material of 60 patients, six patients developed leakage of the bowel&#xD;
      anastomosis, and two patients died from AMI and ARDS. Nine patients with severe complications&#xD;
      had a weight gain of 6-14%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increased postoperative fluid retention results in increased universal edema, which can&#xD;
      significantly affect the tissue's microcirculation and oxygenation. This may have influenced&#xD;
      the healing of intestinal anastomoses and the development of cardiovascular and pulmonary&#xD;
      complications, which typically occurred during the third postoperative day. Based on this, it&#xD;
      is therefore relevant to investigate whether perioperative intervention against fluid&#xD;
      administration can improve the postoperative course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective randomized multicenter study with stratification for each center. Block&#xD;
      randomization with four patients per block. It is necessary to incorporate several centers&#xD;
      for the investigation to be finished within a reasonable time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two x 70 patients scheduled for colorectal resection. The number is determined from previous&#xD;
      works (1, 2) finding a total complication rate of at least 30% after colorectal resection in&#xD;
      post-operatively early-nourished patients. The investigators wish to reduce this to 10%&#xD;
      (MIREDIF = 20%). The risk of Type 1 error (5%) is set low to avoid overlooking a possible&#xD;
      gain. The risk of Type 2 error is set at 20% (power at 80%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the material is unlikely to meet the normal distribution, the number of participant's&#xD;
      increases to 70 in each group, i.e. 140 patients must be included. In order to reduce the&#xD;
      variation, each center must include at least 16 patients (which means that up to nine centers&#xD;
      have to participate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients are included preoperatively after informed consent. An investigator at the&#xD;
           local center randomize the patients to either standard fluid treatment or restrictive&#xD;
           perioperative fluid treatment. The main difference between the two regimes is that less&#xD;
           isotonic saline is administered in the restrictive regime. Anesthesia and postoperative&#xD;
           nutrition regimes are the same in the two groups. The patients are ASA and Apache 2&#xD;
           scored.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Weight registration: The patient is weighed on the same set of scales at the time of&#xD;
           hospitalization (entry weight), after bowel cleansing, and in the morning on the day of&#xD;
           operation (preoperative weight). Hereafter daily weighing every postoperative morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood tests: Blood is withdrawn on the day of hospitalization, on the day of operation&#xD;
           in the morning, on arrival in the recovery ward and the following 7 days (or until&#xD;
           discharged).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Anesthesia: Patients must fast for food from midnight before surgery, but they can have&#xD;
           clear fluids up to 2 hours preoperatively, but max. 500 ml from midnight.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Premedication is a tablet of Triazolam 0.125 mg with 50-100 ml of water by mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Combined epidural and general anesthesia are used: An epidural catheter is inserted&#xD;
           corresponding to TH10-12, tested with Lidocaine 2% and adrenaline 3-4 ml. After 3-5&#xD;
           minutes this is supplemented with refracted doses of Bupivacaine 0.5% until the blockade&#xD;
           is sufficient (often about 8-12 ml). Continuous infusion of Bupivacain is administered&#xD;
           0.5%, 4-8 ml/hour. Finally, a bolus injection of 2 mg Morphine is administered. General&#xD;
           anesthesia is induced with Fentanyl 5μg/kg, Thiopental 3-4 mg/kg and Rocuronium&#xD;
           (Esmeron®) 0.6 mg/kg (all doses are modified according to each patient's needs and&#xD;
           cardiovascular condition). Anesthesia is maintained with Isoflurane 0.2-0.4% end-tidal&#xD;
           concentration in oxygen / atmospheric air (inspiratory oxygen concentration 30-35%). The&#xD;
           neuromuscular block can be reverted with neostigmine when needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypotension Diagnosis and Treatment: Detailed guidelines for clinical treatment and&#xD;
           handling are given in the case report forms (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Perioperative fluid treatment: During operation, fluid is submitted and recorded in the&#xD;
           CRF. Fluid balance is calculated at the end of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Monitoring: Standard anesthesia monitoring as recommended by Danish Anesthesiological&#xD;
           Society. A central vein catheter (CVK) is placed if needed after the initiation of&#xD;
           anesthesia to measure central venous pressure (CVP) until the patient is discharged from&#xD;
           the recovery ward. Arterial blood gases and hematocrit are withdrawn immediately after&#xD;
           the initiation of anesthesia, immediately after arriving at the recovery ward and before&#xD;
           the patient is transferred to the surgical ward, in addition to clinical needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Surgery: Surgery is performed in accordance with the department's routines. During the&#xD;
           surgery, a nutritional feeding tube is inserted in the duodenum for postoperative&#xD;
           enteral nutrition. If the tube cause nausea, the tube is removed and the patient will&#xD;
           consume nutrition according to ability by mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Antibiotic prophylaxis, bowel cleansing, physiotherapy, etc. follow the usual guidelines&#xD;
           of the respective departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Postoperative fluid treatment and nutrition during the day of operation: Fluid&#xD;
           recordings continue from the end of the anesthesia, on the recovery ward and for the&#xD;
           rest of the day of operation. On the day of operation, 600 ml of Nutri-concentrated 75&#xD;
           is given in the feeding tube. Nutri-concentrated 75 contains 200 kcal and 7.5 g protein&#xD;
           per 100 ml. 1000 ml pr. Day cover the recommended daily allowances for vitamins and&#xD;
           minerals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Fluid treatment and nutrition in the following days: Nutri-concentrated 75® 1000 ml/day&#xD;
           is continued the first three postoperative days. Thereafter the patient is expected to&#xD;
           eat normally. The fluid regime in the restrictive group assessed based on the patient's&#xD;
           weight, ability to drink independently and blood samples. The standard regime follows&#xD;
           the department's usual postoperative regime.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Postoperative analgesia: The basis is an epidural infusion of the standard mixture of&#xD;
           Bupivacain-Morphine (5 mg Morphine + 250 mg Bupivacain in NaCl to the volume of 100 ml),&#xD;
           4-8 ml/hour. In addition, Morphine 5-10 mg p.n. If there are no contraindications,&#xD;
           Paracetamol or NSAID can be administered (orally or rectally). The epidural pain&#xD;
           treatment is continued postoperatively for a maximum of 4 days, after which the epidural&#xD;
           catheter is removed. If the patient need analgesics hereafter, opioid is given by mouth&#xD;
           or intravenously as well as Paracetamol and/or NSAIDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. For the treatment of nausea the following may be given: Ondansetron (Zofran®), Cisapride&#xD;
           (Prepulsid®), Metoclopramide (Primperan®) or DHB.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. A postoperative outpatient visit with the investigating doctor is planned 4 weeks after&#xD;
           the surgery. Postoperative complications are registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the project is voluntary and inclusion is after informed consent. Consent&#xD;
      can be withdrawn at any time without further explanation, and without this affecting the&#xD;
      patient's treatment in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no risk associated with participation in the project, but discomfort associated with&#xD;
      additional blood sampling for the project, no more than 4-5 times. However, these blood&#xD;
      samples will preferably be taken from the CVK, so the patient avoids being stabbed&#xD;
      unnecessarily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the long term, a treatment benefit is possible and this appears to outweigh the discomfort&#xD;
      mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is registered with the Scientific Ethics Committee (multicenter study) and The&#xD;
      Danish Data registration agency in accordance with applicable guidelines. All&#xD;
      person-identifiable data is destroyed after the project is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addendum to the protocol written during the patient inclusion and before the trial was&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both too little and too much fluid administered intravenously may be harmful to the cardiac&#xD;
      function (low oxygen supply and congestion) and cause cardiovascular complications:&#xD;
      Postoperatively developed arrhythmias, AMI, pneumonia, pulmonary congestion, postoperatively&#xD;
      developed pleural exudate, pulmonary edema or ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both too little and too much fluid administered intravenously may be harmful to tissue&#xD;
      healing (low oxygen supply and interstitial edema) and cause complications related to tissue&#xD;
      healing and infection: Infections of the wound, bursting of the wound (superficial and&#xD;
      deeper), leakage from the anastomosis and separation of stoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigating surgeon or anesthesiologist perform the randomization by opening&#xD;
      consecutively numbered opaque envelopes. The randomization is stratified for each center and&#xD;
      for colonic and rectal surgery the latter by opening an envelope with highest number for&#xD;
      rectal surgical patients, and with lowest number for colonic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specialist surgeons reading the medical journals censored for all information about&#xD;
      randomization group, fluid therapy given or bodyweight measurements will perform a blinded&#xD;
      assessment for the primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two doctors will evaluate each patient file, and in case of disagreement, a third will decide&#xD;
      the outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intention to treat analysis will be performed for the primary outcome for all patients&#xD;
      included in the trial whether or not they met a post randomization exclusion criterion, and&#xD;
      therefore did or did not receive the allocated treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A per protocol analysis will be performed for the primary outcome for all patients fulfilling&#xD;
      the in- and exclusion criteria whether or not they adhered to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analysis will be performed for the patients with Major-, Minor-, Cardio-pulmonic-&#xD;
      and tissue-healing complications.&#xD;
