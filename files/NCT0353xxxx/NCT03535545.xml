  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to investigate the safety of [68Ga]CBP8 and its efficacy to detect&#xD;
      collagen deposition in pulmonary fibrosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed [68Ga]CBP8, a gallium-68 labeled collagen binding PET&#xD;
      imaging probe, which selectively binds collagen type I. Collagen deposition is a pivotal&#xD;
      event in several human conditions including pulmonary fibrosis. The investigator's studies in&#xD;
      mice showed that [68Ga]CBP8 binds collagen with high affinity and has excellent&#xD;
      pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profiles with high target uptake and low retention in&#xD;
      background tissues and organs. [68Ga]CBP8 was shown in a mouse model to be effective for&#xD;
      detecting lung fibrosis. [68Ga]CBP8 showed high specificity for pulmonary fibrosis and high&#xD;
      target:background ratios in diseased animals. In addition, [68Ga]CBP8 could be used to&#xD;
      monitor response to treatment. Ex vivo analysis of lung tissue from patients with IPF&#xD;
      supported the animal findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators thus aim to perform the first in human studies of [68Ga]CBP8:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the safety of [68Ga]CBP8 and its whole body distribution, metabolism,&#xD;
           pharmacokinetics, and radiation burden in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To establish the accuracy of [68Ga]CBP8-PET to detect radiation-induced fibrosis in lung&#xD;
           cancer patients and correlate collagen-targeted [68Ga]CBP8-PET imaging with HRCT and&#xD;
           histology in lung cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether collagen deposition as assessed by [68Ga]CBP8-PET molecular imaging&#xD;
           can predict disease progression in IPF patients and patients with other types of ILD&#xD;
           with a fibrotic component.&#xD;
