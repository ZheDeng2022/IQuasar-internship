  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some prostate cancer keeps growing even when testosterone in the body drops to very low&#xD;
      levels. This is called castrate-resistant prostate cancer. One treatment is enzalutamide.&#xD;
      This is a modern hormonal therapy. But it only works for a certain amount of time and then&#xD;
      the cancer becomes resistant to it. Researchers want to see if adding the treatment CRLX101&#xD;
      could make enzalutamide work again for people who have already had it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test a new way of treating prostate cancer using CRLX101 plus enzalutamide in people with&#xD;
      certain prostate cancer who already had enzalutamide treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 years and older with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer who have&#xD;
      had enzalutamide treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will have blood&#xD;
      and urine tests. They will have a scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis. They will have a bone&#xD;
      scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get treatment in cycles. A cycle lasts 28 days. They will take enzalutamide&#xD;
      by mouth once a day. They will get CRLX101 through an IV every 1 or 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will repeat screening tests throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up visit 3-4 weeks after they stop taking the study drug.&#xD;
      They will repeat most screening tests and have an electrocardiogram.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enzalutamide is established as first-line hormonal therapy in participants with&#xD;
           metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, it is increasingly&#xD;
           recognized that acquired resistance to therapy (e.g. AR overexpression, AR-V7) could&#xD;
           limit the durability of response to therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upregulation of HIF-1Alpha in hypoxic tumor cells provides a mechanism of acquired&#xD;
           resistance to current hormonal therapies and chemotherapies. Acquired resistance&#xD;
           increases angiogenesis and metastasis, leading to disease progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Targeting the hypoxia driven tumor microenvironment (e.g. down-regulation of HIF-1Alpha)&#xD;
           in addition to the androgen receptor (e.g. enzalutamide) has synergistic activity&#xD;
           against prostate cancer cell line models (e.g. LNCaP, 22Rv1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CRLX101 is a nanoparticle drug conjugate composed of 20(S)-camptothecin (a potent and&#xD;
           highly selective topoisomerase I inhibitor with anti-HIF-1Alpha properties) conjugated&#xD;
           to a linear, cyclodextrin-polyethylene glycol-based polymer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CRLX101 has been to shown to be safe, tolerable, and efficacious in numerous Phase II&#xD;
           clinical investigations in a variety of tumor subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preclinical and clinical studies have shown CRLX101 significantly down-regulates&#xD;
           HIF-1alpha, impacting tumor-driven angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The treatment combination of CRLX101 and enzalutamide provides a reasonable approach to&#xD;
           re-sensitizing prostate cancer cells to hormonal therapy via synergistic antitumor&#xD;
           activity and inhibition of acquired resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Primary Objective: To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of CRLX101 at the recommended phase&#xD;
      II dose (RP2D) in combination with enzalutamide with respect to treatment response, defined&#xD;
      as greater than or equal to 50% PSA decline or stable disease on imaging following 5 months&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have progressive mCRPC per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3(PCWG3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age and able to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG Performance Status less than or equal to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluable metastatic disease on bone scan or measurable disease on CT Scan per PCWG3&#xD;
           and/or RECIST&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have had disease progression while receiving prior enzalutamide treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted using an optimal two stage Phase II design (8 participants,&#xD;
           expandable to 21 participants total) aimed to determine the percentage of participants&#xD;
           with a PSA decline of greater than 50% or stable disease at 5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first 3 to 6 participants enrolled on study will follow a lead-in dosing scheme to&#xD;
           confirm the safety of the combination (CRLX101 12 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks for the first&#xD;
           two cycles, followed by CRLX101 15 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks at the start of cycle 3, with&#xD;
           enzalutamide 160 mg administered once daily starting on cycle 1 day 2) prior to&#xD;
           initiation of the optimal two stage study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For participants enrolled on study following the lead-in, the confirmed tolerable dose&#xD;
           of CRLX101 will be administered via IV infusion every 2 weeks. Enzalutamide 160 mg will&#xD;
           be administered orally once daily beginning on cycle 1 day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine will be collected at multiple time points for PK and PD analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor assessments will be made using 99Tc bone scintography and/or CT scan (chest,&#xD;
           abdomen, and pelvis) at baseline, prior to Cycle 3 and every 3 cycles thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The accrual ceiling for the study is set at 30 participants.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate cancer confirmed&#xD;
             by either the Laboratory of Pathology at the NIH Clinical Center or Walter Reed&#xD;
             National Military Medical Center at Bethesda prior to starting this study. If no&#xD;
             pathological specimen is available, patients may enroll with a pathologist s report&#xD;
             showing a histological diagnosis of prostate cancer and clinical course consistent&#xD;
             with the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have progressive mCRPC. There must be radiographic evidence of disease&#xD;
             progression or biochemically (rising PSA levels on successive measurements) recurring&#xD;
             disease despite adequate testosterone suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Progression must be evidenced and documented by any of the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PSA progression defined by a minimum of two rising PSA levels with an interval of&#xD;
                  greater than or equal to 1 week between each determination&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Appearance of one or more new lesions consistent with prostate cancer on bone&#xD;
                  scan&#xD;

               -  New or growing lesions on CT scan&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have metastatic disease, per RECIST 1.1(64).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have received treatment with prior enzalutamide for two or more cycles&#xD;
             and must have had evidence of disease progression while on enzalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received antiandrogens such as flutamide, bicalutamide, or&#xD;
             nilutamide for &gt;6 months immediately before enrollment on this study must be off&#xD;
             treatment for 4 weeks (6 weeks for bicalutamide) and demonstrate a continued rise in&#xD;
             PSA. Patients on antiandrogens for &lt;6 months must be off medication for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are&#xD;
             currently available on the use of enzalutamide and CRLX101 in patients &lt;18 years of&#xD;
             age and prostate cancer is not common in children &lt;18 years of age, children are&#xD;
             excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  leukocytes greater than or equal to 3,000/mcL&#xD;

        creatinine levels above institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have castrate levels of testosterone (&lt;50 ng/dL [1.74 nmol/L]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have undergone bilateral surgical castration or must continue on GnRH&#xD;
             agonists/antagonists for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on 5-alpha reductase inhibitors such as finasteride or dutasteride must stop&#xD;
             medication at least 28 days prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of enzalutamide and CRLX101 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason and because androgen receptor antagonists and topoisomerase I inhibitors&#xD;
             as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic,&#xD;
             all study subjects must agree to use a condom during the study treatment period and&#xD;
             for 120 days following the last dose of study drug. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while her partner is participating in this study, she should&#xD;
             inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to&#xD;
             60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents. A minimum washout period&#xD;
             of 28 days is required prior to the initiation of on study treatment unless the&#xD;
             patient is receiving immunotherapy, for which the minimum washout period will be 14&#xD;
             days. This is because Immune-related toxicities are distinct and unlikely to synergize&#xD;
             with this protocol therapy, a shorter washout period is reasonable and customary in&#xD;
             clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have been treated with prior secondary hormonal manipulations with&#xD;
             proposed investigational rationale for having efficacy against AR-V7 splice variants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        This includes but is not limited to EPI-002 and AZD5312. (Note: patients previously treated&#xD;
        with abiraterone, orteronel (TAK-700), apalutamide (ARN-509), galeterone, or VT-464 will be&#xD;
        eligible for this study. Patients who have received prior chemotherapy will also be&#xD;
        eligible for this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a recent (within 1 year) history of seizure or any condition that, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator, significantly increases seizure risk. Also current or&#xD;
             prior treatment with anti-epileptic medications for the treatment of seizures.&#xD;
             Transient ischemic attack within 12 months prior to study enrollment will not be&#xD;
             permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to enzalutamide, CRLX101, or other agents used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history within the last 3 years of another invasive malignancy&#xD;
             (localized non-melanoma skin and bladder cancers are allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, uncontrolled hypertension (SBP&gt;170/DBP&gt;105), or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             situations within 6 months that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received palliative radiotherapy within 2 weeks of study entry and&#xD;
             have not recovered to Grade 1 or baseline from associated toxicities. Note: Patients&#xD;
             may receive palliative radiation once enrolled on study. The subject has not recovered&#xD;
             to baseline or CTCAE less than or equal to Grade 1 from toxicity due to all prior&#xD;
             therapies, including surgery, except alopecia and other non-clinically significant&#xD;
             AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unable to swallow tablets or have a gastrointestinal disease that&#xD;
             could hinder the absorption of enzalutamide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The use of any herbal products that may lower PSA levels (e.g. saw palmetto).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with microscopic hematuria (defined as &gt;100 RBCs on urinalysis) or worsening&#xD;
             urinary symptoms within 7 days prior to the initiation of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             potential pharmacokinetic interations with study drugs. However, patients with&#xD;
             long-standing (&gt;5 years) HIV on antiretroviral therapy &gt;1 month (undetectable HIV&#xD;
             viral load and CD4 count &gt; 150 cells/micro L) may be eligible if the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator or designee determines no anticipated clinically significant drug-drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION OF MINORITIES AND WOMEN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Men of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial. Women are excluded as&#xD;
        prostate cancer does not exist in this population.&#xD;
