  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test a new intervention for sleep disturbance among hematopoietic cell transplant&#xD;
      survivors. About 60 hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) survivors will participate in this&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Steps: To conduct qualitative interviews with patients, caregivers, and&#xD;
      clinicians regarding sleep disturbance in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) survivors and&#xD;
      on preferences for a new mHealth intervention for sleep disturbance. About 30 individuals (10&#xD;
      HCT survivors, 10 caregivers and 5-10 clinicians) will participate in this part of the study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will collect qualitative interview data from HCT survivors, caregivers, and&#xD;
      clinicians to inform the development of a new mHealth intervention. Then, this new&#xD;
      intervention will be developed by adapting existing interventions that were originally&#xD;
      designed for other cancer and non-cancer populations.A virtual reality relaxation component&#xD;
      will also be developed as an adjunct to the mHealth stepped-care intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention participants will complete a baseline survey via the internet about their&#xD;
      demographics, health, and well-being. The baseline survey also includes questions about their&#xD;
      sleep and will take approximately 1 hour to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be provided brief behavioral therapy through the mHealth intervention.&#xD;
      Participants would be monitored passively via actigraphy for the next 30 days. Those who&#xD;
      continue demonstrating clinically significant sleep disturbance 30 days after starting the&#xD;
      intervention would then receive a more intensive therapy with a trained therapist via&#xD;
      videoconferencing. This videoconferencing therapy, adapted from cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      for insomnia, will also be a built-in part of the mHealth intervention. Thus, the new mHealth&#xD;
      intervention will be delivered via mobile device to enhance disseminability and improve&#xD;
      access for survivors who typically live long distances from their HCT center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then Sixty HCT survivors with clinically significant sleep disturbance will be recruited 90&#xD;
      days after HCT and be block-randomized based on sex to receive usual care (n=20), the new&#xD;
      mHealth stepped-care intervention (n=20), or the new mHealth stepped-care intervention&#xD;
      +virtual relaxation component (n=20). Outcomes will be assessed before randomization as well&#xD;
      as 30 and 60 days later. Participants will complete a validated self-report measure of sleep&#xD;
      disturbance, and for objective measurement of sleep participants will be asked to wear a&#xD;
      Fitbit and allow Fitbit data to be uploaded to the intervention for customizing individuals'&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention, participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire to provide&#xD;
      feedback on the intervention and participate in a post-intervention interview with a member&#xD;
      of the study team.&#xD;

    <description>The study will be considered acceptable if 50% of eligible patients approached for study participation sign consent and if &gt; 50% of the mHealth stepped-care intervention group participants report that they are at least &quot;mostly satisfied&quot; with the intervention on a validated satisfaction scale. That is, at least half report an average score of ≥ 3 on a scale of 1 to 4 on this instrument.</description>

    <time_frame>60 days post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep disturbance will be operationalized by scores on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and sleep efficiency (the percentage of time spent in bed that is spent asleep). For secondary efficacy analyses participants will be categorized as having sleep disturbance if their Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score is ≥ 5 (for subjectively-measured sleep disturbance) and if their sleep efficiency is &lt;85% (for objectively-measured sleep disturbance).</description>

    <description>Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) survivors, caregivers and clinicians will participate in this part of the study. HCT survivor participants will be asked to nominate and provide contact information for the person who was their primary caregiver before, during, or after their HCT hospitalization. All participants will be asked to participate in either an in-person or telephone interview that will last approximately 1 hour. The interview will be digitally audio-recorded and will ask questions on the trajectory of sleep disturbance in HCT recipients and strategies to manage common barriers to quality sleep, as well as discuss the planned intervention for sleep disturbance in HCT survivors.</description>
