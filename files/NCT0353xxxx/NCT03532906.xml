  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to hopefully understand the most beneficial way to control pain&#xD;
      after removing the gallbladder by keyhole surgery (laparoscopic cholecystectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will investigate two groups of patients undergoing laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One group will receive the injection of local anaesthetic into the abdominal wall (TAP block)&#xD;
      and into the wounds; the second group will have local anaesthetic into the wounds only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to have meaningful results, we anticipate a large number of participants would be&#xD;
      required. Therefore we would test first whether it is technically possible to set up the&#xD;
      study itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be looking at parameters (willingness of patients to be recruited,&#xD;
      willingness of clinicians to recruit participants, number of eligible patients, follow-up&#xD;
      rates, adherence/compliance rates, number of participants needed for an adequate sample size)&#xD;
      that will allow to understand if such a larger trial is technically possible to set up.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain control after laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be achieved with the injection of local&#xD;
      anaesthetic into the abdominal wall (TAP block) or into the surgical wounds. There is no&#xD;
      reported literature comparing the two techniques with regard to early discharge rate,&#xD;
      consumption of oral painkillers and return to daily activities in the week following surgery.&#xD;
      In an era where day case surgery has become reality, there is a pressing need for strategies&#xD;
      to optimize patients' pathways. In this context the postoperative pain control is a key&#xD;
      point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the two techniques in a randomized trial, a large number of participants would be&#xD;
      needed. Therefore the investigators would conduct a pilot study first, to evaluate if further&#xD;
      research in the form of a larger study is likely to demonstrate the benefits of the TAP block&#xD;
      during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the developing of the research proposal, advice and comments had been given by the&#xD;
      local Research and Development Department and the public.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians will identify potential participants in the surgical outpatient clinic. All&#xD;
      patients who fulfil the entry criteria will be invited to take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be fully informed verbally about the proposed study and will receive a&#xD;
      Letter of invitation to participant and a Patient information leaflet to take home. That will&#xD;
      give them adequate time to read the documents and make an informed choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      As being a feasibility study it is required to have 30 cases per group in the final dataset,&#xD;
      with a total of 60 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be informed about the study and receive the information leaflet at the time&#xD;
      they are enrolled for an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the surgical outpatient&#xD;
      clinic. Only once patients are fully informed will they be asked to make a decision to enter&#xD;
      the trial. Participants willing to join the study will have written informed consent, on the&#xD;
      day of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be informed that they do not have to take part in the study if they choose to&#xD;
      not be enrolled. Refusal to enter the trial will not compromise their care. Patients will&#xD;
      also be informed that if at any time during the study they wish to withdraw they can do so,&#xD;
      without having to give a reason and again this will not compromise their care. General&#xD;
      Pratictioners will be informed by letter of their patients' inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no additional risks over and above participants' normal clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both anaesthetic techniques are currently in use in the Royal Devon and Exeter National Heath&#xD;
      System Foundation Trust. The procedures themselves do have potential risks (side-effects)&#xD;
      which would be explained routinely to both trial and non-trial patients ahead of surgery.&#xD;
      Taking part in this study will not change these risks in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no immediate benefits to the participants from taking part in the trial at present.&#xD;
      However, if the results are promising, the investigators will run a larger trial that could&#xD;
      potentially lead to a new way of looking after patients having laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      That may therefore lead to a future change in medical care that could help patients who will&#xD;
      be having laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would be clear that no new technique or medication is being tested. Also&#xD;
      there is no financial benefit from the study to both the participants and the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conflicts of Interest&#xD;
&#xD;
      None.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be stored anonymously against a participant number. Only the clinical team and&#xD;
      research nurse will have access to the single table correlating participant's name number.&#xD;
      Anonymity will be preserved throughout the trial.&#xD;
