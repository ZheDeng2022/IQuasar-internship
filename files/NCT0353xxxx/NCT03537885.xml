    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to monitor the brain using electroencephalography (EEG) while&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is being administered, as a potential pathway&#xD;
      to determine neurophysiological markers capable of forecasting the intensity of a subject's&#xD;
      response to tDCS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique that has&#xD;
      been the subject of many recent investigations. There is a growing body of evidence to&#xD;
      suggest that tDCS can enhance the efficacy of various therapies. However, progress in the&#xD;
      field is slow: many studies suffer from reproducibility issues, or highly variable results,&#xD;
      including stroke rehabilitation. It is feasible that much of the variance in experimental&#xD;
      results can be explained by an inability to quantitatively track individual responses to tDCS&#xD;
      in real-time, and personalize stimulation parameters for maximum effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring the brain via EEG while tDCS is being administered is a potential pathway to&#xD;
      determine neurophysiological markers capable of forecasting the intensity of a subject's&#xD;
      response to tDCS. This research has not previously been attempted due to technical&#xD;
      difficulties- namely, the electromagnetic interference that is associated with tDCS degrades&#xD;
      EEG signal quality. Recent advances in electrode and amplification technology have made it&#xD;
      possible to make EEG recordings simultaneously with tDCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will attempt to determine whether specific EEG signatures can indicate the&#xD;
      magnitude of a tDCS response. Subjects will receive either real or sham anodal tDCS to the&#xD;
      hand representation of their left primary motor cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of the tDCS protocol will be quantitatively determined using transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) to generate a motor-evoked potential (MEP) in the hand pre- and&#xD;
      post-tDCS. Additionally, prior to, during, and following the tDCS protocol, we will record&#xD;
      EEG event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to a finger-tapping (motor) task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to draw a correlation between the magnitude of MEP changes and pre- and&#xD;
      post-tDCS and changes in recorded ERPs before, during and after tDCS in order to quantify the&#xD;
      response to tDCS over the motor cortex. If EEG metrics can be used to gauge efficacy in&#xD;
      real-time during tDCS administration, the investigators will gain significant insight into&#xD;
      how to appropriately and quantitatively individualize tDCS dosage parameters for each&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
