  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ascending aorta conducts blood from the heart to the rest of the body. The ascending&#xD;
      aorta can become enlarged, and the risk of tearing and rupturing becomes higher with larger&#xD;
      aorta. When the ascending aorta tears or ruptures, the risk dying is high even if surgery is&#xD;
      done as soon as possible. Traditionally, when the ascending aorta gets above 5.5 cm, surgery&#xD;
      is recommended to replace the aorta. However, this threshold is based relatively weak&#xD;
      evidence, and sometimes patients with smaller aorta can tear or rupture. On the other hand,&#xD;
      surgery carries its own risk as well. Since there are risk of waiting or doing surgery, there&#xD;
      is currently no great support for either approach for patients with a smaller aorta. In the&#xD;
      TITAN SvS trial, patients with an ascending aorta between 5.0 to 5.5 cm is assigned by chance&#xD;
      to the early surgery group, in which they will undergo replacement of aorta, or the&#xD;
      surveillance group, in which they will be closely monitored. The chance of dying or suffer&#xD;
      tearing or rupture of aorta between the two groups will be compared. The result of the trial&#xD;
      will guide future practice for patients with enlarged ascending aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multi-centre randomized control trial that compares the all-cause&#xD;
      mortality, aneurysm-related aortic events, rate of stroke, and quality of life for those&#xD;
      patients undergoing early elective ascending aortic surgery to those patients undergoing&#xD;
      surveillance. Patients referred for an ascending aortic aneurysm that meets the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be randomized to the early elective surgery group or the surveillance group.&#xD;
      Recruitment will end when the desired sample size is reached, and the patients will be&#xD;
      followed for a minimum 2-year period. The primary objective of the trial is to compare the&#xD;
      composite outcome of the all-cause mortality and incidence of acute aortic events between&#xD;
      surveillance and elective ascending aortic surgery for patients with degenerative or bicuspid&#xD;
      valve-related ascending aortic aneurysm after 2 years of follow up. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      the early surgery group will have a significantly lower all-cause mortality and incidence of&#xD;
      acute aortic events at 2 years of follow up compare to the surveillance group. The result of&#xD;
      this trial will provide evidence based guidance in the appropriate management of ascending&#xD;
      aortic aneurysm based on the size criteria, and establish a large database for future&#xD;
      investigations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients referred electively to a participating investigator for the evaluation of their&#xD;
      ascending aortic aneurysm will be screened for study eligibility. Patients between the age of&#xD;
      18 and 79 with an asymptomatic ascending aortic aneurysm between 5.0 cm and 5.4 cm in maximal&#xD;
      diameter are entered into the randomization study. Patients with ascending aortic aneurysm&#xD;
      with a diameter of 4.5 cm - 4.9 cm will be observed with serial CT, and will be considered&#xD;
      for enrollment into the trial once the aneurysm reaches 5.0 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient is first assessed in clinic, a pre-randomization evaluation will be&#xD;
      completed. Baseline information of the patient, including demographics, past medical history,&#xD;
      family history, medications, smoking habits, and the characteristics of the aneurysm, is&#xD;
      collected. Measurements including weight, height, heart rate, blood pressure in both arms, is&#xD;
      recorded. Basic blood work, including hemoglobin, white cell count, platelets, electrolytes,&#xD;
      creatinine, random blood sugar, HbA1c, and cholesterol profile is taken for analysis. An&#xD;
      electrocardiograph, chest X-ray, and a CT scan from the surgeon's institution is also&#xD;
      obtained. SF-36, the quality of life questionnaire, will be completed by the patient. Those&#xD;
      patients that are suitable for the trial based on inclusion and exclusion criteria will then&#xD;
      be randomized en-site through a computer-generated randomization program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the patients randomized to elective surgery group, the surgery is scheduled within 10-12&#xD;
      weeks of randomization. In the interim, the patient will be placed on maximal medical therapy&#xD;
      for their aneurysm, including beta-blocker, statin, and blood pressure control, and the doses&#xD;
      of these medication will be individualized based on each patient's own physiological&#xD;
      response. The types of surgery (ascending aortic replacement, Bentall procedure,&#xD;
      valve-sparing root replacement, etc.) will be at the discretion of the surgeon. The details&#xD;
      of the surgery and the patient's course of postoperative hospital stay is recorded. The&#xD;
      patient will be managed postoperatively according to routine hospital care. After discharge,&#xD;
      patients will be seen at 1 months for their routine postoperative follow up, then annually&#xD;
      counting from their index clinic visit before the surgery. At the first postoperative clinic&#xD;
      visit, weight, height, heart rate, blood pressure in both arms, is recorded. Basic blood&#xD;
      work, including hemoglobin, white cell count, platelets, electrolytes, creatinine is taken&#xD;
      for analysis. An electrocardiograph and chest X-ray will be obtained. All subsequent clinic&#xD;
      visits can be done in person or by phone conducted by a study coordinator. A CT scan will be&#xD;
      obtained at all subsequent clinic visits. Mortality status and occurrence of acute aortic&#xD;
      event or stroke in the previous year will be assessed at every annual clinic visit. Quality&#xD;
      of life assessment by SF-36 questionnaire will be completed by the patient in person or by&#xD;
      phone at 1 year and 2 years follow-up. Annual follow-up will continue until either the&#xD;
      patient dies or the trial ends. Patients who are randomized to the surveillance group will be&#xD;
      placed on maximal medical therapy for their aneurysm, including beta-blocker, statin, and&#xD;
      blood pressure control. The doses of these medication will be individualized based on each&#xD;
      patient's own physiological response. The patients will undergo a CT scan of the chest at the&#xD;
      first clinic visit then annually for the duration of the study. All CTs will be uploaded to a&#xD;
      core CT imaging lab where the image will be reviewed by a Radiologist. If the aneurysm grows&#xD;
      beyond 5.5 cm or the patient develop symptoms, the surgeon will consider the patient for&#xD;
      surgery. At all clinic visits, in addition to CT, weight, height, heart rate, blood pressure&#xD;
      in both arms, an electrocardiograph, and a chest X-ray will be obtained. The surveillance&#xD;
      visits continue until either the patient dies, the trial ends, or surgery is considered. If&#xD;
      the patient is no longer considered a suitable candidate for surgery or refuse surgery,&#xD;
      follow-up will continue, and the patient will no longer be a part of the trial and will only&#xD;
      be registered in the side arm.&#xD;
