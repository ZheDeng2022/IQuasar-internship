  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to evaluate the safety of drug combinations in patients with&#xD;
      advanced gastroesophageal cancer and other gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies. Finding&#xD;
      effective novel therapies for patients with advanced gastric cancer and other GI malignancies&#xD;
      is an area of great unmet need. The investigators believe that modulating the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment with biologic agents like cabozantinib will have synergistic effect when&#xD;
      combined with checkpoint-based immunotherapeutics like durvalumab in this patient population.&#xD;
      This is a phase I/II, open label, multi-cohort trial looking at safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      efficacy endpoints.&#xD;
