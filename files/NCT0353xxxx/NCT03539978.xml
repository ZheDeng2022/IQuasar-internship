  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study focuses on the delivery of discharge education by clinical nurses to improve&#xD;
      parent and family self-management in the home environment. This study tests an discharge&#xD;
      method (SM-THINk protocol) designed to improve the quality of care for hospitalized pediatric&#xD;
      patients at the time of discharge, enhance the child's and family's experience, and decrease&#xD;
      length of stay and health care utilization (ED visit or re-admission). The SM-THINk protocol&#xD;
      is an enhancement to the standard clinical practice and will be implemented for all subjects&#xD;
      on two Children's Hospital of Wisconsin (CHW) nursing units. This enhancement will require&#xD;
      additional training of the nurses prior to implementation of the research project. This&#xD;
      research determines the effectiveness of the training enhanced discharge method. The training&#xD;
      is independent from the research project and will evaluate effectiveness of this training.&#xD;
      For the enhanced discharge method, clinical nurses on the study units will be trained to&#xD;
      deliver the Self-Management Transition to Home (SM-THINk protocol), which is based on the&#xD;
      family self-management discharge preparation previously developed and tested by the study&#xD;
      team.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This quasi-experimental study uses a cluster design with parents from 3 nursing units at the&#xD;
      Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. Implementation of the SM-THINk protocol will occur on 2&#xD;
      pediatric inpatient units and a third unit will serve as the usual care control unit. The&#xD;
      SM-THINk protocol will be implemented on the two implementation experimental units regardless&#xD;
      of this study as a clinical practice change. The nurses will not serve as subjects in this&#xD;
      study since they are expected to learn the protocol as part of their everyday jobs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan to enroll 300 patients and one legal guardian per patient (parent or caregiver who has&#xD;
      guardianship of the patient). 300 parents of patients per unit (for a total of 900 patients&#xD;
      and 900 parents). A high-risk discharge assessment based on Mayo Clinic criteria is used to&#xD;
      identify children with complex or chronic conditions. Approximately 120 patients per unit&#xD;
      (40%) will have a complex or chronic condition. Parent experience related to quality of&#xD;
      discharge teaching and care coordination will be self-reported by parents using established,&#xD;
      reliable and valid scales. Child and parent characteristics, length of hospitalization,&#xD;
      readmission, and Emergency Department use data will be extracted from electronic medical&#xD;
      records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurses on the three units will provide a brief information sheet to families at some point&#xD;
      after admission and explain that if the subjects/families have questions that they should&#xD;
      call the research team or ask the nurse to contact the research team on their behalf. This&#xD;
      information sheet includes a summary of the research purposes and what questions will be&#xD;
      asked. When a nurse on the implementation unit is ready to discharge a family who agree to&#xD;
      participate, he/she will obtain the iPad, enter the patient code and write down which code&#xD;
      corresponds to which patient on a log, perform the enhanced discharge method per clinical&#xD;
      practice, then log out of the iPad. He/she will then log into the parent questionnaires&#xD;
      (REDCap), enter the patient code, and provide the iPad to the subjects/families. The nurse&#xD;
      will indicate that if they would like to participate, they should do so after he/she leaves&#xD;
      the room and log out of the iPad when finished. Nurses on the control unit will perform their&#xD;
      usual discharge and then obtain the iPad, enter the patient code and write down which code&#xD;
      corresponds to which patient on a log. He/she will then log into the parent questionnaires&#xD;
      (REDCap), enter the patient code, and provide the iPad to the subjects/families. The nurse&#xD;
      will indicate that if they would like to participate, they should do so after he/she leaves&#xD;
      the room and log out of the iPad when finished. After approximately 10 minutes the nurse will&#xD;
      check to be sure the subject/family has left and if so, will pick up the iPad, ensure the&#xD;
      family has logged out, and return the iPad to the storage area. If the subject/family has not&#xD;
      left yet, the nurse will check back periodically until they have left. This design will&#xD;
      ensure that nursing discharge time is not affected. The research team will pick up the list&#xD;
      of patient codes on the next working day. There is a waiver for documentation of informed&#xD;
      consent and assent. If the parent and child are interested, participation will serve as&#xD;
      implied consent. A HIPAA waiver will be requested by the study team to abstract data from the&#xD;
      patient's medical record to look for outcomes over time regarding readmissions and ED visits.&#xD;
      Only the following data will be collected from the patient's medical record: the number of&#xD;
      hospitalizations in the last 1 year, date of admission/discharge, and the reason for&#xD;
      hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All units will ask the parents to complete the parent experience tools at time of discharge&#xD;
      using the iPad. Both groups will receive standard post-discharge follow-up care including&#xD;
      laboratory and clinic appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parent's age, insurance information and the child's chronic conditions will all be asked&#xD;
      for in the REDCap questionnaires on the iPad. If the iPad is temporarily unavailable for&#xD;
      subject/families, paper forms will be provided to them and they will be instructed by the&#xD;
      nurses to fill out the forms and seal them in an envelope when they are finished. Nursing&#xD;
      staff will provide the sealed envelopes to the research team.&#xD;
