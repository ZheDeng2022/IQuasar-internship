  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To understand the effects of a novel dietary supplement when used in conjunction with a&#xD;
      healthy lifestyle exercise program and to define biomarkers that are specific to sarcopenia.&#xD;
      A primary aim in the present study is to determine whether a relationship exists between&#xD;
      positive changes in body composition through increases in lean mass and reductions in body&#xD;
      fat following oral supplementation of naturally occurring food components in combination with&#xD;
      exercise. The purpose of the present study is to examine the effects of a multi-nutrient&#xD;
      supplement in combination with an endurance and resistance based exercise intervention in a&#xD;
      cohort of older adult men with varying degrees of sarcopenia as compared to younger male&#xD;
      controls (McMaster/CIHR/Exerkine project). A sub-purpose nested within the study is to&#xD;
      provide serum and muscle samples for use in an aging/sarcopenia biomarker discovery study&#xD;
      taken at pre-intervention for the young and older men (Buck Institute/Astellas project).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a randomized double-blind placebo controlled repeated measures design,&#xD;
      with sampling of the cohorts on multiple occasions. Upon obtaining informed consent&#xD;
      participants will be randomized into one of six groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy younger males - n=20; Healthy older males - placebo n=10, supplement n=10; Sarcopenic&#xD;
      older males, placebo, n=20, supplement n=20;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Take home resistance training program The older adult male groups will be provided with a&#xD;
      progressive resistance training program which will use exercise bands (Therabands®, Akron,&#xD;
      Ohio) and consist of six upper body and six lower body exercises, which will be performed&#xD;
      three times per week for 12 weeks without supervision at home. Each session will consist of&#xD;
      active warm-up (5min), resistance training with elastic tubing (45min), and cool down (5min).&#xD;
      Briefly, the resistance exercises will be performed using elastic tubing for chair squats,&#xD;
      hip flexions, leg extensions, leg flexions, ankle dorsiflexion, wall push-ups, back rows,&#xD;
      shoulder abductions, triceps extensions, and forearm flexions. Ankle plantar-flexions and&#xD;
      abdominal curl-ups will be performed using body weight as resistance. Each participant will&#xD;
      be given an exercise instruction booklet and a set of five elastic tubes offering different&#xD;
      resistances. Prior to beginning the program trained staff will meet with participants and&#xD;
      will teach them how to properly perform exercises in addition to determining the starting&#xD;
      elastic tubing size. Furthermore, participants will perform one set of each exercise during&#xD;
      weeks 1 and 2, two sets of each exercise during weeks 3 and 4, and three sets of lower body&#xD;
      and two sets of upper body exercises during the remaining weeks. Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to move to the next larger tubing size when they can perform 12 repetitions with&#xD;
      good exercise form during their last set. This progression will be monitored by the project&#xD;
      staff mid way through the study over the phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study products Study products will be provided by Infinit Nutrition Canada (Windsor, Ontario)&#xD;
      to all older male subjects, however the young males will only act as baseline controls. The&#xD;
      composition of the study products is displayed above in the general experimental design. Both&#xD;
      products are similar in taste and appearance and provide an energetic value of ∼200 kcal per&#xD;
      serving in a volume of 200 mL. Participants will be asked to consume 1 serving daily of the&#xD;
      study product throughout the 12-wk intervention period. Participants will consume their&#xD;
      serving at approximately the same time of day, but preferably before breakfast. Participants&#xD;
      will be instructed to consume the supplement as a single bolus within 5-10 min. Subjects will&#xD;
      also also be provided an omega-3 supplement (or placebo, if they are assigned to the placebo&#xD;
      arm) and be instructed to consume 2 teaspoons at the same time as their nutritional&#xD;
      supplement. Participants will be instructed to record product intake in a diary to check&#xD;
      compliance. To maintain the double-blind nature of the experiment, the placebos, which&#xD;
      contains microcrystalline cellulose or safflower oil, will be matched in size and appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three day weighed food record Participants will be asked to record everything that they&#xD;
      consumed for 3 nonconsecutive days: 2 week-days and either a Saturday or a Sunday. On&#xD;
      completion of the food record, it will be analyzed using a commercially available&#xD;
      computerized database software (Nutribase version 11.5, Cybersoft Inc., Phoenix, AZ, USA).&#xD;
      Food items will be aggregated into the following categories: fruit (e.g., fresh/frozen,&#xD;
      tinned, juice), vegetables (e.g., fresh/frozen, canned), dairy products (e.g., milk, yoghurt,&#xD;
      cheese), breads and cereals (e.g., bread, breakfast cereal, rice, pasta), meats and&#xD;
      alternatives (e.g., red meat, poultry, fish, pork, processed meat, tofu, eggs, nuts) and&#xD;
      extra foods (e.g., hamburger, pizza, meat pies, chocolate, cake, ice cream, jam, biscuits,&#xD;
      crackers, crisps, alcohol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pedometer Participants will be given a wearable activity tracker, and instructed on weight&#xD;
      training days to aim for 5,000 steps and on all other days to try and reach 10,000. All&#xD;
      participants will record their daily totals for subsequent analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and blood pressure A DXA scan is a non-invasive procedure&#xD;
      requiring the participant to only lay still on a padded table. It is a fast procedure that&#xD;
      provides a variety of body composition variables (bone mass/area/density, fat mass, and fat&#xD;
      free mass). The DXA scan exposes individuals to low levels of radiation, approximately 0.18&#xD;
      millirem. According to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Americans receive&#xD;
      approximately 620 millirem each year, half of which is due to environmental background&#xD;
      radiation. Radiation exposure can be due to medical treatments or procedures, like X-Ray or&#xD;
      MRI's, food, sun exposure, etc. Any exposure to radiation can increase the risk of cancer. In&#xD;
      the present study, body composition will be assessed using DXA scan (GE Lunar Prodigy,&#xD;
      Madison, WI) and a software program for adults (encore Version 9.15.010). Fat free mass&#xD;
      (FFM), fat mass (FM) and bone mineral density (BMD) of the entire body will be recorded.&#xD;
      Arterial blood pressure (i.e., systolic [SBP] and diastolic [DBP]) will be measured during&#xD;
      rest with a stethoscope (Marshall Nurse Stethoscope, Riverside, Ill., USA) and&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer (MDF Instruments Direct Inc., Agoura Hills, Calif., USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle biopsies Participants will arrive in the morning in the fasted state and rest quietly&#xD;
      in the supine position for 10 minutes. A muscle biopsy will then be taken from the vastus&#xD;
      lateralis using local anaesthetic. Samples will be dissected free of connective tissue and&#xD;
      immediately partitioned for subsequent analysis (~ 25 mg) for RNA, a small piece (~ 10 mg)&#xD;
      will be placed into chilled glutaraldehyde for subsequent electron microscopic evaluation, ~&#xD;
      20 mg will be frozen for mtDNA deletions, and ~ 50 mg will be frozen for enzyme and protein&#xD;
      analysis. The investigators will measure muscle anabolic signaling as previously reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling A total of 100 mL blood will be taken from the antecubital vein and drawn into&#xD;
      evacuated tubes with heparin used for plasma collection and non-treated tubes will be used to&#xD;
      collect serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Waist and hip circumference measures For waist circumference measurement, the participant&#xD;
      will stand with arms at the sides, feet together, and abdomen relaxed. Using a Gulick tape&#xD;
      measure, a horizontal measure will be taken at the narrowest part of the torso (above the&#xD;
      umbilicus and below the xiphoid process). Obtaining a horizontal measure directly above the&#xD;
      iliac crest enhances standardization according to The National Obesity Task Force. For hip&#xD;
      circumference measurement, the participant stands erect and feet together, a horizontal&#xD;
      measure is taken at the maximal circumference of buttocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical performance battery A total of four functional tasks will be performed once using a&#xD;
      stopwatch that records times to an accuracy 1/100 of a second. First, the 6-minute walk test&#xD;
      will involve participants walking as fast as possible around a 20m track for 6 minutes and&#xD;
      distance will be measured to the closest meter. Next, the standard 4-stair climb test will&#xD;
      involve participants climbing 4 stairs as fast as possible. A 5x sit-to-stand test will&#xD;
      involve participants performing a series of consecutive rising and sitting positions from a&#xD;
      sturdy, armless plastic chair secured against a wall and with arms crossed at the chest.&#xD;
      Finally, the chair rise-and-walk test will involve participants starting from a seated&#xD;
      position, standing up and walking as quickly as possible in a predetermined straight line to&#xD;
      a pylon 9.14m, while going around the pylon, and returning to their original seated position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leg press 1RM Assessment procedures for determining lower body strength using leg press&#xD;
      exercise equipment (Cybex Eagle ®, Medway, MA) will require the participant to sit in the leg&#xD;
      press machine with the right foot and left foot on the weight platform. The seat and back pad&#xD;
      will be adjusted so that feet are flat on the platform hip-width apart, toes slightly angled&#xD;
      out, and legs parallel to each other. The interviewer will then instruct the participant to&#xD;
      grasp the handles or sides of the seat and extend their legs leaving just a slight bend in&#xD;
      the knee. Next, the participant will remove the racking mechanism from the platform and grasp&#xD;
      the handles or seat again. The participant will begin with a selected weight that is within&#xD;
      their perceived ability, approximately 60 to 80% of maximum capacity (make an educated&#xD;
      guess). The participant will lower the platform slowly and controlled towards the chest,&#xD;
      keeping the hips and buttocks on the seat, and the back flat against the back pad. Once the&#xD;
      thighs are parallel to the platform the participant will extend the legs, pushing the weight&#xD;
      back to the start position as hard and as fast as possible. The participant will be&#xD;
      instructed to not allow their hips to shift to one side, the buttocks to rise, or knees to&#xD;
      move inward or outward during this exercise. The interviewer will also instruct the&#xD;
      participant to keep heels flat and not allow the knees to go beyond the toes. Once the&#xD;
      repetitions are completed, the participant will replace the racking mechanism and exit the&#xD;
      leg press. These procedures were adapted from procedures described by the National Strength&#xD;
      and Condition Association (2008) and the American College of Sports Medicine (2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hand grip strength (MVIC) Hand grip strength will be measured using an isometric dynamometer&#xD;
      (JAMAR®, Sammons, Bolingbrook, IL). The grip width will be adjusted to hand size and with arm&#xD;
      flexed at 90°, the participant will perform three X 5 s efforts with a one min rest between&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knee extension (MVIC) Isometric knee extension will be measured by mechanical dynamometry&#xD;
      (Biodex System 3, Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY). Participants will be positioned into&#xD;
      the machine with the knee flexed at 90° and perform three X 5s maximal voluntary contractions&#xD;
      with 30s rest between each trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SF-36 Quality of health Questionnaire The RAND 36-Item Health Survey (Version 1.0) taps eight&#xD;
      health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health&#xD;
      problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being,&#xD;
      social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single&#xD;
      item that provides an indication of perceived change in health.&#xD;
