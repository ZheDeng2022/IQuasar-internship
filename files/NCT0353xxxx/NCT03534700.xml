  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic sacrococcygeal pilonidal disease is a common acquired condition associated with&#xD;
      hirsutism that predominantly affects young male patients. Morbidity from this disease results&#xD;
      in pain, embarrassment and loss of normal activities, causing absenteeism from work and&#xD;
      school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various surgical procedures have been described for the treatment of both primary and&#xD;
      recurrent pilonidal disease counting: open excision and healing by secondary intention,&#xD;
      marsupialization, excision and primary closure (midline or off-midline), excision and repair&#xD;
      by flap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No single method has been accepted as the &quot;gold standard&quot;, and none of them cancels the risk&#xD;
      of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal therapy for pilonidal sinus disease should be simple, with good aesthetic&#xD;
      outcomes and a low recurrence rate. It must allow the return to normal activities quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parasacral perforator flap seems to answer these entire requirements. No study compares&#xD;
      this flap repair with the most common procedure, which is the open excision with secondary&#xD;
      healing. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and the security of the&#xD;
      reconstruction of the natal cleft with the perforator parasacral flap versus open excision&#xD;
      with secondary healing in the treatment of sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many studies seem to attest the superiority of excision and reconstruction of the natal cleft&#xD;
      with a flap rather than the open excision with secondary healing. Jamal et al. found a&#xD;
      significantly lower recurrence rate with a rhomboid excision and reconstruction with a&#xD;
      Limberg flap versus open excision and secondary healing (p=0.005) in a prospective controlled&#xD;
      randomized trial including 49 patients. Keshuari et al. obtained the same significant results&#xD;
      in their prospective controlled randomized study including 321 patients, with a rate of 1.2%&#xD;
      of recurrence in the Karidakis flap repair cluster versus 7.5% in the excision with healing&#xD;
      by secondary intention cluster. The time for complete wound healing was also significantly&#xD;
      amended .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reconstruction of the natal cleft with a Karydakis or Limberg flap seemed to be superior&#xD;
      in terms of recurrence compared to open excision. But those flaps led to a significant and&#xD;
      discernable scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parasacral perforator flap has been described by Garrido et al. in 2002. It appears to be&#xD;
      a good alternative, offering all the benefits of the reconstruction of the natal cleft in&#xD;
      terms of lower rate of recurrence and lower time for complete wound healing. It also gives a&#xD;
      better aesthetic result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, patients will be operated under general anesthesia. A Methylene blue injection&#xD;
      will identify the limits of the pilonidal sinus. An excision of the whole width of the&#xD;
      relevant area will be performed, with depth reaching the presacral fascia. In the A group, a&#xD;
      parasacral perforator flap repair of the natal clef will be done, and in the B group healing&#xD;
      by secondary intention by dressing will be performed. Patients will be followed in&#xD;
      consultation at 15 days, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During these visits, a potential clinical recurrence will be detected, the time to be&#xD;
      completely healing will be evaluated, the period of loss of normal activities will be noted,&#xD;
      the quality of life will be assessed by a standardized generic measure (EQ-5D-5L) and by a&#xD;
      specific score (DLQI), and post-operative complications will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and the security of the reconstruction of the&#xD;
      natal cleft with the perforator parasacral flap versus open excision with secondary healing&#xD;
      in the treatment of sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A medico-economic analysis evaluating the incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility&#xD;
      ratio will be also done at 2 years. Additionally, an evaluation of the production costs of&#xD;
      the new strategy (i.e. parasacral perforator flap) will be performed from the specific&#xD;
      perspective of hospitals.&#xD;
