    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) can lead to cardiovascular, renal and neurological&#xD;
      complications if left poorly-controlled over prolonged periods of time. However, lowering&#xD;
      glycemic goals for diabetic patients increases their risk for hypoglycemia exposure.&#xD;
      Hypoglycemia is associated with symptoms such as heart palpitations, fatigue, shakiness,&#xD;
      anxiety, confusion, and blurred vision. Recurrent hypoglycemia leads to impairment of the&#xD;
      body's autonomic and symptomatic responses to this condition, and can result in loss of&#xD;
      awareness in the patient of the hypoglycemic state. Repeated incidences of hypoglycemia from&#xD;
      loss of this awareness can result in even more hypoglycemic episodes and more severe&#xD;
      outcomes, such as loss of consciousness, accidents, hospitalization and even death if left&#xD;
      untreated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether adrenergic blockade through the use of&#xD;
      low-dose carvedilol treatment can improve hypoglycemia awareness and the counterregulatory&#xD;
      hormone responses to hypoglycemia in T1DM patients with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoglycemia elicits a multifaceted hormonal response that helps restore glycemic levels to&#xD;
      normal. As blood glucose levels start to fall, insulin secretion ceases. At the top of this&#xD;
      hierarchy of counterregulatory responses are glucagon and epinephrine which are the two&#xD;
      principal hormones that act rapidly to increase glucose production and inhibit glucose&#xD;
      utilization to raise plasma glucose levels back to normal. In cases of prolonged and/or more&#xD;
      severe hypoglycemia, growth hormone and cortisol are mobilized to stimulate the synthesis of&#xD;
      gluconeogenic enzymes and inhibit glucose utilization. In non-diabetic individuals, glucagon&#xD;
      and epinephrine are usually very effective and the latter responses are rarely required in&#xD;
      the acute situation. In contrast, impaired glucose counterregulation presents itself in&#xD;
      longstanding diabetes and with antecedent hypoglycemia. Within the first five years after the&#xD;
      onset of T1DM, the primary defense against hypoglycemia, the release of glucagon, either&#xD;
      becomes significantly attenuated or is completely absent in diabetic patients and this&#xD;
      impairment appears to be specific for the stimulus of hypoglycemia. Hence, patients with&#xD;
      diabetes primarily depend on the release of epinephrine as their main defense against&#xD;
      hypoglycemia. Unfortunately, with longer duration of diabetes and especially with poor&#xD;
      glycemic control, epinephrine secretion is also compromised, making these patients even more&#xD;
      vulnerable to the threat of hypoglycemia. In patients with diabetes, hypoglycemia arises from&#xD;
      the interplay of a relative excess of exogenous insulin and defective glucose&#xD;
      counterregulation and it remains a limiting factor in attaining proper glycemic management.&#xD;
      Both the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) conducted in Type 1 patients and the&#xD;
      United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) conducted in Type 2 patients, have&#xD;
      established the importance of maintaining good glucose control over a lifetime of diabetes to&#xD;
      avoid cardiovascular, renal and neurological complications. However, lowering glycemic goals&#xD;
      for diabetic patients increases their risk for hypoglycemia exposure. According to the DCCT,&#xD;
      T1DM patients put on intensive insulin therapy, though having improved outcomes for diabetic&#xD;
      complications, are at a 3-fold higher risk of experiencing severe hypoglycemia compared to&#xD;
      those on conventional insulin therapy. Moreover, recent antecedent hypoglycemia reduces&#xD;
      autonomic (epinephrine) and symptomatic (which normally prompts behavioral defenses such as&#xD;
      eating) responses to subsequent bouts of hypoglycemia. Thus begins the vicious cycle of&#xD;
      recurrent hypoglycemia (RH) where hypoglycemia leads to further impairment of&#xD;
      counterregulatory responses which tin turn, begets more hypoglycemia and so forth. Because of&#xD;
      the imperfections of current insulin therapies, those patients attempting to achieve glycemic&#xD;
      control suffer an untold number of asymptomatic hypoglycemic episodes. Current estimates of&#xD;
      symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes range form 2-3 incidences per week on average and severe,&#xD;
      debilitating episodes occur one or twice each year. Therefore, developing therapies to&#xD;
      prevent or eliminate hypoglycemia is of great importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensors that detect changes in blood glucose levels and initiate glucose counterregulatory&#xD;
      responses have been identified in both the periphery and within the brain. These sensors have&#xD;
      been localized to the hepatic portal vein, the carotid body and the brain. In the brain, the&#xD;
      dominant sensors are located in the hypothalamus. While peripheral glucose sensors may play a&#xD;
      role in mediating the immediate counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia, it is thought&#xD;
      that glucosensors located within the brain may have a redundant regulatory and/or modulatory&#xD;
      role in regulating glucose counterregulatory responses. It is well established that brain&#xD;
      glucose sensors are crucial for detecting falling blood glucose levels and for initiating&#xD;
      counterregulatory responses. These sensors are located in the hindbrain, the lateral&#xD;
      hypothalamus, the paraventricular nucleus, the dorsal hypothalamus and the ventromedial&#xD;
      hypothalamus (VMH). The neurons within the VMH contain much of the same glucose sensing&#xD;
      machinery as the pancreatic β-cells. To date, two main types of glucose sensing neurons have&#xD;
      been identified in the brain - those that increase their firing rate in response to increases&#xD;
      in glucose levels, the &quot;glucose-excited&quot; (GE) neurons and those that decrease their firing&#xD;
      rate in response to increases in glucose levels, the &quot;glucose-inhibited&quot; (GI) neurons. The&#xD;
      mechanism by which GE neurons sense changes in blood glucose concentrations is believed to be&#xD;
      similar to that used by pancreatic β-cells whereas GI neurons respond to decreases in ambient&#xD;
      glucose levels through activation of the metabolic fuel sensor, AMP kinase (AMPK), and&#xD;
      closure of chloride channels that result in increased activity of GI neurons. Although many&#xD;
      of these sensing components have been identified, it is still not entirely clear how glucose&#xD;
      sensing neurons regulate counterregulatory hormone release. It has been proposed that&#xD;
      alterations in the firing rates of VMH glucose sensing neurons in response to glucose or fuel&#xD;
      deficits can inhibit (as is the case for GE neurons) or stimulate (as is the case for GI&#xD;
      neurons) the exocytosis of vesicles containing neurotransmitters that can modulate the&#xD;
      counterregulatory hormone response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA, and the stimulatory neurotransmitters, glutamate and&#xD;
      norepinephrine (NE), act within the VMH to suppress or stimulate the counterregulatory&#xD;
      responses to hypoglycemia, respectively. In response to an initial bout of hypoglycemia, VMH&#xD;
      GABA levels decrease while glutamate and NE levels increase, allowing for activation of the&#xD;
      counterregulatory hormone responses. While these studies underscore the importance of VMH&#xD;
      neurotransmitter signaling in regulating glucose homeostatic mechanisms, to date, the&#xD;
      mechanisms that lead to their dysregulation in models of counterregulatory failure are not&#xD;
      entirely clear. Recent evidence suggests that lactate, which serves as an alternate fuel&#xD;
      substrate in the brain, plays an important role in precipitating the defects noted above.&#xD;
      Lactate produced from neighboring astrocytes can supplement higher energy requirements during&#xD;
      periods of increased neuronal activity or when glucose supply is limited. If this is the&#xD;
      case, then lactate can be used in place of glucose as a fuel for VMH glucose sensing neurons,&#xD;
      preventing them from detecting a fall in glucose levels, causing (inhibitory) GABA tone to be&#xD;
      enhanced and (stimulatory) glutamate output to be reduced. Together, these actions ultimately&#xD;
      suppress the release of counterregulatory hormones. In recent years, it has been shown that&#xD;
      lactate levels are sensed by the brain and more specifically, can act in the hypothalamus to&#xD;
      regulate glucose homeostasis, appetite and body weight. Lactate prevents the activation of&#xD;
      hypothalamic neurons during glucose deprivation and more pertinent to this application,&#xD;
      attenuates glucose counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia when locally administered into&#xD;
      the VMH. Data from the investigator's research group revealed VMH extracellular lactate&#xD;
      concentrations are elevated in RH and diabetic animals and in particular, these conditions&#xD;
      also increase expression of the lactate transporter in the VMH. When VMH lactate uptake is&#xD;
      pharmacologically inhibited, neurotransmitter and counterregulatory responses improve in both&#xD;
      RH and diabetic animals, suggesting lactate plays an important role in dysregulating&#xD;
      neurotransmitter systems in the VMH, which in turn, impairs counterregulatory responses.&#xD;
      Preliminary data suggests that therapeutic strategies that can reduce brain lactate levels,&#xD;
      may help restore hypothalamic glucose sensing mechanisms and the counterregulatory response&#xD;
      to hypoglycemia. Hence, identifying the mechanisms that increase VMH lactate levels may lead&#xD;
      to suitable therapeutic strategies to prevent hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Norepinephrine can enhance lactate production from astrocytes and it can also increase the&#xD;
      uptake of lactate into neurons through the activation of β2-adrenergic receptors (β2AR),&#xD;
      potentially helping to coordinate both the supply and uptake of lactate into neurons.&#xD;
      Normally, in response to an acute bout of hypoglycemia, VMH NE levels rise and act through&#xD;
      β2ARs to enhance the sympathoadrenal response. Although activation of VMH β2ARs augments the&#xD;
      counterregulatory response during acute bouts of hypoglycemia, less is known about the&#xD;
      effects of RH on this neurotransmitter system. It has been reported that VMH NE levels are&#xD;
      not altered by successive bouts of hypoglycemia, suggesting activation of the VMH NE system&#xD;
      is not dampened by RH and that its suppressive effects on counterregulatory hormone release&#xD;
      may lie downstream of NE release. In support of this finding, adrenergic blockade during&#xD;
      antecedent bouts of hypoglycemia was shown to prevent counterregulatory failure in healthy&#xD;
      human subjects. Therefore, while acute activation of VMH adrenergic receptors may be&#xD;
      beneficial in its capacity to enhance the counterregulatory response, repeated activation of&#xD;
      this neurotransmitter system may contribute to counterregulatory failure, but the mechanisms&#xD;
      by which this occurs have not been fully identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate whether repeated activation of the VMH NE system contributes to counterregulatory&#xD;
      failure, NE was microinjected into the VMH of non-diabetic, hypoglycemia-naive rats for 3&#xD;
      hours/day for 3 consecutive days before subjecting the animals to a hypoglycemic glucose&#xD;
      clamp on day 4. Repeated activation of the VMH NE system in the absence of hypoglycemia,&#xD;
      increased VMH lactate levels and more importantly, blunted the counterregulatory hormone&#xD;
      responses to hypoglycemia. This phenomenon was recapitulated with microinjection of&#xD;
      salbutamol, a short-acting β2AR agonist, into the VMH using the same protocol as for NE,&#xD;
      suggesting the suppressive effects of NE are mediated through VMH β2ARs. In a subgroup of&#xD;
      animals treated with NE, uptake of lactate into neurons was blocked immediately prior to the&#xD;
      hypoglycemic clamp. In this group, the suppressive effects of NE treatment on glucose&#xD;
      counterregulation were completely abolished. Hence, preliminary data suggests that repeated&#xD;
      activation of the VMH NE system plays a role in the development of counterregulatory failure,&#xD;
      in part by enhancing central lactate production and therefore, the use of β-adrenergic&#xD;
      blockers may be a promising treatment to preserve the responses to hypoglycemia. Preliminary&#xD;
      data show that RH rats treated with low doses of the non-specific β-blocker, carvedilol,&#xD;
      during the induction of RH, required less exogenous glucose during the hypoglycemic clamp&#xD;
      compared to RH animals treated with vehicle. More importantly, reductions in VMH lactate&#xD;
      levels and significant improvements in the counterregulatory hormone responses to&#xD;
      hypoglycemia in the carvedilol-treated RH animals were observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carvedilol is a third generation non-selective, vasodilating β-blocker, which is FDA-approved&#xD;
      for the treatment of congestive heart failure and hypertension. Carvedilol mainly blocks β2-&#xD;
      and β1-adrenergic receptors and some α1-adrenergic receptors. Due to its lipophilic nature,&#xD;
      carvedilol readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. As the brain is the primary target, this&#xD;
      beneficial pharmacokinetic property of carvedilol improves central nervous system&#xD;
      bioavailability, allowing lower doses to be used to deliver treatment to the brain. With&#xD;
      lower doses, the potential for side effects stemming from unnecessary exposure of peripheral&#xD;
      tissues to high levels of β-adrenergic blockade can be reduced. This study is designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose carvedilol treatment for 4 weeks as a treatment for&#xD;
      restoring the counterregulatory hormone responses to hypoglycemia and improve hypoglycemia&#xD;
      awareness in T1DM patients.&#xD;
