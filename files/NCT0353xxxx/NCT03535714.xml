  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test effectiveness of a new treatment program for adolescents and&#xD;
      young adults within the age of 14-21 suffering from AN (MANTR-a) compared to treatment as&#xD;
      usual (TAU).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious mental illness which leads untreated to aggravation of&#xD;
      symptomatology and chronification. Among all mental illnesses, AN has the highest mortality&#xD;
      rate, which is about 5.1 per 1000 people per year. High drop-out rates (up to 40%) or small&#xD;
      treatment motivation constrains treatment success. Since the onset of AN is mainly in&#xD;
      adolescence, it is important to start with therapy as early as possible and establish an&#xD;
      effective single-setting treatment program for this age group to prevent chronification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MANTR-a (Maudsley model of anorexia nervosa treatment for adolescents) is an innovative,&#xD;
      theory-based, tailored treatment program which combines a cognitive behavioural approach with&#xD;
      motivational interviewing. The main focus of the treatment program is the transformation&#xD;
      maintaining factors of AN, like personality aspects, pro-anorexic beliefs, emotion regulation&#xD;
      strategies, thinking styles and obstructive behaviour from caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is the examination ot the effectiveness of the MANTR-a treatment&#xD;
      program for adolescents and young adults. Therefore we compare MANTR-a (intervention group)&#xD;
      with treatment as usual (control group). Assessments will be conducted before treatment (T0,&#xD;
      baseline), after six months (T1), after 12 months (T2) and after 18 months (T3, follow-up)&#xD;
      via questionnaires, interviews and neuropsychological measurements. Process evaluation takes&#xD;
      place after every session. Each group consists of female adolescents and young adults within&#xD;
      the age of 14-21 suffering from AN (ICD-10: F50.0, F50.1), resulting in an overall sample&#xD;
      size of 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of the study is to provide an evidence-based outpatient treatment for&#xD;
      children and adolescents with AN in order to prevent a chronic course of the disease.&#xD;

After 20 weeks, therapy continues with four monthly booster-sessions. In sum, each patient (whose bodyweight is above the 3rd BMI percentile) can attend 24 therapy sessions.
