      The primary objectives of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the safety and tolerability of ascending repeated oral doses of&#xD;
           BAY1902607 in healthy subjects (Part 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the effect of BAY1902607 on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a&#xD;
           sub-therapeutic 1 mg dose of midazolam (Part 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of BAY1902607 in patients with&#xD;
           refractory chronic cough (Part 2).&#xD;
