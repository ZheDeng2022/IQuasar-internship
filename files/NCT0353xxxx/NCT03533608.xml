  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged Exposure therapy (PE) is a first-line treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder;&#xD;
      however few VA patients receive this treatment. One of the barriers to PE receipt is that&#xD;
      this treatment is only available in an individual (one-on-one) format, whereas many VA mental&#xD;
      health clinics provide the majority of their psychotherapy services in group format. In&#xD;
      particular, PTSD residential rehabilitation programs (RRTPs) offer most programming in group&#xD;
      format. Thus, the current study was designed to pilot test a group format of PE in RRTPs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty Veterans who are currently receiving treatment in the PTSD RRTP at a Midwest VA will be&#xD;
      recruited to participate in a Group PE protocol. Participants will engage in 12, 90-minute&#xD;
      sessions of Group PE over the course of 6 weeks. Treatment consists of psychoeducation,&#xD;
      rationale for treatment, and in vivo exposure to reduce trauma-related avoidance and thereby&#xD;
      improve PTSD symptoms. PTSD symptoms will be measured via the PCL-5. The goal of this pilot&#xD;
      study will be to determine whether or not it will be feasible to conduct a full-scale trial&#xD;
      of Group PE in the current setting by testing the process, resources, management, and&#xD;
      scientific basis of the planned trial. As such, the proposed study will primarily assess&#xD;
      feasibility outcomes and not efficacy outcomes. The investigators will assess number of&#xD;
      participants screened, number meeting inclusion criteria, adherence of participants to the&#xD;
      proposed treatment (measured via number of sessions attended), standard deviation of the&#xD;
      outcome measure (PCL-5), response rates to questionnaires, and loss to follow-up. The&#xD;
      investigators will also measure clinicians' adherence to protocol and acceptability of the&#xD;
      treatment to patients.&#xD;

    <description>PTSD symptoms will be measured via the PCL-5 at baseline, 6-week, and 2-months. The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. Patients are asked to rate how bothered they are by each item in the past month on a 5-point likert scale ranging from 0-4 (not at all, a little bit, moderately, quite a bit, extremely). Items are summed together and a PCL-5 cut point score of 33 is used for provisional PTSD diagnosis. Change = (Week 6 score-Baseline score) and (2 month score-Baseline score).</description>

    <description>Depressive symptoms will be measured via the PHQ-9 at baseline, 6-weeks, and 2-months. The PHQ-9 is a 9-item self-report measure that assesses the presence and severity of depressive symptoms. Patients are asked to rate the presence of symptoms over the past 2 weeks on a 4-point likert scale ranging from 0-3 (not at all, several days, more than half the days, nearly every day). Individual items are summed together and Total scores ranging from 5-9 indicate mild depression, 10-14 indicate moderate depression, 15-19 indicate moderately severe depression, and 20-27 indicate severe depression. Change = (Week 6 score-Baseline score) and (2 month score-Baseline score).</description>

        <description>Depressive symptoms will be measured via the PHQ-9 at baseline, 6-weeks, and 2-months. The PHQ-9 is a 9-item self-report measure that assesses the presence and severity of depressive symptoms. Patients are asked to rate the presence of symptoms over the past 2 weeks on a 4-point likert scale ranging from 0-3 (not at all, several days, more than half the days, nearly every day). Individual items are summed together and Total scores ranging from 5-9 indicate mild depression, 10-14 indicate moderate depression, 15-19 indicate moderately severe depression, and 20-27 indicate severe depression. Change = (Week 6 score-Baseline score) and (2 month score-Baseline score).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 2-months</time_frame>
        <population>Scores are reported for the 39 enrolled participants, including the 5 who did not complete the treatment but agreed to complete the follow-up assessments.</population>
