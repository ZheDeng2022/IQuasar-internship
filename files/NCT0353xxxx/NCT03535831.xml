  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre PSMA registry is to assess the&#xD;
      contribution of 18F-DCFPyL (PSMA) PET imaging (PET/MR or PET/CT) to the management of&#xD;
      patients with prostate cancer (PCa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, patients with intermediate or high risk prostate cancer are staged with CT abdomen&#xD;
      and pelvis and bone scan to assess for distant metastases. Patients with biochemical&#xD;
      recurrence after primary therapy are restaged in a similar manner. Locally, multiparametric&#xD;
      MR of the prostate or prostate bed may also be obtained in select cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients recruited for this registry will be staged/ restaged with PSMA PET (PET/CT or&#xD;
      PET/MR) to determine whether this imaging strategy results in more accurate detection of&#xD;
      metastatic disease (for patients undergoing primary staging) or detection of local recurrence&#xD;
      or distant disease (for patients undergoing restaging). Choice of imaging method (PET/CT or&#xD;
      PET/MR) will be made by one of the study PIs, based on clinical judgement taking into account&#xD;
      the specific exam indication, prior recent imaging, and suitability for MR imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single arm study to assess the contribution of PSMA PET imaging (PET/MR or PET/CT)&#xD;
      to the management of patients with prostate cancer (PCa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective trial, the investigators will recruit 200 men whom will undergo PET&#xD;
      imaging using an integrated PET/CT scanner or with an integrated PET/MR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive standard treatment for PCa according to UHN/PMH urology oncology site&#xD;
      policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment outcome including clinical response, blood work including serial serum PSA, and&#xD;
      follow-up imaging if performed up to 5 years will be recorded.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer among Canadian men. Men diagnosed with&#xD;
      localized PCa are placed in low, intermediate and high-risk groups, using the prognostic&#xD;
      variables including pathologic Gleason score, T-stage and serum prostate specific antigen&#xD;
      (PSA). These risk groups correlate with biochemical failure-free survival and prostate cancer&#xD;
      specific mortality [1]. Although PCa is prevalent, the risk of clinical or fatal PCa in a 50&#xD;
      year old man is estimated at only 10% and 3%, respectively [2]. Currently, over 2/3 of men&#xD;
      diagnosed with PCa are diagnosed with organ confined, low risk disease (PSA &lt; 10 ng/ml,&#xD;
      Gleason score (=GS) 3+3, cT1c) [3]. Management is dependent on tumor grade, size and stage&#xD;
      and clinical parameters (e.g. life expectancy) and may range from active surveillance to&#xD;
      radical therapy including definitive whole gland treatment (radical prostatectomy (RP), or&#xD;
      radiotherapy). Although radical whole gland therapy is effective from an oncological&#xD;
      standpoint, it may be associated with significant side effects. A more conservative approach&#xD;
      in select patients may be enrollment in an active surveillance program. The concept behind&#xD;
      this approach is that small volume, low grade PCa may have an indolent course and may not&#xD;
      progress to biological significance in the absence of treatment in the patient's lifetime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for this study is to determine in a prospective cohort of patients with unfavorable&#xD;
      intermediate-risk or high-risk PCa, whether PSMA PET improves the detection of lymph node and&#xD;
      distant metastases as compared to conventional imaging strategies (CT abdomen and bone&#xD;
      scintigraphy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the rate of change in planned management after adding information from PSMA PET&#xD;
      in patients with PCa being staged prior to primary therapy or restaged after primary therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis behind the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre PSMA PET registry is that&#xD;
      in patients with PCa, PSMA PET will enable more accurate staging and restaging, and improve&#xD;
      prognostic stratification as compared to conventional workup. Furthermore, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the addition of PSMA PET to the workup of these patients will change the&#xD;
      planned management in a significant proportion of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine in a prospective cohort of patients with unfavorable intermediate-risk or&#xD;
      high-risk PCa, whether PSMA PET improves the detection of lymph node and distant metastases&#xD;
      as compared to conventional imaging strategies (CT abdomen and bone scintigraphy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the rate of change in planned management after adding information from PSMA PET&#xD;
      in patients with PCa being staged prior to primary therapy or restaged after primary therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the clinical outcome and rate of biochemical control after therapy. For this&#xD;
      purpose, information from clinical notes of routine clinical visits, results of blood tests&#xD;
      (such as serum PSA) and follow-up imaging, if performed, will be collected for up to 5 years.&#xD;
