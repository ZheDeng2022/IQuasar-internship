      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People cope with cancer in different ways. Mindfulness means focusing on the present moment&#xD;
      with an open mind. Researchers want to see if this can help children and young adults with a&#xD;
      high-grade high-risk cancer with poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if mindfulness is feasible and acceptable for children and young people with&#xD;
      high-grade high-risk cancer with poor prognosis and their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children ages 5 24 with a high-grade or high-risk cancer, with a caregiver who agrees to do&#xD;
      the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Must have internet access (participants may borrow an iPod for the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Must speak English&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will complete questionnaires. These will be about feelings, physical&#xD;
      well-being, quality of life, and mindfulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will review children s medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly put in the mindfulness group or the standard care group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the standard care group will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Get general recommendations for coping with cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have check-in sessions 1 and 3 weeks after starting. These will last about 10 minutes each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After participants finish the standard care group, they may be able to enroll in the&#xD;
      mindfulness group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the mindfulness group will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attend an in-person mindfulness training session. The child participant will meet with one&#xD;
      research team member for 90 minutes while the parent participant meets with another. Then&#xD;
      they will come together for a half hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practice mindfulness exercises at least 4 days a week for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Be asked to respond to weekly emails or texts asking about their mindfulness practice&#xD;
&#xD;
      Get a mindfulness kit with things to help them do their mindfulness activities at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have a 30-minute check-in with their coach 1 and 3 weeks after starting. This can be in&#xD;
      person or by video chat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants (from both groups) will be asked to answer follow-up questions about 8 and&#xD;
      16 weeks after starting the study. Participants will be paid $20 for each set of&#xD;
      questionnaires they complete to thank them for their time.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children and young adults diagnosed with a high-grade or high-risk cancer (e.g., diffuse&#xD;
           intrinsic pontine glioma, glioblastoma multiforme, relapsed-refractory leukemia,&#xD;
           refractory metastatic sarcomas) face a poor prognosis given limited curative options.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recent research has indicated that this population of patients and their parents&#xD;
           experience elevated stress and poorer health-related quality of life (HRQL) relative to&#xD;
           normative samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recently published psychosocial standards of care in pediatric oncology strongly&#xD;
           recommend that children diagnosed with cancer and their caregivers receive early and&#xD;
           continued assessment of their wellbeing and have access to interventions to optimize&#xD;
           functioning and HRQL. In addition, there is increasing recognition of the importance of&#xD;
           palliative interventions early in the disease trajectory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Despite this recommendation, minimal research has examined supportive care interventions&#xD;
           for this population early in the disease trajectory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have empirical support for their feasibility and&#xD;
           efficacy in alleviating emotional distress and physical symptoms in children and adults&#xD;
           with chronic health conditions, including terminally-ill patients and their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To assess the feasibility of an enhanced mindfulness intervention (EMI) in children and&#xD;
      young adults (ages 5-24 years) with a high-grade or high-risk cancer with poor prognosis and&#xD;
      one of their primary caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children and young adults ages 5-24 years and a parent or adult primary caregiver&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of a high-grade or high-risk cancer with poor prognosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  English speaking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Must have access to a mobile device or computer with internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potential participants will be excluded if there is evidence of pre-morbid severe&#xD;
           cognitive or psychiatric disability in parent or child that would impair their capacity&#xD;
           for participation, or if there is evidence of clinical disease progression at the time&#xD;
           of referral to this study, such that it would prevent the child from engaging in the&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a pilot randomized controlled trial that will compare feasibility and&#xD;
           preliminary efficacy of an 8-week EMI group (n=10 dyads) compared to a psychoeducation&#xD;
           control group (n=10 dyads).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will complete measures of feasibility (primary outcome) and exploratory&#xD;
           outcomes at baseline and following the 8-week intervention. Exploratory measures will&#xD;
           include emotional (e.g., depression, anxiety) and physical (e.g., pain, fatigue)&#xD;
           wellbeing, as well as baseline mindfulness/self-compassion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 8-week EMI will consist of one initial in-person session with the child and parent,&#xD;
           a series of at-home assignments, and two booster sessions. The psychoeducation group&#xD;
           will be given educational material about coping with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The psychoeducation group will be offered the opportunity to participate in the EMI 8&#xD;
           weeks post-baseline&#xD;
