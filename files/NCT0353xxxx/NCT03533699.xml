    <textblock>
      After receiving approval from the Hospital Ethics Committee, women with uncomplicated term&#xD;
      pregnancy who will be admitted to the Ainshams maternity hospital will be recruited in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gestational age of 38-41 weeks of pregnancy (according to a reliable last menstrual&#xD;
           period (LMP) and sonography of first trimester)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nulliparity,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Singleton pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cephalic presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Intact membranes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Bishop Score 5 or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusive criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pelvic contraction,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Previous surgical operation on the uterus,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Signs of fetal distress,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Placenta previa&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Suspicious macrosomia,&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Polyhydramnios,&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Hydrocephalus of fetus&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. History of any known cardiac, pulmonary or metabolic disorder of mother, or maternal&#xD;
           drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming an effect size regarding interval until good contractions of 0.6(Ashraf DM et al.,&#xD;
      2013), a sample size of 101 in each group would be enough to elucidate such effect if true,&#xD;
      at 0.05 alpha error and 0.95 power of the test. Sample size could be inflated by 10% for&#xD;
      dropouts so the total would be 112 in each group Sample size was calculated using sample size&#xD;
      table calculation in designing clinical research appendix 6A (Hulley, S.B. et al., 2013)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention to be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After taking informed consent, all pregnant ladies recruited in the study will undergo&#xD;
      complete clinical examination and detailed medical history will be obtained along with&#xD;
      necessary lab investigations and ultrasound findings. Each patient will have a case record&#xD;
      form in which the following data will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ History: Personal (age, duration of marriage), present (any current medical or surgical&#xD;
      diseases and any current medication), obstetric history (Gestational age, obstetric&#xD;
      complications) and past history (cardiac, pulmonary or metabolic diseases).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. General examination: assessment of vital data, cardiac and chest auscultation to&#xD;
                exclude contraindications for drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Abdominal examination: assessment of fundal level and contractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. PV examination: assessment of Bishop score, membranes status and fetal&#xD;
                presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Routine investigations will be done e.g., complete blood count and blood grouping.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Pelvi-abdominal U/S (Confirm fetal life, placental location, fetus parameters,&#xD;
                amniotic fluid index and expected fetal weight).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmation of gestational age before 20 weeks' gestation (regular menstrual history&#xD;
           with known last menstrual period and/or ultrasound confirmation of gestational age by&#xD;
           means of crown rump length measurement in 1st trimester).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of uterine contractions and PV examination (cervical dilation and effacement,&#xD;
           station of fetal head, fetal presentation, membranes status) are done and recorded and&#xD;
           bishop score will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CTG will be done for all pregnant ladies included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then Patients will be randomly assigned to two groups using sealed, sequentially distributed&#xD;
      envelopes to which the letters A and B will be allocated. The letter A will be assigned to&#xD;
      the propranolol group and the letters B to the oxytocin group. The envelopes, will be opened&#xD;
      by the investigator, and according to the letters, the group of patients will be determined.&#xD;
      The first vaginal examination will be performed by the investigator, and then the induction&#xD;
      will be initiated by the same researcher. Continuation of induction and the control of&#xD;
      patients will be monitored by a coworker who knew nothing about the method of initiation of&#xD;
      induction, neither did the patients (double blind)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first group (Propranolol plus Oxytocin), a capsule consisting of 20 mg Propranolol&#xD;
      will be administered and in the second group (Oxytocin plus placebo), a similar capsule as a&#xD;
      placebo will be administrated orally by researcher before beginning of induction of labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction will be initiated at a dose of 2 mIu/min and it will be increased 2 mIu / minute&#xD;
      every 15 minutes until good contractions are obtained (3 forceful contractions within 10&#xD;
      minutes) or to a maximum dose of 30 mIu/min; then, it will be continued at this rate for 8&#xD;
      hours. If patients enter the active phase of labour (cervical dilatation = 3-4 cm), induction&#xD;
      will be continued until delivery. If no response to induction of labour, a caesarean section&#xD;
      will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressures and heart rate of the parturients and fetal heart rates will be monitored&#xD;
      every 15 minutes. The participants' characteristics, age, primary Bishop score, gestational&#xD;
      age, the number of deliveries on the first day of induction and caesarean sections, timing of&#xD;
      the beginning good contractions after induction, duration of latent phase (interval between&#xD;
      the beginnings of good contractions until cervical dilatations of 3-4 cm will be obtained),&#xD;
      type of delivery and Apgar scores of minutes 1 and 5, need of admissions to NICU and neonatal&#xD;
      weights will be recorded and compared in the two groups. The participants will be followed up&#xD;
      until delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The partogram will be used to monitor the fetal heart rate, membranes status, cervical&#xD;
      dilation and effacement, station of the fetus and uterine contractions (rate and strength).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After delivery mothers will be encouraged to establish skin to skin contact and breast&#xD;
      feeding as soon as possible after birth. Babies will be encouraged to feed on demand but the&#xD;
      interval between feeds will be no longer than 3 hours Samples for measuring blood glucose&#xD;
      level for the newborn will be taken 1 hour after birth regardless of feeds, then before feeds&#xD;
      3-4 hourly in the first 24 hours. Measurements will be discontinued if there are 3 normal&#xD;
      blood glucose concentration measurements and no clinical concerns about feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also fetal heart rate will be measured every 4 hours for 24 hours after delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the parturient has hyperstimulation of contractions (in a situation with more than 5&#xD;
      contractions/10 mins, duration of contractions &lt;90 secs, interval of contraction less than 2&#xD;
      min or fetal distress) the augmentation will be stopped and the parturient is kept in left&#xD;
      lateral position and given oxygen, and intravenous dextrose.&#xD;
