  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Stable Vision</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>Stable vision was defined as a loss of fewer than 15 letters in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) compared to baseline. BCVA was measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly using the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Scale (ranging from 0 to 100 letters) in the study eye. The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly means that vision has improved. The study eye was defined as the eye that meets the entry criteria. If both eyes met the entry criteria, the eye with the worse BCVA at baseline (Day 1) was selected as the study eye. If both eyes had same BCVA values at baseline (Day 1), then the participant had to select their non-dominant eye for treatment, or else the right eye was selected as the study eye.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Central Retinal Thickness (CRT) in the Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>CRT was assessed using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), a non-invasive diagnostic system providing high-resolution imaging sections of the retina. SD-OCT was performed in the study eye after pupil dilation. A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement. The study eye is defined as the eye that meets the entry criteria. If both eyes met the entry criteria, the eye with the worse BCVA at baseline (Day 1) was selected as the study eye. If both eyes had same BCVA values at baseline (Day 1), then the participant had to select their non-dominant eye for treatment, or else the right eye was selected as the study eye.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Loss of 15 or Less EDTRS Letters in BCVA From Baseline in the Study Eye</measure>

    <measure>Change Form Baseline in BCVA in the Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 28</time_frame>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Stable Vision</title>
        <description>Stable vision was defined as a loss of fewer than 15 letters in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) compared to baseline. BCVA was measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly using the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Scale (ranging from 0 to 100 letters) in the study eye. The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly means that vision has improved. The study eye was defined as the eye that meets the entry criteria. If both eyes met the entry criteria, the eye with the worse BCVA at baseline (Day 1) was selected as the study eye. If both eyes had same BCVA values at baseline (Day 1), then the participant had to select their non-dominant eye for treatment, or else the right eye was selected as the study eye.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Stable Vision</title>
          <description>Stable vision was defined as a loss of fewer than 15 letters in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) compared to baseline. BCVA was measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly using the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Scale (ranging from 0 to 100 letters) in the study eye. The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly means that vision has improved. The study eye was defined as the eye that meets the entry criteria. If both eyes met the entry criteria, the eye with the worse BCVA at baseline (Day 1) was selected as the study eye. If both eyes had same BCVA values at baseline (Day 1), then the participant had to select their non-dominant eye for treatment, or else the right eye was selected as the study eye.</description>
