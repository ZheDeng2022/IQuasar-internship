    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of PEOX-based polymer encapsulated&#xD;
      paclitaxel FID-007 (FID-007) in treating participants with malignant neoplasms that have&#xD;
      spread to other places in the body and do not respond to treatment. FID-007 is a packaged&#xD;
      form of the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel, and uses a polyethylozaxoline (PEOX) polymer which&#xD;
      may allow the drug to reach deeper into tumors and less into normal cells by being smaller.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of FID-007 and the recommended phase II dose&#xD;
      (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel, (free and total) in patients treated&#xD;
      with FID-007.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the safety and tolerability of FID-007 by assessing toxicities per Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v.)4.3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To obtain a preliminary assessment of anti-tumor activity of FID-007 via objective&#xD;
      radiologic tumor response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate in a preliminary fashion the serum concentration of total paclitaxel and free&#xD;
      paclitaxel, and explore potential associations with serum concentrations, efficacy and&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive FID-007 intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8 and 15. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up periodically.&#xD;
