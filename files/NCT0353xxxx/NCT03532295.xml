  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators propose to combine INCMGA00012 with radiation therapy (RT)&#xD;
      and bevacizumab with or without epacadostat in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma (GBM).&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that this combination provides a powerful synergy between RT&#xD;
      and immune modulators to produce more robust anti-tumor immune response, induce tumor&#xD;
      regression and improve overall survival.&#xD;

    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>-Overall survival is defined as the time interval from date of treatment start to date of first documented death event (death due to any cause) or date of censoring. If a patient has not had an event, OS will be censored at the date of last follow up</description>

    <time_frame>Through 2 years after completion of treatment (estimated to be 4 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of time from start of treatment to radiographic progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first&#xD;
Radiographic progression will be assessed using the RECIST 1.1. If the disease recurrence/progression assessment involves more than one date, the earliest date will be used as the event date. A patient will be censored at the date of the last radiographic disease assessment indicating a lack of disease progression, if any of the following occurs before documented disease progression: alive and lack evidence of progression at the end of study or at the time of analysis data cut-off, disease progression or death occurs right after missing data for a scheduled radiographic disease assessment, patient receives non-protocol treatment, or equivocal findings of recurrence - treatment may continue until the next scheduled assessment. If recurrence is confirmed at the next scheduled assessment, the date of recurrence should be the earlier date when recurrence was suspected</description>

    <measure>Neurologic functions as measured by the NANO scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Neurologic Function in Neuro-Oncology (NANO) scale is a scoring assessment based on direct observation and testing performed during clinical evaluation&#xD;
There are 9 domains (gait, strength, ataxia, sensation, visual fields, facial strength, language, level of consciousness, and behavior&#xD;
The score defines overall response criteria&#xD;
Each domain is subdivided into 3 or 4 levels of function with scores based on discrete quantifiable measures. Thus, levels of function for each domain range from 0 to 2 or 0 to 3. A score of 0 indicates normal function, while the highest score indicates the most severe level of deficit for that domain. Levels of function are distinguished by significant and measurable differences in order to avoid misinterpretation of subtle or nonspecific changes</description>
