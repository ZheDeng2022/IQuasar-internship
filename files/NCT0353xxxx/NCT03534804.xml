                  Uncontrolled hypertension needs to be determined based on persistently high blood&#xD;
                  pressure readings over more than 24 hours and should NOT be based on the blood&#xD;
                  pressure readings from one clinic visit. Blood pressure readings done at home or&#xD;
                  by primary care providers are acceptable. If a blood pressure reading on the day&#xD;

                       the risk associated with study participation or study treatment&#xD;
                       administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results&#xD;
                       and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient&#xD;

                       treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: If a single ECG shows a QTcF with an absolute value &gt; 500 ms, two additional ECGs at&#xD;
        intervals of approximately 3 min must be performed after the initial ECG, and the average&#xD;
        of these three consecutive results for QTcF will be used to determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of another malignancy within 2 years before first dose of study treatment,&#xD;
             with the exception of those determined by the treating investigator to have a&#xD;

             corticosteroids (dose more than physiologic replacement doses equivalent to prednisone&#xD;
             10 mg daily) or (disease modifying immunosuppressive agents). Replacement therapy&#xD;
             (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for&#xD;
             adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local&#xD;
             steroid injection) is not considered an exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
