      This study will be a prospective, open-label trial designed to objectively assess the safety&#xD;
      and bioactivity of AAV2/8-LSPhGAA in subjects diagnosed with Pompe disease, which is caused&#xD;
      by a defect in acid Î±-glucosidase (GAA) gene. AAV2/8-LSPhGAA is intended to enable expression&#xD;
      of a functional copy of the GAA gene in subject's hepatocytes.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects are capable of giving written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to walk at least 100 meters on the 6MWT (with assistive devices permitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  FVC within the range of 30% to less 90% (inclusive) of predicted in the upright&#xD;
             position.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving ERT for at least 104 weeks (inclusive) immediately preceding screening and&#xD;
             receiving a stable dose of ERT for the 52-week period immediately preceding dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Females of childbearing potential must use at least one of the following acceptable birth&#xD;
        control methods throughout the study and for 6 months after dosing with ACTUS-101.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy) 6&#xD;
             months minimum prior to receiving ACTUS-101.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Intrauterine device in place for at least 90 days prior to receiving ACTUS-101.&#xD;
&#xD;

             to receiving ACTUS-101.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Abstinence (the subject must be willing to remain abstinent from screening to 6 months&#xD;
             after receiving ACTUS-101). Females are allowed to claim abstinence as their method of&#xD;
             contraception only when it is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Surgical sterilization of partner(s) (vasectomy) for &gt; 180 days prior toACTUS-101.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Hormonal contraceptives starting &gt; 90 days prior to receiving ACTUS-101. If hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives are started less than 90 days prior to receiving ACTUS-101, subjects&#xD;
             must agree to use a barrier method (diaphragm plus spermicide or condom) from&#xD;
             screening through 90 days after initiation of hormonal contraceptives&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Must agree to use a condom from Study Day 1 through 6 months after the time of&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Documented evidence of vasectomy in males for 180 days minimum prior to receiving&#xD;
             ACTUS-101 is an acceptable form of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Males who claim abstinence as their method of contraception are allowed provided they&#xD;
             agree to use barrier methods should they become sexually active from screening through&#xD;
             6 months after receiving ACTUS-101. Males are allowed to claim abstinence as their&#xD;
             method of contraception only when it is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
             subject&#xD;

             period preceding study day 1, or having started respiratory strength training greater&#xD;
             than 6 months prior to study day 1 and unwilling to continue for the first year of&#xD;
             study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received an investigational drug or participated in another interventional study&#xD;
