  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of this study is to assess whether measurements obtained through speckle tracking (LV&#xD;
      longitudinal and circumferential strain, RV longitudinal strain) can give additional&#xD;
      information in identifying patients who develop adverse outcomes 30 days post successfully&#xD;
      weaning from VA ECMO (liberation not for palliation). It is a prospective observational&#xD;
      non-blinded pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve this purpose, speckle tracking analysis will be performed on the recorded&#xD;
      images of the transoesophageal echocardiogram performed during the last VA ECMO weaning study&#xD;
      of patients defined ready for VA ECMO liberation. VA ECMO liberation will be based according&#xD;
      to LVOT VTI increase and clinical judgment during patients' VA ECMO weaning study. It will be&#xD;
      assessed whether the population experiencing the outcomes of interest (death within 30 days&#xD;
      from VA ECMO liberation, hospital admission for a new episode of cardiogenic shock or heart&#xD;
      failure within 30 days from VA ECMO liberation, need for new mechanical circulatory support&#xD;
      within 30 days from VA ECMO liberation) and the population not experiencing these outcomes&#xD;
      have different values of strain (LV longitudinal and circumferential and RV longitudinal&#xD;
      strain) during the weaning study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This project is non-commercial study which aims to assess whether measurements derived&#xD;
      through speckle tracking give additional information to conventional echocardiographic&#xD;
      parameters (LVOT VTI measurements, etc.) in identifying patients at greatest risk of major&#xD;
      clinical events occurring within 30 days after VA ECMO liberation. It is a prospective&#xD;
      observational non-blinded pilot study. In this study will be investigated whether particular&#xD;
      values of strain (longitudinal and circumferential LV longitudinal and circumferential and RV&#xD;
      longitudinal strain) and conventional echocardiographic parameters, obtained during VA ECMO&#xD;
      weaning studies, are more associated to major clinical outcomes within 30 days after VA ECMO&#xD;
      liberation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population consists of patients receiving VA ECMO mechanical circulatory support for&#xD;
      cardiogenic shock, who have undergone an echocardiogram as part of the weaning process and a&#xD;
      decision has been made to attempt weaning from VA ECMO. The decision to wean the patient from&#xD;
      VA ECMO will be made by the attending clinician who will be aware of all echocardiographic&#xD;
      measurements with the exception of the speckle tracking results (as is the standard-of-care&#xD;
      at our institution). The study investigator who will perform all speckle tracking analysis&#xD;
      will not be involved in the decision to wean from VA ECMO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCHEMATIC OF STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening of VA ECMO patients in whom a weaning study is planned&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Definitive SCREENING FAILURE = patients who do not fulfil inclusion criteria or have at&#xD;
           least one exclusion criterion (not including the LVOT VTI criterion)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. VA ECMO weaning study performed&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients deemed unsuitable for liberation from VA ECMO at this time are not&#xD;
                enrolled for analysis, and are reassessed following the next weaning study&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients deemed suitable for liberation from VA ECMO, but whose LVOT VTI was &lt;10cm&#xD;
                at any stage of the weaning study, or whose LVOT VTI at lowest achieved flow was&#xD;
                lower than baseline are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients deemed suitable for liberation from VA ECMO and not excluded based on LVOT&#xD;
                VTI criterion are enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. EVALUATION OF SPECKLE TRACKING FINDINGS (LV LONGITUDINAL AND CIRCUMFERENTIAL AND RV&#xD;
           LONGITUDINAL STRAIN) AND CONVENTIONAL ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS WITH CLINICAL&#xD;
           OUTCOMES AT 30 DAYS POST VA ECMO LIBERATION (REMOVAL)&#xD;
