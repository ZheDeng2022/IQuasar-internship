      The management of posterior urethral disruption secondary to blunt pelvic injury remains&#xD;
      controversial. While many groups have recommended early realignment of urethral distraction&#xD;
      injuries, Classic reports advocate a suprapubic cystostomy at the time of injury with&#xD;
      delayed, perineal approach urethral re- construction 4 to 6 months after injury . Timing of&#xD;
      the intervention typically is classified as :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. -Immediate treatment: when it takes place less than 48 hours after injury,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. -Delayed primary treatment : after 2 to 14 days, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. -Deferred treatment : 3 months or more after injury.&#xD;

      It is important to make a distinction between posterior urethral stricture and a pelvic&#xD;
      fracture urethral distraction defect. Urethral stricture indicate a narrowing of the urethral&#xD;
      continuity due to either instrumentation or partial urethral tears. In urethral distraction&#xD;
      defects there is a gap between the membranous urethra and the bulbar urethral end. A&#xD;
      distraction injury also involve all or any portion of the membranous urethra.&#xD;

      Immediate open repair of posterior urethral injuries is usually associated with a higher&#xD;
      incidence of strictures, re-stenosis, incontinence and impotence. Difficulty in identifying&#xD;
      structures and planes as a result of hematoma formation and edema also hamper adequate&#xD;
      mobilization and subsequent surgical apposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contemporary urethral realignment employs actual realignment by fluoroscopic and endoscopic&#xD;
      guidance of flexible cystoscopes that keep the urethral ends in the same cephalocaudad axis,&#xD;
      followed by Seldinger technique catheter placement. The urethral catheter, which is usually&#xD;
      maintained for 4 to 6 weeks, acts as a guide that allows the distracted urethral ends to come&#xD;
      together as the pelvic hematoma slowly resorbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the unstable or multisystem trauma patient, realignment often is delayed a few days to&#xD;
      weeks (typically 2 to 14 days). the patient is managed by damage control and resuscitated in&#xD;
      the intensive care unit while the urine is diverted by suprapubic tube placement first. Once&#xD;
      the patient is stable, delayed urethral realignment is performed. Endourologic and radiologic&#xD;
      techniques for realignment, theoretically, should not affect potency or urinary continence&#xD;
      because no manipulation occurs of the periprostatic tissues or neurovascular bundles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Types of surgical repair employed in posterior urethral distraction defect are 1) anastomotic&#xD;
      urethroplasty, 2) Buccal mucosal urethroplasty, 3)Scrotal or penile island and 4) Johansen's&#xD;
      urethroplasty. We aim to compare the outcomes of different management approachs for patients&#xD;
      with posterior urethral distraction injuries after pelvic fractures in Assiut University&#xD;
      Hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the work To evaluate outcomes of posterior urethroplasty in patients with pelvic&#xD;
      fractures and posterior urethral distraction defect according to different patient&#xD;
      characteristics (Age, prior manipulation), type of injury (type of fracture, gap length) and&#xD;
      time of intervention.&#xD;
