  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the third most common mental illness with a lifetime&#xD;
      prevalence rate of 9.2% in Canada. Depression and anxiety are common comorbidities making&#xD;
      treatment complex. Currently available treatments for PTSD include medications and talk&#xD;
      therapies. However, their best combined response rates are around 50%. Our recent pilot&#xD;
      feasibility study showed potential benefits of a breathing based meditation intervention&#xD;
      called Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) in PTSD, as an augmentation treatment. The investigators&#xD;
      seek to now assess the safety and efficacy of SKY intervention compared to an active control,&#xD;
      Health Enhancement Program (HEP) in a double blind randomized controlled trial. The&#xD;
      investigators will include PTSD patients with a wide range of trauma experience including&#xD;
      road traffic accidents, childhood, physical, emotional or sexual abuse, or recurrent traumas&#xD;
      over the lifespan. Patients will be offered a 12-week program of either SKY or HEP&#xD;
      interventions as an add-on to their existing treatment schedules. This study will examine if&#xD;
      patients with PTSD experience a reduction in PTSD symptoms from baseline to 12-week&#xD;
      follow-up, as measured by the PCL-5 after receiving either HEP or SKY.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN: Single-center, blinded (rater, investigator, and clinician), longitudinal, RCT&#xD;
      comparing a 12-week SKY online intervention group to a 12-week HEP online intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY RECRUITMENT: Participants include men and women (n=130), 18-75 years of age, with PTSD.&#xD;
      The study will recruit via referrals from the General Adult Ambulatory, the Traumatic Stress&#xD;
      Services Program (TSS), the PTSD clinical research unit and the Geriatric Mental Health&#xD;
      Program of London Health Sciences Centre at an expected rate of approximately 1 to 2&#xD;
      participants per week. Referred participants will be individuals who in the opinion of&#xD;
      investigators or referring physicians will likely meet inclusion and exclusion criteria. A&#xD;
      letter will be sent to primary care physicians in London, ON and surrounding area requesting&#xD;
      the referral of potential participants. The letter will be accompanied by a poster&#xD;
      advertising the study and by a list of the studies inclusion/exclusion criteria. Posters will&#xD;
      also be placed online on the websites of the studies investigators as well as websites and&#xD;
      social media sites of relevant organizations such as Project Trauma Support and&#xD;
      Ivegotyourback911. Online posters will indicate that individuals should not share or comment&#xD;
      on posters to protect their identity. Printed posters will be placed in community centres,&#xD;
      libraries, hospitals, medical centres, locations where veterans frequent, and locations where&#xD;
      first responders work such as fire halls and police stations. Information sessions will be&#xD;
      held at locations where first responders work or may frequent to inform potential&#xD;
      participants about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING AND INITIAL ASSESSMENT: Referred potential participants will be provided with a&#xD;
      Letter of Information (LOI) to review and consider. Participants will be given a minimum of&#xD;
      24 hours to review the LOI before being contacted over-the-phone by one of the study Research&#xD;
      Assistants (RA). During this initial phone call the RA will answer any questions the&#xD;
      potential participants have, briefly explain the study, and invite potential participants to&#xD;
      a screening appointment to be conducted either remotely or in person. During the initial&#xD;
      screening appointment participants will complete the informed consent process which includes&#xD;
      an opportunity to ask any questions. Participants will be screened for inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria by a trained member of the research team. These participants will have&#xD;
      clinically diagnosed PTSD, further confirmed through a structured clinical interview, the&#xD;
      Clinician-administered PTSD Scale for DSM5-past month version (CAPS5). Any additional&#xD;
      diagnoses will be screened by the MINI (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview). The&#xD;
      CAPS5 will also be used to rule out severe depersonalization and derealization as per&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. If the participant is above the age of 65 years of age, they will&#xD;
      complete a cognitive screening test using the Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE&gt;24 to rule&#xD;
      out significant cognitive impairment. Participants meeting all study criteria who wish to&#xD;
      join the study will be enrolled and assigned a unique study identifier e.g. HEPSKY001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION: Participants meeting inclusion criteria will be randomized to either SKY or&#xD;
      HEP with equal probability (1:1), stratified by gender, using computer generated&#xD;
      randomisation numbers. Concealment of randomisation to outcome assessors and investigators&#xD;
      will be ensured by an independent consultant who will perform the randomization. The&#xD;
      independent consultant will be responsible for randomization and will inform an unblinded&#xD;
      study team member of allocation codes. The unblinded study team member will send an email to&#xD;
      study participants informing them of their treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL INTERVENTIONS: The investigators will offer the two interventions, online via Cisco&#xD;
      WebEx, in groups of 6-8 participants on a rolling basis 1. Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY): 1.&#xD;
      Participants in the SKY group will undergo a 12-week training course conducted by certified&#xD;
      teachers of the Art of Living Foundation. 2. HEP Intervention: Participants in HEP will learn&#xD;
      about health promotion, healthy diet, music, and exercise, but will not learn breathing&#xD;
      techniques, or meditation. HEP will be delivered by trained staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will continue to receive standard care through their providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN: All statistical analyses will be run with the level of statistical&#xD;
      significance set at 0.05. Independent samples t tests (for continuous variables) or&#xD;
      chi-squared analyses (for categorical variables) will be used to identify whether any&#xD;
      differences in demographic or clinical characteristics exist between patients assigned to SKY&#xD;
      and HEP. Any variables showing statistically significant differences will be controlled for&#xD;
      in the analyses, and sub-group analyses will be completed, as appropriate, to estimate the&#xD;
      effect of various demographic or clinical variables. For our Primary Objective 1, the change&#xD;
      in PCL-5 scores from baseline to 12-week follow-up of patients assigned to SKY and HEP will&#xD;
      be compared using linear mixed models. This approach will account for the clustering of&#xD;
      observations since both SKY and HEP will be delivered in a group setting. We will evaluate&#xD;
      whether a greater proportion of patients assigned to SKY, compared to HEP, respond to&#xD;
      treatment (decrease of at least 10 points on the PCL-5), or go into remission (defined as a&#xD;
      PCL-5 score &lt;33), using generalized linear mixed models. In evaluating our Secondary&#xD;
      Objectives; depressive symptoms, anxiety, and quality of life, the change score for each&#xD;
      measure from baseline to 12-week follow-up of patients assigned to SKY and HEP will be&#xD;
      compared using linear mixed models. In evaluating our Exploratory Objectives, linear mixed&#xD;
      models will also be used to evaluate the change in levels of inflammatory markers and HF-HRV&#xD;
      from baseline to the 12-week follow-up. Correlation analyses will be used to evaluate whether&#xD;
      improvement in PCL-5 scores is associated with greater improvement in levels of inflammatory&#xD;
      markers and HR-HRV. Lastly, we will evaluate whether the effects found at the 12-week&#xD;
      follow-up are maintained at six months. The above analyses (linear mixed models and&#xD;
      generalized linear mixed models) will be repeated for PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms,&#xD;
      anxiety and quality of life, comparing scores at baseline and six-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analysis may be completed in order to meet one or more of these conditions a) sponsor&#xD;
      reporting requirements and/or b) research training requirements of residents and/or c) data&#xD;
      safety monitoring board meetings for stop or continue decisions. Prior research ethics board&#xD;
      approval will be sought before any interim analysis is conducted.&#xD;

Starting the following week participants will attend once weekly follow up sessions (60-90 min/wk) for 3 weeks and then bimonthly sessions for the next 8 weeks. Participants will be asked to complete 25 min/day of course homework. Participants will learn about health promotion, healthy diet, music, and exercise, but do not learn breathing techniques, or meditation. In HEP, which has been manualized, participants get the support of a group and facilitator, and talk through and try to implement positive health-enhancing life changes, HEP will be delivered by a trained social worker (or equivalent).</description>

Through SKY breathing, interactive discussions, journaling, yoga and guided meditations, the workshop builds a framework for resilience and empowerment, and develops self-awareness, connectedness and community, and a positive outlook. SKY training will take place in group-format (6-8 participants). During the first week participants will attend three 2.5-3 hour sessions on three consecutive days. There will then be a gap of 4 days where participants can apply the tools provided, followed by three more consecutive days of 1.5-3 hours of instruction. This will be followed by once weekly follow up sessions (90 min/wk) for 3 weeks and then bimonthly sessions (every 2 weeks) for the next 8 weeks. In addition, participants will be asked to practice SKY at home daily (25 min/day) throughout the duration of the study period (up to 26 weeks) and log practice frequency.</description>
