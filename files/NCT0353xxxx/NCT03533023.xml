  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study of its kind to assess and test an intervention to improve biological&#xD;
      rhythms and general health of shift workers, specifically first responders with San Diego&#xD;
      Fire and Rescue. In a randomized control trial, investigators intend to measure the health&#xD;
      impact of Time Restricted Eating in emergency responders who work a 24-hour shift schedule.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomly assigned to a control group of behavioral nutrition counseling&#xD;
      (standard of care) or the intervention group of standard of care with the addition of&#xD;
      adopting a 10 hour eating window for one year (TRE). For the first 3 months of intervention,&#xD;
      participants will be monitored closely by the research team. For the following 9 months,&#xD;
      participants will be in a self-monitored intervention period. Investigators will evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of TRE on blood glucose levels, biomarkers, sleep/mood, and weight loss. These&#xD;
      assessments will be made at baseline, at the end of the 12-week monitored intervention&#xD;
      period, and every 3 months (months 6, 9, and 12) during the self-monitored intervention&#xD;
      period for one year. Food/drink intake, activity, and sleep will be monitored with the&#xD;
      smartphone myCircadianClock application (&quot;mCC app&quot;) throughout the study. A continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitor, a wrist-worn actigraphy device, and questionnaires will also be used during&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
