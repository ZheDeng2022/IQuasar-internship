  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2016 WHO antenatal care guidelines stated that pregnant women in undernourished&#xD;
      populations should receive fortified balanced energy-protein (BEP) supplements to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of stillbirth and small-for-gestational-age birth. However, acceptable supplements and&#xD;
      delivery channels must be determined for different contexts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present proposal therefore will 1) perform a formative study to identify the most&#xD;
      suitable (acceptability and utilization) BEP supplement for pregnant women in rural Burkina&#xD;
      Faso (phase 1) and 2) evaluate the efficacy of this supplement to improve birth weight, fetal&#xD;
      and infant growth (phase 2). The nutritional composition of the BEP supplement was&#xD;
      established during an expert convening at the BMGF in September 2016. Private sector partners&#xD;
      will prepare the supplements in the selected forms with the recommended nutrient composition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy remains a challenging period in the life of many women in low- and middle-income&#xD;
      countries. Maternal mortality remains high and many newborns suffer from premature delivery&#xD;
      and /or gestational growth retardation both in length and in weight accumulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2016 WHO antenatal care guidelines stated that pregnant women in undernourished&#xD;
      populations should receive fortified balanced energy-protein (BEP) supplements to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of stillbirth and small-for-gestational-age birth. However, acceptable supplements and&#xD;
      delivery channels must be determined for different contexts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a fortified BEP supplement for&#xD;
      pregnant and lactating women to improve birth weight, fetal and infant growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research includes 2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1 - part 1: Formative research to identify preferred product types of a fortified&#xD;
           BEP supplement;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1 - part 2: Formative research with a 10-week home-feeding trial to determine the&#xD;
           acceptability of a fortified BEP supplement for longer-term consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2: A community-based, individually randomized efficacy trial of the fortified BEP&#xD;
           food supplement including 1,776 pregnant and lactating women aimed at testing 2&#xD;
           hypothesis: supplementing pregnant and lactating women with a fortified BEP supplement&#xD;
           will improve fetal growth; improving fetal growth will have a positive effect on health&#xD;
           and growth during infancy.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The intervention study is a randomized controlled 2x2 factorial efficacy trial. At study inclusion, eligible pregnant women will be randomly assigned to the prenatal intervention or control group, and randomly assigned to a postnatal intervention or control group. The intervention group will receive daily a fortified BEP supplement to be consumed under supervision for the duration of pregnancy/lactation. Both control and intervention group will receive the standard iron and folic acid tablet through the regular ante natal care program.</intervention_model_description>
