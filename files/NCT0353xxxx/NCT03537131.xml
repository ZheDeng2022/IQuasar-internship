  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately 400,000 people in the UK who are living with type 1 diabetes (T1DM),&#xD;
      of whom 29,000 are children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with T1DM experience on average 2 episodes of symptomatic hypoglycaemia per week , and&#xD;
      exercise (especially aerobic) increases this risk . Strategies to prevent hypoglycaemia&#xD;
      during and after exercise include increasing glucose consumption and reducing insulin dose,&#xD;
      however overcompensation may result in worsening of blood glucose control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysregulated glucagon secretion, manifested as a reduced counter-regulatory response during&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia, is a key feature in T1DM, occurring soon after diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anecdotal evidence suggests that SGLT-2 (sodium/glucose cotransporter-2) inhibitors (SGLT2i)&#xD;
      such as dapagliflozin prevent exercise-induced hypoglycaemia in T1DM. SGLT2is promote glucose&#xD;
      excretion without causing hypoglycaemia.Paradoxically, given their mode of action, they&#xD;
      increase plasma glucose and stimulate glucagon secretion. Studies in diabetic rats indicate&#xD;
      that the physiological counter-regulatory response is suppressed in insulin-treated diabetes,&#xD;
      a defect that can be corrected by somatostatin antagonists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DEPTH trial will test the novel hypothesis that hypoglycaemia results from hypersecretion&#xD;
      of somatostatin, and that this defect can be corrected by SGLT2i. As these medications are&#xD;
      already in clinical use, our findings may be rapidly translated into practice. Understanding&#xD;
      these key processes has the potential to generate novel therapeutic strategies to improve&#xD;
      glycaemic control, thereby facilitating a more active lifestyle in people with T1DM.&#xD;

      PART A Study visit 1 (30min, day 1): 1. Observations documented in CRF: resting heart rate&#xD;
      and blood pressure 2. CGM sensor inserted. 3. Insulin dose reduced by approximately 15%. 4.&#xD;
      Participants instructed to return on day 3 (study visit 2) fasted (no breakfast), and to&#xD;
      refrain from exercising until then. 5. If they experience a hypoglycaemic episode within 24h&#xD;
      of visit 2 then it will be postponed by 2 days. The medical research team will review the&#xD;
      participant's insulin dose and make any required changes. If following this a second&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia event occurs, then the participant will be withdrawn from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visit 2 (5 hours, day 3): 1. Observations documented in CRF: resting heart rate and&#xD;
      blood pressure 2. Euglycaemic clamp for up to 1.5h to maintain blood glucose at 5mmol/L&#xD;
      (90mg/dL) 3. Exercise challenge 4. If a participant fails to reach hypoglycaemia (defined as&#xD;
      &lt;3.3mmol/L, 60mg/dL) during the exercise challenge, then the study visit will be repeated&#xD;
      after at least 2 days of washout/rest. If they again fail to reach hypoglycaemia then they&#xD;
      will be withdrawn from the trial. 5. If the exercise challenge is completed with a&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia episode, then the participant will proceed to Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following visit 2, participants will be allocated to a treatment group using an adaptive&#xD;
      randomisation scheme. This will be used to balance the groups' baseline characteristics (age,&#xD;
      sex &amp; fitness level) in this relatively small pilot trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART B Study visit 3 (30 minutes, day 8): 1. Observations documented in CRF: resting heart&#xD;
      rate and blood pressure 2. CGM sensor inserted (if required). 3. Participants informed which&#xD;
      arm of the study they have been randomised to, and supplied with their prescription of&#xD;
      dapagliflozin. Participants in arm B1 will take the single dose when they attend study visit&#xD;
      4. Participants in arm B2 will begin taking their regular dose of dapagliflozin immediately.&#xD;
      4. Participants instructed to return on day 10 (study visit 4) fasted (no breakfast), and to&#xD;
      refrain from exercising until then. 5. If they experience a hypoglycaemic episode within 24h&#xD;
      of visit 4 then the exercise challenge will be postponed by 2 days. The medical research team&#xD;
      will review the participant's insulin dose and make any required changes. If following this a&#xD;
      second hypoglycaemia event occurs, then the participant will be withdrawn from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visit 4 (5 hours; day 10): 1. Observations documented in CRF: resting heart rate and&#xD;
      blood pressure 2. (Arm B1): single dose of dapagliflozin taken when they arrive at the&#xD;
      department unless they have experienced a hypoglycaemia event earlier in the morning. (Arm&#xD;
      B2): compliance with dapagliflozin regimen and adverse events recorded in the CRF by the&#xD;
      medical research team. 3. Euglycaemic clamp for up to 1.5h to maintain blood glucose at&#xD;
      5mmol/L (90mg/dL) 4. Exercise challenge 5. Participants in Arm B2 will be instructed to take&#xD;
      one final dose of dapagliflozin the following day. All participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      return to their pre-trial insulin dose after 48h 6. Arrangements made for end of study visit&#xD;
      (either at CRU or home-visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visit 5 (30min; day 12-20): 1. End of study visit (either at CRU or home-visit) 2. CGM&#xD;
      sensor removed and data downloaded. CGM system returned to CRU. 3. (Arm B1): adverse events&#xD;
      recorded. (Arm B2): compliance with dapagliflozin regimen, adverse events recorded and any&#xD;
      unused dapagliflozin returned (document drug accountability).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone follow-up (15min; 19-27 days after study visit 5): 1. Documentation of any adverse&#xD;
      events occurred following the discontinuation of dapagliflozin. 2. Participant informed about&#xD;
      end of study&#xD;
