      This is a multicenter, randomized, open label study with an active standard-of-care&#xD;
      comparator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stable patients who are already considered to be stable on their standard-of-care&#xD;
      penicillamine chelation therapy for at least 1 year will enroll in the study and enter a&#xD;
      12-week Penicillamine Baseline Period comprising of 1 month (4 weeks) run-in period followed&#xD;
      by a 2 month (8 weeks) evaluation period. During this time all patients will continue to take&#xD;
      their current penicillamine under study conditions. At the end of the Penicillamine Baseline&#xD;
      Period, patients who fulfill the protocol definition of being adequately controlled and&#xD;
      tolerating penicillamine will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either TETA 4HCl or to&#xD;
      continue to receive penicillamine. There is then a 24-week Post-randomization Phase&#xD;
      comprising of a 1 month (4 weeks) run-in period for both treatment arms and a 5 month (20&#xD;
      weeks) evaluation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who successfully complete the 24-week Post-randomization Phase of the study will&#xD;
      have the opportunity to enter an 18 month (72 weeks) Extension Phase. Initially they continue&#xD;
      to receive their allocated TETA 4HCl or penicillamine for a further 24 weeks (i.e., up to&#xD;
      Week 60 of the study). Thereafter all patients will receive TETA 4HCl for 48 weeks (i.e.,&#xD;
      between Week 60 and Week 108). Study clinic visits occur every 6 months (24 weeks) for all&#xD;
      patients (i.e., at Weeks 60, 84 and 108).&#xD;

                       on value at Week 8 visit if a repeat (unscheduled) urinary copper excretion&#xD;
                       was performed at this visit. Result should be within the assay limits of&#xD;
                       quantification for the sample. The ranges in μmol of copper are 0.40 to 2.38&#xD;

                       more of the above lab values fall outside the specified range, it can be&#xD;
                       repeated. The repeat value(s) must be available prior to randomization at&#xD;
                       Week 12 and, if within specified range, the patient can continue to&#xD;
                       randomization. If a patient fails this additional criterion at the end of&#xD;
                       the Penicillamine Baseline Period, the patient can return to the start of&#xD;
                       the run-in period i.e. Day 1 (but only once). A negative urinary pregnancy&#xD;
                       test is also required prior to randomization for females of childbearing&#xD;
                       potential.&#xD;
