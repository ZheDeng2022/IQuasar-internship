  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diaphragm is the main muscle assisting breathing. This study aims to assess the use of&#xD;
      MRI in patients with diaphragmatic weakness and patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary&#xD;
      Disease (COPD) who have hyperinflation. In some patients with COPD, air gets trapped in the&#xD;
      lungs and causes them to expand too much; this is called hyperinflation. These patient report&#xD;
      severe breathlessness, which may be in part because of their diaphragm. It is known that&#xD;
      posture impacts lung function and breathing and the investigators want to assess the effect&#xD;
      of posture on the diaphragm. Currently, lung function tests and CT or ultrasound scan are the&#xD;
      main tests used to check how the diaphragm works. Recently, at University of Nottingham, an&#xD;
      new imaging approach has been developed that uses an upright MRI allowing testing the&#xD;
      patients in lying position and seated/standing in the same scanner. This may help researchers&#xD;
      test the diaphragm position and shape more accurately and check the effects of posture on the&#xD;
      diaphragm. This may help researchers and clinicians better understand the relationship&#xD;
      between postural changes in diaphragm position and shape and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place at the clinical research MRI centre at Nottingham Medical School,&#xD;
      which is next to Queen's Medical Centre. The investigators want to recruit healthy&#xD;
      volunteers, patients with diaphragmatic weakness and patients with COPD whose lungs are&#xD;
      hyperinflated. The study will last 2 years, and the participants are asked to attend the&#xD;
      imaging centre only once, where they will give consent and will be scanned at the same visit,&#xD;
      which is expected to take 2 hours to complete. They will be scanned on two scanners: lying&#xD;
      and seated/standing in the new upright scanner and lying in a conventional scanner. The&#xD;
      investigators will not use any contrast for imaging, i.e. participants will not be injected&#xD;
      with a dye and they will breathe air.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, proof of concept clinical trial. The investigators want to recruit&#xD;
      healthy volunteers, patients with diaphragmatic weakness and patients with COPD whose lungs&#xD;
      are hyperinflated. Half the investigators are clinicians and have asked their patient whether&#xD;
      such a study would interest them, and patients have been very supportive. This study&#xD;
      addresses an unanswered clinical question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be adults, men and women, who can give informed consent, and can&#xD;
      cooperate with the study procedures. As the participants will be scanned using MRI, people&#xD;
      who are unsuitable for MRI scanning, for example those with a pacemaker, will be excluded&#xD;
      from the study for safety reasons.The participant will be observed by a clinical investigator&#xD;
      throughout the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for side effects / risks, no medicinal products will be administered in this study. Some&#xD;
      participants may experience anxiety while undergoing MRI scan. It is expected that some&#xD;
      patients may not be able to lie flat in the scanner, in which case they will be asked only to&#xD;
      undergo scans that they are able to tolerate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to being scanned using an upright MRI and a conventional MRI, the following&#xD;
      measurements will be takes: weight, height, blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation,&#xD;
      respiratory rate, and spirometry. The participants will be asked to fill a St George's&#xD;
      Respiratory Questionnaire and an MRC (Medical Research Council) Dyspnoea Scale. A detailed&#xD;
      medical history will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be assigned unique codes, and their data will be anonymised.&#xD;
      Participants' medical reports will only be accessed for study purposes and will be treated as&#xD;
      confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will aim to use the data to plan future studies, and the data from this&#xD;
      study may contribute to publications and presentations. Participants will not be identified&#xD;
      in any publications arising from the research. The data obtained will be published without&#xD;
      any identifying information..&#xD;
