  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, single arm, multi-centre interventional study to assess&#xD;
      the clinical efficacy and safety of olaparib maintenance monotherapy and will be conducted in&#xD;
      patients with platinum sensitive relapsed (PSR) high grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian&#xD;
      tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete response or partial&#xD;
      response) to platinum-based chemotherapy&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be those with high grade (serous or endometrioid) epithelial ovarian&#xD;
      cancer, primary peritoneal and/or fallopian tube cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have completed 2 previous lines of platinum-based therapy (e.g., containing&#xD;
      carboplatin or cisplatin) and platinum sensitive relapsed before entry to the study. Eligible&#xD;
      patients must be in complete or partial response according to RECIST 1.1 criteria following&#xD;
      the platinum-based chemotherapy prior to enrolment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BRCA (Breast Cancer Susceptibility genes) and HRR (Homologous Recombination Repair) mutation&#xD;
      status should be determined through blood and/or tumour testing when patients are enrolled in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned olaparib tablets p.o. 300 mg twice daily. They should initiate&#xD;
      olaparib treatment within 8 weeks after their last dose of platinum-containing chemotherapy&#xD;
      (last dose is the day of the last infusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have clinical and objective radiological tumour assessments according to&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) criteria at baseline and every 12&#xD;
      weeks relative to date of enrolment, until objective radiological disease progression as&#xD;
      determined by the investigator. Patients could continue to receive olaparib for as long as&#xD;
      determined by the investigator, until objective radiological disease progression or as long&#xD;
      as in the investigator's opinion they are benefiting from treatment in relation to other&#xD;
      clinical assessments and they do not meet any other discontinuation criteria. Once a patient&#xD;
      has discontinued olaparib she will be managed as per local clinical practice but will remain&#xD;
      in the study and data will be collected on subsequent treatments, progression, overall&#xD;
      survival and safety.&#xD;
