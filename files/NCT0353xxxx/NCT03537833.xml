  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pemetrexed is a multi-folate inhibitor approved in the treatment of non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC) and pleural mesothelioma. Its toxicity profile is mainly hematologic (anemia,&#xD;
      neutropenia and thrombopenia) and can be limiting when &gt; grade 2 according to NCI-CTCAE&#xD;
      criteria. First clinical trials highlighted hematologic toxicity, especially anemia, which&#xD;
      was reduced by decreasing pemetrexed dosage from 600 to 500 mg/m² Q3W and by adding&#xD;
      systematic vitamin supplementation (B9/B12). Despite this, incidence of hematological&#xD;
      toxicity remains frequent with anemia occurring in more than 20% of patients treated by&#xD;
      pemetrexed in combination. Methotrexate, a well-known antineoplastic drugs used in several&#xD;
      cancer and non-cancer disease conditions can also induced severe hematologic toxicity in case&#xD;
      of methotrexate-reduced elimination and, as a consequence, its accumulation. For example, the&#xD;
      elimination of methotrexate is mediated by tubular secretion through type 1 and type 3&#xD;
      organic anion transport (hOAT1 and hOAT3). Association with drugs that inhibits hOATs can&#xD;
      induced a hematological toxicity caused by methotrexate accumulation. Among these, proton&#xD;
      pump inhibitors (PPIs) are known to inhibit hOATs. The drug interaction that results from&#xD;
      their combination with methotrexate is clinically relevant and lead to an increased&#xD;
      hematological toxicity. However, hypothetical drug interaction between PPIs and pemetrexed is&#xD;
      unknown while pemetrexed seems to be mostly eliminated by hOAT3 (11-fold higher than&#xD;
      methotrexate). One study revealed lansoprazole to inhibits in vitro hOAT3. This same study&#xD;
      investigates in a retrospective chart patients treated by pemetrexed and the study found a&#xD;
      significant association between combination with PPI and hematological toxicity by&#xD;
      pemetrexed. Unfortunately this study lacks of relevant methodology and suffered from its&#xD;
      retrospective chart. This potential drug interaction must be a real concern for oncologists&#xD;
      and clinical pharmacists. The investigators aim to investigate the potential association&#xD;
      between PPIs and pemetrexed combination and the incidence of hematological toxicity in a&#xD;
      multicenter and prospective study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prospective, longitudinal, multicenter and observational study. All eligible patients will&#xD;
      receive clear information about aims and research modalities on the medical consultation and&#xD;
      before first course of chemotherapy. If patient agrees with study aims and protocol, disease&#xD;
      and therapeutic management will not be change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research agree and participation leads to&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical data: weight, height, body mass index&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Demographic data: sociodemographic data, comorbidities&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Disease data: related to tumor disease and antineoplastic protocol including&#xD;
                adjuvant medications like antiemetic of antidiarrheal agents for example.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complete medication review: a minimum of 3 information sources among the patient and/or&#xD;
           family and close, patient health records, community pharmacy, general practitioner,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  activation of a specific study patient record&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  biologic data collection: blood count and thrombocythemia during all period study and&#xD;
           three week after patient study completion,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  supplementary data in case of hematologic toxicity: hospitalization, growth factors&#xD;
           (like erythropoietin and/or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor use), blood&#xD;
           transfusions, intravenous iron, chemotherapy treatment delay All patients are followed&#xD;
           since inclusion and for 18 months. Research logistic Patients will be recruited in&#xD;
           cancer hospital service where patients received pemetrexed in the four study participant&#xD;
           centers. Full information and all necessary clarification about study will be explained&#xD;
           to all eligible patients with an appropriate consent form. Data collection using case&#xD;
           report form will be performed by pharmacists and physicians from hospitalization&#xD;
           setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruiting duration period Twelve months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject duration period Eighteen months Subject accessibility Patients will be recruited in&#xD;
      one of the four participant centers Statistical analysis Number of patients to include with&#xD;
      statistical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to include 100 patients per group after calculating the number of subjects&#xD;
      required (nQuery software) taking into account the following assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risk alpha = 0.05&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical power = 90%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients without hematologic toxicity in PPI-negative group = 0.62&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients without hematologic toxicity in PPI-positive group = 0.88 (Hazard&#xD;
           ratio = 3.74) Statistical analysis methods of criteria Data description will be&#xD;
           performed using mean and standard deviation or median (interquartile interval and&#xD;
           minimum and maximum) for quantitative variables according to variable distribution and&#xD;
           number and percentage for qualitative variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bivariate analysis will be conducted in order to found the association between hematological&#xD;
      toxicity or not and clinical variables. Multivariate analysis will be performed with Cox&#xD;
      model, using a dependent variable &quot;presence or not of a hematologic toxicity&quot; and&#xD;
      independents variables, variables that are associated with a &quot;p&quot; less than 0.20 with&#xD;
      confusion factors adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of missing data The study will be performed in order to minimize the number of&#xD;
      missing data. For each variable number and percentage of missing data will be described.&#xD;
