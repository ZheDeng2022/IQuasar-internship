  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biliary drainage is the mainstay of the palliative treatment in patients with inoperable&#xD;
      malignant bile duct stricture. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the&#xD;
      cornerstone of biliary drainage method in these patients. However, ERCP is sometime&#xD;
      unsuccessful to perform because of the presence of the high grade biliary stricture, tumor&#xD;
      invasion of duodenum and ampulla of vater and surgically altered gastrointestinal anatomy.&#xD;
      Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided biliary drainage has been emerged as an alternative&#xD;
      procedure to traditional surgical bypass and percutaneous trans hepatic biliary drainage&#xD;
      after failed ERCP. There were few data to directly compare between ERCP and EUS guided&#xD;
      biliary drainage and in patients with malignant high grade biliary stricture.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is comparing the efficacy and complications between ERCP and EUS guided&#xD;
      biliary drainage in patients with malignant high grade biliary stricture. Malignant high&#xD;
      grade biliary stricture has not been well defined. The investigators define this malignant&#xD;
      high grade biliary stricture using these arbitrary number include total bilirubin ≥ 15 mg/dl&#xD;
      and or bile duct diameter ≥12 mm. based on the investigation's experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be divided patients with inoperable malignant high grade biliary stricture&#xD;
      into 2 groups, group (A) will be undergone ERCP with biliary stenting and group (B) will be&#xD;
      undergone EUS guided biliary drainage. If the assigned intervention is not successful, then&#xD;
      patients will be crossed-over to the another intervention.&#xD;

    <description>ERCP with biliary stent is performed using a side view duodenoscope of Olympus (TJF-160). Biliary cannulation is performed using a sphincterotome and 0.035 inch jag wire, and cholangiogarm is done to assess common bile duct diameter, and length of biliary stricture. Biliary sphincterotomy is then performed. A straight biliary stent is placed across stricture bile duct.</description>

    <description>EUS guided biliary drainage is performed using a linear echoendoscope of Olympus (GFUCT240). Extrahepatic bile duct was identified from duodenal bulb, then 19 G needle is inserted into bile duct with confirmed with cholangiogram. The fistula tract is dilated using a 6 Fr cystotome (Wilson Cook Medical). A double pigtail stent is placed across biliary-enteric fistula.</description>
