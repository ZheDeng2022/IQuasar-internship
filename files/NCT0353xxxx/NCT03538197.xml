  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is the second leading cause of death among people aged 15 to 24 (WHO, 2014). After a&#xD;
      first suicide attempt, the 18 to 25 years old would be very likely to repeat the act: 25 to&#xD;
      31% would make a new attempt in the following year (Christiansen et al, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless the literature on this subject is not detailed. In this project, we hypothesize&#xD;
      that young adults aged 18 to 25 who have made their first suicide attempt will repeat their&#xD;
      act more frequently than younger or older populations. In addition, these young people would&#xD;
      have identifiable risk factors (sociodemographic, clinical and biological) that differ from&#xD;
      young people who do not enter this phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main objective is to measure the rate of suicidal reiteration in a population of young&#xD;
      adults aged 18 to 25 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary objectives are to identify sociodemographic, clinical and biological&#xD;
      characteristics of a population of suicidal re attempt young people, to highlight potential&#xD;
      risk factors&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Our main objective is to measure the rate of suicidal re attempt (SR) in a population of&#xD;
           young adults aged 18 to 25 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Our secondary objectives are to identify sociodemographic, clinical and biological&#xD;
           characteristics of a population of suicidal young people, in an attempt to highlight&#xD;
           potential risk factors. We will try to highlight correlations between the reiteration of&#xD;
           the suicidal act and:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. socio-demographic criteria: level of urbanity, socio-economic level, social and&#xD;
                family context, date and place of birth, religion, sexual orientation, name and&#xD;
                contact details of the general practitioner, previous access to care&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. scores on the scales of various psychiatric pathologies, existing or in formation&#xD;
                (eg depression, anxiety disorders, psychosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. alterations at the peripheral level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  on the stress response system: cortisolemia and capillary cortisol levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  on the total and mature serum BDNF&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, DNA and RNA genetic samples will be taken in order to constitute a biological&#xD;
      collection for later research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study: This is an interventional research with minimal risks and constraints (2 °&#xD;
      study), multicenter prospective cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of centers: 2 Suicide Prevention Center at the Le Vinatier Hospital Center and the&#xD;
      Post Crisis Unit at the Edouard Herriot Hospital of the Hospices Civils de Lyon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the study / experimental plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective cohort study that will be divided into two groups: &quot;repeat suicide&#xD;
      attempt&quot; and &quot;no repeat attempt&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary judgment criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the occurrence of repeating a suicide attempt (over a period of 3 months after the&#xD;
      initial attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, a suicide attempt is defined according to WHO criteria as &quot;non-fatal&#xD;
      suicidal behavior, self-inflicted injury with a desire to end one's life that does not lead&#xD;
      to death&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will include 200 patients at the Le Vinatier CH Suicide Prevention Center and the&#xD;
      Post Crisis Unit at Edouard Herriot Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      inclusion criteria: between the ages of 18 and 25&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a first suicide attempt&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Master French sufficient&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Majors protected: under curatorship or under guardianship&#xD;
&#xD;
      Course of the study :&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Inclusion will take place immediately after the first suicide attempt at the Post Crisis&#xD;
      Unit at Edouard Herriot Hospital and the Suicide Prevention Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An anamnestic collection of social and demographic data will be carried out: level of&#xD;
      urbanity, professional activity, level of study, access to care, and previous care received,&#xD;
      socio-economic level, social and family context (notably existing conflict with parents or&#xD;
      love break-up). The patient's telephone number will be collected as well as the patient's&#xD;
      psychiatric and addiction history, and the means used for the suicide attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different scales of assessments, by means of self-questionnaires, will be given to the&#xD;
      patient and an investigator will provide the C-SSRS scale assessment for the suicidal risk&#xD;
      severity. Finally a venous blood sample will be performed with a measure of total and mature&#xD;
      serum BDNF and cortisolemia. Capillary cortisol will also be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining the patient's consent, two blood samples (DNA and RNA) will be collected and&#xD;
      stored at -80 degrees to create a biological collection for later research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An orientation in the course of care will then be given to the subject who will receive the&#xD;
      appropriate care as well as a phone call made by the Suicide Prevention Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -At 3 months: A phone call will be made to check the presence or absence of the main&#xD;
      evaluation criterion: the repetition of a suicide attempt. In addition, the patient will be&#xD;
      asked about life events during these three months and the care received since inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits and risks of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected benefits of this study are: a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      the recurrence of the suicidal act, which could allow an optimal patient management and an&#xD;
      adapted orientation in the care network, this for a setting in place in the near future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, patients included in the study will benefit from follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The foreseeable risk is the SR that can lead to suicide. To minimize this risk, each patient&#xD;
      included in this protocol will benefit from a clinical evaluation performed by a trained&#xD;
      investigator. At the end of this evaluation, according to the observed suicidal risk, an&#xD;
      orientation in the course of care will be proposed. Each patient will be informed of the&#xD;
      different modalities of psychiatry consultations and how to challenge the network. In&#xD;
      addition, all patients will receive a phone call from the Suicide Prevention Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No serious adverse effects that could be attributed to the project are expected as part of&#xD;
      this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, the blood test is carried out systematically as part of a post-suicide treatment and&#xD;
      no other invasive examination is scheduled. The only undesirable events that can occur after&#xD;
      a venous blood collection are: a hematoma at the point of puncture, pain during the bite,&#xD;
      vagal discomfort or rare cases of infectious risks. These risks are greatly minimized by&#xD;
      means of sterile single-use equipment and qualified medical personnel, and can not be&#xD;
      considered as a serious expected adverse effect.&#xD;

    <description>The Screener contains 6 &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; questions in which respondents are asked to indicate whether they have experienced several thoughts or feelings relating to suicide over the past month and behaviors over their lifetime and past 3 months. Each question addresses a different component of the respondent's suicide ideation severity and behavior.&#xD;
Question 1: wish to be dead Question 2: non-specific suicidal thoughts Questions 3-5: more specific suicidal thoughts and intent to act Question 6: suicidal behavior over the respondent's lifetime and past 3 months If the respondent answers &quot;yes&quot; to Question 2, he/she is instructed to answer Questions 3-5. If the respondent answers &quot;no&quot; to Question 2, he/she may skip to Question 6.&#xD;
An answer of &quot;yes&quot; to any of the six questions may indicate a need for referral to a trained mental health professional and an answer of &quot;yes&quot; to questions 4, 5 or 6 indicate high-risk.</description>
