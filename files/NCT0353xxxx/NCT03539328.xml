      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, designed to assess the therapeutic&#xD;
      efficacy and toxicity of the combination chemotherapy with pembrolizumab in recurrent,&#xD;
      platinum resistant OC patients. The main objective is to test whether the therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention benefits the patients evaluating the increase in overall survival with respect&#xD;
      to chemotherapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin 40 mg/mq iv q 28 Weekly Paclitaxel 80 mg/mq d 1,8,15 q 28&#xD;
      Gemcitabine 1000 mg/mq d 1,8 q 21 At physician' discretion or&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin 40 mg/mq iv q 28 Weekly Paclitaxel 80 mg/mq d 1,8,15 q 28&#xD;
      Gemcitabine 1000 mg/mq d 1,8 q 21 plus Pembrolizumab 200 mg d1 q 21 iv infusion in 30 minutes&#xD;
      In both arms patients will receive treatments until disease progression, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity of patient's refusal. Patients will receive at least 6 to 8 cycles of chemotherapy&#xD;
      at physician's discretion. In the experimental arm patients who stop chemotherapy for&#xD;
      toxicity reasons and whose disease is at least in stabilization, may continue treatment with&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab as single agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be stratified according to the number of previous chemotherapy lines (1 vs &gt;1)&#xD;
      and measurable/evaluable disease.&#xD;
