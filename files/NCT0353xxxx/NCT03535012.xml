  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past 10 years, there have been substantial improvements in breast reconstruction by&#xD;
      plastic surgeons, and much has been achieved in aesthetic restoration after mastectomy.&#xD;
      Advances in both microsurgery and implants have allowed for a wider variety of surgical&#xD;
      methods, and procedural skills that minimize donor site complications have been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With such satisfactory aesthetic results, interest has recently increased not only in breast&#xD;
      reconstruction but also in sensory recovery. Due to the growing expectation of patients,&#xD;
      sensory discomfort may decrease overall patient satisfaction with breast reconstruction&#xD;
      despite good aesthetic results. Hence, for qualitative improvement of breast reconstruction&#xD;
      surgery, efforts must be made to restore sensation in the reconstructed breast. There has&#xD;
      been little research on the mechanism of sensory recovery despite its clinical importance.&#xD;
      This study aimed to compare the degree of sensory recovery in the reconstructed breast using&#xD;
      various reconstruction methods as well as to evaluate the status of neural regeneration with&#xD;
      harvesting the tissues when nipple reconstruction is performed.&#xD;

        This study will be conducted by dividing the subjects into two groups(25 per each arm)&#xD;
        according to the method of reconstruction: implant vs. abdominal tissue. It is difficult to&#xD;
        determine a sample size that can establish statistical significance based on previous&#xD;
        studies. Therefore, the number of targeted subjects was estimated based on the number of&#xD;
        patients that can generally be recruited during the study period.&#xD;
