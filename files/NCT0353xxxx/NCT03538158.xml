  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to examine the usability and efficacy, for diverse older&#xD;
      adults, of a new tablet-based dynamic system: the Fittle Senior System (FSS) that will&#xD;
      provide: (1) personalized behavior-change programs for improved diet and increased physical&#xD;
      activity and (2) online social interaction and support from small teams pursuing similar&#xD;
      goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study involves a two group randomized trial where participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to the Fittle Senior System or to a paper-based psycho-educational control&#xD;
      condition following a baseline assessment. The duration of the intervention phase will&#xD;
      involve an active 12-week intervention phase followed by a 12-week maintenance phase. We will&#xD;
      recruit and randomize 180 community dwelling adults aged 65+ years, who live alone and are at&#xD;
      risk for social isolation. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3 months post active&#xD;
      intervention and 3 months post maintenance (6 months following active intervention) on&#xD;
      measures of health and health behaviors, and indices of social support.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The proposed study will evaluate a new tablet-based dynamic system: the Fittle Senior System&#xD;
      (FSS) that will provide: (1) personalized, goal-directed behavior-change programs for&#xD;
      improved diet and increased physical activity and (2) online social interaction and support&#xD;
      from small teams pursuing similar goals. The system builds on two technology-based systems&#xD;
      developed by the investigative team: (1) the computer-based PRISM system (Czaja et al.,&#xD;
      2015), designed for older populations to support social connectivity and well-being, and (2)&#xD;
      the Fittle mobile platform (PARC) designed to support positive health behavior change through&#xD;
      integrated online social support and personalized coaching based on artificial intelligence&#xD;
      (AI). The Fittle program is based on Self-efficacy and Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura,&#xD;
      1998, 2001), Goal Setting (Locke &amp; Latham, 2002) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen,&#xD;
      1991). Fittle provides support for individuals and teams to progress through lifestyle&#xD;
      challenges (e.g., poor eating habits, sedentary behavior), helping individuals master one&#xD;
      health improving habit after another in a way that builds on previous achievements.&#xD;
      Individuals choose from a variety of challenges to accomplish goals via an intelligent&#xD;
      coaching agent and personalized, engaging user experiences. The objective is to maintain and&#xD;
      reinforce perceived self-efficacy with daily goals that are perceived as being achievable,&#xD;
      and to improve motivation and ability with goals that are perceived as not too easy. The&#xD;
      program provides encouragement and social support through a team component. Thus, Fittle is&#xD;
      designed to reinforce and build self-efficacy and positive attitudes.&#xD;
