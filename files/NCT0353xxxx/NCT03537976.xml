  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using separate prospective cohorts of patients who have lip revision and lip repair surgery,&#xD;
      the objective of this clinical trial is to both qualitatively and quantitatively assess how&#xD;
      surgeons integrate the objective measures and visual aids of the Intervention with the&#xD;
      systematic subjective assessment in order to determine decisions surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard-of-care to evaluate patients for lip revision surgery relies on a subjective&#xD;
      assessment by the surgeon of the static face. The important role of function or movement&#xD;
      generally has been given far less consideration mainly because of the challenges faced by&#xD;
      surgeons (e.g., the amount/quality of the tissue available to alter movement). Presently,&#xD;
      even when surgeons do attempt to assess function, they do so in a subjective manner because&#xD;
      there are no quantitative/visual aids to incorporate functional assessment into their&#xD;
      treatment planning and decisions regarding lip surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Intervention approach proposed here has been refined sufficiently with surgeon feedback&#xD;
      to allow surgeons to broaden their &quot;vista&quot; of the patients' 'movement and form' problems.&#xD;
      Potentially, having identified a movement/form problem(s), surgeons could contemplate what&#xD;
      needs to be done to improve patient specific problem(s). Importantly, pilot studies&#xD;
      demonstrated that the Intervention had a definite impact on surgeons' decisions for lip&#xD;
      revision: Surgeons substantially, but variably, changed their problem list and treatment&#xD;
      planning goals. Thus, a goal of this study is to collect surgical outcome data which will be&#xD;
      used primarily to monitor adverse events but also will provide preliminary information on&#xD;
      improvement in patient outcomes (facial form and movement) when surgeons use the&#xD;
      Intervention. In addition, given that revision surgery is very common after the primary lip&#xD;
      repair, it is important to understand surgeons' decision-making with the use of the&#xD;
      Intervention, to determine surgeons' goals and expectations for primary lip repair surgery,&#xD;
      and to understand the surgical limitations that may lead to subsequent revision surgery.&#xD;

    <description>Outcomes are based on transcribing the In-Depth-Interviews (IDIs) that will be conducted with the surgeon-raters; coding the transcript with an a priori structure in mind (using the interview format as a starting point) but then using Grounded Theory to guide further coding in order to capitalize on themes that emerge that may not conform to the interview format. Themes will be developed (from the interview format and/or the emergent themes) that we will group by frequency as well as to their relevance to hypothesis generation as to how surgeon-raters might learn about and integrate patient data over time.</description>

    <description>Outcomes are based on transcribing the IDIs that will be conducted with the surgeon-raters; coding the transcript with an a priori structure in mind (using the interview format as a starting point) but then using Grounded Theory to guide further coding in order to capitalize on themes that emerge that may not conform to the structured interview format. Themes will be developed (from the interview format and/or the emergent themes) that we will group by frequency as well as to their relevance to hypothesis generation as to how surgeon-raters might learn about and integrate patient data over time.&#xD;
This thematic and frequency analysis will be conducted after the SAFS Intervention is conducted with the surgeons for those patients who are in need of lip revision surgery to address objective 1, as well as after the SAFS Intervention is conducted with the surgeons for those patients in need of primary lip repair surgery to address objective 2.</description>
