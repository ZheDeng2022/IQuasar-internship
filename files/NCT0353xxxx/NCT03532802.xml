      Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) patients often develop disabling symptoms of&#xD;
      heart failure. Current treatment strategies are predicated on the empirical use of&#xD;
      long-standing drugs, such as beta-adrenergics, although with little evidence supporting their&#xD;
      clinical beneﬁt in this disease. Metoprolol is currently the most widely used beta-blocker in&#xD;
      symptomatic HOCM patients, but a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, that looks at the&#xD;
      effect in HOCM patients has never been conducted. No studies of HOCM combine invasive&#xD;
      pressure measurement with exercise and echocardiography. All previous studies, both invasive&#xD;
      and echocardiographic, have been conducted during rest, and not during exercise. Symptoms of&#xD;
      HOCM patients are function-related, and exercise testing is essential to assess the condition&#xD;
      and the effect of drugs.&#xD;

      Background Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by an increase in&#xD;
      left-ventricular wall thickness, typically localized at the interventricular septum. The&#xD;
      hypertrophy can increase to an extend that causes a dynamic obstruction of the left&#xD;
      ventricular outflow tract (LVOTO); these patients have hypertrophic obstructive&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Due to the obstruction, patients develop high interventricular&#xD;
      pressure gradients, which may overtime become detrimental to the left ventricular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOCM patients often develop disabling symptoms of heart failure. Current treatment strategies&#xD;
      are predicated on the empirical use of long-standing drugs, such as beta-adrenergics,&#xD;
      although with little evidence supporting their clinical beneﬁt in this disease. Metoprolol is&#xD;
      currently the most widely used beta-blocker in symptomatic HOCM patients, but a randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial, that looks at the effect in HOCM patients has never been conducted.&#xD;
      No studies of HOCM combine invasive pressure measurement with exercise and echocardiography.&#xD;
      All previous studies, both invasive and echocardiographic, have been conducted during rest,&#xD;
      and not during exercise. Symptoms of HOCM patients are function-related, and exercise testing&#xD;
      is essential to assess the condition and the effect of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective The investigators wants to quantify the effects of metoprolol on myocardial&#xD;
      function and perfusion, hemodynamics and heart failure symptoms in patients with HOCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Metoprolol treatment reduces ∆ pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) (rest-exercise)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metoprolol treatment reduces PCWP at rest&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metoprolol treatment increases maximal oxygen consumption (VO2-max) .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metoprolol treatment reduces LVOT gradient during exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metoprolol treatment increases the coronary flow reserve&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metoprolol treatment decrease External Work&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metoprolol treatment reduces heart failure symptoms, estimated by the Kansas City&#xD;
           Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study, anticipated to examine 32&#xD;
      patients with HOCM both during treatment with metoprolol and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be examined in a set-up of simultaneous 1) right heart catheterization 2)&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise test and 3) transthoracic echocardiography. The set-up allows the&#xD;
      investigators to evaluate the hemodynamic values during rest and maximum exercise.&#xD;
