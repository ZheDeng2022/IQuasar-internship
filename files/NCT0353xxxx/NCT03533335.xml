      The primary objective of this 6 month study is to compare the effectiveness of oral health&#xD;
      promotion interventions on both clinical oral health, and oral opportunistic respiratory&#xD;
      pathogens in institutionalized elders. Secondary objectives are to investigate changes in&#xD;
      oral health-related quality of life, incidence of adverse side effects, pneumonia, as well as&#xD;
      subject acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elders residing in nursing homes in Hong Kong will be recruited into the clinical trial.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly allocated into one of the following groups: 0.2% chlorhexidine&#xD;
      spray, 0.1% pH-balanced chlorine dioxide spray, or sterile water spray (placebo control),&#xD;
      once daily. Dental plaque, gingival bleeding, oral opportunistic respiratory pathogens, oral&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), and pneumonia incidence will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, 3 months and 6 months. Subject acceptability of the interventions will be assessed&#xD;
      at the end of the clinical trial.&#xD;

      STUDY SITE AND PARTICIPANTS This study will be a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group&#xD;
      clinical trial of 6 months duration. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board&#xD;
      of the University of Hong Kong (IRB reference number: UW 12-509) (Appendix II). A clinical&#xD;
      trial certificate (No. 100269) was obtained from the Department of Health, Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria for recruiting patients in this randomized clinical trial (RCT) are:&#xD;
      (1) age 65 years and above; (2) not less than six natural teeth in the mouth; (3) not having&#xD;
      an indwelling naso-gastric feeding tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION Dental plaque will be the primary outcome variable in this study. A&#xD;
      previous study conducted amongst institutionalized elders in Hong Kong documented a mean PI&#xD;
      score of 2.0 (standard deviation [SD] =0.7) (Lo et al. 2005). Thus, based on 80% power and a&#xD;
      statistical significance level set at 0.05, 61 participants in each group are required in&#xD;
      order to detect a difference in PI scores of at least 0.4 between the three treatment groups.&#xD;
      In order to account for an anticipated 25% dropout rate, the proposed sample size is 76&#xD;
      patients per group (228 in total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT RECRUITMENT An invitation letter will be sent to residential care homes informing&#xD;
      that the dental hospital would like to provide oral health activities for elders at their&#xD;
      care homes. Written informed consent will be obtained from all subjects who opt to&#xD;
      participate before the commencement of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURE A one-hour oral health presentation covering oral health care and common oral&#xD;
      diseases, as well as oral hygiene demonstrations and practical exercises encompassing proper&#xD;
      techniques for assisting residents with toothbrushing, denture cleaning, and clearance of&#xD;
      remaining food debris in the oral cavity following meals, will be provided by a registered&#xD;
      dentist to the nursing home staff and residents. In addition, hand-over-hand demonstrations&#xD;
      on how to use the oral spray, and the specific areas of the oral cavity to be sprayed will be&#xD;
      performed on a tooth block model. Caregivers will apply a daily dose of 12 sprays (each&#xD;
      delivering a volume of 0.13ml) to the buccal and lingual gingival third of tooth surfaces in&#xD;
      each sextant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment will be conducted within one week after the presentation and&#xD;
      demonstration. Following baseline assessments, participants will be allocated randomly via&#xD;
      block randomization to receive either 0.2% chlorhexidine (Corsodyl) spray (Group 1), 0.1%&#xD;
      pH-balanced chlorine dioxide (CloSYS) spray (Group 2), or sterile water spray (placebo&#xD;
      control) (Group 3), once daily. The randomization sequence will be generated by the research&#xD;
      assistant. Chemotherapeutic agents will be assigned individually to participants, and&#xD;
      allocated in unmarked (labeled with subject's identity only) propellant-free atomizer bottles&#xD;
      by the research assistant. Both the principal examiner conducting the clinical assessments,&#xD;
      and the nursing home staff will be blinded to treatment group allocation. All participants&#xD;
      will receive a powered toothbrush and a standard sodium fluoride toothpaste. Sufficient&#xD;
      bottles of spray will be prepared for a 6-month volume of usage and sprays will be&#xD;
      administered (one hour following toothbrushing) by nursing home staff once daily. Scheduled&#xD;
      reports of patient compliance will be provided by nursing home staff to the investigator.&#xD;
      Nursing home staff compliance with the administration of oral sprays will be confirmed by the&#xD;
      completion of logbooks, and bi-weekly weighing of spray bottles by the research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BASELINE DATA COLLECTION Clinical oral health assessment Primary outcome measures (plaque&#xD;
      levels) will be assessed using the Silness and Löe Plaque Index (PI) (Silness and Löe 1964)&#xD;
      which has been validated and widely used in clinical trials assessing changes in oral hygiene&#xD;
      status. PI scores will be recorded on all permanent teeth and at six sites per tooth.&#xD;
      Gingival health was assessed by using the Gingival Bleeding Index (GBI) (Ainamo and Bay&#xD;
      1975).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the side effects of the chemotherapeutic agents (i.e. chlorhexidine and&#xD;
      chlorine dioxide), extrinsic tooth staining and supragingival calculus accumulation will be&#xD;
      assessed by using the Modified Lobene extrinsic tooth stain index (Macpherson et al. 2000)&#xD;
      and Volpe-Manhold calculus index (CI) (Volpe et al. 1965), respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological assessment Supragingival plaque will be collected with a sterile Gracey&#xD;
      curette from the six index teeth (upper right first molar, lower left first molar, upper left&#xD;
      first premolar, lower right first premolar, upper left incisor and lower right incisor)&#xD;
      (McInnes and Cutting 2010). Samples will be stored in 2 ml of sterile phosphate buffered&#xD;
      saline (PBS) and placed in an icebox, and subsequently transported back to the laboratory&#xD;
      within six hours for processing and identification of aerobic and facultatively anaerobic&#xD;
      Gram-negative bacilli (AGNB), Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus&#xD;
      influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral health-related quality of life assessment The Chinese version of the NHANES-OHIP will be&#xD;
      used to assess oral health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional disability assessment The Barthel Index (BI) is a valid and reliable measure of&#xD;
      disability, which scores patients in 10 activities of daily living (Mahoney and Barthel&#xD;
      1965). Scored items include mobility (stair climbing, transfer, ambulation), and self-care&#xD;
      (bowel and bladder care, toilet use, bathing, dressing, grooming, feeding). The BI scores&#xD;
      range from 0-100, with higher scores representing better physical function, and will be&#xD;
      assessed by a trained research assistant in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a simplified, practical and effective test in&#xD;
      evaluating psychiatric patients (Folstein et al. 1975). It includes 11 questions and&#xD;
      concentrates only on the cognitive aspect of mental disability, with scores ranging from&#xD;
      0-30. The results are interpreted as: 0-10=severe cognitive impairment; 10-20=moderate&#xD;
      cognitive impairment; 20-25=mild cognitive impairment; 25-30=no cognitive impairment. The&#xD;
      MMSE test will be conducted by a trained research assistant at each nursing home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hand function disability will be assessed using the Jebsen and Taylor Hand Function Test,&#xD;
      which assesses manual dexterity (Jebsen 1969). Seven items are designed for the patients to&#xD;
      perform, including 1) writing a short sentence; 2) simulated page turning; 3) picking up&#xD;
      small objects and placing into a container; 4) stacking checkers; 5) simulated eating; 6)&#xD;
      moving large empty cans; and 7) moving weighted large cans. The time of performance will be&#xD;
      recorded for both dominant and non-dominant hands. The Jebsen and Taylor Hand Function Test&#xD;
      will be performed by a trained research assistant at the nursing home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swallowing disability will be assessed using the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) (Crary&#xD;
      et al. 2005). FOIS assessments will be recorded by senior nursing home staff at each&#xD;
      institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Oral Food Debris Index (OFDI) (Migliario and Rimondini 2011) will also be scored and&#xD;
      documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP DATA COLLECTION At the 3-month review, clinical assessments and the NHANES-OHIP&#xD;
      questionnaire will be conducted, and microbiological samples collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 6-month review, subjects will be queried regarding their satisfaction with the oral&#xD;
      health promotion interventions provided, as well as the condition of their mouth. Responses&#xD;
      were coded as: 1=totally satisfied, 2=very satisfied, 3=reasonably satisfied, 4=not very&#xD;
      satisfied, 5=not at all satisfied. Clinical assessments, questionnaires (NHANES-OHIP) and&#xD;
      microbiological sampling will be repeated. Medical records will be audited to assess the&#xD;
      incidence of pneumonia during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS All the data collected from the three time points will be analyzed using&#xD;
      the statistics software package PASW 23.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline differences between groups in categorical demographic variables, oral mucosa status,&#xD;
      CPI, LOA and prosthetic status, as well as the pathogen prevalence will be compared using&#xD;
      Chi-square tests. As for continuous variables, one-way ANOVA for independents samples and&#xD;
      paired t tests for related samples will be undertaken if they follow normal distribution; if&#xD;
      they do not follow normal distribution, Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA for independent samples&#xD;
      and Wilcoxon Signed Rank test for related samples will be performed. Within-group comparisons&#xD;
      (baseline to 3-month) of oral mucosa status, CPI, LOA and prosthetic status, adverse effect,&#xD;
      and pathogen prevalence will be done via the McNemar test. Within-group comparisons (baseline&#xD;
      to 3-month) of median DMFT, calculus index, stain index and GBI, as well as viable counts&#xD;
      (cfu/ml) will be evaluated using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, while mean PI scores and&#xD;
      NHANES-OHIP scores will be made by Paired-Sample T test. Comparison of change scores in PI&#xD;
      between groups will be performed using One-Way ANOVA and Bonferroni pairwise comparisons.&#xD;
      Comparison of change scores in GBI, calculus index, stain index and viable counts (cfu/ml)&#xD;
      between groups will be determined by Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA, and the Mann-Whitney U&#xD;
      test for individual pairwise comparisons. Pathogen prevalence (persistence, acquisition,&#xD;
      transience, loss, and absence) between groups will be made using the chi-square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons of mean PI and NHANES-OHIP scores across baseline, 3-month, and 6-month&#xD;
      assessments will be completed by two-way ANOVA test, while pairwise comparisons will be made&#xD;
      via the Bonferroni test. Median GBI, calculus index, stain index and viable counts (cfu/ml)&#xD;
      at the three assessment points will be compared with the Friedman two-way ANOVA test, while&#xD;
      pairwise comparisons will be done with the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. Comparisons of pathogen&#xD;
      prevalence at the three assessment points will be accomplished via Cochran Q test, and&#xD;
      individual pairwise will be made with the McNemar test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Univariate analyses of potential independent factors associated with PI, GBI, NHANES-OHIP,&#xD;
      and viable counts of AGNB, S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis at&#xD;
      review assessments will be done with multiple linear regression analyses. Variables with&#xD;
      p&lt;0.05 will be entered into the multiple linear regression model (Forward Wald). Potential&#xD;
      independent factors associated with the prevalence of AGNB, S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, H.&#xD;
      influenzae and M. catarrhalis at review assessments will be subjected to multiple logistic&#xD;
      regression analyses.&#xD;
