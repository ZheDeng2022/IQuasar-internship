      1. A retrospective scoping cohort review of adult patients undergoing emergency&#xD;
           laparotomy/laparoscopy for acute gastrointestinal (GI) pathology who have had a CT scan&#xD;
           of the abdomen(+/- pelvis). CT measured sarcopenia would be compared with clinical&#xD;
           outcomes, 30-day and 1-year mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A prospective observational cohort study and bio-banking exercise of routinely collected&#xD;
           clinical data, in a cohort of patient undergoing emergency laparotomy/laparoscopy or&#xD;
           conservative treatment for an otherwise operable pathology. An interrogation of CT&#xD;
           measured sarcopenia and a validated clinical frailty score would be analysed against&#xD;
           clinical outcomes, 30-day and 1-year mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to research the association and predictive advantage of combining&#xD;
      subjectively measured frailty, objectively measured CT sarcopenia and other risk predicting&#xD;
      tools used in every day surgical practice and surgical outcomes (mortality and morbidity) in&#xD;
      a cohort of acute surgical patients undergoing surgery or conservative treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frailty has a significant impact on surgical outcomes. It is an independent risk factor for&#xD;
      adverse outcomes following surgery including complications, length of stay, inability to&#xD;
      return home and mortality. Frailty is a physiological decline across multiple body systems&#xD;
      accumulating in loss of reserves and increased vulnerability to stressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcopenia, loss of muscle mass or progressive reduction in muscle mass, is one of the&#xD;
      central physiological manifestations of frailty resulting in weight loss, weakness and&#xD;
      exhaustion. Frailty has both a strong correlation with age as well as significant overlap&#xD;
      with disability and co-morbidity. Further factors strongly influencing outcome, 30 day and&#xD;
      mortality have been described including polypharmacy, Charlson co-morbidity index, age, not&#xD;
      independently mobile, emergency admission and falls. It has been recognised that poor&#xD;
      outcomes are multimodal relating to the interplay of co-morbidities, physical functioning and&#xD;
      nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessing frailty can be completed using simple questionnaire tools, as well as more complex&#xD;
      assessment of co-morbidity, functional status, and disability. There is good evidence the&#xD;
      simple tools can be as accurate as formal geriatric assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As sarcopenia relates directly to many manifestations of frailty it can be used as a&#xD;
      surrogate marker. One of the favoured ways for diagnosing sarcopenia is using CT morphometric&#xD;
      biological markers. This uses an axial image at the level of the 3rd lumbar vertebra (L3) to&#xD;
      assess the total or cross-sectional volume of the psoas muscle, giving rise to indices&#xD;
      measuring muscle mass, visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major abdominal emergency surgery is a high-risk procedure with ongoing audit and outcome&#xD;
      monitoring. Currently data collection for UK National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) is in&#xD;
      its fourth year with annual reports into the management and outcomes of emergency&#xD;
      laparotomies. Observation and audit of these outcomes remain central to improving service and&#xD;
      healthcare both regionally and nationally. Furthermore, this group of patients is not well&#xD;
      represented in research and is one of the most understudied surgical cohorts that exist. This&#xD;
      is especially the case for patients presenting with an acute surgical diagnosis and are&#xD;
      deemed unable to withstand the stress of surgery, and hence pursue a conservative or&#xD;
      radiological treatment option. With our ageing, co-morbid population this is becoming&#xD;
      increasing common. The diagnosis of frailty and sarcopenia are a significant measurable and&#xD;
      modifiable risk factor that impacts on perioperative surgical care, healthcare provider and&#xD;
      patient decision-making and most importantly long and short term outcomes. This urgently&#xD;
      requires further audit and study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work package one (WP1): Retrospective scoping cohort study in acute general surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient identification The number of patients recruited from each participating hospital will&#xD;
      be proportionate to the total number of cases, in accordance with relative annual case&#xD;
      volumes (as reported by NELA - in the case of less than 100% case capture, the theoretical&#xD;
      100% case number will be used). This will provide a representative sample of the recruiting&#xD;
      region's population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most recent laparotomy cases with 1-year follow-up mortality data available will be&#xD;
      included at the time of study activation. Data collection over a predicted six week period&#xD;
      will be undertaken or until the sample size is reached. Retrospective collection of routinely&#xD;
      recorded clinical data will be performed (See appendix data collection tool). This includes,&#xD;
      but is not restricted to [a] routine clinical variables: patient characteristics,&#xD;
      demographic, pathological and physiological variables will be captured in line with NELA&#xD;
      data, alongside confounding factors associated with frailty and sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol for measuring muscle radiation attenuation Inclusion: Retrievable CT abdomen/pelvis&#xD;
      on an electronic NHS PACS system. CT can be non-contrast or with contrast, supine or prone&#xD;
      but must be of sufficient quality for the sarcopenia CT analyses software to handle&#xD;
      (Slico-maticâ„¢, TomoVision, Magog, Canada ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion: CT-scans with large radiation artefacts or with missing parts of muscle tissue on&#xD;
      the ventral, dorsal, or both lateral edges of the scan preventing sarcopenia assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting inclusion criteria will have their CT extracted and reviewed by a trained&#xD;
      independent party. This may through an allocated representative at the base hospital or the&#xD;
      CT can be extracted and sent in a fully anonymised format to the central unit for sarcopenia&#xD;
      assessment. CT scans obtained via a PACS system can up transferred through secure&#xD;
      inter-hospital PACS transfer. Those with non-compatible systems can either be uploaded via CD&#xD;
      or analysed at the data collection site. The outcome of the assessment for sarcopenia will&#xD;
      define whether a patient is considered to have sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can be identified primarily from the NELA database with confirmation of GI&#xD;
      pathology on the radiological report. This can be cross reference against admission logs,&#xD;
      acute surgery admission databases, theatre logs for emergency surgery and NELA databases to&#xD;
      maximise case capture. Once patients are confirmed to meet the inclusion criteria their data&#xD;
      can be gathered into a data collection tool. The CT scan will be extracted and sent for&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients meeting inclusion criteria will be identified by the lead researcher in each&#xD;
      centre. Frailty scores are already part of standard acute admission clerking proformas in&#xD;
      many of the hospitals across the region; as such the researcher's role will be ensure&#xD;
      appropriate and complete data capture from existing clinical information sources, but no&#xD;
      additional intervention or questioning of patients beyond current standard of care will be&#xD;
      required. Patients will be collected across a set time scale as listed above. Baseline&#xD;
      demographics and disease factors will be collected as per collection proforma attached as&#xD;
      supplementary material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Reported Edmonton Frail Scale (REFS) is collected at time of admission as part of routine&#xD;
      clinical assessment for surgical admissions. This is a validated, self-reported patient&#xD;
      questionnaire that can categorise the degree of frailty. This information is routinely&#xD;
      collected in many acute unit or care of the elderly departments. The REFS will enable a&#xD;
      consistent method of collecting this data utilising a rapid and well validated tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients presenting in extremis or unable to complete the score due to an acute state or&#xD;
      requirement for prompt treatment, this will be gathered at the next appropriate pre-operative&#xD;
      opportunity. Patients unable to complete a REFS given the best opportunity will be excluded,&#xD;
      however reasons for exclusion will be recorded.&#xD;
