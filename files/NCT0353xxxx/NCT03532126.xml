  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation aims to confirm the safety and effectiveness of Princess VOLUME PLUS&#xD;
      Lidocaine in midface volume deficit augmentation and includes a long term safety followup.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This non-interventional study will evaluate subjects treated with Princess VOLUME PLUS&#xD;
      Lidocaine for midface volume deficit augmentation. A touch-up treatment will be allowed, on&#xD;
      discretion of the treating investigator, if the initial treatment didn't provide optimal&#xD;
      correction. The effectiveness parameters will be evaluated based on a validated scale for&#xD;
      midface volume deficit scale and confirmed by use of patient reported outcome questionnaires&#xD;
      as well as based on photographs to be evaluated by an independent evaluator.&#xD;
