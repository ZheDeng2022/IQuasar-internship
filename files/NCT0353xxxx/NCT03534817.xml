    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an outpatient chronic disease management program&#xD;
      delivering secondary prevention, which is proven to reduce morbidity and mortality. The&#xD;
      Canadian Cardiovascular Society Access to Care working group recommends patients access CR&#xD;
      &quot;preferably&quot; within 2-7 days following percutaneous intervention for myocardial infarction&#xD;
      (MI), but that 30-60 days is &quot;acceptable&quot;. Despite these benchmarks, in practice patients&#xD;
      access CR up to 90 days post-treatment in Canada. This is disconcerting given the detrimental&#xD;
      impacts of delayed access to CR. These include ventricular remodeling (i.e., ventricular&#xD;
      enlargement and reduced pump function), lower CR use, less post-CR exercise, among others.&#xD;
      Accordingly, EVADE will be the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the effects of&#xD;
      early access CR (1-week post-discharge to first CR visit) compared to standard access CR&#xD;
      (7-weeks post-discharge to first CR visit) in ameliorating these concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS &amp; HYPOTHESIS: The primary aim is to compare ventricular remodeling as defined by the&#xD;
      change in end-systolic volume at 1-year in participants randomized to early versus standard&#xD;
      access CR. The secondary aims are: (1) to compare post-CR exercise adherence by&#xD;
      accelerometry, exercise capacity by 6-minute walk test distance, and health-related quality&#xD;
      of life (HRQL) at 1-year in participants randomized to early versus standard access CR; (2)&#xD;
      to compare CR program session attendance in participants randomized to early versus standard&#xD;
      access CR; and (3) to assess biomarkers of ventricular remodeling in participants randomized&#xD;
      to early versus standard access CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final aims are to explore more immediate health benefits associated with early versus&#xD;
      standard access CR. Accordingly, at 6 months following hospital discharge the investigators&#xD;
      will measure end-systolic volume, exercise adherence, exercise capacity, biomarkers of&#xD;
      ventricular remodeling, and HRQL. The investigators will also explore hospitalization for any&#xD;
      cause of death at 1 year in order to inform future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall hypothesis is that early access CR will be associated with less ventricular&#xD;
      remodeling, increased CR attendance and post-CR exercise adherence, increased exercise&#xD;
      capacity, and greater HRQL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: EVADE will be a two-centre, 2 parallel-arm, single-blinded RCT. Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited through coronary care units following treatment for MI from the Royal University&#xD;
      Hospital in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and the University of Alberta Hospital in Edmonton. The&#xD;
      University of Alberta Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) online database will&#xD;
      randomize (1:1) participants (allocation concealed). A total of 60 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled: 30 participants will each be allocated to early access and standard access CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPACT: In the first prospective multicentre trial of its kind, EVADE will test an innovative&#xD;
      post-MI rehabilitation strategy that has the potential to demonstrate the superior benefits&#xD;
      of early access CR for attenuating ventricular remodeling, and increasing CR attendance,&#xD;
      post-CR exercise adherence, exercise capacity, and HRQL. The results from EVADE would&#xD;
      encourage the Canadian CR community to consider early access CR to further enhance readily&#xD;
      available and existing CR programs. The knowledge gained from EVADE will inform clinical&#xD;
      decision-making practices, influence future CR guidelines and policy, and will contribute to&#xD;
      the ongoing goal of improving efficiency and effectiveness of the Canadian health care&#xD;
      system.&#xD;

    <measure>Exercise history</measure>
    <time_frame>On the first visit to CR.</time_frame>
    <description>The Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (modified) scores a participant's recreational physical activity levels outside of employment within the past 4 weeks. This questionnaire will capture and account for physical activity performed prior to commencing CR. This questionnaire is not a scale as it does not have a maximum value, thus the range is not provided. It provides a score based by summing the number of bouts of light, moderate, and heavy physical activity, increasing the relative contribution of exercise intensity by adding a multiplier to the number of exercise bouts depending upon the intensity (i.e., multiply by 9 for heavy, by 5 for moderate, and by 3 for light activity). E.g., With 3 heavy exercise sessions, 6 moderate sessions, and 14 light sessions, the total leisure activity score = (9 × 3) + (5 × 6) + (3 × 14) = 27 + 30 + 42 = 99. A higher score represents a greater physical activity volume and a better outcome.</description>
