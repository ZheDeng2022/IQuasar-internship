    <textblock>
      To characterize and estimate the incidence rate of new-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) in&#xD;
      patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI). To explore the prognostic influences of NOAF&#xD;
      on MI patients' clinical outcomes. To further investigate the impact of NOAF associated&#xD;
      characteristics on patients' clinical outcomes eithier during hospitalization or follow-up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, investigators retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all acute&#xD;
      MI patients who were admitted to the coronary artery unit (CCU) of Shanghai Tenth People's&#xD;
      Hospital between February 2014 and March 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients' demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, laboratory&#xD;
      tests, echocardiography data, angiography data, acute and dischage medications, and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes will be collected. All patients admitt to our CCU department will receive CEM&#xD;
      immediately after admission and continue until discharge. Heart thythm status and those&#xD;
      characteristics assoicated with NOAF will be reviewed by several independent physicians and&#xD;
      recorded in a centralized electronic database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several post-MI NOAF assoicated characteristics and definitions are displayed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Total CEM duration is defined as the period during which the monitor was started after&#xD;
           admission and turned off before discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. AF maintained duration is defined as the period during which an AF episode presented and&#xD;
           terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Total AF duration is calculated by summing all AF episodes' maintained durations&#xD;
           descripted above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. AF burden was calculated by dividing the total AF duration by the total CEM duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. NOAF pattern included paroxysmal NOAF, persistent NOAF, transient NOAF, and persisting&#xD;
           NOAF, definitions are demonstrated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Paroxysmal NOAF is defined as more than 1 episodes of AF occur during hospitalization&#xD;
      irrespective of the discharge rhythm status or only 1 episode of AF is observed during&#xD;
      hospitalization and maintain sinus rhythm at discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Persistent NOAF is defined as only 1 episode of AF is observed during hospitalization and&#xD;
      maintain AF at discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) Transient NOAF is recorded if AF episodes only occur during hospitalization with emergency&#xD;
      department ECG, on-admission ECG and discharge ECG maintaining sinus rhythm, irrespective of&#xD;
      the frequencies of AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) Persisting NOAF is recorded if AF episodes occur during hospitalization with a discharge&#xD;
      ECG still maintaining AF rhythm, irrespective of the frequencies of AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Frequencies of NOAF&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Symptomatic and silent NOAF&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Symptomatic AF is defined as AFresulting in clinical symptoms or the need for urgent&#xD;
           cardioversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Silent AF is defined as any asymptomatic episodes of AF lasting for over 30 seconds at&#xD;
           CEM.&#xD;
