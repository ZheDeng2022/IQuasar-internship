  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal disease is an immune-inflammatory disease which consists of connective tissue&#xD;
      breakdown, loss of attachment, and alveolar bone loss.In normal physiology, there is an&#xD;
      equilibrium maintained between reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity and antioxidant defence&#xD;
      capacity. when this equilibrium changes and shifts in favour of ROS, it will result in&#xD;
      oxidative stress (OS). Increased levels of acute phase proteins have been associated with&#xD;
      gingival inflammation and periodontitis, which reflected the locally stressed environment. it&#xD;
      has been well established that in chronic inflammation sites there is over-production of ROS.&#xD;
      The human body consists of an array of antioxidant defense mechanisms (non-enzymatic and&#xD;
      enzymatic antioxidants) which removes harmful ROS as soon as they are formed and prevent&#xD;
      their deleterious effects. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione&#xD;
      peroxidase are the enzymatic antioxidants, while the nonenzymatic antioxidants include&#xD;
      vitamins E and C, and reduced glutathione. C - reactive protein (CRP) is a plasma protein&#xD;
      that reflects a measure of the acute phase response to inflammation and is one of the markers&#xD;
      of choice in monitoring this response. Changes in peripheral blood cellular and molecular&#xD;
      components can be seen in patients with periodontitis, as periodontitis includes inflammatory&#xD;
      changes of the periodontal tissues. Ashwagandha is also known as Indian ginseng and winter&#xD;
      cherry. It consists of dried roots of Withania Somnifera (Family: Solanaceae).6 The Sanskrit&#xD;
      words ashva meaning horse, and gandha meaning smell together form the name Ashwagandha.&#xD;
      Ashwagandha possessed marked anti-inflammatory effect against denaturation of protein in&#xD;
      vitro. the effect was plausibly due to the alkaloid and withanolide contents of ashwagandha.&#xD;
      It is a multipurpose herb, which acts as adaptogenic, antioxidant, anticancer, anxiolytic,&#xD;
      antidepressant, cardio protective, thyroid modulating, immunomodulating, antibacterial,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, cognitive enhancing and hematopoietic agent.So, this&#xD;
      study is carried out to assess SOD &amp; CRP levels with or without Ashwagandha supplementation&#xD;
      as an adjunct to scaling and root planing(SRP) in chronic periodontitis(CP) patients.&#xD;

      Periodontal disease is an immune-inflammatory disease which consists of connective tissue&#xD;
      breakdown, loss of attachment, and alveolar bone loss.1 In normal physiology, there is an&#xD;
      equilibrium maintained between reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity and antioxidant defence&#xD;
      capacity. Thus when this equilibrium changes and shifts in favour of ROS, it will result in&#xD;
      oxidative stress (OS). OS plays a causative role in pathogenesis of periodontal disease.2&#xD;
      Increased levels of acute phase proteins have been associated with gingival inflammation and&#xD;
      periodontitis, which reflected the locally stressed environment.3 The human body consists of&#xD;
      an array of antioxidant defense mechanisms (non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidants) which&#xD;
      removes harmful ROS as soon as they are formed and prevent their deleterious effects.&#xD;
      Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase are the enzymatic&#xD;
      antioxidants, while the nonenzymatic antioxidants include vitamins E and C, and reduced&#xD;
      glutathione.2 C - reactive protein (CRP) is a plasma protein that reflects a measure of the&#xD;
      acute phase response to inflammation and is one of the markers of choice in monitoring this&#xD;
      response. CRP can be used for the prediction and early detection of periodontal disease as it&#xD;
      is a sensitive marker to evaluate the inflammatory status.4 Ayurveda is the traditional&#xD;
      system of medicine practiced in India that can be traced back to 6000 BC .It is a basic&#xD;
      foundation of ancient medical science in India. Ashwagandha is also known as Indian ginseng&#xD;
      and winter cherry. It consists of dried roots of Withania Somnifera (Family: Solanaceae).6&#xD;
      The Sanskrit words ashva meaning horse, and gandha meaning smell together form the name&#xD;
      Ashwagandha. The root has been described as having a strong &quot;horse like&quot; aroma, although some&#xD;
      experts note that the origin of the name suggests that one who ingests it can attain the&#xD;
      strength and vitality of a horse.7 Ashwagandha possessed marked anti-inflammatory effect&#xD;
      against denaturation of protein in vitro. the effect was plausibly due to the alkaloid and&#xD;
      withanolide contents of ashwagandha.6 Ashwagandha root has major bioactive constituents which&#xD;
      are steroidal alkaloids and lactones known as withanolides which have immunomodulatory&#xD;
      effect.8 It is a multipurpose herb, which acts as adaptogenic, antioxidant, anticancer,&#xD;
      anxiolytic, antidepressant, cardio protective, thyroid modulating, immunomodulating,&#xD;
      antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, cognitive enhancing and&#xD;
      hematopoietic agent.7 Also, by taking Ashwagandha regularly one can enhance his memory and&#xD;
      learning skills dramatically.9So, this study is carried out to assess SOD &amp; CRP levels with&#xD;
      or without Ashwagandha supplementation as an adjunct to scaling and root planing(SRP) in&#xD;
      chronic periodontitis(CP) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a randomized double-blind clinical and biochemical trial in which 50&#xD;
      subjects with CP in the age group of 30-55 years, reporting to Department of Periodontology,&#xD;
      TKDC and RC, New Pargaon will be equally and randomly divided into Test Group (TG) and&#xD;
      Control Group (CG). The randomization will be done based on consort guidelines 2010 14&#xD;
&#xD;
      TG will be provided with Ashwagandha capsules 500 mg twice daily, after meals with plain&#xD;
      water for 1 month and CG will be provided with placebo. SRP will be done at baseline in TG&#xD;
      and CG. Clinical and biochemical parameters will be recorded at baseline, 1st month (4 weeks)&#xD;
      and 2nd month (8 weeks). Whole saliva sample (unstimulated) will be collected. Recall visits&#xD;
      will be carried out on 4th week and 8th week. Oral hygiene instructions and reinforcement&#xD;
      will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire will be provided to both the groups for evaluation. All participants will be&#xD;
      explained the need and design of the study and written consent will be obtained from each&#xD;
      individual prior to the commencement of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Special Instructions Given Regarding with Diet to the Patients during Ashwagandha&#xD;
      supplementation period:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No Deep Fry Food should be eaten.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. No Sour substances.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. No Pastry Flour (Maida) made foodstuffs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE COLLECTION METHOD-&#xD;
&#xD;
      A ] SALIVA- 2 ml of unstimulated saliva will be collected in a sterile container.&#xD;
      Centrifugation will be done for 10 minutes at 4000 rpm.16 Then the supernatant will be&#xD;
      removed and stored at 2oC till the assay procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of Saliva Sample: Mahvash Navazesh 200817 Unstimulated whole saliva will be&#xD;
      collected for the estimation of SOD.2ml will be collected from each subject between&#xD;
      9.00-10.00a.m.The participants will be requested not to eat or drink anything except water in&#xD;
      the morning before sampling. This will ensure that the variability in salivary flow and&#xD;
      composition be minimum due to diurnal variation. The subject will be asked to rinse the mouth&#xD;
      with distilled water thoroughly to remove any food debris.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Serum CRP detection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three ml of venous blood were taken from all patients at baseline, after 4 weeks and 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS OF BIOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS- SOD- Kajridas method C Reactive Protein- hs CRP-&#xD;
      Nephelometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WILL BE DONE BY USING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With 95% confidence and 80% power minimum 46 patients from either groups, test as well as&#xD;
      control group, is required to be included in the study. To compensate for potential dropouts,&#xD;
      50 patients will be considered, 25 patients constituting in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests will be done are:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ANOVA repeated measures post hoc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Independent T test.&#xD;
