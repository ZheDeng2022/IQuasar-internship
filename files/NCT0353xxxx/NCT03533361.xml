  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an Expanded Access Program to make lenvatinib available to participants with&#xD;
      radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer in Brazil. Participants who have no&#xD;
      other treatment options available, and who, in the opinion and clinical judgment of the&#xD;
      treating physician, would benefit from treatment with lenvatinib will be enrolled. This is a&#xD;
      multicenter, open-label program consisting of 2 phases: a 28-day pretreatment phase&#xD;
      (including screening) and a treatment phase. Treatment will be provided as long as there is a&#xD;
      clinical benefit based on tumor assessments performed according to the center's standard of&#xD;
      care and the judgment of the participant's treating physician.&#xD;
