      The investigators attend to conduct a prospective randomized study to assess safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of trigonal-involved vs. trigonal-sparing botox injection technique, quality of life&#xD;
      measurement and post-injection anticholinergics use efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessing safety by identification of side effects like constipation, urine retention....etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      efficacy is measured using Over Active Bladder Symptoms Score(OABSS) and urodynamics measures&#xD;

      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a condition characterized by the presence of urinary urgency,&#xD;
      typically joined by frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency urinary incontinence&#xD;
      [UUI], in the absence of urinary tract infection (UTI) or other clear pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequency is the most commonly reported symptom coming to 85% while 54% complained of urgency&#xD;
      and 36% urgency incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OAB has usually resulted from detrusor over activities. The basic cause could be a&#xD;
      neurological disorder (neurogenic type) such as spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis. In&#xD;
      some cases, no obvious cause could be identified (idiopathic type).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OAB is a prevalent, chronic symptom complex that can impair quality of life (QOL). The&#xD;
      prevalence of OAB in the general population was evaluated at 11.8% in a population-based&#xD;
      survey conducted across five European countries. Epidemiological studies from North America&#xD;
      have reported prevalence of OAB in women of 16.9% and the prevalence increases with age&#xD;
      rising to 30.9% in those beyond 65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment objectives are to reduce the occurrence of bothersome symptoms. Several treatment&#xD;
      choices are available for OAB including bladder and behavioral training, pharmacologic&#xD;
      treatment, and surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antimuscarinics are well established as pharmacotherapy for reducing OAB symptoms and&#xD;
      enhancing QOL.Although, their use is limited in some patients by insufficient response to&#xD;
      treatment &quot;refractory OAB&quot;, or intolerable side effects , for example , dry mouth , blurred&#xD;
      vision , constipation and cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, a European and Australian trial including about 2000 patients assessed&#xD;
      mirabegron (β-3 agonist) (50 mg and 100 mg) in comparison to tolterodine (4 mg ER&#xD;
      preparation) and placebo. There was a significant reduction in the number of voids over a&#xD;
      24-hours period, and incontinence episodes, vs. placebo at 12 weeks, at 1.93 vs. 1.34 (P &lt;&#xD;
      0.05) and 1.57 vs. 1.17 (P &lt; 0.05), respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a trial of pharmacotherapy, if the patient has not had satisfactory improvement in&#xD;
      symptoms, intra-vesicle injection of Botox (BTX) can be offered as the following step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Botulinum toxin (BTX) is a neurotoxin, it contains a heavy chain that binds to the&#xD;
      presynaptic terminal of the neuromuscular junction , and this then acts by inhibiting the&#xD;
      release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic vesicles at the axon terminal of the motor end&#xD;
      plate , that then results in the muscle that is innervated becoming ﬂaccidly paralyzed. BTX&#xD;
      is available in different preparations. The current commercially utilized type is BTX type A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Now, there is cumulative data supporting use of BTX in cases of refractory Detrusor&#xD;
      overactivity (DO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intradetrusal injection of BTX is followed by a significant improvements in the number of&#xD;
      voiding episodes over 24 hours, incontinence episodes, urodynamic variables and quality of&#xD;
      life scores. There is a decrease in episodes of urgency and incontinence by 80% and 60%,&#xD;
      respectively. The efficacy peaks at 4 weeks, with the effect lasting typically up to 9&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some essential issues for further investigations are the injection site, volume and number of&#xD;
      injections. In terms of dosage, there are no firm recommendations, but in practice the advice&#xD;
      was for a lower starting dose of 100 units of BTX-A, based on the currently available&#xD;
      research. The disadvantage with higher dosing is the reduction in detrusor voiding pressures&#xD;
      and an increased risk of voiding problems, while at the same time there is no increased&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current AUA and EUA guidelines recommend trigonal sparing technique. During the injection&#xD;
      process the trigone is typically spared because of the theoretical risk of de novo VUR from&#xD;
      inhibition of the peritrigonal anti-reflux mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, trigonal area is rich in sensory fibers, therefore trigonal injection may enhance&#xD;
      sensory component of urgency.&#xD;
