  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a pressing national need to provide higher-quality, more effectively accessible&#xD;
      language interpretation services to improve the health outcomes of Americans who have limited&#xD;
      English proficiency (LEP). This project addresses a critical component of this problem: The&#xD;
      need to improve access to high quality, mental health services for diverse populations by&#xD;
      improving the flow of clinical work across care settings (primary care and specialty care)&#xD;
      through the use of innovative online asynchronous methods of language interpretation and&#xD;
      clinical communication. The investigators are conducting a two phase study. The first phase&#xD;
      is completed and involved developing and testing the interpreting tool. The second phase of&#xD;
      the research is a clinical trial to compare two methods of cross-language psychiatric&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to develop and test a novel automated asynchronous interpretation&#xD;
      tool. The proposed project builds on previous research, piloting the automated asynchronous&#xD;
      interpretation tool. This 5-year project will be conducted in two phases. In Phase 1 the&#xD;
      investigators iteratively evaluate and refine the automated asynchronous interpretation tool&#xD;
      already developed in prior studies. In Phase 2, the investigators evaluate this tool using a&#xD;
      two-group randomized cross-over trial. Investigators compare:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Method A (current gold standard of in-person real-time interpreting practice). A&#xD;
           Spanish-speaking patient is diagnostically assessed in-person by an English-speaking&#xD;
           psychiatrist through a Spanish-speaking interpreter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Method B (comparative practice - ATP). A Spanish-speaking patient is interviewed in&#xD;
           Spanish by a trained mental health interviewer. The interview is recorded in real time,&#xD;
           translated into English using the automatic interpretation tool and adding sub-titles to&#xD;
           the video file, and sent to an English-speaking psychiatrist to asynchronously - that&#xD;
           is, at a later time - review the video and make a diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo evaluation by both methods. Half of the patients will be randomized&#xD;
      to be assessed by Method A first, followed by Method B and half to be assessed by Method B&#xD;
      first, followed by Method A. The specific aims of the study are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1: To iteratively evaluate and refine the automated asynchronous interpretation tool&#xD;
           already developed in prior studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2: To compare patient satisfaction of Method A vs. Method B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 3: To compare the diagnostic accuracy and psychiatrist inter-rater reliability of&#xD;
           Method A vs. Method B and demonstrate psychiatrist inter-rater reliability for Method B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 4: To compare the interview and language interpretation quality and accuracy of&#xD;
           Method A vs. Method B.&#xD;
