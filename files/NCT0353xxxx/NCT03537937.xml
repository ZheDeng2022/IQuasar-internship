  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation of ICU patients universally involves titration of the fraction of&#xD;
      inspired oxygen (FiO2) to maintain arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2). Despite decades of ICU&#xD;
      practice, however, the optimal SpO2 target remains unknown. Current guidelines offer&#xD;
      divergent recommendations as to the optimal SpO2 target. Therefore, we propose a&#xD;
      2,250-patient cluster-randomized cluster-crossover trial comparing a lower SpO2 target (90%;&#xD;
      range 88-92%), an intermediate SpO2 target (94%; range 92-96%), and a higher SpO2 target&#xD;
      (98%; range 96-100%) with regard to the outcome of days alive and free of invasive mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation.&#xD;

    <description>The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (Vincent et al Critical Care Medicine 1998) is composed of scores from six organ systems, graded from 0 to 4 according to the degree of dysfunction or failure. Scores range from 0 (no evidence of organ dysfunction or failure) to 24 (evidence of severe dysfunction failure in each of the six organ systems). The modified non-respiratory SOFA score is composed of scores from five of the six organ systems included in the complete SOFA score (excluding the respiratory system), graded on the same scale as the complete SOFA score. Scores range from 0 (no evidence of organ dysfunction or failure) to 20 (evidence of severe organ dysfunction or failure in each of the five organ systems assessed).</description>

    <ipd_description>The NIH's guidelines for data sharing will serve as the model for the approach we will follow for the proposed investigation;&#xD;
http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/data_sharing_guidance.htm&#xD;
Even though the final dataset will be stripped of identifiers prior to release for sharing, the inherent link between the period in which the patient was admitted to the study ICU and group assignment in a cluster-crossover trial introduces a significant risk for deductive disclosure of subjects. Thus, we will make the data and associated documentation available to users only under a data sharing agreement that provides for: (1) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; (2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; and (3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed.</ipd_description>
