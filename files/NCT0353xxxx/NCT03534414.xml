    <textblock>
      The European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) guidelines have not made any&#xD;
      specific recommendations regarding the Portfolio diet, a dietary pattern that includes nuts,&#xD;
      viscous fibre, plant protein, and plant sterols. To update the recommendations, the Diabetes&#xD;
      and Nutrition Study Group (DNSG) of the EASD commissioned a systematic review and&#xD;
      meta-analysis using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation&#xD;
      (GRADE) approach to summarize the available evidence from controlled trials of the effect of&#xD;
      the Portfolio dietary pattern on LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and other established&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk factors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: The Portfolio Dietary Pattern, which includes nuts, viscous fiber, plant protein,&#xD;
      and plant sterols, has been shown to have a cholesterol-lowering effect similar to that of&#xD;
      early statin medications. Despite the endorsement of the Portfolio Dietary Pattern by major&#xD;
      international diabetes and cardiovascular guidelines, the European Association for the Study&#xD;
      of Diabetes (EASD) guidelines for nutrition therapy have not made any specific&#xD;
      recommendations for the Portfolio Dietary Pattern. The present systematic review and&#xD;
      meta-analysis using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation&#xD;
      (GRADE) approach was thus commissioned by the Diabetes and Nutrition Study Group (DNSG) of&#xD;
      the EASD to summarize the available evidence from controlled trials of the effect of the&#xD;
      Portfolio dietary pattern on LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and other established cardiometabolic&#xD;
      risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for proposed research: High quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses of controlled&#xD;
      trials represent the highest level of evidence to support dietary guidelines and public&#xD;
      health policy development. As dietary guidelines and public health policy have shifted toward&#xD;
      food and dietary-pattern based recommendations, there is a need for a systematic review and&#xD;
      meta-analysis assessing the pooled effect of the Portfolio Dietary Pattern trials on&#xD;
      cholesterol and cardiometabolic risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The investigators will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize&#xD;
      the effect of a Portfolio Dietary Pattern compared to control on lipids and other&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk factors in controlled clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted according to the Cochrane&#xD;
      Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and reported according to the Preferred&#xD;
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be&#xD;
      searched using appropriate search terms supplemented by hand searches of references of&#xD;
      included studies. Authors will be contacted for applicable missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study selection: The investigators will include controlled dietary trials. Randomized and&#xD;
      non-randomized controlled trials will be included if they are &gt;= 4 weeks duration and assess&#xD;
      the effect of the Portfolio Dietary Pattern on cholesterol and cardiometabolic risk factors&#xD;
      compared to a control diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction: Two or more investigators will independently extract relevant data and&#xD;
      assess risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. All disagreements will be resolved&#xD;
      by consensus. Standard computations and imputations will be used to derive missing variance&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The primary outcome of the systematic review and meta-analysis will be the&#xD;
      established lipid target for cardiovascular risk reduction, LDL-C. Secondary outcomes will&#xD;
      include other blood lipids (total-C, triglycerides, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, apolipoprotein B (apo&#xD;
      B)), adiposity (body weight), inflammation (C-reactive protein), blood pressure (systolic and&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure (BP)), glycemic control (HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, fasting&#xD;
      blood insulin), and the Framingham risk score for the estimation of 10 year coronary heart&#xD;
      disease (CHD) risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data synthesis: Mean differences and standardized mean differences will be pooled for the&#xD;
      outcomes noted using the generic inverse variance method. Random-effects models will be used&#xD;
      even in the absence of statistically significant between-study heterogeneity, as they yield&#xD;
      more conservative summary effect estimates in the presence of residual heterogeneity.&#xD;
      Fixed-effects models will be considered where there are &lt;5 included studies and large precise&#xD;
      trials are being combined with smaller imprecise trials. Paired analyses will be applied for&#xD;
      crossover trials. Heterogeneity will be assessed by the Cochran Q statistic and quantified by&#xD;
      the I2 statistic. To explore sources of heterogeneity, the investigators will conduct&#xD;
      sensitivity analyses, in which each study is systematically removed. A sensitivity analysis&#xD;
      will also be conducted comparing trials where food was provided with trials where&#xD;
      participants received dietary advice, but not provided food. If there are &gt;=10 studies, then&#xD;
      the investigators will also explore sources of heterogeneity by a priori subgroup analyses by&#xD;
      age (children [=&lt;18 years of age], adults), health status (metabolic syndrome/diabetes,&#xD;
      overweight, normal weight), comparator, baseline measurements, randomization, study design&#xD;
      (parallel, crossover), follow-up (=&lt;8-weeks, &gt;8-weeks), and risk of bias. Meta-regression&#xD;
      analyses will assess the significance of categorical and continuous subgroups analyses. When&#xD;
      &gt;=10 studies are available, publication bias will be investigated by inspection of funnel&#xD;
      plots and formal testing using the Egger and Begg tests. If publication bias is suspected,&#xD;
      then the investigators will attempt to adjust for funnel plot asymmetry by imputing the&#xD;
      missing study data using the Duval and Tweedie trim and fill method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence Assessment: The strength of the evidence for each outcome will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation plan: The results will be disseminated through interactive&#xD;
      presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and publication in&#xD;
      high impact factor journals. Target audiences will include the public health and scientific&#xD;
      communities with interest in nutrition, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Feedback will be incorporated and used to improve the public health message and key areas for&#xD;
      future research will be defined. Applicant/Co-applicant Decision Makers will network among&#xD;
      opinion leaders to increase awareness and participate directly as committee members in the&#xD;
      development of future guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The proposed project will aid in knowledge translation related to the role of&#xD;
      the Portfolio Dietary Pattern in cholesterol-lowering and cardiometabolic risk, strengthening&#xD;
      the evidence-base for guidelines and improving health outcomes by educating healthcare&#xD;
      providers and patients, stimulating industry innovation, and guiding future research design.&#xD;
