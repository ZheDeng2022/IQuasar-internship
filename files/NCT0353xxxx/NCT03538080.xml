  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound marking of saphenous veins before varicose vein surgery or for saphenectomy for&#xD;
      vascular or coronary artery bypass grafting is a long, tedious, low-grading examination,&#xD;
      generating overconsumption of many consumables including marking markers that may damage the&#xD;
      probes, of the modern and expensive ultrasound doppler. Augmented reality devices can&#xD;
      visualize the superficial veins and hope to simplify the investigation, improve the comfort&#xD;
      of the patient during the examination by significantly reducing the time of the examination.&#xD;
      There is few data in the literature on the value of using augmented reality devices of this&#xD;
      type. The AccuVein® system is a patient-friendly, non-contact, non-invasive technique that&#xD;
      minimizes discomfort due to standing time and thus improves patient comfort.&#xD;

      At admission eligible patients are proposed to participate. Written consent is signed after&#xD;
      complete oral and written explanation of the protocol is signed. No register of non-included&#xD;
      patients will be kept. In included patients, in parallel to the standard ultrasound&#xD;
      investigation for marking of saphenous veins for which the patient is referred, AccuVein®&#xD;
      system will be performed as explained later in arm description.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual ongoing treatments are obtained by history and recorded. The end of the visit is the&#xD;
      end of the participation of the subjects.&#xD;

    <description>Intervention is marking of the saphenous veins with ACCUVEIN system. The AccuVein® AV400 vein illumination system is a laser imaging system that detects superficial veins up to 10 mm deep and digitally displays, through a projected red light, a map of the vascularization on the surface of the skin. in real time, allowing clinicians to check vein permeability and position.&#xD;
This system is portable and lightweight. It can be easily cleaned, and requires no calibration or adjustment. It does not require any contact with the patient. Second time is completion of marking by ultrasound if necessary</description>
