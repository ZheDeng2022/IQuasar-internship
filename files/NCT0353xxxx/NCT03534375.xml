  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Risk-taking in early adolescence have has been found to be normative and even formative as it&#xD;
      might fulfill the youth's needs to experiment different sensations, make independent&#xD;
      decisions and learn from their consequences. Several theoretical models have suggested that&#xD;
      male and female adolescents differ in risk-taking as a product of individual/contextual&#xD;
      factors and neocortical functioning; however, the neurophysiological and neuropsychological&#xD;
      correlates of those differences continue to be underexplored. Informed by Evolutionary&#xD;
      Neuroandrogenic Theory, the investigators examine the links between gender, risk-proneness,&#xD;
      gratification delay, self-control, self-efficacy, executive functions and&#xD;
      neurophysiological-neuroanatomical correlates in early adolescents (age 10-12 years).&#xD;
      Participants (N=24; 50% females) will complete behavioral measurements on study constructs&#xD;
      and perform neuropsychological tests using fMRI scanning (e.g., Go/NoGo continuous&#xD;
      performance, stop-signal reaction time, NIH Cognition Battery, delay discounting). Female and&#xD;
      male groups will be compared on all outcome measures.&#xD;
