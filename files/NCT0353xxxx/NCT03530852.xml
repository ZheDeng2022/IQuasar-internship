    <textblock>
      Children with inadequate intestinal absorption due to loss of large amounts of small bowel&#xD;
      require intravenous nutrition (feeding through the vein) to sustain hydration and nutrition&#xD;
      to avoid starvation and dehydration; however, intravenous (IV) nutrition can lead to&#xD;
      complications including liver failure. Tube feeding directly to the small intestine avoids&#xD;
      the complications of IV nutrition, but fats are not fully digestible due to inadequate bowel&#xD;
      function. We propose to predigest the fat using a small cartridge attached to the feeding&#xD;
      tube to allow for rapid absorption with the possibility of reducing or eliminating the need&#xD;
      for intravenous nutrition&#xD;

      Project Summary/Abstract&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is often due to the loss of large amounts of small intestine that&#xD;
      compromises digestive absorption. The treatments include (1) a high-calorie diet that&#xD;
      includes vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, proteins and fats; (2) injections of vitamins and&#xD;
      minerals; (3) administration of drugs to slow the normal movement of the intestine or to&#xD;
      increase the surface area of the intestinal lining; and (4) feeding through the vein (i.e.,&#xD;
      parenteral nutrition or PN). Many patients cannot wean from PN due to reduced intestinal&#xD;
      length or function. Patients on long-term PN frequently experience serious metabolic&#xD;
      complications, sepsis, hepatic biliary disorders including cholestasis, and fibrosis and can&#xD;
      progress to liver failure. Full intestinal feeding (enteral nutrition) without PN is the&#xD;
      optimal way to prevent the above complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enterally administered long chain triglycerides in patients with SBS, especially those with&#xD;
      hepatic dysfunction, are not well tolerated due to bile acid malabsorption, which leads to&#xD;
      decreased micelle formation and fat digestion. The dietary fat is unable to be emulsified by&#xD;
      the bile acids and acted on by lipases before exiting the patient as stool. Switching to&#xD;
      other forms of fat such as medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) that do not require micelles for&#xD;
      absorption may be better tolerated in patients with bile acid or pancreatic insufficiency but&#xD;
      are not optimal as they increase the osmotic load in the intestine. This may increase the&#xD;
      chance of stool dumping; moreover, MCTs do not contain essential fatty acids (FAs). The&#xD;
      ability to provide the essential FAs such as those present in enteral formulas in a form that&#xD;
      does not require the formation of micelles for absorption, would allow patients with SBS and&#xD;
      those who are no longer PN dependent to receive adequate nutrition and continue to maintain&#xD;
      the same growth trajectory as when they received the majority of their nutrition&#xD;
      parenterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RELiZORB is a digestive enzyme cartridge connected in-line with enteral feed tubing sets&#xD;
      designed to mimic the function of pancreatic lipase. It is hypothesized that by using an&#xD;
      external lipase device (RELiZORB) enteral nutrition will be better absorbed, and PN&#xD;
      dependence reduced as enteral autonomy is increased. This product uniquely eliminates the&#xD;
      need for intestinal emulsification and lipase activity and eliminates the risk of drugs,&#xD;
      including lipases, allowing absorption at the time the diet enters the gut. The device has&#xD;
      been shown to digest &gt;90% of fat in most enteral formulas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase 4, open label single center clinical trial to determine the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and bioavailability of the RELiZORB enzyme cartridge with enteral nutrition&#xD;
      when used daily for 90 days in pediatric subjects with SBS, aged 5 years - 18 years, who are&#xD;
      PN dependent. The change in PN calories from baseline, assessed at Day 7, 14, 28, 60, and 90,&#xD;
      will be assessed by area under the curve and presented with a 95% confidence interval. The&#xD;
      number (percent) of treatment-emergent adverse events, grade 2 or above, will be tabulated.&#xD;
      Changes in growth, fecal fat/protein, plasma FAs, PN volume, and enteral/oral nutrition will&#xD;
      be described.&#xD;
