      Introduction In the last 10 years, numerous published cases and case series described the&#xD;
      revascularization or regenerative endodontics. Revascularization is a conservative method for&#xD;
      inducing maturogenesis in necrotic immature teeth. The favorable outcomes of regenerative&#xD;
      endodontics are largely dependent on the adequate disinfection of the root canal. These&#xD;
      canals with compromised fragile underdeveloped dentinal walls represent a contraindication&#xD;
      for mechanical instrumentation; thus, chemical debridement remains the main form of&#xD;
      disinfection. A mixture of ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and minocycline, known as the triple&#xD;
      antibiotic paste (TAP), has been shown to be very effective in eliminating endodontic&#xD;
      pathogens in vitro and in situ. However, TAP has an adverse effect on stem cell survival.&#xD;
      Discoloration of the tooth is a problem mostly related to the use of minocycline in TAP.&#xD;
      Moreover, TAP can demineralize dentin resulting in reduced microhardness and fracture&#xD;
      resistance. Propolis, a flavonoid-rich resinous product of honeybees, is ten times less&#xD;
      cytotoxic than calcium hydroxide and has a well-known antibacterial effect. Therefore,&#xD;
      creating alternatives to the TAP for disinfecting the root canal of necrotic teeth during the&#xD;
      process of pulp revascularization is thought to be of value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods Forty patients with immature, nonvital maxillary incisors were included&#xD;
      in this study from the outpatient clinic of the Faculty of Dentistry, Ain Shams University,&#xD;
      Cairo, Egypt. A detailed medical and dental history was obtained from each patient's parents&#xD;
      or guardians. Only medically free patients were included in this research. The clinical and&#xD;
      radiographic exclusion criteria were teeth with vertical fractures, periodontally involved&#xD;
      teeth, and nonrestorable teeth. All procedures were performed after obtaining proper&#xD;
      institutional review board approval based on the regulations of the Ethical Committee of the&#xD;
      Faculty of Dentistry, Ain Shams University. Intraoral periapical radiographs revealed&#xD;
      immature apices. The age of the patients ranged between 8 and 18 years. Informed consent was&#xD;
      signed for each case by the patient's parents or guardians including the proposed treatment&#xD;
      and possible outcomes or complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases were divided randomly and equally into 4 groups according to the intracanal medicament&#xD;
      (10 patients for each group):&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAP group: was treated with Triple Antibiotic Paste CP group: was treated with Ciprofloxacin&#xD;
      + Propolis paste CM group: was treated with Ciprofloxacin + Metronidazole paste PM group: was&#xD;
      treated with Propolis + Metronidazole paste&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Triple Antibiotic Paste (TAP):&#xD;
&#xD;
           It consisted of Ciprofloxacin (Ciprocin 250 mg tablets; EPICO, Cairo, Egypt),&#xD;
           Metronidazole (Flagyl 500 mg tablets; Sanofi Aventis Pharma, Cairo, Egypt), Doxycycline&#xD;
           (Vibramycin 100 mg capsules; Pfizer, Cairo, Egypt). One Doxycycline capsule content was&#xD;
           evacuated in a sterile mortar, one tablet of metronidazole and one tablet of&#xD;
           ciprofloxacin were crushed and ground in the same mortar using a pestle into homogenous&#xD;
           powder. Saline drops (Otrivin baby saline; Novartis, Cairo, Egypt) were added and mixed&#xD;
           using the pestle until a creamy paste was achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ciprofloxacin + Propolis Paste:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ethanol extract of raw propolis (EEP; ElEzaby Co. Labs, Cairo, Egypt.) was prepared by&#xD;
           adding 10 gm of propolis (Imtinan, Cairo, Egypt) to 40 gm of 70% ethanol (ElGomhorya&#xD;
           Co., Cairo, Egypt) (for 20% tincture) in a dark container to prevent reduction of&#xD;
           propolis. The container was sealed and placed at room temperature for a period of three&#xD;
           weeks. The sealed container was manually shaken every 2 days to ensure proper mixing.&#xD;
           After 3 weeks, the container was opened and ethanol extract of propolis was obtained.&#xD;
           Ethanol-free EEP was made by evaporating the ethanol in a water bath. EEP was then mixed&#xD;
           with Ciprofloxacin powder in the ratio 1:1. Saline drops were added and mixed using the&#xD;
           pestle until a creamy paste was achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ciprofloxacin + Metronidazole Paste:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ciprofloxacin powder was mixed with Metronidazole powder in the ratio 1:1. Saline drops were&#xD;
      added and mixed using the pestle until a creamy paste was achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) Propolis + Metronidazole paste: EEP was mixed with Metronidazole powder in the ratio 1:1.&#xD;
      Saline drops were added and mixed using the pestle until a creamy paste was achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A preoperative radiograph was taken using the standardized paralleling technique by the Rinn&#xD;
      XCP (Rinn Corporation Elgin, Illinois, USA) alignment system and Fona ScaNeo intra-oral&#xD;
      digital imaging system (FONA Dental, Bratislava, Slovak Republic). Patients were treated as&#xD;
      follows: Caries was excavated; access cavity was prepared. The rubber dam was then applied&#xD;
      and working length was determined with a periapical radiograph taken with a file inserted&#xD;
      into the canal. Canal space was debrided using K file size #80. Canal space was irrigated&#xD;
      using 40 cc of NaOCl 2.6% solution and final flush of saline. Canal space was dried using&#xD;
      paper points. The antibiotic paste was prepared as previously described. One cc of the&#xD;
      prepared paste was injected into the canals using a sterile plastic syringe with 20&quot; gauge&#xD;
      needle. Care was taken to avoid apical extrusion and to minimize placement in the coronal&#xD;
      portion of the tooth. The access cavity was then sealed using temporary restoration (Coltosol&#xD;
      F; Coltene Whaledent, Altstatten, Switzerland) over plain cotton. After the 3 weeks, under&#xD;
      the same aseptic conditions, anesthesia without vasoconstrictor (Mepecaine, Alexandria Co.,&#xD;
      Alexandria, Egypt) was administrated. The tooth was re-entered, the antibiotic paste was&#xD;
      removed and the canal was irrigated using a sterile saline and dried using paper points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sterile hand file size #25 was introduced into the root canal and placed at 2 mm beyond the&#xD;
      working length to induce bleeding into the canal. The bleeding was allowed to reach a 3-mm&#xD;
      level below the cemento-enamel junction, and teeth were left at rest for 5 minutes so that a&#xD;
      blood clot could be formed. Next, a 3-mm plug of MTA (Angelus; Londrina, Brazil) was inserted&#xD;
      into the canals using a suitable-sized amalgam carrier to seal the root canal at the cervical&#xD;
      level. The MTA plug was verified radiographically. The MTA plug was then covered by moist&#xD;
      cotton and temporary filling. After one week, MTA setting was confirmed clinically, adhesive&#xD;
      composite resin (Z250 Restorative; 3M ESPE, St Paul, Minnesota, USA) was used to seal the&#xD;
      access cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were recalled for follow up at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months. Follow-up included the&#xD;
      clinical assessment of pain and/or swelling and standardized radiographic assessment, which&#xD;
      included the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An increase in root length&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An increase in root thickness&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A decrease in apical diameter&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A change in periapical bone density All radiographic measures were collected by the same&#xD;
           investigator. All radiographic measurements were repeated after 1 week, and the mean of&#xD;
           the 2 sets was considered as the final value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increase in root length: A measuring scale was set in the Image-J software (Image-J v1.44, US&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) by measuring a known clinical dimension to its&#xD;
      radiographic dimension. The scale was calculated as number of measured pixels per mm length.&#xD;
      Root length was measured as a straight line from the cemento- enamel junction to the&#xD;
      radiographic apex of the tooth in millimeters. Pre and follow-up root lengths were measured&#xD;
      using Image-J analysis software. Difference in length was calculated. Percentage of increase&#xD;
      in length was calculated as follows: percentage of increase in length = [(postoperative&#xD;
      length - preoperative length) / preoperative length] X 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increase in root thickness: Using the preset measurement scale, the level of the apical third&#xD;
      was determined and fixed from the cemento-enamel junction. The root thickness and the pulp&#xD;
      width were measured mesiodistally at this level in millimeters. Mesiodistal dentin thickness&#xD;
      was measured by subtraction of the pulp space from the whole root thickness. Pre and&#xD;
      follow-up root thicknesses were measured. Measurements were done pre and post operatively at&#xD;
      the same fixed level. Difference in dentin thickness was calculated. Percentage of increase&#xD;
      in dentin thickness was calculated as follows: percentage of increase in dentin thickness =&#xD;
      [(postoperative thickness - preoperative thickness) / preoperative thickness] X 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decrease in apical diameter: Using the preset measurement scale, the mesiodistal diameter of&#xD;
      the apical foramen was measured in millimeters. Measurements were done pre and&#xD;
      postoperatively. Percentage of apical closure was calculated as follows: percentage of apical&#xD;
      closure = [(preoperative apical diameter - postoperative apical diameter) / preoperative&#xD;
      apical diameter] X 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periapical bone density:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periapical bone density was estimated using Image-J software as follows: periapical area was&#xD;
      located and analyzed for bone density. Average area density was measured in scale from 0&#xD;
      (black) to 255 (white) and recorded for each radiograph. The same area was then measured in&#xD;
      subsequent radiographs and average densities were recorded for the follow up radiographs. The&#xD;
      difference between densities was calculated between subsequent radiographs. Percentage of&#xD;
      change in density was calculated from the original pre-operative radiograph density as&#xD;
      follows: percentage of change in density = [(postoperative bone density - preoperative bone&#xD;
      density)/preoperative bone density] X 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were collected, tabulated and statistically analyzed using statistical analysis software&#xD;
      SPSS (Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences 19.0, IBM, Armonk, NY). Two-way analysis&#xD;
      of variance was performed. The Tukey post hoc test was used in case of significance.&#xD;
