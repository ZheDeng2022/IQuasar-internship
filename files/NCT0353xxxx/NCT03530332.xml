      This research study is being done to find out whether a screening blood test can help&#xD;
      identify women with an increased risk of preterm birth.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth (PTB) remains the leading cause of neonatal mortality and long-term disability&#xD;
      throughout the world. Recently treatments early in pregnancy such as progesterone, cervical&#xD;
      support and maternal support have been demonstrated to delay delivery amongst at risk women.&#xD;
      Nonetheless, the majority of women who are at risk are not identified using current screening&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are 18 years or older, with a singleton pregnancy between 19 5/7 weeks and 20 6/7&#xD;
      weeks gestational age (GA) confirmed by ultrasound prior to enrollment and no history of&#xD;
      prior preterm birth (delivery between 16 0/7 weeks and 37 6/7 weeks) will be invited to&#xD;
      participate. Women who enroll will be randomized to screening and intervention for those at&#xD;
      high risk of PTB or no screening and standard care. All participants will undergo sample&#xD;
      collection, but the samples from the group randomized to &quot;no screening' will not be analyzed&#xD;
      until the end of the study (post-delivery of all neonates).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women randomized to the intervention group will be screened using the PreTRMÂ® test (Sera&#xD;
      Prognostics, Inc.) at a large tertiary care center. Predicated upon the degree of risk, women&#xD;
      will be treated according to a pre-specified algorithm. The outcomes of these women will be&#xD;
      compared to a control group of women who do not receive screening at the same tertiary care&#xD;
      center.&#xD;
