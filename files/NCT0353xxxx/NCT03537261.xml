  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 24-week study is to determine whether the &quot;Parent-based Crisis Prevention&#xD;
      Institute (CPI) physical management training program&quot; (i.e., P-CPI) is effective in&#xD;
      increasing self-efficacy in parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parents of children with ASD deal with more stress, especially if their child demonstrates&#xD;
      self-injurious and aggressive behavior. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether&#xD;
      &quot;Parent-based Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI) physical management training program&quot; (i.e.,&#xD;
      P-CPI) for parents of children with ASD helps alleviate some of this stress and increase&#xD;
      parental self-efficacy, physical management competency, and overall quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet criteria will be randomly assigned to either the treatment group or the&#xD;
      waitlist control group. Participants assigned to the treatment group will be invited to a&#xD;
      6-hour P-CPI group training session. This parent-based training in CPI's Nonviolent Crisis&#xD;
      InterventionÂ® will include nonverbal, paraverbal, verbal, and physical intervention&#xD;
      techniques. Participants assigned to the waitlist group will be encouraged to continue their&#xD;
      existing medical support, or services, as they typically would. The waitlist group will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the P-CPI training at the conclusion of the post-assessment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline measures will be on the day of training for the treatment group and within five days&#xD;
      of the P-CPI training for the waitlist group. Follow-up measures will be at 2-week, and 1, 2,&#xD;
      and 3- month post-baseline. The treatment group will also participate in a follow-up group&#xD;
      interview.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and 2-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPES-DD self-efficacy scale is a 16-item brief outcome measure in the evaluation of individual parenting interventions that measures parents' self-efficacy in managing specific child behavior problems. Instructions were modified to ask about the previous two weeks instead of the previous four weeks. The range of possible scores is 16-160, with higher scores corresponding to greater parental self-efficacy and a positive change indicating improvement from baseline. Mean changes were estimated using repeated measures linear regression controlling for score at screening visit.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Parent Stress Index - Short Form Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PSI-SF is a self-report measure of severity and domain of parenting stress which includes 36 items rated on a 5-point, Likert scale. The range of possible values for the total stress raw score is 36-180, with higher scores corresponding to greater levels of parental stress and negative change corresponding to reduced levels of parental stress. Mean changes were estimated using repeated measures linear regression controlling for score at screening visit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Family Quality of Life Scale Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The FQOL is a 25-item measure assessing families' perceptions of their satisfaction with different aspects of family quality of life. It assesses five domains: family interaction, parenting, general resources, health and safety, and support for persons with disabilities. Instructions were modified to ask about the previous two weeks instead of the previous 12 months. The range of possible values for the FQOL total score is 25-125, with higher scores corresponding to better quality of life and positive change corresponding to improved quality of life. Mean changes were estimated using repeated measures linear regression controlling for score at screening visit.</description>

It assesses five domains: family interaction, parenting, general resources, health and safety, and support for persons with disabilities. Instructions were modified to ask about the previous two weeks instead of the previous 12 months. The range of possible values for the FQOL total score is 25-125, with higher scores corresponding to better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change in the Family Quality of Life Scale Total Score</title>
        <description>The FQOL is a 25-item measure assessing families' perceptions of their satisfaction with different aspects of family quality of life. It assesses five domains: family interaction, parenting, general resources, health and safety, and support for persons with disabilities. Instructions were modified to ask about the previous two weeks instead of the previous 12 months. The range of possible values for the FQOL total score is 25-125, with higher scores corresponding to better quality of life and positive change corresponding to improved quality of life. Mean changes were estimated using repeated measures linear regression controlling for score at screening visit.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and 2-weeks</time_frame>
        <population>All 35 participants assigned to P-CPI training and 28 participants assigned to waitlist who completed the baseline assessment contributed at least one FQOL total score to the analysis. Four of these participants contributed only one score: two assigned to P-CPI training and one assigned to waitlist who discontinued study participation between baseline and two weeks, and one at baseline assigned to waitlist who provided incomplete FQOL data.</population>
