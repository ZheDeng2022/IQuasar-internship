      This study aims to determine whether the GeneSight Psychotropic test can result in better&#xD;
      treatment outcomes for patients with treatment-naive major depressive disorder&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder is a chronic psychiatric illness that leads to devastating&#xD;
      consequences at the individual and societal levels. Today, the choice of treatment continues&#xD;
      to be largely based on subjective factors, primarily the clinician and/or patient's&#xD;
      preferences, as well as the individual's history of response to treatment, often tainted by&#xD;
      recall bias. Psychiatric medication decisions are even more arbitrary when the subject in&#xD;
      question has not had past treatment trials. This often leads to a trial and error process and&#xD;
      an increasingly resistant disease with each failed trial. Early implementation of an&#xD;
      objective tool designed for tailoring medication choice to an individual may prove highly&#xD;
      beneficial in decreasing illness chronicity, individual suffering, and economic burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GeneSight Psychotropic test is a pharmacogenomic decision support tool, developed to help&#xD;
      clinicians make informed, evidence-based decisions about proper drug selection. Therefore, we&#xD;
      propose conducting a randomized, double blind, controlled trial to evaluate the impact of the&#xD;
      GeneSight Psychotropic test to guide treatment decisions in patients with treatment-naïve&#xD;
      (never having taken medication for depression) Major Depressive Disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve 6 visits over about 24 weeks where participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      have their study clinician have access to their pharmacogenetic report in order to make&#xD;
      treatment decisions, or to not have access to their report for the first 12 weeks. At Visit&#xD;
      5, Week 12, all participants will receive a copy of their pharmacogenetics report and all&#xD;
      clinicians will be unblinded to be able to use the results to guide treatment options for an&#xD;
      additional 12 weeks.&#xD;
