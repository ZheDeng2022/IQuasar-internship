      Gall bladder status among children with chronic haemolytic anemia attending to Assuit&#xD;
      University Children Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemolysis is defined as the premature destruction of red blood cells (RBCs) (a shortened RBC&#xD;
      life span). Anemia results when the rate of destruction exceeds the capacity of the marrow to&#xD;
      produce RBCs. Normal RBC survival time is 110-120 days (half-life: 55-60 days), and thus,&#xD;
      approximately 0.85% of the most senescent RBCs are removed and replaced each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic haemolytic anemia are subjected to many complications of chronic&#xD;
      haemolytic anemia e.g anemic heart failure, complications of blood transfusion as hepatitis&#xD;
      and AIDS, hypersplenism, haemosiderosis ,among them there is incidence of gallbladder stone&#xD;
      formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work aims to a) to determine the prevalence of gall bladder diseases among patient with&#xD;
      chronic haemolytic anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b) to determine the risk factors of gall bladder diseases among patients with chronic&#xD;
      haemolytic anemia.&#xD;

      Gall bladder status among children with chronic haemolytic anemia attending to Assuit&#xD;
      University Children Hospital Hemolysis is defined as the premature destruction of red blood&#xD;
      cells (RBCs) (a shortened RBC life span). Anemia results when the rate of destruction exceeds&#xD;
      the capacity of the marrow to produce RBCs. Normal RBC survival time is 110-120 days&#xD;
      (half-life: 55-60 days), and thus, approximately 0.85% of the most senescent RBCs are removed&#xD;
      and replaced each day.(1) They may be classified according to the means of hemolysis, being&#xD;
      either intrinsic in cases where the cause is related to the red blood cell (RBC) itself,&#xD;
      defects of red blood cell membrane production (as in hereditary spherocytosis and hereditary&#xD;
      elliptocytosis), defects in hemoglobin production (as in thalassemia, sickle-cell disease and&#xD;
      congenital dyserythropoietic anemia), defective red cell metabolism (as in&#xD;
      glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and pyruvate kinase deficiency). or extrinsic in&#xD;
      cases where factors external to the RBC dominate, acquired hemolytic anemia may be caused by&#xD;
      immune-mediated causes, drugs and other miscellaneous causes. Patients with chronic&#xD;
      haemolytic anemia are subjected to many complications of chronic haemolytic anemia e.g anemic&#xD;
      heart failure, complications of blood transfusion as hepatitis and AIDS, hypersplenism,&#xD;
      haemosiderosis ,among them there is incidence of gallbladder stone formation.(2) The&#xD;
      gallbladder is a small pouch that sits just under the liver. The gallbladder stores bile&#xD;
      produced by the liver. After meals, the gallbladder is empty and flat, like a deflated&#xD;
      balloon. Before a meal, the gallbladder may be full of bile and about the size of a small&#xD;
      pear. In response to signals, the gallbladder squeezes stored bile into the small intestine&#xD;
      through a series of tubes called ducts. Bile helps digest fat.(3) Diseases affecting gall&#xD;
      bladder in children as:a)Gallstones (cholelithiasis) for unclear reasons, substances in bile&#xD;
      can crystallize in the gallbladder, forming gallstones which is common and usually harmless,&#xD;
      gallstones can sometimes cause pain, nausea, or inflammation. b)Cholecystitis( Infection of&#xD;
      the gallbladder), often due to a gallstone in the gallbladder. Cholecystitis causes severe&#xD;
      pain and fever, and can require surgery when infection continues or recurs.c) Gallstone&#xD;
      pancreatitis: An impacted gallstone blocks the ducts that drain the pancreas. Inflammation of&#xD;
      the pancreas results, a serious condition.(4) While problems associated with the gallbladder&#xD;
      are rare in children, almost 50 percent of children have gallstones. Many of them--between 80&#xD;
      percent and 90 percent--have no symptoms. However, even small stones in small children can&#xD;
      cause problems , Gallstones are mainly categorized in three groups of cholesterol, pigment,&#xD;
      and mixture, among which the mixture is more common. Imbalance in bile constituents,such as&#xD;
      cholesterol,lecithin,andbilesalts,is the main cause of gallstone formation.(4-5) In children&#xD;
      &gt;70% of gallstones are the pigment type, these stones are mostly reported in cases with&#xD;
      hemolytic disease, such as spherocytosis and sickle cell anemia, cirrhosis, bile tract&#xD;
      infection, these stones are black-brown in color, the incidence increases progressively with&#xD;
      age. In sickle-cell disease, the prevalence of pigment gallstones( was reported to be 10% to&#xD;
      15% in children under 10 years of age, it increased to 40% in those aged 10-18 years, and 50%&#xD;
      in adults(6-7). The prevalence of gallstones in hereditary spherocytosis was 10% to 20% and&#xD;
      in adult series it was 40%(7-8). In thalassemia, the reported figure is low (10% to&#xD;
      15%)(8-9). With longer survival of thalassemiapatients, higher prevalence of gallstones (50%)&#xD;
      has been reported(9). The highest prevalence of gallstones have been reported in thalassemics&#xD;
      with Gilbert's syndrome genotype(10). However, in a study on 64 patients with median age of&#xD;
      10 (range, 5 to 20) years with thalassemia major from Chandigarh, none had gallstones(11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Multiple blood transfusions: In patients who periodically receive blood transfusions,&#xD;
           hemolysis of the transfused cells may supplement the chronic endogenous blood&#xD;
           destruction as a factor in the formation of gallstones [11-12].&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. High rates (20% by age of four years) of recurrent biliary tract obstruction in children&#xD;
           with the sickle cell disease reported [13].&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Obesity: With the prevalence of childhood obesity on the rise, there is a need to be&#xD;
           more aware of obesity-related comorbidity including gallbladder disease. No clear link&#xD;
           between the diet and risk for cholelithiasis, though foods high in cholesterol and low&#xD;
           in fiber may increase the risk [14].&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Inefficient and infrequent gallbladder contractions, which allow bile to sit in the&#xD;
           gallbladder for long periods of time, resulting in an over concentrated bile that is&#xD;
           conducive to stone formation [15].&#xD;
&#xD;
