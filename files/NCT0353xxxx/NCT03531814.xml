      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder. It has a broad variety of effects on&#xD;
      the body. Up to half of people with NF1 get plexiform neurofibromas (PNs). These are benign&#xD;
      tumors. But they can have serious effects like pain and disfigurement. To treat PNs, a person&#xD;
      may have to take medicine every day for a long period of time. Researchers think that it will&#xD;
      be important for people to take the medicine regularly for it to work. They want to study how&#xD;
      well people with NF1 follow their treatment plan for PNs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study how often people with neurofibromatosis type 1 take medicine that has been&#xD;
      prescribed to them for treating plexiform neurofibromas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 3-59 already enrolled in an NF1 clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will need access to the internet to do the study activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents or caregivers will do some study activities for child participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete 5 questionnaires. They will take about 20 minutes total. The&#xD;
      topics will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent life events&#xD;
&#xD;
      How much pain interferes with daily life&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ability to focus and pay attention to tasks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emotional distress or depression&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will mark down every time they take a dose of the medicine in their clinical&#xD;
      trial. They will use a form the researchers give them. The pill bottles they get in their&#xD;
      trial will have a chip in the cap that will record when it is opened. Participants will keep&#xD;
      a daily diary of their medicine. Their pills will be counted at clinical trial visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have more short questionnaires. They may have interviews by phone or video.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in&#xD;
           3,500 individuals and is associated with a broad variety of symptoms and physical&#xD;
           findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) are histologically benign tumors which occur in 25-50% of&#xD;
           patients with NF1 and can lead to significant morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral therapeutic options for the treatment of plexiform neurofibromas are being actively&#xD;
           developed, however early clinical data indicate that prolonged treatment over the course&#xD;
           of months to years will likely be needed to maintain clinical efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long-term medication adherence is an ongoing challenge for patients with many types of&#xD;
           chronic illness, and clinical experience makes us strongly suspect patients with NF1&#xD;
           will likely have this issue as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In other diseases, such as HIV and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, decreased medication&#xD;
           adherence has been associated with poorer clinical outcomes, and this may be the case&#xD;
           for NF1 as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The medication event monitoring systems (MEMSTM) uses a computerized method of tracking&#xD;
           the dates and times of a pill bottle being opened, and has been shown to be a more&#xD;
           accurate measure of medication adherence than patient diaries or pill counts in other&#xD;
           patient populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessing medication adherence over time in this unique population will be essential for&#xD;
           assessing any impact on medical outcomes, identifying potential behavioral&#xD;
           interventions, and targeting patients most at risk for nonadherence moving forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To establish the feasibility of using MEMSTM to monitor medication adherence in the NF1&#xD;
      population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects must have a diagnosis of NF1 and be between 3 and 59 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be enrolled on a clinical trial for an oral medication in pill (tablet&#xD;
           or capsule) form directed at the treatment of plexiform neurofibroma(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This single-site, longitudinal study will recruit children and adults with NF1 who are&#xD;
           currently enrolled in a treatment protocol for a drug targeting PN volume reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MEMSTM caps will be used to monitor adherence over time along with patient diaries and&#xD;
           pill counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with MEMSTM cap data indicating &lt;90% adherence at any study visit (typically&#xD;
           across 3 - 6 cycles) will be administered a measure assessing barriers to adherence&#xD;
           electronically and will be interviewed to evaluate what factors might contribute to&#xD;
           decreased medication adherence and what potential interventions they consider useful.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria for Patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be between 3 and 59 years of age at the time of the baseline assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be enrolled on an NF1 clinical trial for an oral medication directed at&#xD;
             the treatment of plexiform neurofibroma(s) (enrollment on this study to occur ideally&#xD;
             within 1st cycle) Patients must have regular access to a computer or electronic device&#xD;
             (e.g., smartphone, tablet) with internet access.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have a parent or adult primary caregiver willing to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) to understand and the&#xD;
             willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be able to read and comprehend the English language.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria for Parents or Caregivers&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be a parent or primary caregiver of a child (or if applicable adult patient) of&#xD;
             diagnosed with NF1 and enrolled on a clinical trial for oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have a child (or if applicable adult patient) willing to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have regular access to a computer or electronic device (e.g., smartphone, tablet)&#xD;
             with internet access.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be able to speak and understand English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willing to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
             document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria for Patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the opinion of the PI or an AI, the subject has significant cognitive or emotional&#xD;
             difficulties that would prevent them from being able to understand and/or participate&#xD;
             fully in the study or complete the measures. Though these patients might be receiving&#xD;
             assistance in taking medication from a caregiver, it is likely that their medication&#xD;
             takingroutine would be significantly different from the general population of patients&#xD;
             with NF1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving the study drug in liquid form, since the use of MEMSTM caps&#xD;
             prohibits liquid dosing.&#xD;
