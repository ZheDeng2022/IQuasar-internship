  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if fulvestrant and abemaciclib can help&#xD;
      to control low-grade serous ovarian cancer. The safety of this drug combination will also be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Fulvestrant and abemaciclib are both FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for the treatment of several types of cancer. Their use in patients&#xD;
      with low-grade serous ovarian cancer is investigational. The study doctor can explain how the&#xD;
      study drugs are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 15 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Drug Administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every study cycle will be 28 days. You will receive treatment in 2 periods: Neoadjuvant&#xD;
      Treatment (before surgery) and Adjuvant Treatment (after surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are premenopausal or perimenopausal, you will receive goserelin as an injection under&#xD;
      the skin every 12 weeks. The study doctor will tell you if you will have these injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant Treatment (Cycles 1-4) There are 4 cycles in the neoadjuvant treatment period. On&#xD;
      Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of Cycles 2-4, you will receive fulvestrant as an&#xD;
      injection in your buttocks. On Days 1- 28 of each cycle, you will take abemaciclib tablets 2&#xD;
      times every day by mouth at about the same time each day, preferably with food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abemaciclib should be swallowed whole; not chewed. If a tablet is broken, cracked, or&#xD;
      otherwise not whole, do not take it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery After 4 cycles of neoadjuvant treatment, you will have your scheduled surgery as part&#xD;
      of your standard care. You will sign a separate consent for this surgery describing the&#xD;
      procedure and its risks in more detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjuvant Treatment (Cycles 5 and beyond) After you have recovered from surgery (about 3-6&#xD;
      weeks later), you will begin receiving fulvestrant and abemaciclib. On Day 1 of each cycle,&#xD;
      you will receive fulvestrant as an injection in your buttocks. On Days 1- 28 of each cycle,&#xD;
      you will take abemaciclib tablets 2 times every day by mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the&#xD;
      study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study You will receive the study drug(s) for as long as the study doctor thinks it&#xD;
      is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease&#xD;
      gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study&#xD;
      directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation in this study will be over after the 30-day follow-up phone call&#xD;
      (described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a physical exam. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will also have a&#xD;
      pelvic exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine, tumor marker, and biomarker tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine will be collected for routine tests. If you can become pregnant, part of this blood&#xD;
      sample will be used for a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 15 of Cycle 1, you will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of odd-numbered cycles after Cycle 1 (Cycles 3, 5, 7, and so on), you will have an&#xD;
      MRI or CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At your visit before the surgery, you will have a CT scan or MRI to check the status of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery, some of the tissue removed will be used to compare to tissue collected from&#xD;
      you before you received chemotherapy so researchers can learn if the study drugs had any&#xD;
      affect on the disease. This sample will be stored at MD Anderson for an unlimited amount of&#xD;
      time for testing related to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the last dose of study drug(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a physical exam. Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine, tumor&#xD;
      marker, and biomarker tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have an MRI or CT scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up About 30 days after the last dose of study drugs, the study staff will call you and&#xD;
      ask how you are doing. This call should last about 5 minutes.&#xD;

             peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinomas who in the judgement of the treating&#xD;
             physician are unlikely to achieve optimal surgical cytoreduction and have been&#xD;
             recommended to receive neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Histological diagnosis must be based on surgical or core biopsy not just fine needle&#xD;

             Pre-treatment fresh frozen tissue must be available for research purposes. This tissue&#xD;
             can be collected from preoperative laparoscopy, other diagnostic biopsy, or a&#xD;
             research-specific biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Signed informed consent on protocol LAB02-188.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Tissue from an archival tissue sample or fresh tissue obtained from a core or&#xD;

             translational studies must be willing to undergo a research biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have measurable disease by RECIST v1.1. a. Measurable disease is defined&#xD;

             (&lt;/= 5 X ULN in patients with bone or liver metastases)&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior therapy or surgical procedures to&#xD;
             National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE 4.03 Grade &lt;/= 1&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Women of child-bearing potential (intact uterus) MUST have a negative serum or urine&#xD;
             human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first&#xD;
             dose of study medication. Patients of childbearing potential are those who have not&#xD;
             been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year. If the&#xD;
             urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will&#xD;

             Section 7.7). Patients of childbearing potential are those who have not been&#xD;
             surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year. Should a woman&#xD;
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Pre/perimenopausal women must be amenable to be treated with goserelin. All patients&#xD;
             will be rendered post-menopausal secondary to concomitant administration of goserelin.&#xD;
