      To compare the efficacy of carbon ion-based chemo radiotherapy with x-ray-based chemo&#xD;
      radiotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma by comparison of&#xD;
      overall survival at 2 years following treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient has 2 in 3 chance of receiving Arm A and 1 in 3 chance of receiving Arm B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A (chemoradiation takes place in Japan):&#xD;
&#xD;
      CIRT in 12 fractions/treatments plus concurrent gemcitabine, followed by 4 cycles of&#xD;
      gemcitabine + nab-Paclitaxel, or until progression or intolerance of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMRT in 28 fractions plus concurrent gemcitabine or capecitabine, followed by 4 cycles of&#xD;
      gemcitabine + nab-Paclitaxel, or until progression or intolerance of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per investigator discretion, patients may receive either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Definitive treatment :&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Neoadjuvant treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjuvant chemotherapy 4 cycles of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel or FOLFIRNOX, Gemcitabine alone&#xD;
