  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of radiotherapy in metastatic cancer has historically been limited to palliation&#xD;
      while metastasectomy or radiofrequency has emerged as playing a major role in disease&#xD;
      control. Although resection is the standard of care for liver metastasis, 80-90% of patients&#xD;
      are not resectable at diagnosis in particular because of the presence of oligometastases.&#xD;
      Factors that favour a truly oligometastatic state include a long latent interval between the&#xD;
      treatment of the primary tumor and the appearance of metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oligometastatic cancer is a very heterogeneous disease with respect to several factors&#xD;
      including the location of the primary tumor. With the advent of extracranial stereotactic&#xD;
      body radiation therapy (SBRT), higher biological equivalent doses can be safely delivered in&#xD;
      3 to 5 fractions, thus potentially ablating all the tissue in the treated area while&#xD;
      protecting more efficiently the hosting organ and healthy tissues surrounding the tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with liver oligometastases, in-field local control rates at 2 years range from&#xD;
      70% to 90% with less than 5% severe grade 3 or higher toxicity rates. Retrospective studies&#xD;
      indicate that roughly 20% of the patients remain disease-free 2 to 4 years after SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients treated with SBRT some authors found that half of the patients had either no&#xD;
      metastatic progression or very little progression in terms of number and site of metastases.&#xD;
      The patterns of failure after SBRT for oligometastases in one organ showed that 73% of&#xD;
      patients eventually developed new metastases with higher than 80% occurring as new metastases&#xD;
      in the same index organ. These findings support the idea of an oligometastatic state in which&#xD;
      aggressive local therapy could improve progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this phase III study, we sought to evaluate the impact of SBRT on PFS at 2 years in&#xD;
      patients with synchronous or metachronous liver-only oligometastases from colorectal cancers&#xD;
      patients after a first line chemotherapy for metastatic disease but not having progressed&#xD;
      during first line chemotherapy and up to 1 year&#xD;
