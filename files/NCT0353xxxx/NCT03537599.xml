    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of donor lymphocyte infusions&#xD;
      when given together with daratumumab and to see how well they work in treating participants&#xD;
      with acute myeloid leukemia that has come back after a stem cell transplant. A donor&#xD;
      lymphocyte infusion is a type of therapy in which lymphocytes (white blood cells) from the&#xD;
      blood of a donor are given to a participant who has already received a stem cell transplant&#xD;
      from the same donor. The donor lymphocytes may kill remaining cancer cells. Monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as daratumumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Giving daratumumab and donor white blood cells may work better in treating&#xD;
      participants with acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate safety and tolerability of daratumumab and escalating doses of donor&#xD;
      lymphocyte infusions (DLI) in post-hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) patients with&#xD;
      relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) transformed to AML&#xD;
      (phase I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate overall response rate to daratumumab and DLI in patients with post-HCT&#xD;
      relapsed AML and MDS (phase II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess overall response rates in minimal residual disease (MRD) positive patients and&#xD;
      in patients with overt morphological relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess MRD conversion rates from MRD positive to MRD negative. III. To determine the&#xD;
      post-relapse 6-month overall response (OS) rates of patients with relapsed AML and MDS&#xD;
      following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) who are treated with&#xD;
      daratumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the rates of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (both grades II-IV and III-IV)&#xD;
      and autoimmune side effects of daratumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the post-relapse 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rates of patients&#xD;
      with relapsed AML and MDS following allo-HSCT who are treated with daratumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare CD38 expression levels in myeloid blasts and interferon gamma (IFN-y) levels in&#xD;
      plasma at the time of relapse before starting daratumumab and at progression or relapse after&#xD;
      daratumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare peripheral blood T cell number and subsets (CD3, CD4, CD8, (CD38 expression on&#xD;
      regulatory T cells [T-regs], CD4 and CD8), T regs, B-regulatory cells, natural killer (NK)&#xD;
      cell numbers and bone marrow T cell subsets at the time of relapse before starting&#xD;
      daratumumab, at the time of partial/complete response to daratumumab, and at the time of&#xD;
      progression or relapse after daratumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate whether daratumumab has (i) direct anti-leukemia effects (ii)&#xD;
      antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis&#xD;
      (ADCP) and (III) immune modulation of autologous immune system (NK cells, T cells, T-regs,&#xD;
      B-regulatory cells [B-regs], and myeloid-derived suppressor cells [MDSCS]) in AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the effect of daratumumab on exosome content and clearance along with other&#xD;
      soluble factors in AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate serum interferon (IFN) levels pre-daratumumab, during and post-daratumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate whether fratricide occurs in patients treated with daratumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of donor lymphocyte infusions followed by a&#xD;
      phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive daratumumab intravenously once a week for 8 weeks and donor lymphocyte&#xD;
      infusion in weeks 3 or 4 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Participants found to be in complete response (CR) at the end of 8 weeks may receive&#xD;
      daratumumab IV once every 2 weeks for 8 weeks, and then once monthly for 6 months in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 1 year.&#xD;
