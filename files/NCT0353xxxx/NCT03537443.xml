  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency in childhood leads to poor bone growth and muscle weakness, yet it is&#xD;
      unknown if the amount of vitamin D a woman consumes during her pregnancy affects her child's&#xD;
      bone and muscle development. In collaboration with researchers in Bangladesh, the&#xD;
      investigators recently completed a study of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy in&#xD;
      which women were assigned to 1 of 5 groups containing vitamin D or placebo (no vitamin D).&#xD;
      The investigators now aim to conduct a follow-up study of a sample of 600 4 year old children&#xD;
      born to these mothers to test the possible effects of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy&#xD;
      on children's bones, their body composition and the strength of their muscles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D is a modifiable regulator of bone mineral metabolism and muscle function; yet&#xD;
      little is known about the role of in utero vitamin D exposure on bone mineral accrual and&#xD;
      muscle development in early childhood. Observational findings suggest associations between&#xD;
      prenatal vitamin D status and infant bone, lean and fat mass and muscle function, but data&#xD;
      from intervention trials is either unavailable or limited to early infancy. The investigators&#xD;
      of the proposed study have previously shown that prenatal vitamin D supplementation safely&#xD;
      improves maternal-fetal vitamin D status and perinatal calcium metabolism. Given the current&#xD;
      interest in the potential role of vitamin D in perinatal health, adequately powered and&#xD;
      well-designed randomized trials are required to investigate the effect of maternal vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation on offspring musculoskeletal health and body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recently conducted the Maternal Vitamin D for Infant Growth (MDIG) trial&#xD;
      (NCT01924013), a randomized placebo-controlled dose-ranging trial of vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation in pregnancy and lactation in Bangladesh, where severe vitamin D deficiency&#xD;
      is common. Women at 17-24 weeks' gestation were randomized to 1 of 5 dose groups comprising a&#xD;
      prenatal:postpartum regimen of placebo:placebo, 4200:0, 16800:0, 28000:0 or 28000:28000 IU&#xD;
      vitamin D3/week until 26 weeks postpartum. Enrolment (n=1300) was completed in September&#xD;
      2015, and all infants were delivered by February 2016. The MDIG trial was primarily designed&#xD;
      to determine the effect of maternal vitamin D on infant length at 12 months of age, with&#xD;
      follow-up continuing until infants reached 24 months of age (completed in March 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed observational follow-up study, the investigators will leverage the design and&#xD;
      infrastructure of the MDIG trial to investigate effects of vitamin D on early childhood bone&#xD;
      and muscle outcomes in a sample of MDIG participants at 4 years of age (target n=600 with 120&#xD;
      participants per maternal vitamin D treatment group; to allow for an expected attrition rate&#xD;
      of 15%, the required sample size will be inflated to 140 children per group, giving an&#xD;
      overall target sample size of 700 children).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to quantify the effects of prenatal vitamin D supplementation versus&#xD;
      placebo on offspring total-body-less head (TBLH) bone mineral content and density. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to examine the effect of vitamin D on TBLH lean and fat mass, and muscle&#xD;
      function. Bone, lean and fat mass will be measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry&#xD;
      (DXA). Muscle strength (handgrip test), anthropometry, dietary intake and vitamin D status&#xD;
      will also be assessed, in addition to biomarkers of bone turnover that may affect&#xD;
      musculoskeletal health in young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed follow-up study of a large randomized trial will contribute new evidence&#xD;
      regarding the effects of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on musculoskeletal health&#xD;
      in childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Owing to the large contribution of head BMC values to whole-body BMC, in addition to&#xD;
      difficulties in obtaining accurate head positioning without motion artifact in young&#xD;
      children, TBLH BMC will be considered as the primary outcome in the present study. While TBLH&#xD;
      BMC and TBLH areal BMD are closely related and complementary measures of bone mass, and both&#xD;
      will be examined in the main analyses, TBLH BMC will be considered as the primary outcome&#xD;
      measure. Whole-body measurements will be examined as secondary outcomes, in addition to BMC&#xD;
      and areal BMD measurements of the head alone. DXA-derived estimates of lean and fat mass will&#xD;
      also first be explored as TBLH measures, and later explored as whole-body measurements.&#xD;
      Primary analyses will be conducted without adjustment for covariates; however, adjustment for&#xD;
      concurrent body size, age or child sex will be explored in additional analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo versus high-dose prenatal vitamin D supplementation: To address the objectives with&#xD;
      maximum statistical efficiency, the 2 high-dose prenatal vitamin D groups will be combined&#xD;
      for a comparison of children of mothers who received 28000 IU/week of vitamin D prenatally&#xD;
      (with or without 28000 IU/week of vitamin D postpartum) versus those children whose mothers&#xD;
      received placebo prenatally. Differences will be expressed as mean differences with 95% CIs,&#xD;
      and tested for statistical significance using t-tests. In sub-group analyses, we will&#xD;
      stratify by baseline maternal vitamin D status (25(OH)D ≥ 30 nmol/L vs &lt; 30 nmol/L) or infant&#xD;
      sex (boys vs girls). A restricted analysis will also be completed, limited to term-born&#xD;
      infants only (≥37 weeks' gestation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-response effect of prenatal and postpartum vitamin D supplementation: For the&#xD;
      dose-response analysis including data from all treatment groups, we will regress each outcome&#xD;
      (as a continuous variable) on the assigned dose of vitamin D (as a categorical variable)&#xD;
      during the prenatal period (with the 2 high-dose prenatal vitamin D treatment groups&#xD;
      combined). In this way, mean differences of each prenatal supplementation group will be&#xD;
      compared to the placebo group, to test the effect of prental supplementation only. We will&#xD;
      also regress each outcome on the average weekly dose of vitamin D assigned as a continuous&#xD;
      variable during the prenatal period. Similar regression models will be conducted using more&#xD;
      precise estimates of the vitamin D dose received, based on manufacturer analysis of the&#xD;
      vitamin D composition of each batch of tablets provided and individual compliance with study&#xD;
      tablets. We will use linear regression splines to accommodate non-linear outcome-dose&#xD;
      relationships if warranted based on non-parametric visualization (e.g. LOWESS). To ensure&#xD;
      precision of the 95% CIs, and therefore ensure robust inferences, 95% CIs from the linear&#xD;
      regression models will be obtained using bootstrapping (with 1000 replications).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore potential effects of prenatal only versus prenatal plus postpartum vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation, a similar dose-response analysis will be conducted across all 5 treatment&#xD;
      groups (i.e., disaggregation of the 2 high-dose prenatal vitamin D groups), for which we will&#xD;
      regress each outcome (as a continuous variable) on the vitamin D treatment group assigned&#xD;
      during the prenatal and postpartum periods (as a categorical variable). Mean differences of&#xD;
      each supplementation group will therefore be compared to the placebo group. Estimates of the&#xD;
      95% CIs from all regression models will be obtained using bootstrapping (with 1000&#xD;
      replications).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further exploratory analyses of primary and secondary outcomes: Multivariable regression&#xD;
      models will enable adjustment for other potential determinants of bone mass, muscle function&#xD;
      and body composition including: baseline covariates that differed by treatment group (if&#xD;
      present) and thus may confound treatment effects; child characteristics at the time of&#xD;
      assessment (e.g. vitamin D status); maternal characteristics (e.g. education level) and&#xD;
      socioeconomic status of the household. We will include measures of height or weight (e.g.,&#xD;
      height-for-age Z-scores) as covariates to test their roles in mediating the effect of the&#xD;
      vitamin D intervention on bone mass or other outcomes (muscle strength, body composition).&#xD;
      Linear regression models will also be used to assess between-group differences in calcium&#xD;
      metabolism and bone turnover markers.&#xD;
