  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether creative writing in newly diagnosed&#xD;
      cancer patients and those with recent progression in their disease will have a positive&#xD;
      impact on their mental health. Using a randomized controlled trial approach, emotion&#xD;
      thermometers will be employed to evaluate participants' responses on a number of domains,&#xD;
      such as anxiety, depression, despair, and anger along with a series of survey questions to&#xD;
      monitor changes in depressive and anxiety symptoms. Open-ended survey questions will be used&#xD;
      to capture how a creative writing intervention impacts participants' experience of their&#xD;
      illness. Melissa Greene's Write from the Heart program focuses more on creative writing&#xD;
      rather than cancer focused topics. Patients in the intervention arm will complete -one and a&#xD;
      half hour group sessions every two weeks over the span of 3 months. Participants in the&#xD;
      active control arm will be provided a book (i.e., Writing Down Bones by Natalie Goldberg)&#xD;
      about creative writing and will be asked to do activities for 1.5 hrs every 2 weeks for a&#xD;
      period of 3 months.&#xD;

      Mental wellness before and after intervention in both arms. A validated Emotional Thermometer&#xD;
      Scales will be used to predict changes in parameters reflecting participants' mental health&#xD;
      pre- and post-intervention. Survey questions focused on symptoms of depression and anxiety&#xD;
      will be used to monitor for changes in mental wellness pre- and post-intervention.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomized within strata formed by cancer type in order to assure that these potentially important confounding variables are balanced across groups. Patients will be enrolled on a rolling basis over a three-month period, allowing patients in intervention arm to participate in 3 months workshops (workshops would be held once every 2 weeks). Patients in control arm will be provided a book (Writing Down Bones by Natalie Goldberg) about creative writing and will be asked to do activities for 1.5 hours every 2 weeks. After three months, control group participants can join creative writing workshops at their discretion for the remaining period for writing workshops. Both group members will receive follow up surveys twice a month for two months at the completion of the participant's three-month study period.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Mood scores before and after intervention (after completion of entire session this may vary as some patients may not be able to complete six sessions). A validated Emotional Thermometer Scales (ETS) will be used to predict changes pre and post-intervention. The validated ETS has five dimensions (distress, anxiety, depression,anger, need help), which are all continuous variables and range from 0 to 10 with 0 being no emotional symptoms and 10 extremely emotional. Individual scores will be analyzed as well as a sum of the five scores will be collected to represent average mood score.</description>

    <description>Severity of depression symptoms before and after intervention between two groups. The validated depression questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), will be used to predict changes. This questionnaire includes 9 questions, that describes individual symptoms of depression and asks individuals to asses how much each depression symptoms has bothered them in the last two weeks, from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). The total score is compiled to represent a final depression severity score, with higher scores indicating worse severity, at a maximum value of 27 points.</description>

This includes 7 questions describing symptoms of generalized anxiety, asking individual patients to rate how much those symptoms have bothered the individual in the past two weeks, from a score of 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). The total of the scores will be used to represent anxiety symptoms score, with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 21, with higher score representing increasing severity of anxiety.</description>

A total of the 8 scores is used as a final value for the SSS-8, with higher scores indicating worse Somatic Symptom severity.</description>

          <description>Self-reported somatic symptoms pre and post intervention in two groups. We will use the Somatic Symptom Scale - 8 (SSS-8) to quantify somatic symptom burden. The scale is composed of 8 questions with options to choose a score of 0 (not at all) - 4 (very much) to describe degree of distress caused by individual somatic symptoms. A total of the 8 scores is used as a final value for the SSS-8, with higher scores indicating worse Somatic Symptom severity</description>

The validated depression questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), will be used to predict changes. This questionnaire includes 9 questions, that describes individual symptoms of depression and asks individuals to asses how much each depression symptoms has bothered them in the last two weeks, from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). The total score is compiled to represent a final depression severity score, with higher scores indicating worse severity, at a maximum value of 27 points</description>

        <description>Mood scores before and after intervention (after completion of entire session this may vary as some patients may not be able to complete six sessions). A validated Emotional Thermometer Scales (ETS) will be used to predict changes pre and post-intervention. The validated ETS has five dimensions (distress, anxiety, depression,anger, need help), which are all continuous variables and range from 0 to 10 with 0 being no emotional symptoms and 10 extremely emotional. Individual scores will be analyzed as well as a sum of the five scores will be collected to represent average mood score.</description>

The total of the scores will be used to represent anxiety symptoms score, with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 21, with higher score representing increasing severity of anxiety.</description>

          <title>Self Reported Somatic Symptoms at Final</title>
          <description>Self-reported somatic symptoms pre and post intervention in two groups. We will use the Somatic Symptom Scale - 8 (SSS-8) to quantify somatic symptom burden. The scale is composed of 8 questions with options to choose a score of 0 (not at all) - 4 (very much) to describe degree of distress caused by individual somatic symptoms. A total of the 8 scores is used as a final value for the SSS-8, with higher scores indicating worse Somatic Symptom severity.</description>

        <title>Depression Symptoms at Final</title>
        <description>Severity of depression symptoms before and after intervention between two groups. The validated depression questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), will be used to predict changes. This questionnaire includes 9 questions, that describes individual symptoms of depression and asks individuals to asses how much each depression symptoms has bothered them in the last two weeks, from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). The total score is compiled to represent a final depression severity score, with higher scores indicating worse severity, at a maximum value of 27 points</description>
