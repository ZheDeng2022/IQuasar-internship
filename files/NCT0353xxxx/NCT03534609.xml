  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Genius system is substantially equivalent to the Infini device (K121481). The study is a&#xD;
      prospective, multi-site, non-randomized study of up to 30 treated subjects presenting for&#xD;
      treatment of mild to moderate lines, wrinkles, textural concerns, and/or skin laxity of the&#xD;
      neck.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At enrollment, standardized baseline/pretreatment 2D and 3D images will be obtained from each&#xD;
      subject. Study subjects will receive three neck treatments completed 30 days apart. Subjects&#xD;
      will be contacted via a phone call 3 days following each treatment to assess for adverse&#xD;
      events and expected treatment effects. Effectiveness assessments will occur prior to&#xD;
      Treatments #2 and #3, and a follow-up visit will be completed at 90 days following Treatment&#xD;
      #3. Each assessment visit will include efficacy, adverse events, and expected treatment&#xD;
      effects assessments, and post-treatment 2D and 3D digital images will be captured.&#xD;

    <time_frame>From baseline to 90 days following the last treatment</time_frame>
    <description>An assessment of paired pre- and post-treatment photographs will be conducted by blinded assessors evaluating for improvement in neck appearance from pre- to post-treatment. The assessors choose the photo they believe to be the post-treatment photo, i.e., Left photo or Right photo.</description>

    <description>Overall aesthetic improvement based on completion of the Clinician Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale, a 5-point scale (0-4) that rates global aesthetic improvement from the pre-treatment appearance with 4 being 'Very Much Improved' and 0 being 'Worse'. The scale will be administered based on a live assessment of the subject while referring to the subject's pre-treatment photographs, and based on a comparison of the subject's pre-treatment photographs to the Day 90 follow-up photographs.</description>
