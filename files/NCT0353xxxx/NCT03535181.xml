  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial aneurysm are frequent with a prevalence estimated over 2-5% in the general&#xD;
      population. These are focal dilatations occuring in the cerebral vessels. They usually remain&#xD;
      silent until complications occur. Complications associated with intracranial aneurysms&#xD;
      include mass effect on adjacent structures and rupture. Rupture is the most severe&#xD;
      complication with a mortality rate of 35-50% and a high rate of morbidity including long-term&#xD;
      disability. It incidence is estimated about 1% per year for aneurysm smaller than 1 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, preventative treatments have their own risk of complication and morbi-mortality rate&#xD;
      including stroke and hemorrhage. Actual guidelines for treatment planning are mainly designed&#xD;
      with the size, the location and the age of the patient. This is why working on the&#xD;
      identification of imaging markers of aneurysmal instability is relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic CTA (Computed Tomography Angiography) acquisition allow to study the variation of&#xD;
      metrics such as dome height, dome length, ostium width, ostium area, and volume during the&#xD;
      cardiac cycle. The goal of this study is to assess different aneurysmal metrics to determine&#xD;
      those which may vary the most during the cardiac cycle and to assess it as an imaging marker&#xD;
      of aneurysmal instability.&#xD;
