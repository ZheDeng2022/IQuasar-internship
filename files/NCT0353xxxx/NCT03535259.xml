  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm phase II clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of&#xD;
      concurrent sorafenib and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for advanced hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma with portal vein or hepatic vein tumor thrombosis or lymph node involved.&#xD;
      Eligibility patients will receive IMRT to hepatic primary tumor, vein tumor thrombosis, and&#xD;
      metastasis lymph node with concurrently sorafenib with a dose of 400mg twice daily.&#xD;
      Prescription of IMRT will be a conventional fraction dose of 2Gy to a total dose of 40 to&#xD;
      60Gy. Sorafenib will be maintained with a dose of 400mg twice daily after IMRT until disease&#xD;
      progression, or unacceptable adverse events. Six months of sorafenib maintenance is&#xD;
      recommended.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the clinical application of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) and&#xD;
      intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), radiotherapy (RT) has shown important role in the&#xD;
      treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Meta-analysis has demonstrated that&#xD;
      transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined RT was more therapeutically&#xD;
      beneficial than TACE alone. Especially for advanced disease with portal vein tumor thrombosis&#xD;
      (PVTT), or hepatic vein tumor thrombosis, or lymph node involved, RT was more effective than&#xD;
      other treatment methods. Previous studies had showed that RT could receive response rate of&#xD;
      50% to 60% for HCC with PVTT. But for those patients, high accidence of out RT field failure&#xD;
      of liver and distance metastasis was found. Effective systemic therapy was necessary to&#xD;
      advanced HCC. Based on two phase III trials, sorafenib was recommended as systemic therapy to&#xD;
      advanced HCC. But tumor response rate of sorafenib alone was only 2.3-3% by RICIST criteria.&#xD;
      More than half of patients was received survival benefit by maintaining in stable disease. It&#xD;
      is feasible to improve survival by combining IMRT and sorafenib for advanced HCC with portal&#xD;
      vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT), or hepatic vein tumor thrombosis, or lymph node involved. In&#xD;
      addition, it was demonstrated that sorafenib could potentiate irradiation in HCC cell lines&#xD;
      through inhibiting radiation-induced proliferation and DNA repair and promoting&#xD;
      radiation-induced apoptosis.&#xD;
