  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will use the double-blind balanced placebo design to examine differences&#xD;
      between expectancies versus the pharmacological effects of varenicline medication&#xD;
      administered for two weeks to cigarette smokers. The double-blind balanced placebo design&#xD;
      includes medication administration (active medication v. placebo) and medication information&#xD;
      (told truth v. deception) resulting in four groups of smokers: (1) told therapeutic dose (TD)&#xD;
      medication + received TD medication; (2) told TD medication + received placebo; (3) told low&#xD;
      dose (LD) medication+ received TD dose medication; (4) told LD medication + received placebo.&#xD;
      Ecological momentary assessments (EMA) in the form of Daily Dairies delivered via smartphone&#xD;
      will assess real-time side effects, withdrawal symptoms, cigarettes smoked, medication use,&#xD;
      and reasons for medication non-adherence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current proposal will utilize the double-blind balanced placebo design to differentiate&#xD;
      expectancies versus pharmacologic mechanisms of varenicline administered to varenicline naïve&#xD;
      smokers seeking treatment (N = 80) for two-weeks. Race block randomization (controlling for&#xD;
      baseline expectancies) will be used to randomize participants. The double-blind balanced&#xD;
      placebo design includes a cross-balanced medication administration (active medication v.&#xD;
      placebo) and instructional set (told truth v. deception) resulting in four groups of smokers&#xD;
      seeking treatment (n = 20 for each): (1) told therapeutic dose (TD) medication + received TD&#xD;
      medication; (2) told TD medication + received placebo; (3) told low dose (LD) medication+&#xD;
      received TD dose medication; (4) told LD medication + received placebo. Participants will be&#xD;
      told they received low dose (rather than placebo) due to concerns that participants will not&#xD;
      take a medication that they believe to be a placebo. Ecological momentary assessments (EMA)&#xD;
      in the form of Daily Dairies delivered via smartphone will assess real-time side effects,&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms, cigarettes smoked, medication use, and reasons for medication&#xD;
      non-adherence. The current proposal will test the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Examine the main effects of instructional set and pharmacology. Hypothesis 1:&#xD;
      Main effects for TD instructional set and active medication administration will result in&#xD;
      reduced medication adherence compared with LD instructional set and placebo medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Examine the interaction between instructional set and pharmacology.&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: There will be a synergistic (i.e., non-additive) effect between instructional&#xD;
      set and pharmacology. Specifically, those assigned to the TD instructional set and active&#xD;
      medication group will result in a 50% discontinuation compared to a 20% discontinuation in&#xD;
      the TD instructional set and placebo medication group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim: Evaluate moderators of pharmacology and expectancy effects on medication&#xD;
      adherence. First, we will conduct exploratory examination of baseline medication expectancies&#xD;
      moderating the relationship between pharmacology and medication adherence. Second, we will&#xD;
      conduct an exploratory evaluation of potential moderators (e.g., gender and race) of&#xD;
      pharmacology and baseline medication expectancy.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 - 13</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported medication adherence measured through a single item assessing medication compliance. The item is answered as &quot;yes&quot; (scored as 1) or &quot;no&quot; (scored as 0). This measure combines all responses from Day 1 through Day 13 of this study to provide a total measure of medication adherence ranging from 0% (missed all doses) to 100% (took every dose as prescribed). Higher scores indicate better outcomes (i.e., better adherence to medication).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication Expectancies</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Medication expectancies will be measured through the Beliefs and Attitudes about Varenicline (BAV) scale which is a 6-item questionnaire adapted to assess varenicline expectancies. This measure is rated on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). The measure has a minimum score of 6 and a maximum score of 30. Higher scores indicating better outcomes (i.e., stronger positive beliefs about using varenicline).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Side Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>A 30-item self-report measure of the presence (or not) of symptoms commonly associated with varenicline side effects and nicotine withdrawal. Items are rated as &quot;No&quot; (scored as 0) or &quot;Yes&quot; (scored as 1). A total score was calculated to reflect the total number of reported side effects. This measure has a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 30. Higher scores indicate worse outcomes (i.e., greater frequency of experienced side effects).</description>

        <description>Self-reported medication adherence measured through a single item assessing medication compliance. The item is answered as &quot;yes&quot; (scored as 1) or &quot;no&quot; (scored as 0). This measure combines all responses from Day 1 through Day 13 of this study to provide a total measure of medication adherence ranging from 0% (missed all doses) to 100% (took every dose as prescribed). Higher scores indicate better outcomes (i.e., better adherence to medication).</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>(1) Reliance on self-report data, particularly for medication adherence, may have produced biased results with participants reporting higher adherence as an artifact of social desirability. (2) Although the primary outcome was to observe instances of nonadherence within the early initiation of varenicline, limiting the medication regimen to two weeks may have hindered observations in this study. (3) No information was collected related to the degree of severity for each reported side effect.</limitations_and_caveats>
