  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An injury to the spinal cord can be life altering: with a 'complete' injury, the affected&#xD;
      individual is unable to move their legs at all and may become wheelchair-bound. While a&#xD;
      'complete' injury suggests that the cord was completely severed, it is actually more common&#xD;
      for some connections in the spinal cord to remain after it is injured but, for some reason,&#xD;
      they are inactive or sleeping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical stimulation applied to the skin surface at the lower back appears to 'wake up'&#xD;
      these remaining connections, allowing some (previously unavailable) leg movements. The first&#xD;
      time they had this spinal stimulation (SS), people with long-standing 'complete' spinal cord&#xD;
      injuries became able to move their legs and, after several weeks of SS, these movements&#xD;
      seemed to increase. They also noticed other changes taking place, including improvements in&#xD;
      their bladder control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SS has been shown to cause strong leg extension movements, and one person with SCI stood up&#xD;
      with SS, using minimal support. SS for standing may assist people with SCI to carry out daily&#xD;
      tasks at home, which would hugely benefit the SCI community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will explore whether SS enables people with SCI to stand up and whether&#xD;
      regular sit-to-stand training combined with SS improves; i) standing ability; ii) bladder&#xD;
      control and; iii) well-being, in people with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten volunteers with SCI will carry out an 8-week sit-to-stand training programme. Training&#xD;
      will be carried out 3 times/week at Neurokinex using their Keiser Power Rack. The volunteers&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned either to the control (sit-to-stand only) or test (sit-to-stand&#xD;
      plus SS) group. Measurements will be taken before and after the training programme to assess&#xD;
      standing ability, bladder function, and well-being.&#xD;

      Recruitment and Initial Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from London Spinal Cord injuries Centre (LSCIC) at the Royal&#xD;
      National Orthopaedic Hospital (RNOH) and Neurokinex neurological rehabilitation centres where&#xD;
      the 8-week (24-session) training intervention will be carried out. The study will also be&#xD;
      advertised via relevant newsletters, bulletin boards, websites and mailing lists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First Appointment (Visit 1 - 1 session at RNOH):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will attend an initial session at the RNOH in Stanmore, lasting one to two&#xD;
      hours. Participants will be given the opportunity to ask questions about the study and&#xD;
      informed consent to participate in the study will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this, we will perform some simple tests to check muscle response to stimulation&#xD;
      without undue discomfort. Stimulating electrodes will be placed over the lower back and&#xD;
      recording electrodes will be placed on lower limb muscles. The BCMA will then be completed:&#xD;
      participants will be placed in the supine position and asked to perform a number of motor&#xD;
      tasks in response to verbal cues (e.g. bring knee to chest). Stimulation will then be&#xD;
      delivered in varying patterns (e.g. pulse width and frequency) and intensities (0mA to 100mA)&#xD;
      and responses will be recorded from lower limb muscles. From this, optimal electrode&#xD;
      position, and threshold level to stimulation will be defined. Trains of stimulation will then&#xD;
      be applied at a range of frequencies (1-100Hz) and intensities 0mA to 100mA (or the highest&#xD;
      intensity tolerated by the participant, whichever is lower). This will provide information on&#xD;
      the pre-intervention ability of the participant. At the end of this session we will arrange&#xD;
      with the participant a date for the next baseline session at the Neurokinex location most&#xD;
      convenient for the participant to travel too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored intermittently during all stimulation&#xD;
      procedures with a blood pressure monitor. This will be taken before beginning to record a&#xD;
      baseline response and any significant rise in systolic and diastolic blood pressure greater&#xD;
      than 20 mmHg systolic or 10 mmHg diastolic above baseline is an indication of autonomic&#xD;
      dysreflexia (AD). If an event of AD occurs we will temporarily remove the stimulation until&#xD;
      blood pressure returns to baseline. If this effect continues to occur this participant will&#xD;
      be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Session (Visit 2 - 1 session at Neurokinex):&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the baseline session, we will record measures of participant's ability to perform&#xD;
      sit-to-stand onto force plates both with stimulation and without stimulation. Again, adhesive&#xD;
      electrodes will be placed over the lower back and lower limb muscles and a small device&#xD;
      called a goniometer will be positioned across the knee joint to measure its position. SS&#xD;
      parameters (intensity, frequency) will be defined based on the results of the first&#xD;
      appointment. Participants will then perform sit-to-stand with and without stimulation. This&#xD;
      will be performed using the Keiser Power Rack: a device that assists transferring in the&#xD;
      sit-to-stand manoeuvre by partially supporting your bodyweight. During the SS testing,&#xD;
      stimulation will be delivered during each transition from the seated position to standing,&#xD;
      maintained during standing for approximately 4-5 minutes (with intensity reduced if required&#xD;
      for comfort) and switched off during sit-down for approximately 2-3 minutes. Training will&#xD;
      last for 45 mins (including application of harness &amp; electrodes 1 hour). A neurological&#xD;
      assessment using the ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) will also be performed and participants will&#xD;
      be asked to complete questionnaires/forms to assess your well-being, independence and bladder&#xD;
      function following the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optionally, the patient's recent clinical urodynamics results will be obtained from RNOH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training (Visits 3-26; 24 sessions (3days/week) at Neurokinex):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be purposively assigned to either the control (sit-to-stand training; n=5)&#xD;
      or test (sit-to-stand training with spinal stimulation; n=5) group, based on the results of&#xD;
      the baseline neurological assessment performed at the baseline session (ASIA; Appendix 11).&#xD;
      An 8-week (24-session) training intervention will be carried out at Neurokinex (participants&#xD;
      enrolled site) (http://www.neurokinex.org/). Each participant will be required to attend&#xD;
      Neurokinex for training 3 times per week for 8 weeks; each session will last approximately&#xD;
      one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each session:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive 40 minutes of sit-to-stand training using the Keiser Power&#xD;
           Rack. With the amount of body weight assistance set to provide minimal assistance, and&#xD;
           will be adjusted as necessary throughout training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nintendo Wii Balance Boards will also be positioned under each foot to measure loading&#xD;
           during stance and two load cells will read the amount of force offset by the grip bar&#xD;
           whilst transferring/standing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Five sit-to-stands will be completed in each session, as follows: transfer from&#xD;
           sit-to-stand, 4-5 mins standing, transfer from stand to sit-down, 2-3 mins rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test group will additionally receive SS during training. SS parameters (intensity,&#xD;
      frequency) will be defined based on the results of the first appointment (see above), and&#xD;
      will be modified during training as required. SS will be delivered during each transition&#xD;
      from the seated position to standing, maintained during standing (with intensity reduced if&#xD;
      required for comfort) and switched off during sit-down.&#xD;
