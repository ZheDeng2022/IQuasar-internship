  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is assessing a new drug, duvelisib, in combination with a drug that is&#xD;
      already FDA approved, venetoclax, as a possible treatment for participants with CLL or those&#xD;
      with Richter's Syndrome&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an&#xD;
      investigational drugs and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational&#xD;
      drugs to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drugs are being studied&#xD;
      together for the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase I study tests the safety of the drug duvelisib when used in combination with the&#xD;
      drug venetoclax. Duvelisib is still being studied, but the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration) has approved the use of Duvelisib in patients with CLL/SLL with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory CLL after having received 2 or more prior therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duvelisib is a drug that is given in capsule form and taken by mouth. This drug is designed&#xD;
      to stop cancer growth by blocking a protein called phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K),&#xD;
      which is important for the survival of CLL cells. In laboratory studies and in other clinical&#xD;
      trials that included participants with CLL, duvelisib was effective at killing CLL cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venetoclax is a tablet that is taken by mouth. Venetoclax targets a protein called BCL-2,&#xD;
      which helps cancer cells survive. Venetoclax is an effective treatment for many participants&#xD;
      with CLL who do not respond to chemotherapy or other approved drugs or who have relapsed&#xD;
      after prior therapy.Venetoclax is FDA approved for participants with CLL who have never had&#xD;
      therapy before or whose CLL has worsened after prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase I portion of this study, the investigators are looking to determine the dose of&#xD;
      venetoclax that is safe to give with duvelisib and to see what the side effects are of this&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase II portion of this study, we are looking to determine how effective&#xD;
      thecombination of duvelisib and venetoclax is for patients with CLL or Richter's Syndrome&#xD;
