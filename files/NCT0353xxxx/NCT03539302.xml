      The study consists of 3 parts (Part A, Part B and Part C). Part A was an open-label,&#xD;
      randomized, multi center design to evaluate the feasibility of administration of inhaled&#xD;
      flecainide in two dosing regimens. Part B was an open-label, multicenter design to confirm&#xD;
      the safety (including tolerability) and efficacy of the optimal inhaled flecainide dose&#xD;
      determined from Part A. Part C is currently ongoing and is an open-label, multi center study&#xD;
      with exploratory objectives to explore the feasibility of patient-led self administration of&#xD;
      flecainide. Part C also includes an exploratory sub-study to assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      implementing a portable cardiac ultrasound (HHE) at screening in an emergent setting.&#xD;

      Subjects eligible to participate in the study must provide written informed consent (IC)&#xD;
      before randomization or any study- specific procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 3 parts (Part A, Part B and Part C) as described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: was completed in March 2020 and was an open-label, randomized, multicenter design to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility of administration of inhaled flecainide in two dosing regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are randomized at a 1:1 ratio to a single (N = 10) or repeat (N = 10) dose regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the 60 mg dose cohort and review of safety/tolerability and PK data,&#xD;
      additional subjects were enrolled in an additional repeat dose regimen (90 mg eTLD, N= up to&#xD;
      30 subjects. An additional dose cohort of 120 mg was added to Part A which utilized a&#xD;
      different concentration of flecainide (75 mg/mL) and formulation (FlecIH-103). The final dose&#xD;
      of 120 mg was selected as the dose to continue evaluating in Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: was an open-label, multicenter design to confirm the safety (including tolerability)&#xD;
      and efficacy of the optimal inhaled flecainide dose determined from Part A (120 mg, using the&#xD;
      FlecIH-103 inhalation solution).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization, for the initial 20 patients in Part A was stratified by duration of the&#xD;
      presenting AF episode (≥ 1 h up to ≤ 24 hours; &gt; 24h up to ≤ 48h).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C: is an open-label, multi center design study with exploratory objectives to explore&#xD;
      the feasibility of patient-led self administration of flecainide. Part C also includes an&#xD;
      exploratory sub-study to assess the feasibility of implementing a portable cardiac ultrasound&#xD;
      (HHE) at screening in an emergent setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once study regimen is allocated, the subject will self-administer the study treatment and&#xD;
      inhalation regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at 90 minutes after initiation of dosing, no conversion to SR is observed, the&#xD;
      Investigator may offer the subject another appropriate therapy. Discharge is left up to the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating physician but no less than 90 min after initiation of dosing.&#xD;
      Heart rhythm will be confirmed with an Event Recorder during follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible for monitoring safety&#xD;
      during the study.&#xD;

          -  are prescribed a pill-in-the-pocket regimen (flecainide or propafenone) for paroxysmal&#xD;
             AF, or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are within 3 months of having undergone ablation of paroxysmal AF, or&#xD;

             episode of recent-onset paroxysmal AF may consent to pre-study screening prior to&#xD;
             presenting with recent-onset symptomatic AF. These subjects will be eligible to&#xD;
             receive study drug only when presenting with symptomatic paroxysmal AF of recent-onset&#xD;
             (i.e., ≤ 48 hours), consenting to the full study, and after meeting all eligibility&#xD;
             criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             suggestive of acute myocardial infarction), symptoms (e.g., angina pectoris, atypical&#xD;
             angina pectoris), and/or being medicated with anti-anginal medication. In addition,&#xD;
             subjects with signs of prior myocardial infarction (such as pathological Q waves) who&#xD;
             are also taking concomitant medications for angina pectoris should be evaluated for&#xD;

             suggestive of sinus node dysfunction, and/or (iii) prior electrical or pharmacological&#xD;
             cardioversion associated with prolonged sinus or ventricular pause (e.g., &gt;3 seconds)&#xD;
             and/or slow ventricular rhythm (e.g., &lt;45 bpm) at time of conversion Note: Sinus node&#xD;
             dysfunction in AF is more prevalent in subjects &gt;75 years old. d) Brugada Syndrome e)&#xD;
