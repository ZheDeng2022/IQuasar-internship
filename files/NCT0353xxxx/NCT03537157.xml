  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's Disease (CD) is a chronic pathology characterized by exacerbations and remissions.&#xD;
      Recurrent inflammation can cause bowel strictures, fistulae (often perianal) or abscesses. CD&#xD;
      often requires intestinal resection. Surgery in CD is not curative, Therefore, endoscopic&#xD;
      follow-up 6-12 months after surgery is recommended. Given the association between enteric&#xD;
      bacteria and postoperative CD recurrence, antibacterial agents were shown to be effective in&#xD;
      reducing the severity of endoscopic recurrence, but prolonged administration causes&#xD;
      significant toxicity. The efficacy of &quot;systemic antibiotics&quot; and the experimental evidence of&#xD;
      the central role of luminal flora as an essential factor in the development of post chirurgic&#xD;
      CD recurrence provide the rationale for evaluating a locally acting antibiotic like&#xD;
      Rifaximin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, relapsing, remitting, systemic disease, which may result&#xD;
      in transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. The precise aetiology is unknown:&#xD;
      it is a lifelong disease arising from an interaction between genetic and environmental&#xD;
      factors, but predominantly observed in developed countries of the world. CD can affect the&#xD;
      entire digestive tract from the mouth to the anus, but the most commonly affected sites are&#xD;
      the ileum and the ascending colon . The clinical course of CD is characterized by&#xD;
      exacerbations and remissions. Therefore, recurrent inflammation can cause bowel strictures,&#xD;
      fistulae (often perianal) or abscesses. Moreover, Crohn's disease (CD) often requires&#xD;
      intestinal resection, despite treatment with immunosuppressive and biologic therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery in CD is not curative, and post-operative recurrence (POR) is a frequent event.&#xD;
      Historically, up to 70% of patients who undergo CD-related resection develop postoperative&#xD;
      endoscopic recurrence at or proximal to the surgical anastomosis within 1 year and&#xD;
      approximately one-third of patients with CD, who have a first resection, require a second&#xD;
      within 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic lesions usually precede and correlate with future clinical recurrence (about&#xD;
      20-25% per year), and predict the development of Crohn's disease-related complications and&#xD;
      the need for re-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, endoscopic follow-up 6-12 months after surgery is recommended. Given the&#xD;
      association between enteric bacteria and postoperative CD recurrence, antibacterial agents&#xD;
      directed against anaerobic bacteria (ornidazole and metronidazole) were shown to be effective&#xD;
      in reducing the severity of endoscopic recurrence, but prolonged administration (more than 3&#xD;
      months) of these antibiotics causes significant toxicity, mainly neuropathy and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal intolerance. The efficacy of &quot;systemic antibiotics&quot; and the experimental&#xD;
      evidence of the central role of luminal flora as an essential factor in the development of&#xD;
      post chirurgic CD recurrence provide the rationale for evaluating a locally acting antibiotic&#xD;
      like Rifaximin in this condition.&#xD;

    The decision to prematurely close the trial recruitment period was taken due to the&#xD;
    difficulties in the recruitment of patients. This decision has not been triggered by any&#xD;
