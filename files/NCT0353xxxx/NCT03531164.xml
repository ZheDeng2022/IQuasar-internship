    <textblock>
      One of the main objectives in spinal cord injury rehabilitation programs is the improvement&#xD;
      of trunk control in order to achieve independence, to prevent complications and, in specific&#xD;
      cases to walk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question: What is the effect of kayak ergometer training in trunk control,&#xD;
      cardiovascular condition and independence in individuals with a spinal cord injury? Purpose:&#xD;
      To determine the effect of kayak ergometer training in trunk control, cardiovascular&#xD;
      condition and independence in individuals with a spinal cord injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Randomized clinical trial, blinded to evaluator and to the person that will analyze&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Spinal cord injured individuals treated at the National Institute of&#xD;
      Rehabilitation, with a spinal cord injury of any ethiology, with a neurologic level of C8 and&#xD;
      below, with time since injury from three months to one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proceeding: The subjects will be randomly assigned to : a control group with neuro&#xD;
      propioceptive facilitation exercises focused in trunk control or an experimental group with&#xD;
      kayak ergometer training. Both groups will recieve 5 sessions a week during 6 weeks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is an alteration of the spinal cord that modifies not only muscular&#xD;
      strength and sensitivity, but that also generates a change in all of the systems of the&#xD;
      organism. At the worldwide level, an incidence is calculated of between 13.1 and 52.2 per one&#xD;
      million inhabitants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Damage to the ascending and descending tracts of the spinal cord consequently gives rise to&#xD;
      an alteration in the postural control system. It is known that effective postural control is&#xD;
      of utmost importance forstanding and walking, as well as for providing support for voluntary&#xD;
      movements. Alterations in posture depend on the grade and level of the injury; thus, persons&#xD;
      with complete, thoracic, or cervical lesions have poor trunk control. Due to the latter, they&#xD;
      are limited in many of the movements necessary for carrying out daily life activities (DALYS)&#xD;
      Therefore, part of the objectives of rehabilitation in individuals with an SCI comprises&#xD;
      improvement in trunk control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, patients with SCI tend to engage in a sedentary lifestyle that, added to&#xD;
      the alterations in the autonomic nervous system proper to the lesion, exposes individuals&#xD;
      with a SCI to a greater risk of developing chronic-degenerative conditions, such as metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome and cardiovascular diseases, which are, at present, the main cause of death in these&#xD;
      persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, after the immediate rehabilitation, it is necessary to maintain and improve the&#xD;
      functional capacity obtained during this process. Therefore, it is important to find training&#xD;
      activities to challenge stabilization of the upper part of the body and sitting equilibrium&#xD;
      without giving rise to symptoms caused by overuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kayak training appears to comply with these criteria, in that it implicates the greater part&#xD;
      of the upper musculature, presents high metabolic demands, and imposes strict requirements&#xD;
      for the balance control system, due to continuous compensation of the disturbances of the&#xD;
      upper part of the body caused by movement on the apparatus. It was previously demonstrated&#xD;
      that open-sea training in kayaks could be implemented in a group of individuals in paraplegic&#xD;
      condition and that this is accompanied by improvements in strength and equilibrium in&#xD;
      sedestatIon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the difficulty in controlling and adjusting the time and challenge level of the&#xD;
      equilibrium experienced by participants at sub-acute stages, it is necessary to utilize a&#xD;
      kayak ergometer, in such a way that the demand for equilibrium can be adjusted individually&#xD;
      and for this to increase progressively as the treatment advances. In this respect, Bjerkefors&#xD;
      and Thorstensson demonstrated that kayak ergometer training in a group of persons with SCI is&#xD;
      accompanied by improvement in shoulder muscular strength and in various functional wheelchair&#xD;
      tests that demand trunk stabilization and balance control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies achieved demonstrating the positive effect of kayak training in patients with&#xD;
      SCI; however, in these studies, small populations were included (10 and 12 individuals), with&#xD;
      chronic-stage lesions, and the effects on trunk control were not evaluated by means of a&#xD;
      validated scale in this population, nor were the training's effects on cardiovascular&#xD;
      function and functional independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the effect of kayak ergometer training has not, to our knowledge, been studied in&#xD;
      individuals with SCI in terms of trunk control with tools validated for persons with SCI,&#xD;
      regarding the cardiovascular condition, functional independence, and quality of life, thus&#xD;
      engendering the need to conduct this present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kayak ergometer training will improve functional independence, trunk control, and&#xD;
      cardiovascular condition in individuals with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of training with the kayak ergometer on functional independence, trunk control,&#xD;
      and the cardiovascular condition in individuals with SCI will be greater than that of&#xD;
      conventional trunk-control training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GENERAL OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of kayak ergometer training in patients with SCI in functionality,&#xD;
      trunk control, cardiovascular condition, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish the validity, reliability, error, and sensitivity of the measurement&#xD;
           instrumented of trunk control in subjects with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the existence of floor/ceiling effects in the instrumented assessment of trunk&#xD;
           control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop computerized tools for evaluation of trunk control that are easily applicable in&#xD;
           daily clinical practice, with low-cost, practical, and simple technology for improving&#xD;
           the exactness and reliability of the observational analysis, for rehabilitation centers&#xD;
           that are not equipped with a movement-analysis laboratory, with sufficient information&#xD;
           for evaluating the trunk control of the individual with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proposal of a pilot program of trunk control rehabilitation in persons with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Broadcast preliminary results at a national scientific meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Form human resources with knowledge of neurological rehabilitation, movement analysis,&#xD;
           and biomedical engineering.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Foster multidisciplinary cooperation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study type. Randomized controlled clinical trial blinded to the evaluator and to the person&#xD;
      performing the data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the work universe. Patients of out-patient consultations and hospitalization&#xD;
      of the SCI Service of the National Institute of Rehabilitation), with a diagnosis of SCI of&#xD;
      any etiology, with a neurological level of under C8, with a SCI of 3 months of evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of the control group Group A. Control group, management with conventional therapy&#xD;
      for improvement of trunk control (proprioceptive neurofacilitation exercises focused on trunk&#xD;
      control21) of 20 minutes five times weekly during 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size We utilized the Epidat ver. 4 statistical software program to calculate sample&#xD;
      size. For 80% study power and an alpha error probability of less than 0.05, and considering&#xD;
      the work of Grigorenko and collaborators18 we found a frontal displacement speed difference&#xD;
      of the Center of Pressure (CoP) of 0.1m/s with a Standard Deviation (SD) of 0.05 m/s between&#xD;
      the experimental and the control group. Therefore, seven patients per group were required.&#xD;
      Considering a possible loss of 20%, we will recruit nine patients per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the study variables, units of measure, and measuring scales&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and demographic variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SCI severity: According to American Spinal Injury Association, with International&#xD;
           standards for neurological classification of spinal cord injury modifications: complete,&#xD;
           B: incomplete, preservation of only the sensitive function, C: incomplete, voluntary&#xD;
           anal contraction or more than half of key muscles in &lt;3, D: incomplete, more than half&#xD;
           of the key muscles in &gt;3, E: total recuperation A, B, C, D, E&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological level: More caudal segment of the SC with normal function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of evolution of the SCI:Time in days elapsed from when the SCI was produced until&#xD;
           time of application of the questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age:Years elapsed from date of birth to time of questionnaire application&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will utilize the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences ver. 17&#xD;
      statistical software program. The investigators will perform descriptive statistics with&#xD;
      central-tendency measurements for quantitative variables and with proportions for qualitative&#xD;
      variables. To determine differences between groups, analysis of covariance will be carried&#xD;
      out. Results that are statistically significant with a p of &lt;0.05 will be considered.&#xD;
