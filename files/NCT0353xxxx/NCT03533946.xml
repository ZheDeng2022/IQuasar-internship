        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hormone-sensitive, histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate with BRCAness&#xD;
             (defined as an alteration in one or more of the following genes: BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2,&#xD;
             BRIP1, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCA, NBN, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D, RAD51, RAD51B) from&#xD;
             soft-tissue based genomic testing or liquid biopsy based genomic or genetic testing.&#xD;
             Pathogenic or likely pathogenic alterations are accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG/Zubrod score of 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At a minimum, subjects must have received definitive local therapy with curative&#xD;
             intent (i.e., prostatectomy, and/or radiation therapy) with or without systemic&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Testosterone level is &gt; 50 ng/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be at least 18 years old at the time the informed consent form is signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in the table in the protocol, all&#xD;
             screening labs should be performed within 28 days of treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Highly effective barrier methods must be used with all sexual activity and&#xD;
             contraception methods must be practiced for all subjects throughout the study and for&#xD;
             at least 6 months after last rucaparib treatment administration if the risk of&#xD;
             conception exists (section 7.2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recovery to baseline or Grade â‰¤ 1 CTCAE v5.0 from toxicities related to any prior&#xD;
             treatments within the context of their definitive local therapy for their prostate&#xD;
             cancer, unless AE(s) are clinically nonsignificant and/or stable on supportive&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is able to provide informed consent and willing to sign an approved consent&#xD;
             form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must have confirmed PSA progression based on at least two time points taken at&#xD;
             least one week apart to confirm rising trend.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with metastases defined by conventional scans (CT, MRI, NM Bone Scan).&#xD;
             Disease identified on molecular imaging (e.g. fluciclovine-PET) is not exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Arterial or venous thrombi (including cerebrovascular accident), myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, admission for unstable angina, cardiac angioplasty, or stenting within the&#xD;
             last 90 days prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-existing duodenal stent, recent (within &lt; 3 months) or existing bowel obstruction,&#xD;
             and/or any gastrointestinal disorder or defect that would, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, interfere with absorption of rucaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to swallow tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant bleeding disorder per the determination&#xD;
             of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior systemic therapy within the past 30 days prior to Day 1 (or 5 half-lives of the&#xD;
             drug, whichever is shorter).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of another malignancy within 2 years before first dose of study treatment&#xD;
             only if the cancer will either interfere with patient safety or interfere with the&#xD;
             primary endpoint, per the judgement of the Principal Investigator. Patients, who have&#xD;
             been diagnosed with, superficial skin cancers, or localized, low grade tumors deemed&#xD;
             cured or with a prolonged natural history (e.g estimated overall survival &gt; 5 years)&#xD;
             may be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with any PARP inhibitor, mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, or any&#xD;
             platinum based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease at the time of&#xD;
             enrollment: congestive heart failure (&gt; New York Heart Association Classification&#xD;
             Class II), or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including cardiovascular, endocrine,&#xD;
             neurologic, pulmonary or psychiatric conditions including recent (within the past&#xD;
             year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior; or laboratory abnormalities that may&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with study participation or study treatment&#xD;
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery (eg, GI surgery, removal or biopsy of brain metastasis) within 8 weeks&#xD;
             before first dose of study treatment. Complete wound healing from major surgery must&#xD;
             have occurred 1 month before first dose and from minor surgery (eg, simple excision,&#xD;
             tooth extraction) at least 28 days before first dose. Subjects with clinically&#xD;
             relevant ongoing complications from prior surgery are not eligible.&#xD;
