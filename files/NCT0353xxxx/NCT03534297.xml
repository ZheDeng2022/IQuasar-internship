  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b randomized, double-blinded, single-center safety and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      study of sequential cohort, dose-escalating, repeat-dosing of dapansutrile or placebo (4:1&#xD;
      ratio) in subjects with stable systolic heart failure (HF) with LVEF≤40% symptomatic for NYHA&#xD;
      functional classification II-III who show signs of systemic inflammation (high sensitivity&#xD;
      plasma C reactive protein [hsCRP] &gt; 2 mg/L). A total of 30 subjects will be enrolled in 3&#xD;
      sequential cohorts by randomized allocation (8 active and 2 placebo within each cohort).&#xD;
      Progression to cohort 2 with dose escalation will occur following the Day 28 visit of the&#xD;
      last subject in the first cohort. Progression to cohort 3 with dose escalation will occur&#xD;
      following the Day 8 visit of the last subject in the second cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened and evaluated twice for eligibility: 1) at the time of Screening&#xD;
      (up to 28 days prior to enrollment); and 2) at the Baseline visit, prior to randomization.&#xD;
      Following enrollment, Baseline assessments will be conducted and the first dose of&#xD;
      investigational product (either dapansutrile capsules or placebo capsules) will be&#xD;
      administered at the clinical site upon completion of all assessment and collection of&#xD;
      baseline parameters. Subjects will then self-administer investigational product once, twice&#xD;
      or four times daily, depending on cohort, for up to fourteen (14) consecutive days beginning&#xD;
      at the Baseline visit and continuing through the planned Day 14 visit. Subjects will return&#xD;
      to the study clinic on Days 4, 8, 14 and 28 for follow-up visits. Additionally, subjects will&#xD;
      be contacted for telephone follow-up on Day 42.&#xD;
