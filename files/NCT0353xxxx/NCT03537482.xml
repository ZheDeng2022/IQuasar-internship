  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, single-agent, open-label, Phase I study of APG-2575. The study&#xD;
      consists of the dose escalation stage and the dose expansion stage.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      APG-2575 will be administered orally, once daily for consecutive 4 weeks as one cycles.&#xD;
      Initially, the start dose is 20mg. Single patient cohorts will be evaluated, the dose of&#xD;
      APG-2575 will be increased in subsequent cohorts, to 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, 600mg and&#xD;
      800mg accordingly. If there is any one of the following event is observed, a DLT, two drug&#xD;
      related Grade 2 toxicities or one drug related ≥ Grade 3 toxicity, or laboratory or clinical&#xD;
      TLS, or suspected hypersensitivity reaction occur in Cycle 1, or dose level of 400 mg is&#xD;
      reached, the dose escalation will convert to the standard 3+3 design, If ≥ 2/6 patients&#xD;
      develop DLT at any dose level dose escalation will cease and the dose level immediately below&#xD;
      will be expanded to 6 patients. If ≤ 1/6 patients develop a DLT at the highest dose reached&#xD;
      this will be declared the MTD. After the MTD is defined, a maximum of 20 patients will be&#xD;
      treated at that dose level.&#xD;
