    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dosing frequency of gemtuzumab&#xD;
      ozogamicin when given in combination with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF),&#xD;
      cladribine, cytarabine and mitoxantrone (GCLAM) and to see how well they work in treating&#xD;
      participants with acute myeloid leukemia or high-grade myeloid tumors (neoplasms) that have&#xD;
      not been previously treated. Antibody-drug conjugates, such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin, act by&#xD;
      directly delivering toxic chemotherapy to cancer cells. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor&#xD;
      is a growth factor used to stimulate leukemia cells and render them more sensitive to&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cladribine, cytarabine and&#xD;
      mitoxantrone, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving gemtuzumab&#xD;
      ozogamicin in combination with G-CSF, cladribine, cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride&#xD;
      may work better in treating participants with acute myeloid leukemia or high-grade myeloid&#xD;
      neoplasm.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) when added to&#xD;
      GCLAM in patients with newly-diagnosed AML requiring induction chemotherapy. (Phase I) II. To&#xD;
      evaluate the 6-month and 1-year event-free survival (EFS) rate with GO + GCLAM treated at the&#xD;
      MTD. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Describe, within the limits of a phase 1/2 study, the toxicity profile of the study&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Compare, within the limits of a phase 1/2 study, measurable residual disease (MRD) rates&#xD;
      with GO + GCLAM at the MTD to patients treated previously with GCLAM alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Estimate, within the limits of a phase 1/2 study, the relationship between MRD status&#xD;
      after induction therapy and relapse risk/time to relapse as well as relapse-free and overall&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Compare, within the limits of a phase 1/2 study, complete remission rates with GO + GCLAM&#xD;
      at the MTD to patients treated previously with GCLAM alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Compare, within the limits of a phase 1/2 study, overall survival rates with GO + GCLAM at&#xD;
      the MTD to patients treated previously with GCLAM alone VI. Evaluate, within the limits of a&#xD;
      phase 1/2 study, the impact of GO dosing regimens on the duration of cytopenias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Collect biological specimens for use for the future laboratory investigation of&#xD;
      biomarkers for response to GO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose escalation study of gemtuzumab ozogamicin followed by a phase&#xD;
      II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION THERAPY: Participants receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin intravenously (IV) either as a&#xD;
      single dose on day 1, or as three doses on days 1, 4, and 7. Participants also receive G-CSF&#xD;
      subcutaneously (SC) on days 0-5, cladribine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5, cytarabine IV over 2&#xD;
      hours on days 1-5, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV on days 1-3. Patients who do not achieve&#xD;
      a CR or CRi following the first cycle of induction are eligible for a second cycle, which is&#xD;
      given without gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Participants with a complete remission (CR) or complete&#xD;
      remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi) may then proceed to Post-Remission Therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POST-REMISSION THERAPY: Participants receive G-CSF, cladribine, and cytarabine as in&#xD;
      Induction Therapy during cycle 1, and cytarabine IV every 12 hours on days 1-6 of cycles 2-3.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every month for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months for 5 years.&#xD;

    <measure>Event-free survival (EFS) rate (Phase 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of study treatment, assessed at 6 months and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A two-stage design will be used to evaluate the EFS. Patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) from the phase 1 portion of the trial will be used in the phase 2 analysis. If censoring occurs, secondary analyses analyzing 6-month or 1-year EFS accounting for censoring will be done, including estimating 6-month or 1-year EFS using the Kaplan-Meier method. The first stage of the two-stage phase 2 design will evaluate 30 patients. If 20 or more of the first 30 patients are alive without event at 6-months after study registration, an additional 30 patients will be enrolled. If 46 or more of the 60 patients treated at the MTD are alive and without event at 6-months after study registration, the study will consider the regimen of interest for further investigation.</description>
