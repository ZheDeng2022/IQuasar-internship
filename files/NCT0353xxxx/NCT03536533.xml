  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a close interplay of sensory and motor functions, the brain constantly evaluates intrinsic&#xD;
      and extrinsic movements, creating an inner - always subjective - representation of the&#xD;
      stability. If there is an acute or chronic imbalance (&quot;mismatch&quot;), a multisensory&#xD;
      misperception can occur. This is perceived subjectively as dizziness. Dizziness is the third&#xD;
      most common neurological cause of an emergency with 11-13% after headache and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central vestibular system is often involved in dizziness. The organ is part of the inner&#xD;
      ear and is located in the petrous bone. It consist of macula organs, which are responsible&#xD;
      for the detection of linear accelerations, and semicircular canals, which perceive the head&#xD;
      velocity. Furthermore, the central vestibular system provides ocular muscles and the spinal&#xD;
      cord with output, in order to control three reflexes. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is&#xD;
      responsible for a clear vision while the head is rotating, whereas the vestibulo-collic&#xD;
      reflex (VCR) innervates the neck musculature in order to fix the head. The purpose of the&#xD;
      vestibulo-spinal reflex (VSR) is the stabilization of the body by compensatory movements. In&#xD;
      terms of restoring vestibular functioning, compensation can be classified into adaptation,&#xD;
      substitution and habituation. Adaptation enhances the VOR, which is equivalent to&#xD;
      restoration. Substitution is distinguished in literature between sensory and behavioral, in&#xD;
      which the sensorial substitution transfers the importance given to proprioceptive and visual&#xD;
      inputs and the behavioral substitution refers to avoidance strategies e.g. immobilization,&#xD;
      increased blink reflex and prevention of head rotations. Habituation on the other hand,&#xD;
      accustoms the affected person to a conflicting situation, in order that the response of the&#xD;
      VOR is avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, it is known that previous conventional vestibular rehabilitation is effective for&#xD;
      age-related vestibular loss. By improving vestibular function, the vestibular rehabilitation&#xD;
      therapy aims to improve balance and neuromuscular coordination, minimize falls and decrease&#xD;
      the feeling of dizziness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, new advances in technology have been made which generate additional methods for an&#xD;
      effective therapy; exercise and videogaming, in short, exergaming. Successful use of virtual&#xD;
      reality in rehabilitation of vestibular patients has previously been implemented. Further,&#xD;
      recent evidence has examined the effects of exergaming in healthy dwellers on vestibular&#xD;
      function. There was a significant reduction found in the dynamic visual acuity (DVA) after an&#xD;
      eight-session exergame training (in total 160 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the effects on vestibulo-ocular reflex of exergames in patients with chronic&#xD;
      peripheral vestibular hypofunction have not been systematically explored. Moreover, very&#xD;
      little is known about the effects of exergaming includes exercises requiring head turns on&#xD;
      vestibular function in this patients. Furthermore, exergaming could become a new tool to&#xD;
      improve DVA and dizziness and increase the training intensity without requiring many&#xD;
      therapists, which in turn reduces health costs. In addition, patients with dizziness are&#xD;
      severely affected by their disease. They will welcome new, efficient and motivating forms of&#xD;
      therapy.Finally, the main aim is to assess the effects of virtual reality-based intervention&#xD;
      with dividat &quot;senso&quot; on vestibular functions in patients with chronic peripheral unilateral&#xD;
      vestibular hypofunction.&#xD;

    <description>The Senso is a training system (dividat, Schindellegi, Switzerland) for improving physical and cognitive function was used as exergame. With foot pushes participants triggered on a pressure-sensitive plate. The Senso game was projected with a beamer at white wall. To promote head movement during training the direction of the beamer was vertical tilted (± 15°) and horizontal turned (90°) with a remote controlled power panner.</description>
