      The Efficacy Of Nalbuphine Versus Fentanyl As Additives To Bupivacaine In Spinal Anaesthesia&#xD;
      For Internal FixationI Of Tibia&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRODUCTION Regional techniques, such as spinal anaesthesia may offer advantages over&#xD;
      general anaesthesia including reduced stress response to surgery and analgesia extending into&#xD;
      the postoperative period.(1,2) Adequate pain management to facilitate rehabilitation and to&#xD;
      accelerate functional recovery after lower limb orthopedic surgery is essential to enable&#xD;
      patients to resume normal activity as soon as possible.(3) To increase the duration of&#xD;
      analgesia produced by local anesthetic, a number of adjuvants have been added through the&#xD;
      central neuraxial route.(4) The profound segmental anti-nociception produced by neuraxial&#xD;
      opioids in doses much smaller than would be required for comparable anti-nociception if&#xD;
      administered systemically has made them very popular and effective in the treatment of many&#xD;
      painful states.(5)The anti-nociception is also devoid of motor, sensory and autonomic&#xD;
      blockade so there is no paralysis or hypotension. Furthermore, the availability of a specific&#xD;
      opioid receptor antagonist naloxone to reverse their action when necessary has made the use&#xD;
      of opioids more acceptable.(6) Opioids work in the intrathecal space by activating opioid-&#xD;
      receptors in the dorsal gray matter of spinal cord, which modulates the function of afferent&#xD;
      pain fibers.(7)Intrathecal and epidural narcotics seem to modulate pain primarily at the&#xD;
      spinal cord rather than in the brain as do intravenous narcotics.(8) Site of action in the&#xD;
      spinal cord may provide analgesia with less sedation, confusion and nausea, which are adverse&#xD;
      effects associated with intravenous narcotics.(9) Various opioids have been used along with&#xD;
      bupivacaine to prolong its effect, to improve the quality of analgesia and minimize the&#xD;
      requirement of postoperative analgesics.(10,11) The main obstacles for optimal use of opioids&#xD;
      are their side effects which include pruritis, nausea/ emesis, constipation, urinary&#xD;
      retention, respiratory depression, undesirable sedation and the development of tolerance/&#xD;
      dependence. Though some side effects may be benign but others like respiratory depression can&#xD;
      prove to be life threatening.(12-14) Nalbuphine is a semisynthetic opioid with mixed mu&#xD;
      antagonist and kappa agonist properties. When used singly or in combination with other agents&#xD;
      it has the potential to maintain or even enhance opioid based analgesia while simultaneously&#xD;
      mitigating the common mu-opioid side effects. (15) Nalbuphine binds readily to both mu- and&#xD;
      kappa-receptors. The binding of nalbuphine to mu receptors only serves to competitively&#xD;
      displace other mu-agonists from the receptor, without itself displaying any agonist&#xD;
      activity.(16)When nalbuphine binds to kappa-receptors, however, it has an agonist effect.&#xD;
      Kappa-opioid receptors are distributed throughout brain and spinal cord involved in&#xD;
      nociception. Nalbuphine binds avidly to kappa-receptors in these areas to produce analgesia.&#xD;
      This pattern of binding and effects defines nalbuphine as a mixed agonist-antagonist.(17)&#xD;
      Fentanyl, a lipophilic opioid has rapid onset of action, It does not tend to migrate&#xD;
      intrathecally to the 4th ventricle in sufficient concentration to cause delayed respiratory&#xD;
      depression.(18,19)&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM OF THE WORK The aim of our study is to compare the effect of intrathecal nalbuphine&#xD;
      versus intrathecal fentanyl as adjuvants to bupivacaine, as regard the intra-operative and&#xD;
      post-operative analgesia, the hemodynamic stability, the onset of sensory/motor block and the&#xD;
      duration of action in patients undergoing internal fixation of tibia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS This study will be carried out in El-Hadara University Hospital on sixty patients&#xD;
      aged 18-50 years; belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I&#xD;
      and II, scheduled for elective internal fixation of tibia, of expected duration less than 3&#xD;
      h, under subarachnoid block, this prospective study will be done in a double-blinded,&#xD;
      randomized way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with significant co-existing conditions such as hepatic, renal and&#xD;
           cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;

           disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with allergy to opioids, long-term opioids use, and a history of chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After approval from the local ethical committee, a written consent will be obtained from each&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly allocated into two groups according to intrathecal drug injected&#xD;
      using closed envelope method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group F:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Subarachnoid block will be performed with 3 ml of the study drug injected in L3/4&#xD;
                intervertebral space, using a 25 gauge Quincke spinal needle, in the sitting&#xD;
                position, maintaining aseptic precautions, according to the standard institutional&#xD;
                protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The patients will be randomized using close envelope method equally into two groups&#xD;
                according to the additive (fentanyl or nalbuphine), and all patients will receive&#xD;
                the same amount of local anesthetic (2 ml 0.5% heavy bupivacaine).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thereafter, patients will be placed in the supine position for surgery, elevation of the&#xD;
           head by a pillow and oxygen mask will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Advanced equipment and drugs for resuscitation, airway management and ventilation will&#xD;

&#xD;
           MEASUREMENTS 1. Hemodynamic parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure will be monitored and recorded&#xD;
                at the following periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  5 minutes before the intrathecal injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 minutes after the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Every 15 min until the patient will be moved to the post anaesthesia care unit&#xD;
                (PACU).&#xD;
&#xD;
                2. Assessment of sensory blockade:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The onset of sensory block is defined as the time in minutes to reach highest&#xD;
                sensory level (20), it will be evaluated by ice at midclavicular level bilaterally&#xD;
                every 2min for 15 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The duration of sensory block will be defined as the time it takes for sensory&#xD;
                level to decrease to dermatomal level 12 measured from the highest sensory level&#xD;
                evaluated by ice every 15 minutes. (21)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The maximal level of sensory block will be evaluated by 20 min after the completion&#xD;
                of injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
                3. Assessment of the motor block:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Onset time of motor block will be assessed immediately after sensory block&#xD;
                assessment using modified Bromage scale.(22)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Modified Bromage scale&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The onset of motor block will be defined as the time from intrathecal injection to&#xD;
                Bromage score 3 tested every 2min for 15 min. (23)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Duration of motor block will be evaluated every 15 minutes intraoperative from&#xD;
                Bromage score 3 then every 30 minutes in the post anaesthesia care unit (PACU)&#xD;
                until full recovery of motor function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. post operative analgesia:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Duration of analgesia:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The duration of analgesia will be defined as the period from spinal injection&#xD;
                     to the first time when the patient complained of pain in the postoperative&#xD;
                     period.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Patients will be assessed using Visual analogue scale (VAS), in the immediate&#xD;
                     postoperative period, then every 2hours for the first 8hours, then every&#xD;
                     6hours for the rest of the first 24hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Visual analogue scale (VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
                - It ranges from 0 indicating no pain till 10 indicating severe intolerable pain&#xD;
                with variable degrees of ascending pain in between.(24)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Postoperative analgesic requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The time of the first request analgesia will be recorded and treated by&#xD;
                     intramuscular diclofenac sodium (75mg) in a dose of 1mg/kg and repeated after&#xD;
                     1 hour if needed up to 2 ampoules.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Paracetamol 1 g IV every 8 hours will be given for analgesia to all patients&#xD;
                     starting immediately postoperative (time zero).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Total dose of analgesic requirements will be calculated and elaborated&#xD;
                     statistically.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Postoperative Complication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any complication will be recorded and managed such as hypotension, bradycardia, nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, pruritus, shivering and respiratory depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypotension will be defined as systolic blood pressure less than 90mmHg and\or a&#xD;
           decrease of more than 20% from baseline blood pressure. (25)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bradycardia will be defined as HR&lt;50 beat\min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory depression will be defined as respiratory rate &lt;10 breath\min.&#xD;
