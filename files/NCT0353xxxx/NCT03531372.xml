    <measure>Change in overall symptom severity from baseline (day 0) to day 14 between the two study arms</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 and Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is the change in the score of a visual analog scale (VAS) (from &quot;no symptoms&quot; to &quot;overwhelming symptoms&quot;) used for evaluating overall symptom severity from baseline (day 0) to day 14 after treatment initiation, between the two study arms. A decrease in VAS score of at least 30% is considered as a clinically meaningful improvement, and therefore subjects achieving a decrease ≥30% in this scale will be considered as responders. The non-inferiority is considered demonstrated if the 95% confidence interval of the difference in the percentage of responders between both study arms lies within the non-inferior margin value defined of 20%.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Responders from baseline to day 3 and day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, Day 3 and Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of responder patients (VAS score decrease of at least 30%) on the basis of the mean change in the overall symptom severity assessed by the VAS score from baseline to day 3 and day 7 in both study arms</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-assessment severity of individual specific symtoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, Day 1, Day 3, Day 7 and Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison between Mipolixin® and Poliprotect® in the mean change of the score of the self-assessed severity of individual specific symtoms (bothersome postprandial fullness, bothersome early satiation, bothersome epigastric pain, bothersome epigastric burning, and bothersome heartburn) rated on a 100 mm VAS (from &quot;no symptoms&quot; to &quot;overwhelming symptoms&quot;) from baseline to 1 3, 7 and 14 days after treatment initiation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the score of GOS scale from baseline to day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 and Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the score of GOS ( Global Overall Symptom) scale from baseline to day 14 in both study arms. A decrease in GOS score ≥2 is considered as a clinically meaningful improvement, and therefore subjects achieving a decrease in overall severity score ≥2 from baseline in this scale will be considered as responders.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of AEs during study treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence and type of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) reported during study treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of AEs and clinical findings during study period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be assessed on the basis of all AEs experienced during study treatment and all observed and volunteered AEs and abnormal findings on physical examination, including vital signs throughout the study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction (treatment administration)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 3, Day 7 and Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Patient level of satisfaction in terms of treatment administration/posology will be assessed by means of specific questions about patient level of satisfaction after the 2-week treatment period. The response will be scored on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 to 4, as follows: 1 = &quot;very satisfied&quot;, 2 = &quot;quite satisfied&quot;, 3 = &quot;somewhat satisfied&quot;, 4 = &quot;not satisfied&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction (taste)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 3, Day 7 and Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Patient level of satisfaction in terms of chewable tablets taste will be assessed by means of specific questions about patient level of satisfaction after the 2-week treatment period. The response will be scored on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 to 4, as follows: 1 = &quot;very satisfied&quot;, 2 = &quot;quite satisfied&quot;, 3 = &quot;somewhat satisfied&quot;, 4 = &quot;not satisfied&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment compliance will be evaluated by performing the IP accountability. This data will be corroborated with the information recorded in the patient diary concerning the daily administered and missed doses.</description>
