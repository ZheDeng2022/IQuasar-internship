  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are currently no treatments to specifically target asthma in obese adults. This pilot&#xD;
      study is being conducted to investigate how effective roflumilast is in treating asthma in&#xD;
      participants that have a higher BMI. Roflumilast can induce weight loss, which may lead to&#xD;
      improved asthma control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of TRIM is to perform a pilot placebo-controlled trial of roflumilast&#xD;
      for the treatment of poorly controlled obese asthmatics.&#xD;

      TRIM is a 24 week, randomized, double-masked, placebo controlled trial that will enroll 38&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be take place in seven centers of the American Lung Association- Airways&#xD;
      Clinical Research Centers (ALA-ACRC). The centers include: Northwestern University Feinberg&#xD;
      School of Medicine, Mount Sinai Icahn School of Medicine, Duke University, University of&#xD;
      Arizona, the University of Vermont, The University of Alabama Lung Health Center, and&#xD;
      University of Illinois Breathe Chicago Center. Johns Hopkins University will be the Data&#xD;
      Coordinating Center (DCC) for the trial.&#xD;

    <description>The Asthma Control Test was designed to help participants describe their asthma and how it affects how they feel and what they are able to do. They choose a response based on their asthma within the last 4 weeks. Participants select how many times per week they experience different asthma symptoms and how often they had to use a rescue inhaler or nebulizer. There are 5 questions with 5 responses; 1 meaning their asthma is not well controlled or they had symptoms more frequently, through 5 meaning they feel their asthma is well controlled or they do not experience any symptoms.&#xD;
The primary outcome is an unadjusted comparison of 24 week change in Asthma Control Test scores between the treatment groups.</description>
