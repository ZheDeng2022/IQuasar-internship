  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to determine the acceptability and feasibility of the Teachable&#xD;
      Moment Brief Intervention (TMBI) + follow-up consultation for Veterans treated on an&#xD;
      inpatient psychiatry unit following a suicide attempt. The study will also determine whether&#xD;
      there is a signal of effectiveness supporting the TMBI in improving the recovery trajectory&#xD;
      of Veterans following discharge to the community.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 50 patients will be recruited from the inpatient psychiatry unit for the study. A&#xD;
      member from the research team will obtain informed consent for the participants and then&#xD;
      administer the baseline assessment battery. Patients will then be randomized to either (a) an&#xD;
      experimental group receiving TMBI + follow-up consultation or (b) a group receiving care as&#xD;
      usual. Patients randomized to the experimental group will receive the intervention prior to&#xD;
      discharge from the hospital, most likely on the same day as the baseline assessment battery.&#xD;
      Patients receiving the experimental intervention will then be asked to complete a brief&#xD;
      post-intervention client satisfaction survey administered by a research team member. All&#xD;
      study participants will then complete telephone follow-up assessments at 1 and 3-month time&#xD;
      points administered by members of the research team and supervised by the PI. Additionally,&#xD;
      patient electronic medical records will be abstracted to document the following health&#xD;
      services and clinical characteristics in the 12 months following enrollment in the study:&#xD;
      death for any reason, inpatient hospitalization (both medical/surgical and psychiatric),&#xD;
      emergency department visits, suicide attempt and other forms of self-directed violence, all&#xD;
      outpatient appointments with VA service providers, and diagnosis. The PI will rate the TMBI&#xD;
      sessions for the interventionists. When the PI delivers the intervention, a trained member of&#xD;
      the research team will review the PI's sessions and rate for adherence. The intervention will&#xD;
      consist of no more than 90 minutes (expected mean is 45 minutes for the intervention based&#xD;
      upon previous studies of the TMBI) of 1:1 interaction with a study clinician. The baseline&#xD;
      assessment battery will take approximately 30 minutes, the post-intervention measure will&#xD;
      take approximately 5 minutes, and the 1 and 3-month assessment batteries will take&#xD;
      approximately 30 minutes. The PI and potentially 2 to 3 members of the Suicide Prevention&#xD;
      Program will provide the intervention to ~25 randomized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notes will be kept on patients who decided to drop out of the intervention and/or the study.&#xD;
      We will examine the mean and standard deviation for the total score and individual items on&#xD;
      the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire. Notes will be kept documenting all contacts for&#xD;
      recruitment and the number of eligible patients per month. Reasons for inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion of potential participants will be documented as well as reasons participants give&#xD;
      for choosing not to participate. Number of patients enrolled and randomized each month will&#xD;
      be documented. Notes will be kept of rates of on-time outcome assessments and days late and&#xD;
      any assessments missed or participants lost to contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics for demographic and clinical variables will be tabulated. All scales&#xD;
      will be scored and subscales described. This process will include examining the data for&#xD;
      missing values, appropriate ranges, and outliers. Although the randomization design should&#xD;
      ensure balance between the two groups, it is essential to control for any known confounders&#xD;
      in the design and analysis to prevent a biased assessment of the brief intervention effect.&#xD;
      Any baseline demographic or clinical variables found to be statistically significant in the&#xD;
      analysis will be included as covariates in all analytic models. We will use an&#xD;
      intent-to-treat sample to complete our analyses. We will utilize mixed-effects regression&#xD;
      models to obtain between-groups effect sizes for the impact of the TMBI + consultation on&#xD;
      elevating motivation, hope, reasons for living and social connection.&#xD;
