  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research Problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper respiratory infections (URIs) are a common reason for absence from schools as it is&#xD;
      estimated that children get six to eight episodes every year. In Jazan (2013-2014), 34% of&#xD;
      primary health care centre attendees who were complaining of URIs were under 15 years old and&#xD;
      42% of them were positive when tested for viruses by nasopharyngeal swabs. An intervention&#xD;
      for URIs prevention is hand hygiene, as it has been shown to have an impact on reducing the&#xD;
      risk of respiratory infections by 50% among children in Karachi, Pakistan by encouraging hand&#xD;
      washing with soap. Another randomised controlled trial study conducted in Spain among primary&#xD;
      school students showed a statistically significant 38% reduction in the absenteeism rate due&#xD;
      to URIs in the intervention group who received education about hand hygiene and used hand&#xD;
      sanitisers which were distributed among schools. Also, the Chinese conducted a cluster&#xD;
      randomised control trial evaluating the effect of a hand washing programme and revealed a 38%&#xD;
      reduction in absence due to URIs among primary schoolchildren.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This preventive measure is questionable, as a randomised controlled trial done among primary&#xD;
      school students in New Zealand revealed that encouraging the use of hand sanitisers in&#xD;
      schools did not have an impact on reducing acute respiratory infections or absenteeism. The&#xD;
      questionable effect was also documented in a systematic review and meta-analysis for&#xD;
      randomised controlled trials about the effectiveness of hand hygiene in decreasing absences&#xD;
      through illness in educational settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate hand hygiene is recommended as a non-pharmacological preventive measure against&#xD;
      respiratory infections. But this preventive measure is questionable as the results of&#xD;
      randomised controlled trials about the effectiveness of different hand hygiene interventions&#xD;
      in reducing absence due to upper respiratory tract infection in different educational&#xD;
      settings are controversial. Furthermore, previous studies of hand hygiene interventions were&#xD;
      low in quality and it is recommended to improve future studies relating to it. Also, there is&#xD;
      no research on the effectiveness of these measures in Saudi Arabia. So, this piece will add&#xD;
      new knowledge to local and international literature. In addition, this study may help the&#xD;
      school health administration to develop a hand hygiene programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if hand hygiene education is associated with school absence rates due to&#xD;
           URIs reduction among primary schoolgirls in Riyadh city, 2017-2018&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure post-intervention total primary schoolgirl's absence rate (both groups) in&#xD;
           Riyadh city, 2017-2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure post-intervention primary schoolgirls' absence rate due to upper respiratory&#xD;
           infections (both groups) in Riyadh city, 2017-2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cluster RCT will be conducted among primary schoolgirls attending public schools in Riyadh&#xD;
      city in the first education semester. Sampling will be multistage to end up with four&#xD;
      schools. 616 schoolgirls who are attending the selected classes will be invited to the study.&#xD;
      Two schools will be randomly assigned to the intervention, which includes one-hour hand&#xD;
      washing workshop at the beginning of the study, in addition to posters. Parents will&#xD;
      self-administer the questionnaire at baseline, in addition to a follow-up phone interview&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
