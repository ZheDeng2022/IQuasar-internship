  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using anonymized patient data collected as part of the WAPPS-Hemo project to explore the&#xD;
      sources of variability in individual pharmacokinetics (PK); use the sources of variability to&#xD;
      improve the performance of the WAPPS-Hemo models through the addition of the predictors of PK&#xD;
      variability as covariates.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Innovation and expected results: As the classical PK approach typically requires 11 samples,&#xD;
      which can be a burden to the patient, specific subgroups of individuals are often excluded&#xD;
      from analysis-including children, elderly and critical care patients. As WAPPS-Hemo is the&#xD;
      largest database of individual PK data, a large subgroup of pediatric patients and patients&#xD;
      with inhibitors are available for investigation, allowing for analysis of variability in&#xD;
      previously unavailable groups. Determining predictors of variability within patient outcome&#xD;
      will allow us to improve the current models used to estimate individual PK, resulting in&#xD;
      better individual care and use of resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria: All valid data in the WAPPS-Hemo database will be used. All factor&#xD;
      concentrates will be included. All available covariates will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: Individuals with hemophilia A or B, any severity, who are registered on WAPPS-Hemo&#xD;
      and for whom infusion and/or PK data are available. Both adult and pediatric patients will be&#xD;
      included. Patients with history of inhibitors will be included as a separate subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Available covariates: age, sex, weight, height, dose and type of factor administered (as&#xD;
      total and IU/kg), blood group, baseline factor level, positive history of inhibitors,&#xD;
      hematocrit, hemoglobin, serum creatinine and laboratory methods used to measure factor VIII&#xD;
      and factor IX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: retrospective data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study database: The WAPPS-Hemo database will be used for the study. WAPPS-Hemo is a web&#xD;
      accessible platform developed and run by the Health Information Research Unit (HiRU) at&#xD;
      McMaster University. Data have been provided from participating hemophilia treatment centers&#xD;
      worldwide to the scope of obtaining individual PK estimates. Data collected are completely&#xD;
      anonymized, and re-use of the data for modelling and validation purposes was agreed upon by&#xD;
      the inputting physicians, who committed to inform their patients about use of their data for&#xD;
      system improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction procedure: Data will be extracted from the WAPPS-Hemo database after&#xD;
      transforming the centre name into a numeric code. The data extracted will include: patient&#xD;
      age, sex, weight, height, dose and type of factor administered (as total and IU/kg), blood&#xD;
      group, baseline factor level, positive history of inhibitors, hematocrit, hemoglobin, serum&#xD;
      creatinine, laboratory methods used to measure factor VIII and factor IX, infused dose,&#xD;
      post-infusion measurement of plasma factor activity level, estimated terminal half-life and&#xD;
      time to 0.01, 0.02, and 0.05 IU/mL, with their credibility intervals, area under the curve&#xD;
      (AUC), central volume, and clearance. Once extracted, the data will be stored in a secure&#xD;
      server, located within the local network of the HiRU, protected by a proxy server and&#xD;
      firewall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data cleaning: Once extracted, the data will be cleaned. Duplicate submissions will be&#xD;
      removed, and all original data that has been duplicated from merged infusions will be&#xD;
      deleted. Any data not valid for modelling, such as user input errors, insufficient data, or&#xD;
      conditions that exclude use of patient data (such as use of inhibitors) will be removed and&#xD;
      excluded from analysis. The dataset will be analyzed to search for outliers. Input errors&#xD;
      missed at the source will be corrected where the incorrect measurement has been used (i.e.&#xD;
      weight, height).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Multivariate hierarchical analysis will be performed on various factors (age,&#xD;
      sex, weight, height, dose and type of factor administered (as total and IU/kg), blood group,&#xD;
      baseline factor level, positive history of inhibitors, hematocrit, hemoglobin, and serum&#xD;
      creatinine, laboratory methods used to measure factor VIII and factor IX) to explore sources&#xD;
      of variability in patient outcome. Significant predictors will be used as covariates in&#xD;
      improvement of the model.&#xD;
