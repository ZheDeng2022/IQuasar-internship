      The objective of this protocol is to evaluate if Dextromethorphan (DXM) reduces Fibromyalgia&#xD;
      (FM) pain. DXM is a drug found in several over-the-counter products, including cough&#xD;
      suppressants. The drug may reduce FM pain by suppressing inflammation in the central nervous&#xD;
      system. The investigators will be observing the effects of DXM on daily self-reported pain&#xD;
      measures in people with FM. If DXM reduces FM pain, it will provide important information&#xD;
      about the nature of FM pathophysiology.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic, widespread pain syndrome. Individuals with FM frequently&#xD;
      report body pain, fatigue, sleep issues, cognitive impairment, headaches, and other symptoms.&#xD;
      The disease affects approximately 5% of women in the United States. Many of those patients&#xD;
      suffer with decreased quality of life and loss of employment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The precise pathological mechanism of FM is not yet understood, and there is no targeted&#xD;
      treatment for the condition. One hypothesis of FM with prior scientific support is that pain&#xD;
      is caused by abnormal inflammation of the brain. When microglia cells in the brain adopt an&#xD;
      inflammatory state, they release chemicals that can cause neurons to increase the&#xD;
      transmission of pain signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DXM has been used in previous research and demonstrated to suppress pain symptoms. When given&#xD;
      at higher dosages (above 200mg), the medication acts as a dissociative agent. This dosage can&#xD;
      reduce pain, but produces side-effects that can limit daily functioning. At lower dosages,&#xD;
      however, DXM may reduce inflammatory aspects of chronic pain while not causing dissociative&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In animal models, central inflammation can be reduced with intraperitoneal dosages of DXM of&#xD;
      0.1mg/kg. In an average U.S. woman, this dosage would translate to approximately 8mg. Because&#xD;
      an oral versus intraperitoneal dosing route will be used, the dose will be raised to 10mg,&#xD;
      administered twice a day (once in the morning and once at night). The investigator will&#xD;
      examine the impact of 20mg total daily DXM on self-reported FM pain.&#xD;
