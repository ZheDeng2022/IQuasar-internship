    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn about the hearing outcomes of adult and&#xD;
      pediatric patients who are treated with or are candidates for bone conductive devices (also&#xD;
      termed &quot;BAHA&quot;). Hearing outcomes will also be assessed with a second audio processor device&#xD;
      called the Adhear System.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Aims 1 and 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult English speaking patients who are experienced users of Bone Anchored Implants&#xD;
             (BAIs) for the indication of either single sided deafness or conductive hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Experienced will be defined as greater than 6 months of device use and no intermittent&#xD;
             function of the device within 2 weeks of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be limited to those who have normal hearing by bone conduction defined&#xD;
             as a pure tone average of 25 dBHL or better at 500, 1000, 2000, &amp; 3000 Hz in at least&#xD;
             one ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Aim 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English speaking children 5 to 17 years of age and their primary guardian who present&#xD;
             to the clinic for treatment by BAI on a headband device for the indications of single&#xD;
             sided deafness or conductive hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be limited to those who have no prior use of a BAI or bone conduction&#xD;
             hearing device, normal hearing by bone conduction defined as a pure tone average of 25&#xD;
             dBHL or better at 500, 1000, 2000, &amp; 3000 Hz in at least one ear. For those children&#xD;
             where this cannot be definitively established, children will be included who display&#xD;
             clinical signs of normal bone conduction hearing beyond a reasonable doubt and may&#xD;
             include such evidence as (but not limited to): auditory brainstem response, speech&#xD;
             awareness thresholds, visual reinforcement audiometry, conditioning play audiometry,&#xD;
             CT scans, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Aim 3 a &amp; b:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pediatric bilateral or unilateral conductive hearing loss patients who are between the&#xD;
             ages of 2 and 17 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pediatric participants who are currently managed by the University of Miami with a&#xD;
             bone conduction device attached to a softband.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Aims 1 &amp; 2:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Aim 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pediatric participants who are non-English speakers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children who have previous experience with a BAI or bone conduction hearing device&#xD;
             will not be included for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pediatric participants reporting allergies to adhesives or highly reactive skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Aims 3a &amp; 3b:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pediatric participants who are non-English speakers.&#xD;
