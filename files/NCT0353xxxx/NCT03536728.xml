  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase 1 study will be conducted to establish safety and dose level of AMXT 1501 dicaprate&#xD;
      alone, and in combination with DFMO, in cancer patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of oral AMXT 1501&#xD;
      dicaprate (AMXT1501) in combination with DFMO in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include characterization of plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of AMXT 1501 as&#xD;
      well as pharmacodynamic (PD) assessment of the impact of AMXT 1501 in combination with DFMO&#xD;
      on polyamine uptake by circulating lymphocytes (blood cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To these aims, the study will evaluate the safety, PK and PD profiles of orally-administered&#xD;
      AMXT 1501 and DFMO. Approximately, 52 patients will be enrolled to determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AMXT 1501 and DFMO in&#xD;
      combination. The MTD is defined as the highest dose level below at which dose escalation is&#xD;
      stopped.&#xD;

    <description>Dose escalation of AMXT1501 with a fixed low dose of DFMO will follow a 3 + 3 dose escalation design. The AMXT 1501 starting dose administered in the first cohort will be 80 mg (2 capsules); each capsule contains 40 mg of active drug. The dose will be given orally, once daily, fasted state alone for 14 days, and starting on Day 15 AMXT 1501 80 mg given in combination with fixed low-dose oral DFMO at 250mg 2x per day (BID), for an additional 14 days; for a total 28 days of treatment per cycle. Cycle 2 includes AMXT1501 + DFMO that will be administered for 28 days. The patient can be treated for additional 28 day treatment cycles as deemed appropriate by their study investigator. Dose escalation of AMXT1501 alone will increase per Part 1 cohort.</description>

The morning dose will be given orally of both AMXT1501 and DFMO, in a fasted state. The evening dose of DFMO alone will be given prior to bed-time for 28 days per cycle. The patient can be treated for additional 28 day treatment cycles as deemed appropriate by their study investigator. Dose escalation of DFMO alone will increase per Part 2 cohort.</description>

&#xD;
        1) Have a seizure disorder where &gt;1 seizure has occurred within the last year. 2) Have&#xD;
        clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., significant cardiac conduction&#xD;
        abnormalities, uncontrolled hypertension, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmia or&#xD;
        unstable angina, New York Heart Association Grade 3 or greater congestive heart failure,&#xD;
        serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, Grade 2 or greater peripheral vascular&#xD;
        disease, or history of cerebrovascular accident [CVA]) within 6 months of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3) History or presence of an abnormal ECG that, in the Investigator's opinion, is&#xD;
        clinically meaningful. Screening QTcF interval &gt;480 ms is excluded. In the event that a&#xD;
        single QTcF is &gt;480 ms, the patient may enroll if the average QTcF for the 3 ECGs is &lt;480&#xD;
        ms. For patients with an intraventricular conduction delay (QRS interval &gt;120 ms), the JTc&#xD;
        interval may be used in place of the QTcF with Sponsor approval. The JTc must be &lt;340 ms if&#xD;
        JTc is used in place of the QTcF. Patients with an intraventricular delay due to a left&#xD;
        bundle branch block are excluded. Note: QTcF prolongation due to pacemaker may enroll if&#xD;
        the JTc is normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4) Patient with treated (surgically excised or irradiated) and stable brain metastases are&#xD;

        initiation of study drug is negative for new brain metastases. Patients with stable brain&#xD;
        metastases must not require therapy with corticosteroids.&#xD;

&#xD;
        a) Women not OCBP defined as any of the following: i. Postmenopausal with &gt;1 year since&#xD;
        last menses and:&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. If older than 65 years old and not on hormone replacement therapy (HRT), with a FSH&#xD;
             &gt;30 mIU/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. If older than 65 years old and on HRT, the FSH requirement in not applicable.&#xD;
             Postmenopausal females on HRT will be allowed if the treatment is stable for at least&#xD;
             6 months prior to dosing of study drug(s).&#xD;

             oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy) with the procedure performed at least 6 months&#xD;
             prior to dosing study drug(s). Note: Tubal ligation is not considered a form of&#xD;
             permanent sterilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8) Have undergone treatment with radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, or&#xD;
        immunotherapy, within 4-weeks prior to study entry (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or Mitomycin&#xD;

        therapy, except for stable chronic toxicities that are not expected to resolve (i.e.&#xD;
        peripheral neuropathy, alopecia etc.). Patients who have an ongoing requirement for thyroid&#xD;
        replacement therapy from prior exposure to a checkpoint inhibitor but who are clinically&#xD;
        euthyroid are permitted.&#xD;

        or hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibody positive, confirmed by HCV ribonucleic&#xD;
        acid). Subjects with HCV with undetectable virus after treatment are eligible. Subjects&#xD;
        with a prior history of HBV are eligible if quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR)&#xD;
        for HBV DNA is negative. Note that elevated levels of biotin may interfere with viral&#xD;
        serology testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        11) Have a serious nonmalignant disease that in the opinion of the Investigator and/or the&#xD;
        Medical Monitor, could compromise protocol objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        12) Patients who are currently receiving any other investigational agent or who have&#xD;
        received an investigational agent within the last 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;

        study drug, including inability to swallow whole capsules or conditions that may interfere&#xD;
        with absorption. The Medical Monitor should be contacted for any questions regarding this&#xD;
        exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        14) Patients who have exhibited allergic reactions to a similar structural compound,&#xD;
        biological agent, or formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        15) Use of biotin (i.e., Vitamin B7) or supplements containing biotin higher than the daily&#xD;
        adequate intake of 30 µg (NIH-ODS, 2020). (Note: Subjects who switch from a high dose to a&#xD;
        dose of 30 µg/day or less are eligible for study entry.) 16) Infection with human&#xD;
        immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 or HIV-2. Exception: subjects with well-controlled HIV&#xD;
        (e.g., CD4 &gt;350/mm3 and undetectable viral load) are eligible.&#xD;
