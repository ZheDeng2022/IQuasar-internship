  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a major chronic condition affecting the quality of life of&#xD;
      millions of Americans. Per the Institute of Medicine new treatment adherence strategies are&#xD;
      needed to help improve the quality of care, reduce social and economic costs, and help those&#xD;
      with chronic conditions, including OSA, live healthier and more productive lives through&#xD;
      better management of their conditions. Adherence with continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      (PAP) therapy is disappointingly low, and new methods to increase both the use and efficacy&#xD;
      of therapy are needed. Historically, patients have not been formally instructed to adjust&#xD;
      their pressure settings on their PAP devices; practically, however, allowing patients to&#xD;
      adjust their pressure settings fosters engagement, self-confidence, and control with therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because of clinical demands, patients are often under-educated and under-supported about the&#xD;
      features of their positive airway pressure (PAP) devices. The most engaged patients are ones&#xD;
      who understand the details of their device and change the feature settings so that they can&#xD;
      maximize the benefits of therapy. Features settings include humidification level, expiratory&#xD;
      pressure relief, pressure ramping, mask alert, auto pressure start, among other important&#xD;
      comfort features. Historically, patients have not been provided with access to alter or&#xD;
      modify therapy pressure settings, which requires physician prescription. Allied medical staff&#xD;
      can carry out subsequent pressure setting changes. It is clear that it is difficult for the&#xD;
      healthcare system to engage in optimal chronic disease management, and accommodate the needs&#xD;
      of sleep apnea patients early in the treatment initialization process, which requires&#xD;
      multiple visits/contacts to ensure that patients are maximizing the use of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching aim of the proposed project is to examine the effect of providing patients&#xD;
      with the ability to adjust their PAP pressure levels on therapy adherence and outcomes. To&#xD;
      answer these research questions, the proposed randomized, controlled two-group trial of Sleep&#xD;
      Apnea Self-Management Program (SM) and SM plus Individualized Pressure Adjustment (IPA) has&#xD;
      the following specific aims related to APAP adherence and efficacy, patient-reported&#xD;
      outcomes, and utilization: (1) To examine the effect of Individualized Pressure Adjustment&#xD;
      (IPA) of settings on treatment adherence and efficacy (i.e., mask leak and residual&#xD;
      apnea-hypopnea index); (2) To examine the effect of SM+IPA versus SM on patient self-reported&#xD;
      treatment outcomes; and (3) To describe the effects of SM-IPA and SM groups on utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep apnea is one of the most common chronic conditions in the VA. Positive airway pressure&#xD;
      (PAP) therapy is the gold-standard therapy for sleep apnea, but adherence with PAP is&#xD;
      suboptimal. VA sleep programs are understaffed relative to clinical demand for education and&#xD;
      support. While adaption to PAP therapy has traditionally been achieved through sequential&#xD;
      visits and pressure changes initiated by providers during office-based care, self-monitoring&#xD;
      and individualized pressure adjustment is an important strategy that would empower Veterans&#xD;
      to achieve better control of their OSA. The key impacts of this project are significant for&#xD;
      both patients (improved outcomes) and the VA (improved staff efficiencies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While patients have control over a wide range of comfort features on their PAP devices,&#xD;
      historically they have not been formally educated and supported to adjust pressure settings.&#xD;
      The unique aspect of this study is the focus on individualizing pressure settings to allow&#xD;
      for the maximizing therapeutic benefit, including increased PAP adherence. Importantly, this&#xD;
      is done within the context of provider oversight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a 6-month randomized, controlled, non-blinded, single-center study&#xD;
      comparing the Sleep Apnea Self-Management Program (SM) to SM plus Individualized Pressure&#xD;
      Adjustment (IPA). Both groups will receive the SM protocol to ensure that they receive&#xD;
      identical OSA and PAP education and support. Participants in the intervention arm will be&#xD;
      provided with additional education and support that will allow them to adjust their PAP&#xD;
      pressures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive findings from this study will result in a Toolkit that can be distributed to provide&#xD;
      patients and providers with the knowledge necessary to improve the clinical management of&#xD;
      OSA.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The investigators' intent is to recruit a study population that is representative of&#xD;
        patients diagnosed with OSA. To this end, entry criteria are as inclusive as possible and&#xD;
        operationalized as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  confirmed diagnosis of OSA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  being newly prescribed an OSA therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  having chronic symptoms per screening symptom checklist&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  fluency in English&#xD;
&#xD;
        OSA diagnosis by the investigators' Pulmonary Sleep Program has been and is currently&#xD;
        consistent with published consensus statements50 that therapy is indicated when the&#xD;
        apnea-hypopnea index (AHI, number of apneas + hypopneas per hour of sleep) is either (1)&#xD;
        &gt;30 or (2) 5-30 AND accompanied by documented OSA symptoms, including EDS, impaired&#xD;
        cognition, mood disorders, insomnia, or documented cardiovascular diseases. Because sleep&#xD;
        apnea is of increasing importance in women, the investigators' plan is to oversample women&#xD;
        by 50% so that they represent 15% of the final study sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Criteria for exclusion include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  cognitive impairment sufficient to cause inability to complete the protocol (e.g.,&#xD;
             documented MMSE &lt; 24/30)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  low health literacy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  residence in a geographical area outside of San Diego County (which could make some&#xD;
             necessary in-person visits difficult)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  fatal comorbidity (life expectancy &lt;6 months as indicated by treating physician)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  significant documented substance/chemical abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  other participant circumstances or characteristics that, in the opinion of a consensus&#xD;
             of study team, would interfere with the safety of a prospective participant or their&#xD;
             need for treatment (i.e.,:)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  clinical needs of patient outweighs needs of research study&#xD;
&#xD;
        No exclusion criteria or any other study design elements will be used directly or&#xD;
        indirectly to restrict study participation by women or members of minority groups. Some&#xD;
        minority groups are thought to have higher OSA prevalence rates than Caucasians, so&#xD;
        assuming they are being screened/diagnosed at the same rates as Caucasians, the&#xD;
        investigators expect minority groups to be included in the study at levels equal to or&#xD;
        higher than the VA San Diego minority composition.&#xD;
