    <textblock>
      This study aims to identify the determinants of diabetes and to explore variation in diabetes&#xD;
      outcomes for people with severe mental illness (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and&#xD;
      bipolar disorder) in order to develop potential healthcare interventions that can be tested&#xD;
      further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study utilises a mixed methods design comprising analysis of patient primary care records&#xD;
      and interviews with patients living with comorbid SMI and diabetes, family carers and&#xD;
      healthcare professionals involved in commissioning or delivering healthcare for this&#xD;
      population. This entry on the Protocol Registration and Results System describes only the&#xD;
      quantitative Work Package of the study in detail i.e. analysis of patient primary care&#xD;
      records.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People living with severe mental illness (SMI) have a lower life expectancy (by around 20&#xD;
      years) than the general population, often dying of preventable or manageable illnesses&#xD;
      (Woodhead et al., 2014). Diabetes contributes significantly to this health inequality, being&#xD;
      2-3 times more likely in people with SMI (Stubbs et al., 2015). This study aims to understand&#xD;
      the determinants of type 2 diabetes and variation in diabetes outcomes for people with SMI in&#xD;
      order to identify potential healthcare interventions that can be tested further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What are the socio-demographic and illness-related risk factors associated with&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. developing type 2 diabetes in people with SMI?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. variation in diabetes and mental health outcomes in people with SMI and type 2&#xD;
                diabetes?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How do physical and mental health outcomes differ between people with SMI and type 2&#xD;
           diabetes,&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. compared to people with SMI without diabetes?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. compared to people with type 2 diabetes but no SMI?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What factors influence access to, and receipt of, diabetes care for people with SMI, and&#xD;
           how are diabetes healthcare interventions experienced by people with SMI?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. How and at what cost is type 2 diabetes monitored and managed in people with SMI&#xD;
           compared to those without SMI?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. What healthcare interventions (e.g. medication, referrals and care pathways) are&#xD;
           associated with better diabetes outcomes for people with SMI and type 2 diabetes?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In people with SMI, to identify which socio-demographic, illness, family history and&#xD;
           lifestyle factors are associated with the development of type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In people with SMI and type 2 diabetes, to identify which socio-demographic, illness,&#xD;
           family history and lifestyle factors are associated with variation in diabetes and&#xD;
           mental health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In people with SMI, to compare healthcare interventions, physical and mental health&#xD;
           outcomes in those with type 2 diabetes with those without diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. In people with type 2 diabetes, to compare healthcare interventions, physical and mental&#xD;
           health outcomes in those with SMI and those without SMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To understand the factors that influence access to, and receipt of, diabetes care for&#xD;
           people with SMI, and explore the experience of diabetes healthcare by people with SMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To compare diabetes care provision for people with and without SMI, and estimate costs&#xD;
           for these.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To identify which healthcare interventions (e.g. medication, referrals and care&#xD;
           pathways) may be associated with better diabetes outcomes for people with SMI and type 2&#xD;
           diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will utilise a convergent triangulation mixed methods design comprising a&#xD;
      quantitative longitudinal observational study of individual patient records of adults with&#xD;
      diagnosed SMI and diabetes held in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD, a&#xD;
      computerised database of anonymised primary care medical records drawn from a proportion of&#xD;
      general practices in the UK) with qualitative interviews with patients, their family carers&#xD;
      and healthcare professionals who commission or deliver services to this comorbid population.&#xD;
      This entry on the Protocol Registration and Results System describes only the quantitative&#xD;
      work stream of the study i.e. the interrogation of patient primary care records. The key&#xD;
      healthcare outcomes to be examined are listed; however, a definitive list of outcomes will be&#xD;
      agreed through a consensus process with project team members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complete study is organised in three work packages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Work Package One, which involves ongoing consultation with experts (service users and&#xD;
           family members belonging to a Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) panel, healthcare&#xD;
           staff and researchers) to refine questions and analyses, a synthesis of evidence on SMI&#xD;
           and diabetes risks and outcomes, integrating the qualitative and quantitative studies,&#xD;
           conducting co-design workshops to translate study findings into recommendations, and&#xD;
           optimising the dissemination of findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Work Package Two, which investigates the role of risk factors thought to influence i)&#xD;
           development of type 2 diabetes in people with SMI (objective 1), and ii) variation in&#xD;
           health outcomes in people with comorbid SMI and type 2 diabetes (objective 2). Further&#xD;
           analyses involve a comparison of diabetes healthcare and outcomes for people with SMI&#xD;
           and type 2 diabetes with outcomes for people with either condition alone (objectives 3&#xD;
           and 4), an examination of variations in type 2 diabetes screening, monitoring and&#xD;
           management and estimation of the costs for these (objective 6); and an exploration of&#xD;
           the role of these interventions in contributing to health outcomes (objective 7). These&#xD;
           investigations will utilise the CPRD database, which is linked to other datasets,&#xD;
           including Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data, HES-Office of National Statistics&#xD;
           mortality data, and Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Three CPRD datasets will be analysed which will consist of linked records from the study&#xD;
           period of 01 April 2000 to 31 March 2016. The first of these, Dataset A, will contain&#xD;
           records of a cohort of adult patients with a diagnosis of SMI. Dataset B is constructed&#xD;
           from Dataset A, and comprises those in Dataset A who also have a diagnosis of diabetes.&#xD;
           Finally, Dataset C is a cohort of patients with diabetes but no record of SMI who are&#xD;
           age and gender-matched to Dataset B on a ratio of 4:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Work Package Three, which explores the experience of diabetes management and healthcare&#xD;
           from three perspectives: patients, family members or friends who support them and&#xD;
           healthcare professionals who commission or deliver services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings will be translated into service recommendations through two multi-stakeholder&#xD;
      co-design workshops. The first of these will identify further avenues of inquiry for the&#xD;
      final stages of analysis and will develop draft recommendations to improve the organisation&#xD;
      and delivery of healthcare for this comorbid population. The second workshop will further&#xD;
      develop the recommendations based on the final analyses and will design interventions or care&#xD;
      pathways, assessing their potential acceptability and feasibility for future evaluation and&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dissemination event will be held, presenting materials in a range of formats to maximise&#xD;
      opportunities for knowledge exchange. Study outputs will include a final report for the&#xD;
      funding body, scientific papers submitted to international peer-reviewed journals, short&#xD;
      articles in practitioner journals, executive summaries published on websites, conference&#xD;
      presentations, and other materials disseminated through clinical, academic and voluntary&#xD;
      sector networks.&#xD;
