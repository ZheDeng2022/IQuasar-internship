  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to asses the effect of warfarin on markers of AXL pathway in patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is emerging evidence from pre-clinical models that Axl activation is critical for the&#xD;
      tumorigenesis and metastasis of pancreatic cancer. Warfarin is a readily available drug in&#xD;
      the clinical setting and could be easily, safely, and quickly used in patients in combination&#xD;
      with known cytotoxic chemotherapies to improve overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral warfarin has been well tolerated in both prophylaxis for catheter-associated thrombosis&#xD;
      and in advanced pancreatic cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this trial is to confirm the preclinical evidence that warfarin affects AXL&#xD;
      pathway in patients with pancreatic cancer. This will validate the effect of escalating doses&#xD;
      of warfarin on circulating biomarkers of AXL.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathologically-confirmed, localized or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.&#xD;
             Diagnostic biopsy must be obtained at the study institution prior to enrollment.&#xD;
             Pathology material must be available for review.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have measurable disease per RECIST criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Started most recent systemic therapy regimen within 15 days of enrollment (any line of&#xD;
             therapy is allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to tolerate, swallow and absorb oral medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.&#xD;
