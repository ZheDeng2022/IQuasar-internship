      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometrial cancer is a common and deadly cancer for women. It is getting more common and&#xD;
      deadly because risk factors like age and obesity are increasing. It is highly curable if it&#xD;
      is identified early. But there may be no symptoms early or they may be missed. Also, this&#xD;
      cancer is becoming more common and deadly for black women than white women. Researchers want&#xD;
      to find better ways to take samples and test them for this cancer. They want to study this&#xD;
      for a racially diverse population. One way to take samples might be from a tampon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if it is possible and acceptable to collect an endometrial sample from women by using&#xD;
      a tampon placed in the vagina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women at least 45 years old who are having a hysterectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will put a tampon in their vagina at least 30 minutes before their surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take a short survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tampon will be collected during the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small piece of tissue will be collected from the uterus that is removed in surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give a blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before or after surgery, participants will answer questions. These will be about their&#xD;
      medical history and basic data such as age and race.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will follow participants medical records for up to 3 years after the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will study the samples and tampons. They will compare how well cancer and other&#xD;
      markers are detected between the samples.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endometrial cancer is the most common and second deadliest gynecological cancer in women&#xD;
           in the United States, with over 63,000 new cases and 11,000 deaths expected to occur in&#xD;
           2018. Unlike most cancers, endometrial cancer incidence and mortality are increasing,&#xD;
           due to increases in risk factors such as obesity and population aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Racial disparities in endometrial cancer incidence and mortality have been reported,&#xD;
           with black or African American (henceforth referred to as black ) women experiencing&#xD;
           more rapid increases in incidence, as well as a higher burden of endometrial cancer&#xD;
           mortality compared to other racial/ethnic groups. The underlying basis for these&#xD;
           disparities is likely multifactorial, involving biological differences, as well as&#xD;
           clinical factors related to access to care, delayed diagnosis, and differences in&#xD;
           treatment and surgical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If identified early, endometrial cancer can be highly curable; however, the earliest&#xD;
           stages may be asymptomatic, and clinical symptoms are often missed. Combining sensitive&#xD;
           molecular testing approaches with non-invasive sampling techniques may to lead to the&#xD;
           development of novel endometrial cancer early detection approaches with the potential to&#xD;
           overcome disparities in access to care and time to diagnosis and treatment. We and&#xD;
           others have recently shown that vaginal tampons offer an acceptable and feasible method&#xD;
           for identifying molecular markers with high sensitivity and specificity for endometrial&#xD;
           cancer. Importantly, these proof-of-principle studies have been conducted in&#xD;
           predominantly non-Hispanic white (white) populations, and studies of molecular markers&#xD;
           for endometrial cancer, including those involving vaginal tampons, are lacking in black&#xD;
           women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The goal of this study is to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and clinical&#xD;
      performance of vaginal tampon sampling for molecular testing of endometrial cancer early&#xD;
      detection biomarkers in a racially diverse clinical population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Eligible participants will include women aged greater than or equal to 45 years undergoing&#xD;
      clinically-indicated hysterectomy for endometrial cancer, endometrial cancer precursors, or&#xD;
      benign conditions at the University of Alabama s Division of Gynecologic Oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a case-control study with prospective follow-up of the electronic health record&#xD;
           or up to 3 years. Cases will be defined as women with histologically-confirmed&#xD;
           endometrial cancer or cancer precursors diagnosed at hysterectomy. Controls will have no&#xD;
           histologic evidence of endometrial cancer or endometrial cancer precursors diagnosed at&#xD;
           hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary endpoints of this study will be: 1) The acceptability and feasibility of&#xD;
           vaginal tampon sampling in a racially diverse clinical population, assessed by&#xD;
           evaluating approximately 10 items from a brief survey regarding tampon sampling and the&#xD;
           DNA yield from the vaginal tampon, respectively and 2) The prevalence, sensitivity, and&#xD;
           specificity of endometrial cancer driver mutations in tampon and tissue samples in cases&#xD;
           and controls.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women scheduled for hysterectomy for endometrial cancer, endometrial cancer&#xD;
             precursors, or benign conditions at the University of Alabama Birmingham s Division of&#xD;
             Gynecologic Oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 45 years. We have chosen this age range to include both&#xD;
             peri- and postmenopausal women, who are at greatest risk for endometrial cancer. Women&#xD;
             younger than 45 years of age will not be included because they are at very low risk&#xD;
             for endometrial cancer and therefore are likely not the target population for early&#xD;
             detection of endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document. Women who do not meet this criterion include potential participants&#xD;
             who do not speak English, or have physical, mental, or emotional problems that prevent&#xD;
             them from comprehending the nature of the study. If the potential participant has&#xD;
             trouble reading the document, the designated study staff person may read the document&#xD;
             to the patient, to include the basic elements of the informed consent document, per 45&#xD;
             CFR 46.116 (a).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant are excluded from gynecologic surgery and are therefore not&#xD;
             eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men are not eligible for this study as this is a disease of a female organ.&#xD;
