  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of Fermented Soy vs. placebo in 72 adults&#xD;
      with localized prostate cancer prior to radical prostatectomy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel group, double-blind, randomized clinical trial with two arms. The primary&#xD;
      aim is to assess the efficacy of Fermented Soy vs. placebo in 72 adults with prostate cancer.&#xD;
      This study has 1 primary aim and 3 (1a thru 1c) sub aims. Aim 1 is to assess the effect of&#xD;
      Fermented Soy (QC) on PSA (prostate specific antigen) In parallel, in Aims 1a-1c will assess&#xD;
      tumor-specific effects of QC:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1a: Identifying the anti-tumor effects of QC. This will be done by culturing multiple&#xD;
      human cancer cell lines with QC at a range of concentrations, followed by readouts at&#xD;
      different time points, of tumor cell apoptosis, proliferation, and senescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1b: Identify a hierarchy of tumors that are responsive to QC. From the data in aim one an&#xD;
      attempt will be made to identify a hierarchy of anti-tumor effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1c: Investigate the signaling pathways in tumor cells that are modified by QC. To do&#xD;
      this, full genomic profiling will be conducted for breast and prostate tumor cell lines, and&#xD;
      will be done in conjunction with analysis of the relevant signaling pathways, and will&#xD;
      include P53 and P21 activation pathways.&#xD;

    <measure>Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Greater than or equal to 4 weeks (up to 10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The PSA test measures the level of PSA in a man's blood. For this test, a blood sample is sent to a laboratory for analysis. The results are usually reported as nanograms of PSA per milliliter (ng/mL) of blood. The PSA range of scores and interpretation are as follows: Normal PSA Levels: 0 - 4 ng/mL, Slightly Elevated PSA: 4 - 10 ng/mL, Moderately Elevated PSA: 10 - 20 ng/mL, Highly Elevated PSA: 20+ ng/mL. Interpretation of these scores is also based on the age of the inidividual.</description>

    <measure>Gleason Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Greater than or equal to 4 weeks (up to 10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Pathological investigation of the removed prostate gland will include the assessment of biopsy-proven, index prostate cancer lesion will lead to the analysis of any modulation of PCa grade (Gleason score) compared to preoperative biopsies. The Gleason Score is interpreted as follows: 3+4 (Prognosis = Good), 4+3 (Prognosis = Likely to Spread), 8 - 10 (Prognosis = Likely to Spread Rapidly).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PCa Tissue Telomeric DNA Length</measure>
    <time_frame>Greater than or equal to 4 weeks (up to 10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis of telomere length in research samples of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells reveals that telomere length decreases with increased replication of cells, reflecting the replicative history of those cells.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA-S) Score Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to final visit (up to 10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Post surgical/post intervention CAPRA score will be used for comparison with baseline (screening) value. The CAPRA score can range from 0 to 10 where: a score of 0 to 2 indicates low-risk, 3 to 5 indicates intermediate-risk, and 6 to 10 indicates high-risk.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cell Cycle Progression Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Greater than or equal to 4 weeks (up to 10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of prostate cancer mRNA can be determined from PCa tissue. Cell cycle progression score assessment of PCa mRNA is a novel RNA expression-based assay that directly measures tumor cell growth characteristics in order to stratify patients with localized PCa according to disease aggressiveness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P v4©)</measure>
    <time_frame>Greater than or equal to 4 weeks (up to 10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life assessment for men with PCa will be assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P v4©). The FACT-P contains 39 items that use a 0-4 rating scale. The highest possible score is 156 (lowest possible score = 0). The total score is an indication of overall quality of life where the higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

          <description>The CAPRA score is a measure of prostate cancer risk that ranges from 0 - 10. A CAPRA score of: 0 to 2 indicates low-risk, 3 to 5 indicates intermediate-risk, 6 to 10 indicates high-risk. For the purposes of this study, the low-risk and intermediate-risk groups were combined as part of the randomization stratification.</description>

        <description>The PSA test measures the level of PSA in a man's blood. For this test, a blood sample is sent to a laboratory for analysis. The results are usually reported as nanograms of PSA per milliliter (ng/mL) of blood. The PSA range of scores and interpretation are as follows: Normal PSA Levels: 0 - 4 ng/mL, Slightly Elevated PSA: 4 - 10 ng/mL, Moderately Elevated PSA: 10 - 20 ng/mL, Highly Elevated PSA: 20+ ng/mL. Interpretation of these scores is also based on the age of the inidividual.</description>
