  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate if a novel instrument called a Binocular Optical&#xD;
      Coherence Tomographer (OCT) may resolve many of the issues with the assessment of patients&#xD;
      with cataract.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cataract is the second leading cause of blindness in western Europe but the leading cause of&#xD;
      blindness in the developing world and both central and eastern Europe. The most common cause&#xD;
      of cataract is age. A number of clinical assessments are required to assess the status and&#xD;
      suitability of each patient for cataract surgery. Currently, these procedures are performed&#xD;
      in an inefficient manner with the patient having to move to different clinical areas to&#xD;
      access often large instruments that are costly to both purchase and maintain. Such an&#xD;
      inefficient patient pathway has been identified as a factor that can markedly increase the&#xD;
      cost of outpatient appointments, extend waiting times, and crucially lead to a reduction in&#xD;
      patient satisfaction. A novel instrument that offers a solution to such problems is the&#xD;
      recently developed Binocular Optical Coherence Tomographer. Binocular-OCT is capable of&#xD;
      non-invasively imaging the whole-eye in a potentially small, inexpensive and portable device&#xD;
      and is also capable of capturing images from both eyes in the same session without the need&#xD;
      for assistance from a trained technician. The Binocular-OCT has the capability to perform the&#xD;
      functions of many clinical tools in a single instrument. Of particular relevance to the&#xD;
      assessment of the patient with cataract is the ability to capture high resolution images of&#xD;
      the anterior eye and crystalline lens with swept-source OCT technology. In this study, the&#xD;
      proposed advantages of binocular OCT system will be assessed for the management of cataract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is important, to not only improve cataract assessment and optomise surgical&#xD;
      outcomes, but it is also vital to establish sensitive measures of lens quality to determine&#xD;
      tools to aid trails attempting to retard the progression of cataract.&#xD;
