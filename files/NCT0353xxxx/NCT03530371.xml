  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Auditory brainstem response testing is necessary in children who are not able to be tested by&#xD;
      classical audiogram, because of their age or an associated retarded psycho-motor development&#xD;
      or behavioral and cognitive troubles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This test needs a perfect immobility of the child, ideally being asleep. This situation is&#xD;
      sometimes impossible to achieve in non-cooperative children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, in the Pediatric Hospital of Nice, the investigators have to do a general&#xD;
      anesthesia to perform quality auditory response tests in this kind of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The alternative to a general anesthesia would be a reliable sedative drug, allowing the&#xD;
      performance of this diagnostic exam without the need of a hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine is a sedative drug with an action on the α2 adrenergic receptors. It causes a&#xD;
      rapid sedation, similar to the natural sleep and with minimal secondary effects. The&#xD;
      possibility of an intranasal administration, avoids the pain and discomfort of a venous&#xD;
      access insertion.&#xD;

      Auditory brainstem response testing is necessary in children who are not able to be tested by&#xD;
      classical audiogram, because of their age or an associated retarded psycho-motor development&#xD;
      or behavioral and cognitive troubles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This test needs a perfect immobility of the child, ideally being asleep. This situation is&#xD;
      sometimes impossible to achieve in non-cooperative children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, in the Pediatric Hospital of Nice, the investigators have to do a general&#xD;
      anesthesia to perform quality auditory response tests in this kind of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The alternative to a general anesthesia would be a reliable sedative drug, allowing the&#xD;
      performance of this diagnostic exam without the need of a hospitalization. An intranasal&#xD;
      administration avoids the pain and discomfort of a venous access insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine is a sedative drug with an action on the α2 adrenergic receptors. It causes a&#xD;
      rapid sedation, similar to the natural sleep and with minimal secondary effects. The&#xD;
      treatment will be administrated by intranasal way at a dosage of 2,5µg/ kg in a single&#xD;
      administration under continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring for 2 hours..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of intranasal dexmedetomidine in&#xD;
      the realization of the auditory brainstem response at the child with a cognitive or&#xD;
      behavioral disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of research involving non-randomized, monocentric prospective&#xD;
      interventional for a duration of 30 months. Patients from 1 year of age and under 16 years,&#xD;
      in context of suspicion of deafness will be included. In view of active queue of&#xD;
      otorhinolaryngology service of Nice University Hospital and taking into account lost sight,&#xD;
      the investigators can include 60 patients, to have a representative sample of concerned&#xD;
      pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be the rate of children included in the study who could determine&#xD;
      the auditory threshold. The non-determination of this threshold (or the determination by&#xD;
      resorting to general anesthesia or sedation of another type) regardless of the cause will be&#xD;
      considered a failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the lack of specific protocols, the applications of dexmedetomidine in children for&#xD;
      many diagnostic procedures have been studied in the past few years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any prospective study about the efficacy of dexmedetomidine for auditory brainstem response&#xD;
      testing has been yet conducted in children&#xD;

    <description>The tolerance will measure by the collection of the following undesirable effects:&#xD;
hypotension, bradycardia: deviation of&gt; 20% (systolic pressure for blood pressure) from the normal values defined for the age of the subject under waking conditions&#xD;
hypertension: deviation of&gt; 20% (systolic pressure for blood pressure) from the normal values defined for the age of the subject in waking conditions&#xD;
decrease in oxygenation: decrease in oxygen saturation &lt;90%&#xD;
These effects will determinate by cardiorespiratory monitoring during the examination. A routine home phone call on D1 will collect information about possible unexpected side effects.</description>

    <measure>time of vigilance recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>from 5 minutes after auditory test to 5 minutes after the patient wake up (Aldrete score equal to 9)</time_frame>
    <description>measure the time between the end of the examination, (defined by the end of the recording and the disconnection of the electrodes) and the recovery of the vigilance of the child , evaluated by the Aldrete score . A score of 9 or more determines a correct recovery of alertness and the possibility of returning home. The child will be reevaluated every 10 minutes until this score is reached.</description>
