      One-center, observational, non-interventional, prospective study of the efficacy of&#xD;
      azilsartan medoxomil in patients with arterial hypertension associated with stable ischemic&#xD;
      heart disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study 5 visits to the research center are planned. At each visit, a physical&#xD;
      examination, sampling of bio-samples for evaluation in the local laboratory, and collection&#xD;
      of information on adverse events will be performed. 24-hours monitoring of blood pressure&#xD;
      will be performed at screening, after 1 months of therapy and at the final visit (6 months of&#xD;
      therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected during 5 consecutive visits to the research center. The observation&#xD;
      period will be about 6 months, the active treatment period will be at least 6 months (24&#xD;
      weeks). Patients included in the study will be observed in an outpatient clinic according to&#xD;
      the local practice of the research center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned that potentially eligible patients will be invited to the screening visit.&#xD;
      Based on the results of daily monitoring of blood pressure, a final decision will be made&#xD;
      about the suitability of the patient to participate in the study. Patients who have not&#xD;
      reached the target values of blood pressure will start taking the study drug (Edarbi). By not&#xD;
      achieving the target values of blood pressure, the mean daily systolic blood pressure is more&#xD;
      than 130 mm Hg and the diastolic blood pressure is more than 90 mm Hg. The length of time&#xD;
      between Visit 1 and Visit 2 is suspected to be no longer than 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All examinations (examination and evaluation of vital functions, laboratory tests,&#xD;
      instrumental examinations) will be performed in accordance with the general standards of&#xD;
      medical practice and in accordance with the routine practice of the institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the number of patients hospitalized in the Research Institute For Complex Issues Of&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Diseases (1500 patients), as well as the data on the prevalence of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes in this group (23.5%, 353 patients), the required sample size will be 184 patients&#xD;
      (Confidence interval ± 5 %, the confidence probability is 95%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SS = Z2 * (p) * (1-p) C2 where: Z = Z factor (1,96 for 95% confidence interval) p =&#xD;
      percentage of respondents required, in decimal form (0,5 by default) c = confidence interval,&#xD;
      in decimal form (for example, 0,04 = ±4%).&#xD;
