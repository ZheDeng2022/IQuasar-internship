      Caffeine is a worldwide consumed dietary constituent. It occurs in a variety of beverages&#xD;
      such as coffee, tea, soft drinks and cocoa beverages, and in chocolate-based food products.&#xD;
      In the United States there is a reported average intake of caffeine of 200 mg/d in 80 % of&#xD;
      adults corresponding to the amount in two 5-ounce cups of coffee or four sodas. A new&#xD;
      interest for caffeine in ophthalmology emerged with the observation that caffeine inhibits&#xD;
      cataractogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cataract is the leading cause of blindness worldwide and until now there is no approved drug&#xD;
      to prevent cataract. UVR-B radiation has been identified as one of the major risk factors for&#xD;
      age related cataract. In vitro, Varma showed that caffeine preserves ATP levels and GSH&#xD;
      levels in the lens when exposed to UVR-B and further maintains the state of transparency in&#xD;
      the lens. Varma moreover hypothesized that its protective effect in the lens is due to its&#xD;
      ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to suppress elevation of toxic&#xD;
      microRNAs and consequent gene silencing. In the galactosemic rat model, Varma demonstrated&#xD;
      that topical caffeine in vivo inhibited the formation of galactose cataract and prevented&#xD;
      apoptosis of lens epithelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further study presented evidence that topical caffeine also prevents in vivo UVR-B induced&#xD;
      cataract and inhibits apoptosis of lens epithelial cells. The investigators estimated the&#xD;
      protection factor (PF) of caffeine to 1.23. The PF is identical to PF for sunscreens; the&#xD;
      ratio between the threshold dose of the toxic agent and the threshold dose without the toxic&#xD;
      agent. The PF observed for topically applied caffeine was higher than the PF observed for&#xD;
      perorally administered vitamin E (PF: 1.14) and vitamin C (PF: 1) , respectively. Only the&#xD;
      Grx gene provides a higher PF (PF 1.3). This strongly supports that caffeine has an important&#xD;
      antioxidant capacity in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 99 % of caffeine is gastrointestinally absorbed and pharmacokinetics are comparable&#xD;
      after oral and i.v. administration. In the liver, caffeine is metabolized by hepatic enzymes&#xD;
      belonging to the cytochrome P-450 family, mainly CYP1A2. Major metabolites like&#xD;
      1-methylxanthine and 1-methyl uric acid were reported to still have significant antioxidant&#xD;
      activity. Recently, a study confirmed the protective effect of coffee combined with&#xD;
      additional antioxidant dietary against age-related cataract. Its hydrophobic properties allow&#xD;
      caffeine passage over all biological membranes. A further study found that caffeine after&#xD;
      oral intake accumulates in the lens epithelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lens epithelium plays a major role in balancing water, ions and the metabolic&#xD;
      homeostasis. Additionally, the germinative cells in the lens epithelium generate a reservoir&#xD;
      for lens fiber cell generation. UVR-B radiation is absorbed by proteins and DNA in the lens&#xD;
      epithelium and underlying lens fibres, causing damage to the cells. When epithelial cells are&#xD;
      damaged, lens growth and transparency is disturbed. Michael et al. demonstrated the&#xD;
      appearance of apoptotic lens cells after in vivo exposure to UVR-B with transmission electron&#xD;
      microscopy. No necrotic cells were found at threshold dose. We found a peak of Apoptosis&#xD;
      hours after UVR-B exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to investigate if caffeine accumulation in human lens epithelial cells&#xD;
      after oral caffeine intake is sufficient to prevent from experimental ultraviolet radiation&#xD;
      induced apoptosis.&#xD;
