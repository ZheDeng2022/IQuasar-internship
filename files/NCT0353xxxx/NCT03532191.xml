      The PrEP Optimization Intervention (PrEP-OI) aims to educate healthcare providers on PrEP and&#xD;
      assist providers in the appropriate targeting of patients at increased risk for HIV&#xD;
      acquisition, initiating PrEP when appropriate, and providing guidance on the ongoing&#xD;
      monitoring and adherence counseling of patients on PrEP. The intervention includes a&#xD;
      web-based panel management tool (called PrEP-Rx) and PrEP coordination (by a PrEP&#xD;
      Coordinator). The PrEP-OI study will take place among participating primary care and&#xD;
      specialty clinics across the San Francisco Department of Public Health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite data indicating nearly 80,000 individuals starting HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis&#xD;
      (PrEP) by the end of 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates&#xD;
      that there are over 1.2 million adults with a substantial risk for HIV acquisition.&#xD;
      Therefore, only 6% of these individuals are receiving PrEP. One of the barriers to PrEP&#xD;
      implementation is lack of healthcare provider (HCP) knowledge and willingness to prescribe&#xD;
      it. In a 2015 national survey, only 66% of primary care clinicians were aware of PrEP.&#xD;
      However, once PrEP was defined, 91% indicated a willingness to prescribe it for high risk&#xD;
      patients and expressed an interest in education about how to deliver PrEP. A descriptive&#xD;
      report on the early experiences with PrEP uptake and delivery in San Francisco identified the&#xD;
      following priority steps for HCPs to address PrEP delivery issues and to maximize PrEP's&#xD;
      public health impact: (1) increase PrEP knowledge among HCPs and (2) expand PrEP access by&#xD;
      training HCPs and developing tools to facilitate PrEP delivery in clinical settings.&#xD;
      Additionally, based on the framework of the PrEP care continuum, interventions to enhance&#xD;
      PrEP uptake include HCP education, tools to assess sexual risk, and systems to minimize HCP&#xD;
      burden. Given these proposals and recommendations, innovative and effective approaches are&#xD;
      needed to support and provide guidance to HCPs regardless of level of experience prescribing&#xD;
      PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a PrEP optimization intervention targeted at HCPs to increase PrEP&#xD;
      uptake and persistence among those at risk for HIV acquisition. This intervention includes:&#xD;
      (1) an integrated web-based panel management tool called PrEP-Rx, which provides structured&#xD;
      HIV risk assessment, automates reminders for laboratory testing and appointments, and reports&#xD;
      patients' history of PrEP use; and (2) a centralized PrEP coordination overseen by a clinical&#xD;
      support staff (referred to as the PrEP coordinator) who can identify individuals at high risk&#xD;
      for HIV through direct patient contact or by reviewing registries for sexually transmitted&#xD;
      infections (STIs) and who can support multiple HCPs. PrEP-Rx consists of three components:&#xD;
      (a) Risk Assessment, (b) Provider Dashboard, and (c) Knowledge Base. The brief online&#xD;
      behavioral Risk Assessment will be provided to patients to complete prior to their initial&#xD;
      visits with HCPs. This assessment allows patients to respond to sensitive risk questions in&#xD;
      private, removes the need for HCPs to ask detailed risk questions, provides a standardized&#xD;
      and comprehensive view of patient's HIV risk, and decreases the time burden on HCPs. Based on&#xD;
      responses to the Risk Assessment, a patient's risk is categorized (high, medium, or low) and&#xD;
      results are presented to the HCP on a &quot;Provider Dashboard&quot; along with laboratory test results&#xD;
      that are required prior to PrEP initiation, and the patient's history of PrEP use (if&#xD;
      applicable). Based on these data, the HCP and patient can discuss the risks and benefits of&#xD;
      PrEP initiation. If a PrEP prescription is given, PrEP-Rx will generate automated follow-up&#xD;
      reminders which are sent to the PrEP Coordinator for scheduling office appointments or&#xD;
      laboratory visits. The activities of PrEP-Rx and the role of the HCP are augmented and&#xD;
      managed by the PrEP Coordinator, who has the ability to identify and contact patients who&#xD;
      have tested positive for STIs, follow-up with patients to minimize loss-to-follow-up and&#xD;
      improve adherence, and ensure timely laboratory monitoring. PrEP-Rx also contains a Knowledge&#xD;
      Base for HCP education and ongoing training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators propose the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim: Evaluate the efficacy of the PrEP optimization intervention (PrEP Coordinator +&#xD;
      PrEP-Rx) to increase PrEP prescriptions through a stepped-wedge design among 10 San Francisco&#xD;
      primary care clinics. The investigators hypothesize that the mean number of prescriptions&#xD;
      issued will be significantly higher when the clinics use the PrEP intervention versus when&#xD;
      they do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Explore differences in PrEP initiation, duration of use, and reasons for discontinuation&#xD;
           based on patient's age, race/ethnicity, and sex/gender, and by clinic and HCP&#xD;
           characteristics among study clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explore sustainability of the intervention during an eight-month follow-up after the&#xD;
           Stepped-wedge Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigate facilitators and barriers of PrEP delivery and experiences with the proposed&#xD;
           PrEP intervention through qualitative interviews with HCPs, PrEP Coordinators, and&#xD;
           clinic directors of study clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of the PrEP Coordinator plus PrEP-Rx has the potential to improve all steps&#xD;
      of the PrEP continuum and enhance overall care by identifying individuals at high risk of HIV&#xD;
      acquisition, standardizing HIV risk assessment, helping in PrEP initiation, systematizing&#xD;
      follow-up visits or laboratory assessments, and educating HCPs about emerging PrEP data.&#xD;
      These goals can have a significant public health impact and be attained with minimal burden&#xD;
      on existing clinic resources.&#xD;
