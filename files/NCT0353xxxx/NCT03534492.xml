  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard of care for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is radical cystectomy, which&#xD;
      is rarely curative. Platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with an improvement&#xD;
      in Overall Survival (OS), but only a few patients can benefit from this approach. Therefore,&#xD;
      new neoadjuvant treatments are required for muscle- invasive bladder cancer. In this study it&#xD;
      will be explored the activity of durvalumab plus olaparib in advanced Transitional Cell&#xD;
      Carcinoma of the Bladder and therefore may have beneficial outcomes in the neoadjuvant&#xD;
      setting. Adverse events associated with durvalumab and olaparib is one of the potential risks&#xD;
      in this study. Participation in this trial, in which 6-8 weeks of preoperative treatment will&#xD;
      be administered, is not expected to result in delays of surgery for participants. It is not&#xD;
      foreseen that treatment with durvalumab and olaparib has a relevant impact on operability or&#xD;
      increases the risks associated with surgery&#xD;
