  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Agitation, paranoia, and suicide risk of the psychiatric patients made them difficult to be&#xD;
      managed when they visited medical emergency services. The prolonged waiting time at medical&#xD;
      emergency services and the stigmatization of psychiatric medicine also made the psychiatric&#xD;
      emergency services full of challenges. However, in recent years, the random killings,&#xD;
      celebrity suicide and other major social events attracted much attention to the emergency&#xD;
      psychiatry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the establishment of the National Health Insurance, the law of mandatory admission,&#xD;
      and the prevalence change of all psychiatric diseases, we are now dealing with totally&#xD;
      different types of emergent psychiatric conditions, i.e., depression and suicide. However,&#xD;
      the real epidemiological data need to be updated. Psychiatric emergency is one of the&#xD;
      entrances of the psychiatric network. A comprehensive review of the psychiatric emergency&#xD;
      would be needed for the base of further research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is aimed to investigate the prevalence of psychiatric diagnosis of patients who&#xD;
      came to Emergency Department of National Taiwan University Hospital and needed a psychiatric&#xD;
      consultation. The epidemiological data will be compared to those collected 30 years ago in&#xD;
      the same hospital to examine the 30-year trend. On the other hand, the visiting time and the&#xD;
      staying time will be analyzed. The stress of on-duty and the contributing factors will be&#xD;
      assessed by a 2-hour in-depth interview with psychiatric residents.&#xD;
