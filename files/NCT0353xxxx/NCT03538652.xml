      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many smartphone apps intend to help people with addictions. But not enough is known about how&#xD;
      they should work. Researchers want to study an app that gives people the advice they need,&#xD;
      just when they need it. This is a JITAI. It stands for Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention. To&#xD;
      create a good JITAI, researchers need to know what approaches work best at different moments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop ways to treat addiction with a smartphone app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18-75 who use heroin or other opioids&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened in another protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit a Baltimore clinic 3 days a week to give urine and breath samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will get their treatment at this clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will answer questions about their personality and stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will randomly be assigned to the JITAI group or a comparison group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a training session on using the smartphone app. JITAI participants&#xD;
      will also watch a video about the written messages they ll see in the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weeks 3-10: participants will carry a smartphone. Four times a day, it will beep and ask&#xD;
      questions. These will be about the participant s activities and mood. The JITAI group will&#xD;
      see a short message after. The message is meant to be helpful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first 16 evenings, JITAI participants will get more information on the phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Answers to the app s questions will be transferred automatically from the smartphone to&#xD;
      secure computers at the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last week, participants can choose the kind of messages they see.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 11: participants will return the smartphone and answer questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weeks 12-16, participants who are getting their medicine from the research clinic will be&#xD;
      encouraged to transfer to other clinics. Otherwise, they will have their dose slowly reduced&#xD;
      to zero.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Our research group has made extensive use of ecological momentary assessment&#xD;
      (EMA) to understand people s daily experiences with opioid craving, use, and lapse. We have&#xD;
      also administered clinic-based psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), in&#xD;
      which clients learn to avoid, escape, resolve, or reframe problems (such as stress) that can&#xD;
      trigger lapses to drug use. CBT contrasts with ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy), a&#xD;
      mindfulness-based approach in which difficult thoughts and feelings are viewed as necessary&#xD;
      and potentially valuable components of a full life, to be experienced observantly rather than&#xD;
      resolved or reframed. CBT and ACT can and do coexist in a single treatment plan, but we know&#xD;
      of no systematic attempt to reconcile their differences. We have also not tried to administer&#xD;
      either of them on a mobile device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: To test a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI)-a treatment given when and&#xD;
      where it is needed. Our JITAI will be delivered via smartphone app and will combine elements&#xD;
      of two widely used treatments for addiction: CBT and ACT. Our goal is not to bring another&#xD;
      branded app onto the market, but rather to clarify when and for whom the generic components&#xD;
      of such apps are effective or not. This will include determining when CBT is more helpful&#xD;
      than ACT and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANT POPULATION: Outpatient adults who are physically dependent on opioids -up to 185&#xD;
      enrolled (35 for a formative-interview phase, 150 for a trial) for a target of 115 evaluable&#xD;
      (30 interviewees, 85 trial participants). Target enrollment will include 40% women and 60%&#xD;
      minorities (mostly African-American). In the trial, some participants will receive&#xD;
      buprenorphine in our clinic, and others will be receiving buprenorphine or methadone&#xD;
      elsewhere; this is a procedural matter, not a component of the experimental design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: After a formative-interview phase, the study will be run as a&#xD;
      microrandomized trial that will also include a conventionally randomized between-groups&#xD;
      clinical-trial component. In microrandomization, interventions are randomized at the&#xD;
      momentary level within person; the effect is measured proximally (e.g., 20 minutes later).&#xD;
      This is a powerful way to assess the effects of different interventions administered in the&#xD;
      field and to examine strategy-situation fit, i.e., whether interventions are differentially&#xD;
      effective under specific momentary circumstances. We are powering our study mostly to detect&#xD;
      (1) any effect of CBT or ACT versus control moments with no intervention given, and (2)&#xD;
      preferential advantages of CBT over ACT, and vice versa, as a function of the participant s&#xD;
      ability to control (change, escape) a given situation. The between-groups aspect of the&#xD;
      design (JITAI group versus EMA-only control group) is needed to demonstrate an effect of our&#xD;
      JITAI on traditional, distal measures of outcome, such as reductions in opioid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: In the formative-interview phase, we will conduct interviews with people in&#xD;
      treatment for OUD who express interest in using a mobile treatment app. We will ask them&#xD;
&#xD;
      about day-to-day challenges they currently face in maintaining progress toward their&#xD;
      treatment goals, and ask them what might be helpful. Then we will show them item lists,&#xD;
      onscreen mockups, and/or functional demos, and we will ask interviewees to comment on the app&#xD;
      s likely usefulness, its likely pitfalls, and how we could improve it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the clinical trial, participants will be randomized to one of two groups (JITAI vs.&#xD;
      EMA-only control). During weeks 1-2, all participants will have baseline assessments of&#xD;
      coping styles and personality, and all JITAI participants will be shown a video introducing&#xD;
      basic concepts of CBT and ACT. For weeks 3-10 (8 weeks), participants will carry smartphones&#xD;
      for EMA with or without JITAI. During week 11, participants will be readministered some of&#xD;
      the assessments from baseline. Participants receiving buprenorphine from us will then be&#xD;
      offered a dose taper or encouraged to transfer to continued treatment elsewhere. All&#xD;
      participants will come to our clinic thrice weekly for urine testing throughout&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Proximal effects of CBT and ACT messages in the JITAI group:&#xD;
      decreases over 20-minute intervals in craving and negative mood, with increases in&#xD;
      self-efficacy; (2) strategy-situation fit in the JITAI group; (3) group differences in distal&#xD;
      effects of treatment (week 11 versus week 2) in terms of self-efficacy and coping&#xD;
      flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Trait predictors of differential responses to CBT and ACT, in&#xD;
      the JITAI group; (2) group differences in frequency of opioid-positive urine over time; (3)&#xD;
      time courses of responsiveness to ACT vs. CBT, in the JITAI group; (4) whether the&#xD;
      intervention types that benefit participants most when pushed by the app are the same ones&#xD;
      participants choose when subsequently given the opportunity to pull interventions.&#xD;

        and/or frank opioid withdrawal); (3) interest in receiving the types of treatment we are&#xD;
        testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Treatment Elsewhere (TE) participants: (1) Age 18-75; (2) receiving methadone or&#xD;
        buprenorphine treatment for opioid dependence from a qualified provider in the community;&#xD;
        (3) interest in receiving the types of treatment we are testing.&#xD;

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase 1: Formative interviews. (1) cognitive impairment severe enough to preclude informed&#xD;
        consent or valid interview responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase 2: Clinical trial with microrandomization.&#xD;

        disorder; current Major Depressive Disorder; (2) unresolved symptoms of PTSD that, in the&#xD;
        investigators view, would make it risky for the participant to undertake mindfulness&#xD;
        exercises (e.g., observing all one s current negative thoughts and emotions) in an&#xD;
        unsupervised setting; (3) current dependence on alcohol or sedative-hypnotic, e.g.&#xD;
        benzodiazepine (by DSM-V criteria); (4) cognitive impairment severe enough to preclude&#xD;
