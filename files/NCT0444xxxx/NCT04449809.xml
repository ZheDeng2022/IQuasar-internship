      The purpose of this research study is to find out if a monitored group exercise program can&#xD;
      increase strength, muscle mass and ability to move in women after treatment for early stage&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;

      This trial will assess the safety and feasibility of a monitored group exercise regimen&#xD;
      utilizing high-load resistance training and functional exercises with compound movements in a&#xD;
      group of women treated for early stage breast cancer with the goal of improving functional&#xD;
      mobility, body composition, and strength after breast conservation therapy.&#xD;
