  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis affects 10% of reproductive aged women and causes severe pain and impaired&#xD;
      quality of life (QoL). Surgery for endometriosis results in long term symptom relief in only&#xD;
      40% of women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QoL in endometriosis improves after surgery, but not to the level of healthy women. Mediators&#xD;
      in QoL include pain intensity, pain cognitions, and stress. In a preliminary study, patients&#xD;
      with negative pain cognitions reported higher pain intensities compared to patients with&#xD;
      positive pain cognitions. This indicates that psychological factors explain considerable&#xD;
      variance in pain, suggesting that changing these factors by psychological interventions may&#xD;
      contribute to improving QoL. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is proven effective as a&#xD;
      psychological treatment for pain-related symptoms. The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate whether usual care combined with CBT improves QoL in patients undergoing surgery&#xD;
      for endometriosis compared to usual care only. Secondary objectives are to investigate&#xD;
      whether pain intensity, pain cognitions, perceived stress, fatigue and objectively measured&#xD;
      cortisol levels mediate the effects of CBT on QoL in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomized controlled trial, 100 endometriosis patients undergoing surgery will be&#xD;
      randomized between usual care with CBT (CBT group) and usual care only (control group). Women&#xD;
      in the CBT group will receive, in addition to usual care, one pre-surgery and six&#xD;
      post-surgery sessions of CBT, aimed at positively influencing mediators of QoL. Women in the&#xD;
      control group will receive only usual care. Follow-up will be 7,5 months. In both groups QoL,&#xD;
      pain intensity, pain cognitions, fatigue, perceived stress (using questionnaires) and&#xD;
      objective stress (assessing cortisol in a hair sample) will be assessed at baseline&#xD;
      assessment, T1 (two weeks after completion of all CBT sessions) and T2 (follow-up).&#xD;
      Recruitment and treatment of patients will take place in Rijnstate hospital and Radboud&#xD;

      Rationale: Endometriosis affects 10% of reproductive aged women and causes severe pain and&#xD;
      impaired quality of life (QoL). Surgery for endometriosis results in long term symptom relief&#xD;
      in only 40% of women. QoL in endometriosis improves after surgery, but not to the level of&#xD;
      healthy women. Mediators in QoL include pain intensity, pain cognitions, and stress. In a&#xD;
      preliminary study, patients with negative pain cognitions reported higher pain intensities&#xD;
      compared to patients with positive pain cognitions. This indicates that psychological factors&#xD;
      explain considerable variance in pain, suggesting that changing these factors by&#xD;
      psychological interventions may contribute to improving QoL. Cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      (CBT) is proven effective as a psychological treatment for pain-related symptoms. QoL after&#xD;
      surgery for endometriosis should be improved. Pain cognitions could be psychosocial targets&#xD;
      in the treatment of endometriosis related symptoms. We hypothesize that CBT focusing on&#xD;
      cognitions towards pain for women undergoing surgery for endometriosis improves pain&#xD;
      cognitions, leading to improvement of QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether usual care combined&#xD;
      with CBT improves QoL in patients undergoing surgery for endometriosis compared to usual care&#xD;
      only. Secondary objectives are to investigate whether pain intensity, pain cognitions,&#xD;
      perceived stress, fatigue and objectively measured cortisol levels mediate the effects of CBT&#xD;
      on QoL in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: In a randomized controlled trial, 100 endometriosis patients undergoing surgery&#xD;
      will be randomized between usual care with CBT (CBT group) and usual care only (control&#xD;
      group). Women in the CBT group will receive, in addition to usual care, one pre-surgery and&#xD;
      six post-surgery sessions of CBT, aimed at positively influencing mediators of QoL. Women in&#xD;
      the control group will receive only usual care. Follow-up will be 7,5 months. In both groups&#xD;
      QoL, pain intensity, pain cognitions, fatigue, perceived stress (using questionnaires) and&#xD;
      objective stress (assessing cortisol in a hair sample) will be assessed at baseline&#xD;
      assessment, T1 (two weeks after completion of all CBT sessions) and T2 (follow-up).&#xD;
      Recruitment and treatment of patients will take place in Rijnstate hospital and Radboud&#xD;
      University Medical Center (UMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Healthy female volunteers aged 18-50 years with an indication for&#xD;
      endometriosis surgery due to endometriosis associated pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Cognitive behavioral therapy administered in a total of seven sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The difference in Quality of Life at the last measurement&#xD;
      compared to baseline assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: The control group will receive usual care. The intervention group will receive&#xD;
      usual treatment plus a total of seven sessions of CBT. In addition, all participants are&#xD;
      asked to fill in seven questionnaires at baseline assessment, T1 (two weeks after completion&#xD;
      of all CBT sessions) and T2 (follow-up): the EHP-30, SF-36, PSC, PASS, CIS, NRS and PSS.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the researcher will carefully collect a scalp hair sample of at least 0,5 cm&#xD;
      thickness. This will be done at baseline assessment, T1 and T2. The hair sample will be&#xD;
      analyzed for cortisol levels in a laboratory.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Health Related Quality of Life assessed by the Endometriosis Health Profile 30</measure>
    <time_frame>7,5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Endometriosis Health Profile 30 (EHP-30) is a disease-specific QoL questionnaire which is validated for use in endometriosis patients and measures the impact of the disease on physical, mental and social aspects of life.&#xD;
The EHP-30 is not a numerical scale.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in general Quality of Life assessed by the Short Form 36</measure>
    <time_frame>7,5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form 36 (SF-36) is a multipurpose, general health survey which is applied to measure QoL on nine different domains: physical functioning, social functioning, role limitations due to physical health, role limitations due to emotional problems, emotional well-being, vitality, pain, general health, and health change.&#xD;
The SF-36 is not a numerical scale.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain intensity assessed by the Numerical Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>7,5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (unbearable pain), and is the most commonly used subjective measure to assess pain intensity. Patients will score there estimated average pain intensity and there highest pain intensity of the previous 7 days.&#xD;
Minimum value: 0 Maximum value: 20 Higher score indicates a higher level of pain intensity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Subjective stress assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>7,5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived stress will be measured using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), a 10-item validated psychological instrument for measuring nonspecific perceived stress. Items are designed to score how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives.&#xD;
Minimum value: 10 Maximum value: 50 Higher score indicates a higher level of perceived stress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Objective stress assessed by measuring scalp hair cortisol levels</measure>
    <time_frame>7,5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cortisol will be extracted from hair. The researcher will carefully collect a scalp hair sample of at least 0,5 cm thickness and sent these to the laboratory to analyze. The most proximal part represents the most recently grown piece of hair. Hair samples will be cut into a segment corresponding to the 4 cm closest to the scalp, reflecting cortisol secretion over the four months prior to sample collection. Cortisol extraction from hair will be carried out using an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in pain cognitions assessed by the Pain anxiety symptom scale</measure>
    <time_frame>7,5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain anxiety symptom scale (PASS) measures anxiety caused by pain. Questions are asked about feelings of fear of pain, cognitive anxiety, avoidance behaviour, and physiological anxiety symptoms.&#xD;
Minimum value: 0 Maximum value: 200 Higher score indicates a higher pain anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in pain cognitions assessed by the pain catastrophizing Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>7,5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The pain catastrophizing Scale (PCS) measures the degree of pain catastrophizing of the participant by measuring elements of helplessness and pessimism in relation to the ability to cope with the pain experience.&#xD;
Minimum value: 0 Maximum value: 52 Higher score indicates a higher level of catastrophizing</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Fatigue assessed by the checklist individual strength</measure>
    <time_frame>7,5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The checklist Individual Strength (CIS) is a 20-item questionnaire addressing fatigue, concentration, motivation and activity over the past two weeks.&#xD;
The CIS is not a numerical scale.</description>

    <description>Patients in the CBT group will receive usual care. In addition, they will undergo one pre-surgery and six post-surgery face-to-face sessions of CBT. In the pre-surgery session, management of expectations towards surgery will be addressed. In the six post-surgery sessions, attention will be paid to psycho-education concerning the biological link between endometriosis-related pain and stress, relaxation training, cognitive stress management, and management of anxiety, catastrophizing and hypervigilance. The CBT sessions will be coordinated by a registered psychotherapist who is experienced in CBT and has knowledge about endometriosis. All CBT will be individual sessions.</description>
