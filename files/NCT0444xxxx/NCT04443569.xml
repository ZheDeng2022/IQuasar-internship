      The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of using lidocaine patches after cesarean&#xD;
      section on pain control and opioid use in the immediate post-operative period. The hypothesis&#xD;
      is the use of lidocaine patches in the immediate post-operative period will lead to a&#xD;
      decrease in the use of opioids as pain control compared to patients that do not have a&#xD;
      lidocaine patch in place. Additionally, the a decrease in the visual analog pain score&#xD;
      compared to women who do not use a lidocaine patch in the immediate post-operative period&#xD;
      following cesarean delivery is anticipated.&#xD;

      The use of lidocaine as a local anesthetic is a common and widely used in practice. Lidocaine&#xD;
      patches can be used for localized pain control and can be placed every 24 hours. The use of&#xD;
      lidocaine patches in post-operative patients has been reported in one case report in&#xD;
      obstetric literature.[1] There is one study that reports decreased immediate postoperative&#xD;
      pain when lidocaine patches were placed at laparoscopic port sites following gynecologic&#xD;
      surgery as measured by visual analog scale score and the Prince Henry and 5-point verbal&#xD;
      rating pain scale . [2] There have been no studies looking at the impact of lidocaine patches&#xD;
      in obstetric surgical procedures, specifically cesarean sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cesarean sections are one of the most common surgeries in the United States. Following&#xD;
      cesarean sections it is common to utilize opioids in the hospital and upon discharge to&#xD;
      manage patient's post-operative pain. According to the CDC overdose deaths involving&#xD;
      prescription opioids were five times higher in 2017 than in 1999 with over 200,000 deaths.[3]&#xD;
      This creates an opportunity to decrease the use of post-operative opioids with the&#xD;
      application of a lidocaine patch as an adjunctive post-operative pain management modality&#xD;
      following cesarean sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lidocaine patches are a common topical analgesia therapy used for localized pain control in&#xD;
      the inpatient and outpatient setting. It's use in the postoperative period is less understood&#xD;
      and the use of topical lidocaine patches has not been thoroughly investigated in the surgical&#xD;
      literature. Thus far, it has been shown as an effective therapy at laparoscopic port sites&#xD;
      following laparoscopic appendectomies. [4] It's use in obstetrical surgeries has not been&#xD;
      studied. Overall, the limited research on this topic making it a valuable area of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve prospective enrollment of women undergoing cesarean deliveries. Women&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive a lidocaine patch or no lidocaine patch to be worn for 72 hours&#xD;
      after delivery to help manage postoperative pain. This will be an adjunctive therapy in&#xD;
      addition to the parental and oral narcotic pain medication that is routine prescribed. The&#xD;
      utility of lidocaine patches for management of post-cesarean delivery pain will be assess by&#xD;
      2 measures. The first measure will involve the total daily dose of narcotic used in morphine&#xD;
      equivalent doses. The second outcome assessed will be subjective pain as measured on a 1-10&#xD;
      scale and reported by the patients to nursing staff. This score will be averaged for each 24&#xD;
      hour period post-operatively.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This will be a prospective randomized non-blinded controlled trial. All cesarean sections for women undergoing their first or second cesarean delivery will be included. Patients will be approached and consented during the pre-operative period when presenting for scheduled surgery or at the time of consent for a non-scheduled cesarean section. The lidocaine patch would be placed on the superior-lateral aspect of the Pfannenstiel incision in the PACU prior to being transferred to the postpartum floor.</intervention_model_description>
