      The Stunning in Takotsubo versus Acute Myocardial Infarction (STAMI) Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Acute myocardial stunning, herein defined as the reversible loss of myocardial&#xD;
      function, occurs in both takotsubo syndrome (TS) and ST-elevation myocardial infarction&#xD;
      (STEMI), and can be life-threatening in both conditions. However, despite typically having&#xD;
      considerably more pronounced myocardial stunning, TS patients have better prognosis than&#xD;
      patients with STEMI. Despite the different relationship between extent of myocardial stunning&#xD;
      and prognosis in TS vs STEMI, no 'head-to-head' comparison of the myocardial stunning&#xD;
      phenotypes in TS vs STEMI has been done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The Stunning In Takotsubo and Acute Myocardial Infarction (STAMI) study is a&#xD;
      single-center, prospective clinical study that will enroll 100 patients with STEMI and 25&#xD;
      patients with TS. Echocardiography, laboratory testing (including troponin and NTpro-BNP),&#xD;
      and ECG will be done immediately after angiography and at days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14 and 30. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint is the proportion of myocardial stunning that has resolved after 72 hours,&#xD;
      as determined by echocardiography. Total myocardial stunning is defined as the extent of&#xD;
      akinesia observed at day 0 that resolves by day 30.&#xD;

      Prospective assessment of the temporal electrocardiographic-, vectorcardiographic- and&#xD;
      echocardiographic changes in STelevation myocardial infarction versus the takotsubo syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM To compare the temporal pattern of myocardial funtional recovery after ST-elevation&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (STEMI) versus the takotsubo syndrome (TS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND Modern therapies have reduced the incidence of acute ischemic heart failure (AIHF)&#xD;
      -But AIHF is still common and once it develops prognosis remains dismal.Despite considerable&#xD;
      therapeutic advancements over the last decades, acute myocardialinfarction (AMI) remains one&#xD;
      of the most common causes of death . Among patients who are admitted with AMI, the 10% that&#xD;
      develop AIHF account for approximately 50% of Deaths within 30 days . The prognosis for&#xD;
      patients with AIHF has not improved over the last decade . AIHF occurs due to acute loss of&#xD;
      cardiac function, some of which occurs in myocardium that is not irreparably damaged - so&#xD;
      called stunned myocardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial stunning in AIHF - Temporary mechanical dysfunction without irreparable injury.&#xD;
      Myocardial stunning was originally described in the setting of ischemia and was defined as&#xD;
      temporary mechanical dysfunction that persists after resolution of ischemia, with the absence&#xD;
      of irreversible histological damage . For the purpose of this application it is more broadly&#xD;
      defined as temporary mechanical dysfunction, with the absence of irreversible histological&#xD;
      damage - irrespective of the underlying cause. Myocardial stunning is believed to be a&#xD;
      harmful phenomenon caused by cellular injury .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: Myocardial stunning is a protective mechanism by which the cardiomyocytes&#xD;
      preserve energy for vital processes in states of severe cellular stress - but that can&#xD;
      &quot;overshoot&quot; and lead to potentially lethal cardiac decompensation. In the normal heart, the&#xD;
      contractile apparatus consumes the majority of myocardial energy and oxygen . Non-contractile&#xD;
      myocardial functions, including cellular and electrical homeostasis, require less than 20% as&#xD;
      much oxygen. When oxygen supply to the heart is interrupted myocardial stunning ensues within&#xD;
      seconds, whereas it takes at least 10 minutes for the cardiomyocyte's energy metabolites to&#xD;
      decrease to 50% of their initial level .Hence, by shutting down the contractile apparatus&#xD;
      before it consumes the cells' energy stores myocardial stunning effectively preserves energy&#xD;
      for processes that are necessary for cell survival . Irrespective of its beneficial effects&#xD;
      on cardiomyocyte metabolism, myocardial stunning may lead to sufficiently pronounced cardiac&#xD;
      dysfunction to cause life-threatening AIHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand the difference between myocardial stunning in STEMI and the more benign&#xD;
      form of stunning in TS. The sudden occurrence of temporary myocardial mechanical dysfunction&#xD;
      with the absence of irreversible myocardial damage is not limited to AMI. It can occur&#xD;
      postoperatively after cardiac arrest; in the settings of acute myocarditis and&#xD;
      tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy; and as a consequence of severe emotional or somatic&#xD;
      stress in the takotsubo syndrome .Intriguingly, takotsubo is characterized by a compensated&#xD;
      hemodynamic profile despite extensive myocardial dysfunction, effective recovery of&#xD;
      myocardial function within days orweeks, and a relatively good prognosis .Takotsubo therefore&#xD;
      appears to be a more efficient form of stunning than AIHF. Better understanding of the&#xD;
      mechanisms behind the stunning phenomenon could allow for manipulation of the stunning&#xD;
      phenotype in AIHF, or for pharmacological reversal of myocardial stunning once coronary&#xD;
      reperfusion and adequate myocardial energy delivery has been ensured.&#xD;

    <description>StunningResolution at 3 days is defined as StunningRes3D = (%Akinesia Baseline - %Akinesia 3day) / (%Akinesia Baseline -&#xD;
%Akinesia 30days); where %Akinesia is calculated as the endocardial length of the akinetic left ventricular myocardium divided by the total endocardial length of the left ventricular myoocardium - as assessed in the apical 2-chamber and 4-chamber views at end-diastole.&#xD;
The recovery of stunning at 3 days is compared to the recovery of stunning at 30 days. Thus a 14 day timeframe is required.</description>
