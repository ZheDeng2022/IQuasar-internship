  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial will investigate effects of daily intake of the bacterial strain Bif195 or placebo&#xD;
      when co-administered to once-daily oral intake of 300 mg of Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial includes a run-in period of two weeks duration followed by a 4-week intervention&#xD;
      period in which Bif195/placebo and ASA are co-administered. This period is followed by a&#xD;
      6-week wash-out period before a new 4-week period is performed with a cross-over&#xD;
      Bif195/placebo intervention as well as ASA co-administration. Bif195 and placebo&#xD;
      interventions are performed double-blinded in randomised order in a cross-over fashion for&#xD;
      each subject.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will participate in the trial for a total duration of approximately 17 weeks&#xD;
      including the run-in phase. Besides the screening visit, the trial will consist of 4 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After having given their written informed consent, subjects will complete the screening&#xD;
      procedures to evaluate their eligibility for participation in the trial and complete a run-in&#xD;
      period of two weeks duration to washout possible pre-trial probiotics and/or use of&#xD;
      medication. On the morning of day 4 after baseline assessments at Visit 2, all subjects will&#xD;
      start daily intake of 300 mg ASA in combination with Bif195 or placebo in a ratio of 1:1&#xD;
      according to the randomisation performed at Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 2 - 5, all subjects will be biopsied from the upper small intestine and the&#xD;
      ventricle during a gastroscopy procedure. At each of these 4 visits, 6 biopsies will be taken&#xD;
      from pre-specified locations in the duodenum and 2 biopsies will be taken from the ventricle&#xD;
      (approximately 5 mg each). Luminal fluids will also be collected during the gastroscopy&#xD;
      (approximately 2 ml per visit). One venous blood sample (of 20 ml per visit) will also be&#xD;
      collected at each of these visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis on biopsies and luminal fluid samples will include a combination of&#xD;
      transcriptomic, microbiome, proteomics and metabolomics analysis.&#xD;
