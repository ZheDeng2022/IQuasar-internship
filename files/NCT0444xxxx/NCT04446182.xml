  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, Phase II trial designed to assess the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      itacitinib in combination ECP and efficacy of the combination after 24 weeks of therapy. The&#xD;
      trial will consist of two parts: Part One will assess the RP2D. For dose-finding purposes,&#xD;
      the DLT evaluation period will be defined as the time from the first dose of itacitinib&#xD;
      lead-in (7-day lead-in) to the last day of cycle one combination therapy (Cycle one day 28).&#xD;
      Part Two will further describe and characterize the safety and efficacy of the regimen. The&#xD;
      RP2D will be determined by a 3+3 dose de-escalation design. Should dose level one be deemed&#xD;
      intolerable, enrollment will proceed at dose level -1. The RP2D will be affirmed according to&#xD;
      the rules of the 3+3 dose de-escalation scheme (Section 4.2). Once an RP2D has been&#xD;
      confirmed, Part 2 will open as an expansion cohort.&#xD;

             corticosteroids, prior to Cycle 1, Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Prior and concomitant use of Calcineurin-Inhibitors (CNIs) for prevention and&#xD;
        treatment of acute GVHD, as well as topical/inhaled steroids, is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received prior JAK inhibitor therapy for any indication ≤ 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day&#xD;
             1.&#xD;

             potential for serious or life-threatening birth defects or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with INCB039110, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with INCB039110. These potential risks may also&#xD;

                  recurrence by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequately treated non-melanomatous skin cancer or lentigo maligna melanoma&#xD;
                  without current evidence of disease.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Any uncontrolled active systemic infection or active infection requiring systemic&#xD;
                  treatment that was ongoing ≤ 7 days before screening. Subjects with acute&#xD;

                  of therapy has been completed and the event is considered resolved. Prophylactic&#xD;
                  antibiotics will be permitted.&#xD;

             (i.e., positive HBsAg). Participants with negative HBsAg and positive total HBc&#xD;
             antibody may be included if HBV DNA is undetectable at the time of screening.&#xD;
             Participants who are positive for HCV antibodies are eligible only if PCR is negative&#xD;
             for HCV RNA. Participants whose immune status is unknown or uncertain must have&#xD;
             results confirming immune status before enrollment. Serology results performed less&#xD;
             than or equal to 6 months prior to the first planned dose of itacitinib are acceptable&#xD;
             for determining eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known prior severe hypersensitivity to investigational product or any component in its&#xD;
             formulations, including known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, interfere with full&#xD;
             participation in the study, including administration of study drug/treatment and&#xD;
             attending required study visits; pose a significant risk to the participant; or&#xD;
