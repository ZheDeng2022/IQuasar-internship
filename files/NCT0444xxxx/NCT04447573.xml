        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subjects voluntarily participated in the study and signed the informed consent&#xD;
             form by themselves or their legal guardian;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. According to the international standard for multiple myeloma (IMWG 2014);&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosed as relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Relapsed and refractory were&#xD;
             defined as follow. Relapsed: patients had received for at least 3 drugs with different&#xD;
             mechanisms of action (including protease inhibitors and immunomodulators) and disease&#xD;
             progression within 60 days of the most recent treatment. Refractory was defined as:&#xD;

             increase the risk of the subject or affect the study, including but not limited to,&#xD;
             for example, cirrhosis, recent major trauma, etc;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. After allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation;&#xD;
&#xD;
