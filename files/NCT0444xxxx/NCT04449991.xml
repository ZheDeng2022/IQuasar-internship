  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most severe complications of systemic lupus erythematosus&#xD;
      (SLE). Among people living with SLE, 35-60% will develop LN during the course of the disease.&#xD;
      This complication is one of the factors that contribute to deterioration of the renal&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some centres perform kidney biopsies after completion of treatment for an episode of LN as a&#xD;
      part of the treatment evaluation. The term &quot;repeat biopsy&quot; is often used to describe these&#xD;
      biopsies. Several studies have reported that repeat kidney biopsies show activity at the&#xD;
      level of tissue, even in patients with normal routine blood and urine markers. The&#xD;
      investigators strongly believe that this information is important, and should be taken into&#xD;
      consideration during decision of treatment. To provide evidence for this, the investigators&#xD;
      have designed a collaborative project within the frame of the Lupus Nephritis Trials Network.&#xD;
      With this research project, the investigators want to contribute to an increased proportion&#xD;
      of patients with LN who achieve remission (inactivity) of LN, and a reduced proportion of&#xD;
      patients who worsen in renal function in the long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with SLE who develop a first episode of LN will be asked to participate in this&#xD;
      project, and will receive treatment according to current guidelines. Half of the patients&#xD;
      will undergo a repeat biopsy 12 months later, and half of the patients will not. The&#xD;
      selection of patients who will undergo or not undergo repeat biopsy will be random. Patients&#xD;
      with high disease activity at the level of kidney tissue will receive more intense&#xD;
      immunosuppressive treatment. Patients who have not undergone repeat biopsy will continue to&#xD;
      be treated according to standard routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare the results of treatment between the group of patients who&#xD;
      underwent and the group of patients who did not undergo repeat biopsy, with regard to (i)&#xD;
      complete disease inactivity at month 24 and (ii) renal function at month 60 from treatment&#xD;
      initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that significantly greater proportions of patients in the repeat&#xD;
      biopsy group will have inactive disease at month 24 and adequate levels of renal function at&#xD;
      month 60. This will provide support for performing repeat biopsies as a part of the treatment&#xD;
      evaluation, in order to optimise the therapeutic management and improve the long-term&#xD;
      prognosis of patients with LN.&#xD;

      Study rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lupus nephritis (LN) affects 35-60% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and&#xD;
      constitutes one of the most severe disease manifestations. Several factors contribute to&#xD;
      renal function impairment in LN, including genetic cargo, nephron endowment, disease&#xD;
      activity, drug-induced toxicity and renal flares. Five to 20% of the afflicted patients&#xD;
      develop end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) within ten years from the first LN episode. Available&#xD;
      therapies induce complete renal remission in only 20-30% of patients after six months of&#xD;
      treatment, and even patients who respond to therapy may relapse in 35% of the cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, clinical and laboratory tests cannot reliably reflect histopathological findings,&#xD;
      and kidney biopsy is indispensable for diagnosis, classification, and exclusion of mimickers.&#xD;
      The role of control biopsies after induction therapy is debatable, despite accumulating&#xD;
      evidence of discrepancies between clinical and histological responses. In the concrete,&#xD;
      several elegant post-treatment biopsy studies have demonstrated persistent activity at the&#xD;
      level of tissue despite adequate clinical response, suggesting that intensified&#xD;
      immunosuppression may be required in these patients. However, studies investigating the role&#xD;
      of repeat kidney biopsies in treatment evaluation and long-term renal outcome have to date&#xD;
      included limited numbers of patients, and varying definitions regarding treatment response&#xD;
      and renal outcome. Thus, the concept of a prospective multicentric per-protocol repeat biopsy&#xD;
      study to generate evidence for future recommendations for the diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
      management of LN gains increasing support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have sought to identify predictors of long-term renal prognosis, including&#xD;
      routine clinical and serological markers. Proteinuria levels &lt; 0.7-0.8 g/day at month 12&#xD;
      after initiation of treatment have been validated in different cohorts as a readily available&#xD;
      predictor of favourable long-term renal outcome. However, while the positive predictive value&#xD;
      (PPV) of this target was high, the negative predictive value (NPV) was poor in two of three&#xD;
      studies, since most patients not achieving the proteinuria target still had a good long-term&#xD;
      outcome (Tamirou et al. 2015; Ugolini-Lopes et al. 2017). Associations between chronic tissue&#xD;
      damage in repeat biopsies and long-term renal function impairment have been demonstrated in&#xD;
      European and Hispanic LN populations (Piñeiro et al. 2016). It was recently demonstrated in a&#xD;
      retrospective study that a high grade of residual activity in per-protocol repeat biopsies&#xD;
      predicted subsequent renal relapse in patients with incident LN, and a high grade of chronic&#xD;
      damage in repeat biopsies predicted long-term renal function impairment. More specifically,&#xD;
      NIH activity index scores &gt; 3 predicted subsequent renal flares, whereas NIH chronicity index&#xD;
      scores &gt; 3 were associated with renal function deterioration in the long term. It is worth&#xD;
      noting that active lesions in glomeruli mostly accounted for the former association with&#xD;
      relapses, whereas chronic damage in the tubulointerstitial compartment were found to be a&#xD;
      more important contributor to the latter association with long-term renal function (Parodis&#xD;
      et al. 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the project will be&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine the percentage of LN patients in histopathological remission after 12&#xD;
           months of standard of care immunosuppression;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to correlate histological and immunological (immune deposits) response to therapy with&#xD;
           clinical response;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate whether therapeutic decisions steered by the results of a per-protocol&#xD;
           repeat kidney biopsy improve renal outcomes compared with a matched control group of&#xD;
           patients who did not undergo repeat kidney biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to generate data on how to evaluate response to therapy in pure membranous LN (ISN/RPS&#xD;
           class V), as well as the value of the information retrieved from repeat kidney biopsies&#xD;
           in portending long-term renal prognosis in this LN subset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with an incident biopsy-proven proliferative or membranous LN, or combinations&#xD;
      thereof, selected to be initiated at standard of care immunosuppressive therapy with either&#xD;
      MMF or EURO-Lupus IV CYC (combined with GCs and ACE inhibitors/ARBs) will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      prospective study. Add-on therapies on the top of the aforementioned regimens will be&#xD;
      allowed. At baseline, patients will be randomised 1:1 to either undergo or not undergo a&#xD;
      per-protocol repeat kidney biopsy at month 12 from baseline. After randomisation, the&#xD;
      patients will be followed for one year within the frame of REBIOLUP Part I, which is&#xD;
      observational. Inclusion of patients participating in other investigator-initiated or&#xD;
      pharmaceutical industry-driven therapeutic trials will be made possible, provided that those&#xD;
      trials do not last more than 12 months. At month 12, REBIOLUP patients will enter into Part&#xD;
      II, which is interventional and an interval of ± 1 month is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with 2003 ISN/RPS class III/IV (± V) at baseline and an NIH activity index score&#xD;
      &gt; 3 (cut-off based on a recent proof-of-concept retrospective analysis) in the repeat kidney&#xD;
      biopsy, the immunosuppressive therapy will be intensified based on the physician's and&#xD;
      patient's shared decision (see recommendations below). In cases of pure membranous nephritis&#xD;
      (ISN/RPS class V) at baseline which transformed to ISN/RPS class III/IV (± V) in the repeat&#xD;
      biopsy, the same algorithm will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with pure membranous (2003 ISN/RPS class V) LN in the repeat biopsy, individual&#xD;
      assessment of the biopsy should steer the decision of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have not undergone a repeat biopsy will be treated according to standard&#xD;
      clinical parameters. Percentages of complete renal response at month 24 and renal impairment&#xD;
      at month 60 will be compared between the two study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomised to the control arm (i.e. to not undergo per-protocol repeat biopsy) who&#xD;
      underwent a repeat kidney biopsy upon clinical indication approximately at month 12 from&#xD;
      baseline, e.g. due to primary non-response or worsening, will be analysed in the control arm&#xD;
      (as per intention) for the primary analysis, and, additionally, together with the patients in&#xD;
      the interventional arm in a secondary analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical power calculation and number of subjects needed&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anticipated frequency of CRR at month 24 in patients of the &quot;no repeat biopsy&quot; arm is&#xD;
      40%. The investigators consider that a difference of 20% in favour of the &quot;repeat biopsy&quot; arm&#xD;
      would be clinically meaningful (i.e. a frequency of 60% CRR at month 24). To detect such a&#xD;
      difference, with an α level of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, a number of 98 patients per arm is&#xD;
      required. In order to take an anticipated 5% drop-out proportion into account, 206 patients&#xD;
      with incident proliferative [2003 ISN/RPS class III/IV (A or A/C)] lupus nephritis will need&#xD;
      to be enrolled. Patients with incident active membranous LN (2003 ISN/RPS class V) will also&#xD;
      be enrolled in REBIOLUP; however, the target number of patients per arm will be based on&#xD;
      proliferative cases only, since power calculation has been based on data from studies of&#xD;
      proliferative LN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on an anticipated yearly inclusion rate of 3-5 patients per year per centre, i.e. 6-10&#xD;
      patients during a 2-year period, approximately 20-30 centres of LN expertise will need to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
