  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Be a mom program (a web-based cognitive-behavioral intervention) is being tested in another&#xD;
      clinical trial as a preventive intervention for postpartum depression (NCT03024645). However,&#xD;
      given its effectiveness in reducing depressive symptoms among women presenting early-onset&#xD;
      postpartum depressive symptoms, Be a Mom can also have potential as a postpartum depression&#xD;
      complement treatment tool. The main goal of this research is to apply and evaluate the&#xD;
      acceptability and effectiveness of a blended cognitive-behavioral intervention for the&#xD;
      treatment of postpartum depression by integrating face-to-face sessions with the web-based&#xD;
      program Be a Mom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RCT will be a two-arm trial. Women who have had a child during the prior 12 months will&#xD;
      be enrolled in the study. A minimum number of 110 women will be enrolled in the study. After&#xD;
      agreeing to participate in the study, the women will be screened for the presence of&#xD;
      postpartum depressive symptoms and evaluated for a clinical diagnosis of postpartum&#xD;
      depression (according to DSM-5) by a researcher (licensed psychologist). Participants who&#xD;
      meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to one of the conditions: the&#xD;
      intervention (blended Be a Mom) or the control condition (treatment as usual). The sample&#xD;
      will be recruited in primary healthcare units in routine care appointments during the&#xD;
      postpartum period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last 12 months. The blended Be a Mom intervention will last&#xD;
      about 3 months. Participants in both conditions will be invited by the researchers via email&#xD;
      to complete baseline, post-intervention and follow-up (3 and 6-months post-intervention)&#xD;
      assessments. Assessments will include self-report questionnaires to assess several indicators&#xD;
      (e.g., depressive and anxiety symptoms, quality of life, marital satisfaction, mother-child&#xD;
      bonding, and maternal self-efficacy), mechanisms that may be involved in the treatment&#xD;
      response (e.g., psychological flexibility, emotional regulation, and self-compassion), user's&#xD;
      acceptability and satisfaction and cost-effectiveness.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the present study, a blended intervention to treat postpartum depression (blended Be a&#xD;
      Mom) will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of this research is to apply and evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness&#xD;
      of a blended cognitive-behavioral intervention for the treatment of postpartum depression by&#xD;
      integrating face-to-face sessions with the web-based program Be a Mom. The efficacy of the&#xD;
      intervention will be assessed considering two indicators: a) decrease or absence of&#xD;
      clinically significant depressive symptoms at post-intervention and follow-up; and b)&#xD;
      post-intervention and follow-up improvements in mother's psychosocial adjustment indicators&#xD;
      (e.g., anxiety symptoms, marital satisfaction, maternal self-efficacy). The present study&#xD;
      will also aim to investigate the mechanisms explaining the treatment response (e.g.,&#xD;
      psychological flexibility, self-compassion) and characteristics moderating the treatment&#xD;
      response (e.g., motivation for therapy, therapeutic relationship).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research design of the trial followed the methodological recommendations for the&#xD;
      development and evaluation of blended interventions. A pilot study will be conducted prior to&#xD;
      the randomized controlled trial (RCT), in order to evaluate preliminary version of blended Be&#xD;
      a Mom intervention. The pilot study will be conducted with women with a clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
      postpartum depression according to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5)&#xD;
      disorders criteria. Pre- and post-intervention assessments, using self-report questionnaires,&#xD;
      and individual interviews will be used to gather information concerning acceptability&#xD;
      (relevance of contents and structure), feasibility, usability and clinical effectiveness&#xD;
      (non-controlled). Appropriate adjustments to the blended protocol will be carried out&#xD;
      considering the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RCT will be a two-arm trial. The intervention condition (blended Be a Mom) will be&#xD;
      compared with a control condition (Treatment as Usual). The sample will include adult women&#xD;
      who delivered an healthy baby in the postpartum period (up to 12 months postpartum). Women&#xD;
      will be enrolled at primary healthcare units in routine care appointments during the&#xD;
      postpartum period. A minimum number of 45 women per condition will be required (N=90).&#xD;
      Accounting for the 20% of expected attrition rate over time, an anticipated sample of 110&#xD;
      women will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who demonstrate interest in the study will be informed of the study goals, the&#xD;
      structure and arms of the research and the researchers' and participants' roles. Women who&#xD;
      agree to participate in the study will sign an informed consent form. All ethical&#xD;
      requirements for research with humans are guaranteed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After women's agreement to participate in the study, the researcher (licensed psychologist)&#xD;
      will screen women for the presence of postpartum depressive symptoms (using self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires) every two weeks during the period of the study. When women have a positive&#xD;
      screen (indicating the presence of clinically relevant depressive symptoms) and meet the&#xD;
      remaining eligibility criteria, an interview (SCID-5) will be conducted by the researcher&#xD;
      (licensed psychologist) to assess the presence of the diagnosis of postpartum depression. In&#xD;
      case of absence of the diagnosis, women's participation in the study will end and they will&#xD;
      be referred to intervention by local providers. Participants with a clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
      postpartum depression will be randomly assigned (blocked randomization, with allocation&#xD;
      concealment) to one of the conditions: the intervention (blended Be a Mom) or the control&#xD;
      condition. The randomization will be conducted by a different researcher who will be blind to&#xD;
      the assessment procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last 12 months. The blended Be a Mom intervention will last&#xD;
      about 3 months and will be conducted by the researcher (licensed psychologist). Participants&#xD;
      in both conditions will be invited by the researchers via email to complete baseline,&#xD;
      post-intervention and follow-up (3 and 6-months post-intervention) assessments. Assessments&#xD;
      will include self-report questionnaires to assess several indicators (e.g., depressive and&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms, quality of life, marital satisfaction, mother-child bonding, and maternal&#xD;
      self-efficacy), mechanisms that may be involved in the treatment response (e.g.,&#xD;
      psychological flexibility, emotional regulation, and self-compassion), user's acceptability&#xD;
      and satisfaction and cost-effectiveness. The necessary statistical analyses will be&#xD;
      conducted, using the intention-to-treat and per-protocol principles.&#xD;
