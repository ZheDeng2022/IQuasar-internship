      This study involves prediabetes volunteers who are at high risk of developing diabetes,&#xD;
      including those with family history of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, fatty liver, polycystic&#xD;
      ovary syndrome and history of gestational diabetes. They will take a 12-week course of&#xD;
      formula: a) JinQi JiangTang Fang (JQJT) including Coptidis Rhizoma, Astragali Radix and&#xD;
      Lonicerae Japonicae Flos, b) combined the ingredients of JQJT and Ophiopogonis Radix to make&#xD;
      up a novel CM, Jin Mai Fang (JM); to evaluate the effectiveness of Chinese Medicine in&#xD;
      preventing diabetes in a controlled setting in order to better understand their actions. They&#xD;
      will be followed up for another 12 weeks after the treatment to evaluate the improvement in&#xD;
      glucose tolerance of the formula.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In China, 10% of adults have diabetes and 30% of people have prediabetes. In Hong Kong, 2 in&#xD;
      100 adults develop pre-diabetes every year and in 2014, 9% of adults have prediabetes. People&#xD;
      with prediabetes have increased risk of cardiovascular disease and development of diabetes.&#xD;
      Once developed, diabetes is associated with loss of 4-10 years of life depending on age of&#xD;
      onset and 2-3 fold increased risk of cardiovascular, kidney and cancer events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early detection and intervention of pre-diabetes will prevent progression from pre-diabetes&#xD;
      to diabetes and reduce the risk of complications of diabetes. This focus on prevention&#xD;
      concords with the concept of 'Zhi-Wei-Bing' in Chinese Medicine (CM). This is not only an&#xD;
      important philosophy of CM but also a unique feature of Chinese culture. The 'Zhi-Wei-Bing'&#xD;
      philosophy includes disease prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin is secreted by the beta-cells of the pancreas which is the only hormone that can&#xD;
      reduce blood glucose. People with diabetes have fewer pancreatic beta-cells than those&#xD;
      without diabetes. Chinese Medicine contains multiple herbs which have been used in China for&#xD;
      thousands of years. These herbal mixtures may alter the expression of these proteins which&#xD;
      can lead to many biological effects including the possible benefits in reducing the risk of&#xD;
      diabetes in high risk subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JinQi JiangTang Fang (JQJT) contains extracts from three herbs including Coptidis Rhizoma,&#xD;
      Astragali Radix and Lonicerae Japonicae Flos and is one of the most popular formulae used by&#xD;
      CMP for prevention of diabetes. The sustained blood glucose lowering effects of JQJT in male&#xD;
      Zucker diabetic fatty rats. On multiomic analysis, the investigators observed concerted&#xD;
      expression changes in a gene-gene network involving mRNA, miRNA and proteins implicated in&#xD;
      fat metabolism and cell cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators have combined the ingredients of JQJT and Ophiopogonis Radix&#xD;
      (Maidong) to make up a novel CM formula, Jin Mai Fang (JM). According to TCM theory, Maidong&#xD;
      nourishes the yin, promotes body fluid production, moistens the lung, eases the mind and&#xD;
      clears away heart fire. The polysaccharide-rich extract of Maidong (0.06-240 mg/ml) has been&#xD;
      shown to inhibit glucose absorption into the intestinal brush border membrane vesicles,&#xD;
      reduce the activity of Î±-glucosidase and improve the activity of NIT-1 cells damaged by&#xD;
      streptozotocin. These combined effects of inhibition of carbohydrate digestion and absorption&#xD;
      and protection of the pancreatic islet cells provide a strong rationale for its use to&#xD;
      prevent diabetes. The subjects will take a 12-week course of formula and they will be&#xD;
      followed up for another 12 weeks after the treatment to evaluate the improvement in glucose&#xD;
      tolerance of the formula.&#xD;
