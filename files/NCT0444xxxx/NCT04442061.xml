  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Difficulties in social interactions are the core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)&#xD;
      and are characterized by abnormal social perception, mainly concerning eye gaze.&#xD;
      Anatomo-functional abnormalities within the superior temporal sulcus (STS), a key region of&#xD;
      the social brain, have been described in ASD. The investigators had recently shown that it is&#xD;
      possible to modulate the neural activity of the STS with transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (TMS) with an impact on social perception, measured by eye-tracking. In the context of ASD,&#xD;
      stimulation of the STS with excitatory TMS could lead to an improvement in social perception,&#xD;
      which would open up new therapeutic strategies. The purpose of this double-blind, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study is to apply a therapeutic TMS protocol (10 daily sessions) at the&#xD;
      right STS in young adults with ASD to improve their social behavior, objectively measured&#xD;
      using eye-tracking.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are neuro-developmental disorders presumably related to&#xD;
      neural circuit alterations. The symptoms, that start very early in development and persist&#xD;
      through adulthood, can lead to severe handicap. Even though a wide variety of clinical&#xD;
      severity exists, difficulties in social interactions are a core feature of ASD. These&#xD;
      difficulties are characterized by social perception abnormalities, manifested mainly through&#xD;
      abnormal eye contact. Such abnormalities have been largely confirmed in the last decade by&#xD;
      eye-tracking studies, which allow objective and quantitative investigation of gaze behaviour.&#xD;
      Studies with adults and children with ASD during visualization of social scene have shown a&#xD;
      lack of preference for socially relevant information, mainly faces and eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the typically developing brain, socially relevant information is processed within a&#xD;
      specific network, called the social brain. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation studies have&#xD;
      shown the implication of a key region of the social brain, namely the superior temporal&#xD;
      sulcus (STS), is in processing social information, ranging from the perception of eyes, faces&#xD;
      and voices to the more complex processes of social cognition. Over the last decades, brain&#xD;
      imaging studies investigating the neuro basis of ASD have consistently described anatomical&#xD;
      and functional abnormalities within the social brain, particularly within the STS Currently&#xD;
      there are important limitations in the therapeutic interventions available for ASD.&#xD;
      Pharmacological treatments are only indicated for psychiatric comorbidity and has no impact&#xD;
      on ASD core manifestations. Behavioural interventions, on the other hand, are generally&#xD;
      expensive, time-consuming and have modest results. In more recent years non-invasive&#xD;
      neuromodulation techniques, such as Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), have raised hope&#xD;
      as effective tool to address ASD core manifestations. Indeed, modulating the neural activity&#xD;
      of STS with an impact on social perception opens new therapeutic perspectives in ASD. The&#xD;
      effect of TMS on social behaviour has been recently showed by a study from our lab. Following&#xD;
      an inhibition of the right STS by inhibitory TMS, healthy volunteers look less at the eyes of&#xD;
      the characters during the visualization of social scenes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of repetitive&#xD;
      session of TMS applied to the STS on social perception in patients with ASD. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to research the impact of putative changes in social perception in broader&#xD;
      social behaviour using clinical scales. Finally, the investigators aim to research putative&#xD;
      changes in brain functioning at rest by measuring rest cerebral blood flow using Arterial&#xD;
      Spin Labeling (ASL)-MRI before and after TMS. This is a double-blind, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled therapeutic trial, ultimately aiming to improve broader social behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For that purpose, the investigators will include in the present study 20 participants with&#xD;
      non-syndromic ASD aged from 18 to 25 years old. Social perception will be measured using an&#xD;
      eye-tracking during passive visualization of social stimuli. All patients will undergo an MRI&#xD;
      for neuronavigation purposes and to obtain rest cerebral blood flow measures using arterial&#xD;
      spin labelling MRI sequence, as well as clinical scales to evaluate their global social&#xD;
      behavior: clinical global impressions (CGI), &quot;évaluation des comportements autistiques&#xD;
      revise&quot; (ECA-R) and autism behavior checklist (ABC). The 20 patients will be automatically&#xD;
      randomized in the active TMS arm (n = 10), or in the placebo arm (n = 10). Patients will&#xD;
      undergo 10 sessions of TMS applied to the posterior part of the right superior STS, from&#xD;
      Monday to Friday for two consecutive weeks. Following the 10 sessions, evaluations will be&#xD;
      performed: 5 days, 1 month and 3 months after the end of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that stimulation of the posterior part of the STS, a region shown to&#xD;
      be strongly implicated in processing social information, mainly from the eyes, would lead to&#xD;
      an increase in eye-gaze perception and thus promote access to social cues necessary for&#xD;
      adapted broader social behavior. If so, TMS could be further considered as an alternative&#xD;
      therapeutical intervention in ASD.&#xD;
