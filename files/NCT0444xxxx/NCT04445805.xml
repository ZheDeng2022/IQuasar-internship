  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate telemedicine treatments for sleep in pregnant&#xD;
      women. As pregnant women are vulnerable to sleep problems, the investigators aim to explore&#xD;
      whether these types of treatment will improve sleep and mood-related health risks in&#xD;
      pregnancy and postpartum. The investigators will test the efficacy of cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy for insomnia (CBTI) and mindfulness-based therapy for insomnia (MBTI) for perinatal&#xD;
      insomnia relative to sleep education and hygiene, which is a minimal intervention control.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to determine the efficacy of cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) and mindfulness-based therapy for insomnia (MBTI) for&#xD;
      perinatal insomnia relative to sleep education and hygiene, which is a minimal intervention&#xD;
      control. The long-term goal is to maximize the effectiveness of insomnia treatment for&#xD;
      perinatal women by adapting safe and efficacious treatments to meet the evolving needs of&#xD;
      women through pregnancy and postpartum. Over half of pregnant women develop insomnia, which&#xD;
      is associated with high rates of depression during pregnancy and postpartum. By successfully&#xD;
      treating insomnia during pregnancy and improving cognitive-emotion regulation, mental health&#xD;
      of pregnant and postpartum women may be substantially improved. In a prior clinical trial,&#xD;
      Dr. Kalmbach (PI) showed that digital CBTI (i.e., fully automated online program) improved&#xD;
      sleep during pregnancy, and offered some protection against sleep problems after childbirth.&#xD;
      Women in this prior trial were highly satisfied with CBTI and the ability to participate in&#xD;
      treatment remotely. However, the investigators identified important shortcomings of CBTI in&#xD;
      this population. Namely, standard CBTI was ineffective at reducing cognitive arousal and&#xD;
      depression. Preliminary data suggest that MBTI may effectively reduce cognitive arousal in&#xD;
      insomnia patients, which has immense potential to enhance sleep and mental health outcomes in&#xD;
      perinatal insomnia. Thus, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of MBTI and CBTI for perinatal insomnia relative to a minimal&#xD;
      intervention control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is a 3-arm RCT comparing CBTI and MBTI to sleep education and hygiene&#xD;
      minimal intervention control for the treatment of perinatal insomnia. 120 women with insomnia&#xD;
      symptoms will be treated beginning in pregnancy and into early postpartum. CBTI and MBTI will&#xD;
      address changes in sleep symptoms and challenges that emerge after childbirth. The&#xD;
      investigators will collect outcome data on insomnia symptoms and related health outcomes&#xD;
      (e.g., cognitive arousal, depression) after prenatal treatment and monthly across the first&#xD;
      postpartum year. The investigators will determine the efficacy of the investigator's CBTI and&#xD;
      MBTI protocols for perinatal insomnia relative to minimal intervention control. The&#xD;
      investigators will then compare the effects of CBTI and MBTI on short- and long-term&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is a commonly used self-report measure of insomnia symptoms that has been validated for use in community samples and clinical trials. The ISI scores range from 0-28, with a higher score indicating a greater severity of insomnia. ISI scores &lt; 8 after treatment indicate remission.</description>

    <time_frame>Will be assessed pretreatment, immediately posttreatment, and monthly across the 1st postnatal year</time_frame>
    <description>The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression (EPDS) is the most widely used depression measure in both pregnant and postnatal women. It is validated for use in community samples and clinical trials. The EPDS scores range from 0-30, with a higher score indicating a greater severity of depression.</description>

    <description>The Presleep Arousal Scale- Cognitive Factor is a commonly used self-report measure of nocturnal cognitive arousal that has been validated for use in community samples and clinical trials. The scores range from 8-40, with a higher score indicating a greater severity of nocturnal cognitive arousal.</description>
