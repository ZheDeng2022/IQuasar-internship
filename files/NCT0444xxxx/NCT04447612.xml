      The investigators propose a phase II randomized-controlled study on using durvalumab in&#xD;
      combination with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation and adjuvant&#xD;
      durvalumab, compared to induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation for&#xD;
      previously untreated locoregionally advanced stage III to IVA NPC. In parallel, the&#xD;
      investigators will also perform collateral tumor and serum biomarker studies which will be&#xD;
      correlated with the treatment response. The investigators will collect fresh tumour biopsies&#xD;
      at pretreatment, then serially after induction chemotherapy and after concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiation to investigate the change in microenvironment of the tumour and the&#xD;
      surrounding inflammatory cells before and after durvalumab. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      will also measure the change in number and intensity of PD-L1-positive circulating tumour&#xD;
      cells (CTC) before and after durvalumab and evaluate their correlation with treatment&#xD;
      response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) of the undifferentiated histology is endemic in southern China&#xD;
      and southeast Asia including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, with a peak annual&#xD;
      incidence of up to 30 per 100,000 persons. According to global cancer registry, NPC ranked&#xD;
      11th most common among all malignancies in China in 2008 with an incidence of 2.8/100,000&#xD;
      person-years in men and 1.9/100,000 person-years in females. It is highly associated with&#xD;
      prior infection with Epstein-Barr virus and thus it is a highly immune-related malignancy.&#xD;
      Treatment strategy is mainly based on the disease stage according to the American Joint&#xD;
      Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) staging system. In&#xD;
      general, stage I-II diseases are treated with radiation therapy alone while stage III-IV&#xD;
      diseases are treated with concurrent chemoradiation with or without adjunct chemotherapy&#xD;
      (induction or adjuvant). Intensive pretreatment workup including blood hematology and&#xD;
      biochemistry, dedicated head and neck imaging with computed tomography and magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging and positron-emission tomography with integrated computed tomography (PET-CT) and&#xD;
      plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) are essential in high-risk&#xD;
      locoregionally advanced diseases to confirm non-metastatic diseases, since the treatment&#xD;
      protocol and overall prognosis between locoregionally advanced (stage III-IVA) disease differ&#xD;
      significantly from metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite intensive radical treatment in the contemporary radiotherapy era with concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiation with or without adjunct chemotherapy, between 15% and 30% of these patients&#xD;
      with stage III-IVA disease develop metastatic diseases at distant sites. Further systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy following radical concurrent chemoradiation may not bring survival benefits,&#xD;
      attributed by the compromised physique following intensive radical concurrent chemoradiation&#xD;
      and the prolonged treatment-related toxicities brought by adjuvant chemotherapy. The recent&#xD;
      Hong Kong NPC Study Group NPC-0502 study failed to show survival benefit in patients with&#xD;
      post-treatment detectable plasma EBV DNA after a further 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      compared to those who just observed after radical concurrent chemoradiation. On the other&#xD;
      hand, induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation may be the more preferred&#xD;
      regimen due to the perceived efficacy of eradication of tumor micro-metastasis and early&#xD;
      shrinkage of primary tumor and bulky neck nodes, which allow a more radical radiotherapy dose&#xD;
      and better coverage of both the primary tumor and neck nodes. Very recently, a China&#xD;
      multi-centre phase III randomised-controlled trial demonstrated an improvement in&#xD;
      recurrence-free survival and overall survival (OS) with induction chemotherapy gemcitabine&#xD;
      plus cisplatin followed by concurrent chemoradiation versus concurrent chemoradiation alone.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, new treatment strategies must be developed to improve treatment outcomes of&#xD;
      these high-risk patients with stage III-IVA disease, which has become the major research&#xD;
      focus in the past decade. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that induction chemotherapy&#xD;
      followed by concurrent chemoradiation improved overall survival compared to concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiation in the era of modern radiotherapy with intensity-modulated radiation therapy&#xD;
      (IMRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune checkpoint inhibitors are now comprehensively and extensively tested in combination&#xD;
      with radiotherapy (RT) as well (NCT01935921, NCT01860430). It has been recently known that RT&#xD;
      increases the expression of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In turn, the MHC&#xD;
      class-I restricted tumor antigen-specific cells elicited by RT will upregulate interferons in&#xD;
      the tumors. This radiation-induced local inflammation and tumor-specific effector T cells&#xD;
      will provide an additional mechanism for tumor control by modification of the tumor&#xD;
      vasculature. In addition, RT will increase dendritic cell surface antigen presentation to T&#xD;
      cells and production of cytokines leading to recruitment and activation of leucocytes from&#xD;
      peripheral blood and extravasation to tumor parenchyma. These are part of the mechanisms of&#xD;
      abscopal effect, a phenomenon where the tumors at the sites far away from the irradiated&#xD;
      sites also regress after localized radiotherapy. Having learnt from the pivotal PACIFIC trial&#xD;
      on the use of consolidation therapy with durvalumab (anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody) which&#xD;
      confirmed the efficacy and safety of combination of chemoradiation and immunotherapy for&#xD;
      stage III non-small-cell lung cancer, it is prime time to consider incorporation of immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors into concurrent chemoradiation for other solid tumors like head and&#xD;
      neck squamous cell carcinoma and NPC. In concurrent +/- adjuvant setting for locoregionally&#xD;
      advanced NPC, there are at least two clinical trials on immune checkpoint inhibitors for&#xD;
      locoregionally advanced disease. The first one is a phase II single-arm study using nivolumab&#xD;
      in combination with concurrent chemoradiation with or without by adjuvant nivolumab for up to&#xD;
      3 months at different dose schedules (NCT03267498). A phase III multi-center&#xD;
      randomized-controlled trial (RCT) in China on the use of a locally-manufactured PD-1&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody (SHR-1210) every 4 weeks for 12 cycles starting at 4-6 weeks after&#xD;
      concurrent chemoradiation for stage III-IVA NPC versus no adjuvant therapy is currently under&#xD;
      way (NCT03427827). It is highly expected and eagerly awaited that immunotherapy with immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors will bring a new insight on the adjuvant treatment for NPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the above with promising synergy between radiation therapy and immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors, the investigators propose a phase II RCT on adding durvalumab in combination with&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation and adjuvant durvalumab for&#xD;
      previously untreated locoregionally advanced NPC. In parallel, the investigators will also&#xD;
      perform collateral tumor and serum biomarker studies which will be correlated with the&#xD;
      treatment response. The investigators will collect fresh tumour biopsies at pretreatment,&#xD;
      then serially after induction chemotherapy and after concurrent chemoradiation to investigate&#xD;
      the change in microenvironment of the tumour and the surrounding inflammatory cells before&#xD;
      and after durvalumab. In addition, the investigators will also measure the change in number&#xD;
      and intensity of PD-L1-positive circulating tumour cells before and after durvalumab and&#xD;
      evaluate their correlation with treatment response.&#xD;
