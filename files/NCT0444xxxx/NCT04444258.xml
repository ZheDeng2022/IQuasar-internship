      In this study, it was aimed to design virtual pregnancy for pregnancy formation, fetal and&#xD;
      placental development in the virtual reality environment and to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the designed virtual pregnancy on midwifery education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study, which will be the first in our second country in the world, aims to reduce the&#xD;
      application errors and determine deviations from normal by examining the formation of&#xD;
      pregnancy, maternal, fetal and placental changes, which form the basis of midwifery&#xD;
      profession, before having clinical experience. In this direction, the objectives of our study&#xD;
      are;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of the virtual pregnancy application, which will be designed for the first&#xD;
           time in our country,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ensuring the effective use of virtual pregnancy practice in midwifery education,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visualizing fetal and placental development with virtual pregnancy that will form the&#xD;
           basis of midwifery education,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To minimize the application errors experienced in clinical practices of midwifery&#xD;
           students,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To increase educational effectiveness, clinical and academic success by visualizing the&#xD;
           formation of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measuring cognitive loadings of students after education&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measuring students' sense of readiness&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Today, simulation education is gradually increasing and it is used effectively in the field&#xD;
      of midwifery education (1). It is observed that simulation education is used effectively&#xD;
      during midwifery, pregnancy, delivery or postpartum period (2,9). Providing a virtual reality&#xD;
      perspective to midwifery simulation training will enable students to use midwifery practices&#xD;
      effectively before going to clinical practice (3,5). Teaching of pregnancy, which forms the&#xD;
      basis of midwifery education, with virtual reality application will minimize clinical&#xD;
      application errors and will provide early diagnosis of fetal presentation and placental&#xD;
      anomalies that will be able to experience pregnancy and childbirth. They will be able to&#xD;
      effectively see the differences that occur as pregnancy progresses and the maternal-fetal&#xD;
      response to these differences. It is an up-to-date and important subject that will enable&#xD;
      them to see the pregnancy process, maternal-fetal development, placental differences and&#xD;
      mother's circulatory response in three dimensions without any obstacle in midwifery education&#xD;
      with virtual pregnancy application (4,6,7,8,9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this application is a newly developed technique, it will create a current perspective&#xD;
      on midwifery education and fill the gap in the virtual reality simulation in its education,&#xD;
      and will provide a basis for midwifery education and literature. Although there are studies&#xD;
      on simulation in midwifery or health in our country, there is no study that combines and&#xD;
      applies virtual reality and pregnancy in midwifery. In the studies related to virtual reality&#xD;
      and health field and midwifery profession in the world, the profession of virtual reality has&#xD;
      been supported in studies that have positive effects on education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of the Study: The study is planned to be an experimental study designed as an&#xD;
      experimental and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Location and Date of the Research: The study will be conducted in the Midwifery Department of&#xD;
      the Faculty of Health Sciences of Karabuk University and between November 2019 and October&#xD;
      2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research consists of 2 parts. In Part I, Virtual Reality Application will be Developed.&#xD;
      Virtual pregnancy software will be prepared through service procurement. For this, fetal&#xD;
      development and fetal physiology will be written in detail by researchers week by week and&#xD;
      virtual pregnancy will be created.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. The application of the research will be done in the department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECTION I: Development of Virtual Reality Application&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 1st part of the research, the software of virtual pregnancy will be prepared through&#xD;
      service procurement. For this, algorithms will be created by researchers in detail by writing&#xD;
      fetal development, fetal physiology and anatomy weekly. This algorithm will be transferred to&#xD;
      the glasses based on images and drawings (10,11) of fetal development weekly and weekly&#xD;
      images of fetal development from the book of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and the images shared&#xD;
      on the internet for fetal development. As stated in the budget form, service will be&#xD;
      purchased for the development of the Virtual Pregnancy software. TUBITAK will be applied for&#xD;
      this service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the Virtual Pregnancy application,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learning pregnancy formation week by week,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To follow placental development and to understand deviations from normal,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It will provide the opportunity to learn normal fetal development and besides,&#xD;
           information will be remembered for a long time. In this way, its effectiveness in&#xD;
           virtual pregnancy midwifery education will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Department: Application of the Research&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this last part of the research, the application part of the research has been started. The&#xD;
      research will consist of 3 groups, 2 experimental groups and a control group. 35 students&#xD;
      will be admitted to each group as a result of G-power analysis calculated with 0.95 power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Universe of the research will consist of 464 Midwifery students studying at Karabuk&#xD;
      University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will consist of 105 midwifery students, including 35 control, 35 experiment I and&#xD;
      35 experiment II, as a result of the G-power analysis calculated by 0.95 power, among the&#xD;
      midwifery students who took theoretical 4 hours in their curriculum within the scope of the&#xD;
      week of week, including fetal development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental I Group: After the Fetal Development Assessment Information Form (FEGBF), a&#xD;
      computer-aided and guided virtual reality application prepared by the researchers including&#xD;
      the phases of the fetus week by week will be watched and then FEGBF will be applied again by&#xD;
      changing the locations of the questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment II Group: Following the Fetal Development Assessment Information Form (FEGBF), the&#xD;
      computer-aided and unguided virtual reality application prepared by the researchers including&#xD;
      the fetal development week by week will be monitored, and then FEGBF will be applied again by&#xD;
      changing the locations of the questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group: FEGBF will be applied after 4 hours of theory training. Virtual pregnancy&#xD;
      application will not be watched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first stage: after 4 hours of theory training to all three groups, the information&#xD;
      form (FEGBF) prepared by the researchers to be used in this research will be applied as the&#xD;
      first test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage: No application will be made to the control group, computer-aided and&#xD;
      guided virtual reality application will be applied to the experimental group, and&#xD;
      computer-free and non-guided virtual application will be monitored to the experiment II&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the third phase: Post-tests will be applied by changing the locations of FEGBF questions.&#xD;
      After the 4-hour theory training for the control group, the posttest will be done after the&#xD;
      virtual birth application is watched on the experiment groups. Also, at this stage,&#xD;
      &quot;Cognitive Load Scale&quot; and &quot;Feel of Inventory&quot; will be applied to the experimental groups&#xD;
      after the application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the fourth stage: After 6 weeks, all three groups will be relocated to FEGBF, and the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the application of virtual birth will be examined in remembering and&#xD;
      recalling the information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order not to affect the groups determined by the computer-aided randomization program&#xD;
      according to the class list order as the experiment and control groups, the students will not&#xD;
      be informed which one is in the experiment and which is in the control group. Since virtual&#xD;
      pregnancy application will be applied to all experimental group students on the same day, the&#xD;
      possibility of students being affected by each other will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Students who could not participate in the study and were selected as a control group in&#xD;
      randomization will also be provided with virtual reality glasses after the study, so that all&#xD;
      students will see the virtual birth application and equality will be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization of the Study: The class list of the students who agree to participate in the&#xD;
      study will be transferred to the computer supported randomization program and the groups will&#xD;
      be determined. Sufficient sample size will be provided by choosing again from the students&#xD;
      who did not participate in the study for the last minute or who did not participate in the&#xD;
      study for reasons such as disease or control group, who accepted to participate in the study&#xD;
      and were not selected in randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teaching complex procedural information by simulation may cause cognitive load in learners&#xD;
      (6). The way to reduce cognitive load and increase teaching achievements is to establish a&#xD;
      sample based system. Thus, the use of rules and examples through modeling simplifies the&#xD;
      process of learning complex procedures. For this reason, the directive on the use of VR and&#xD;
      sample application videos will be presented to the learners as modeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection form: It is planned to apply a form consisting of 15 questions, which&#xD;
      includes the characteristics of the participants such as age, marital status, educational&#xD;
      status and family type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetal Development Assessment Information Form (FEGBF): For the preparation of the information&#xD;
      form, the latest literature information, midwifery core curriculum (EUÇEP) created by YÖK was&#xD;
      reviewed and an information form consisting of 42 questions related to fetal physiology&#xD;
      issues and phases of fetal development was prepared. The items in the information form will&#xD;
      be presented to the students in the form of a full sentence that can be true or false, and&#xD;
      students will be asked to answer these statements as &quot;True&quot; or &quot;False&quot;. Total response time&#xD;
      is 30 minutes. Correct answers will be evaluated as 1 point, Wrong answers will be evaluated&#xD;
      as 0 points. Wrong expressions were also used in the information form, and these items were&#xD;
      coded in reverse compared to others. The lowest score to be taken from the information form&#xD;
      is 0 and the highest total score is 42.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive Load Scale: Kılıç et al. (2004) &quot;Cognitive Load Scale&quot; (BYÖ) adapted to Turkish&#xD;
      will be used. It has single factor and nine points (very little, very little, little, partly&#xD;
      little, neither more nor less, more, more, more, more, more, more or more). The Cronbach&#xD;
      Alpha internal consistency coefficient of the original version was found to be 0.90. Kılıç et&#xD;
      al. (2004) in the adaptation study, the Cronbach Alpha internal consistency coefficient was&#xD;
      found as .78. The lowest point of the scores obtained from the scale is 1.00, the middle&#xD;
      point is 5.00 and the highest point is 9.00. Participants scoring below five points were&#xD;
      evaluated as &quot;cognitively overloaded&quot;, and participants scoring above 5 points were evaluated&#xD;
      as &quot;cognitively overloaded&quot; (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Availability Sensitivity Scale: It is a scale that was originally 7-likert type in Turkish&#xD;
      validity reliability in 2018, but reduced to 5-likert type in Turkish validity. Cronbach&#xD;
      Alpha reliability coefficient of the scale was calculated as 0.91. The scale measures the&#xD;
      sense of presence in virtual reality-based learning environments. The scale has 5 factors&#xD;
      (lower size): Participation (Factor 1), Cohesion / Surrounding (Factor 2), Sensory Commitment&#xD;
      (Factor 3), Interaction (Factor 4) and Interface Quality (Factor 5) and consists of 29&#xD;
      questions (13 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Aspect of the Research: The study will start after obtaining the ethics committee&#xD;
      permission from the non-interventional research ethics committee of Karabük University, and&#xD;
      the informed volunteer consent form will be obtained from each student who agrees to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis of the Research: Analysis of the data of the study will be done using IBM SPSS&#xD;
      for Mac book 24 version. Average values will be taken for socio-demographic characteristics.&#xD;
      In study models with experiment / control groups, the experimental group is tested / tested&#xD;
      and finally tested. The same test will be applied to the control group without experiment.&#xD;
      Whether the difference between the measurements of the three groups is meaningful or not will&#xD;
      be calculated using &quot;z or t test for independent groups&quot;. For statistical significance, p&#xD;
      &lt;0.05 level will be accepted. While evaluating the study data, frequency distributions for&#xD;
      categorical variables and descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum,&#xD;
      maximum) for numerical variables will be used. Whether there is a relationship between two&#xD;
      categorical variables will be checked by Chi-Square analysis and whether there is a&#xD;
      relationship between two numerical variables will be examined by Pearson Correlation&#xD;
      analysis. If the number of groups is two, whether there is a difference between the variables&#xD;
      and the scores, it will be tested with the &quot;significance test of the difference between the&#xD;
      two averages&quot; (independent t test), and if the group number is more than two, &quot;one way&#xD;
      variance analysis&quot; (ANOVA). As a result of the analysis, first of all, the Levene test for&#xD;
      variance homogeneity will be checked by the &quot;multiple comparison test&quot; (Bonferroni or&#xD;
      Tamhane's T2), from which group or groups the difference originated.&#xD;
