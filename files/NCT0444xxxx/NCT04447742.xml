  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Intestinal microbiota composition is fundamental to human health and undergoes&#xD;
      critical changes within the first two years of life. Factors probably influencing the&#xD;
      microbiota are the maternal microbiota and the general environment in Switzerland. However,&#xD;
      the development of the intestinal microbiota is incompletely understood. Gaining knowledge of&#xD;
      the trajectory of microbiota maturation is likely key to the understanding of the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of many pathologies in childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The investigators aim for a deep understanding of the maturation of the healthy infant&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota regarding composition, diversity and metabolic activities. The&#xD;
      investigators aim for identifying parameters affecting microbiota maturation and effects of&#xD;
      the microbiota on infant outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators will recruit 120 pregnant mothers who will be followed as&#xD;
      mother-baby pairs until 10 years of age. Infants will be followed clinically to determine&#xD;
      adequate growth and development as well as pathology including abdominal pain.&#xD;
      Epidemiological parameter and infant nutrition will be assessed. The investigators will&#xD;
      collect biological samples such as stool, maternal milk, vaginal swaps, placenta swabs and&#xD;
      skin swaps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Species composition and diversity will be assessed by 16S sequencing. Metagenomic shotgun&#xD;
      sequencing and bacterial messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) analysis will inform about&#xD;
      metabolic potential and metabolic activity of the microbiota. Mass spectrometry will assess&#xD;
      the small molecule content of stool and maternal milk samples. Network analysis will be used&#xD;
      to assess the complex relationships between bacteria metabolic activities and small molecular&#xD;
      content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: The investigators expect an increase in complexity and metabolic potential&#xD;
      and activity with age. Microbiota parameters will differ according to nutrition and might&#xD;
      predict infant outcomes such as growth and abdominal pain. Systematic analysis of sequential&#xD;
      maternal and infant bacteria samples from stool, skin and maternal milk will help&#xD;
      characterizing bacterial transfer from mother to infant Conclusion: The investigators propose&#xD;
      an observational study of healthy Bern mother baby pairs with clinical characterisation and&#xD;
      biological sampling. Advanced analysis tools will be used to characterise the microbiota and&#xD;
      address mechanistic questions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methods for sample analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary objective and outcome/ endpoint of the study, bacterial content of infant&#xD;
      stool will be analyzed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mass spectrometry to assess intestinal content (metabolome). Techniques have been&#xD;
           established in the laboratory of Prof. U. Sauer who already collaborated with the&#xD;
           investigators' group in previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequencing for bacterial species composition as&#xD;
           well as microbial diversity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bacterial full genome metagenomics shotgun sequencing to identify bacterial genes&#xD;
           present (metabolic potential of the microbiota).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bacterial mRNA sequencing to assess transcription and a functional role of the&#xD;
           microbiota (metabolic activity of microbiota).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of the intestinal virome and eukaryotic intestinal populations by appropriate&#xD;
           sequencing or culturing techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies in human milk and stool and the&#xD;
           interaction of antibodies with intestinal bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the secondary endpoints identical analyses will be performed in skin swabs, maternal&#xD;
      milk, maternal vaginal swabs, maternal placenta probes and maternal stool. Parameters for&#xD;
      infant growth, neurodevelopment, immune maturation and potential occurrence of pathology will&#xD;
      be assessed at every visit. Maternal and infant nutrition, hygiene, socioeconomic status and&#xD;
      clinical history will be assessed by questionnaires at every visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further follow-up experiments with the acquired samples are possible. Specifically,&#xD;
      individual bacteria strains can be isolated and cultured in vitro and also tested alone or in&#xD;
      combination in experimental animals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial sequencing by the methods described above will also inevitably identify maternal or&#xD;
      infant DNA sequences, since metagenomic shotgun sequencing cannot differentiate between&#xD;
      bacterial and human DNA. These human DNA sequences will not be analyzed within the scope of&#xD;
      this project. However, these sequences might be the subject of future studies. Study&#xD;
      participants will therefore be asked for permission to analyze human DNA from mother and/ or&#xD;
      child at the page for &quot;further analyses&quot; within the consent form. An option to &quot;opt out&quot; for&#xD;
      human DNA analysis will be provided and refusal will not lead to exclusion from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any findings of clear relevance to the health of the participant (i.e. mother or child) will&#xD;
      be reported to the participant in collaboration with their treating pediatrician.&#xD;
      Participants will need to inform the study team if they do not wish to be informed.&#xD;
