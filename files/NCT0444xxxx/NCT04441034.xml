    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a major healthcare problem with an annual cost of above $600 billion. The&#xD;
      quality of data available for treatments of chronic pain is not optimal. Generalizability of&#xD;
      explanatory randomized controlled trial data is problematic as these trials exclude up to 90%&#xD;
      of patients: leaving out real-world patients with serious medical and psychological&#xD;
      comorbidities. Pragmatic trials embedded in patient care compare effectiveness of currently&#xD;
      used treatments in real-world application leading to findings that generalize to broader&#xD;
      range of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The changes in clinical practice and workflow necessary to integrate this type of research&#xD;
      within patient care present pragmatic challenges. In this research, the overall objective is&#xD;
      to overcome these challenges using an open-source learning health care system - CHOIR. CHOIR&#xD;
      is currently used to track patients' clinical trajectory and treatment response across&#xD;
      multiple academic sites resulting in over 25 publications characterizing chronic pain.&#xD;
      Through the pilot studies, the investigators have already developed a point-of-care&#xD;
      randomization for CHOIR that facilitates integration of research and patient care by allowing&#xD;
      the physicians to randomize patients during clinic visits. The investigators have already&#xD;
      demonstrated feasibility of the randomization and data collection platform in two ongoing&#xD;
      pilot pragmatic clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are proposing to better integrate pragmatic research within clinical&#xD;
      practice through conducting a randomized comparative effectiveness trial in 450 patients with&#xD;
      chronic pain comparing effectiveness of anti-convulsants and anti-depressants (two most&#xD;
      commonly used classes of medications for treatment of chronic pain). The investigators will&#xD;
      also perform a qualitative interview with all physicians in our clinic to study the impact of&#xD;
      integrating pragmatic research into clinical care. The investigators will use the data&#xD;
      available in CHOIR as well as the real-world data generated from this clinical trial to&#xD;
      build, validate and test a model to predict what clinical characteristics can predict&#xD;
      response to either of these classes of medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is the first step to use flexible point-of-care randomization to compare&#xD;
      effectiveness of different treatments in different subgroups of patients whenever equipoise&#xD;
      exists. The prediction model will guide decision making process of clinicians choosing&#xD;
      between these medications based on clinical characteristics of individual patients.&#xD;

      This study aims to increase generalizability of clinical data for current treatments of&#xD;
      chronic pain by integrating pragmatic comparative effectiveness research within patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic pain is a major healthcare problem with annual cost of above $600 billion. The&#xD;
      quality of data available for treatments of chronic pain is not optimal. Generalizability of&#xD;
      explanatory randomized controlled trial data is problematic as these trials exclude up to 90%&#xD;
      of patients: leaving out real-world patients with serious medical and psychological&#xD;
      comorbidities. Thus, national institutions and societies (including National Institute of&#xD;
      Health) have called for pragmatic trials embedded in patient care to compare effectiveness of&#xD;
      currently used treatments leading to findings that generalize to broader range of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal is to integrate pragmatic research within clinical pain practice; the&#xD;
      investigators will then collect high-quality longitudinal data in the form of randomized&#xD;
      comparative effectiveness research. This research will be a platform for development of&#xD;
      precision health in the field of pain medicine. Personalized treatment options for each&#xD;
      patient will not be possible without understanding how effective these treatments are in&#xD;
      real-world application. The changes in clinical practice and workflow necessary to integrate&#xD;
      this type of research within patient care present pragmatic challenges. In this research, the&#xD;
      overall objective is to overcome these challenges using an open-source learning health care&#xD;
      system - CHOIR. CHOIR is currently used to track patients' clinical trajectory and treatment&#xD;
      response across multiple academic sites resulting in over 25 publications characterizing&#xD;
      chronic pain. Through pilot studies, the investigators have already developed a point-of-care&#xD;
      randomization for CHOIR that facilitates integration of research and patient care by allowing&#xD;
      the physicians to randomize patients during clinic visits. The investigators have already&#xD;
      demonstrated feasibility of the randomization and data collection platform in two ongoing&#xD;
      pilot pragmatic clinical trials. To move this forward, the investigators are proposing to&#xD;
      integrate pragmatic research within clinical practice through conducting a randomized&#xD;
      comparative effectiveness trial in 450 patients with chronic pain pursuing the following&#xD;
      aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To compare effectiveness of anti-convulsants and anti-depressants in patients with&#xD;
      chronic pain using point-of-care randomization. Anti-convulsants and anti-depressants are two&#xD;
      most-commonly used classes of medications for treating chronic pain. Clinicians usually&#xD;
      choose between them based on clinical judgement; these decisions often lack clinical&#xD;
      evidence. The investigators need to understand how effective these medications are in&#xD;
      real-world applications, and which patients respond better to each class of medication. The&#xD;
      investigators will thus randomize the patients in our clinic to either anti-convulsants or&#xD;
      anti-depressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: The participants are going to be randomized by the treating pain provider&#xD;
      using point-of-care randomization during the clinic visit. Point-of-care randomization will&#xD;
      be done through CHOIR using computer generated random numbers. The randomization algorithm&#xD;
      will disregard the patients who are randomized but decline to participate in the study to&#xD;
      maintain a balanced number of patients in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The participants will be randomized to receiving either classes of medications.&#xD;
      Then using a patient centered approach, the participant and their treating pain provider will&#xD;
      choose one medication within the class the patient are randomized to. The decision will be&#xD;
      based on participants' comorbidities, goals of care, preferences and best interest. For&#xD;
      example, if a participant is randomized to receive an anti-convulsant and wants to avoid any&#xD;
      weight gain, topiramate would be an appropriate choice; or if a participant is randomized to&#xD;
      receive an anti-depressant and has poor sleep, a tricyclic anti-depressant would be an&#xD;
      appropriate choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue the medications for at least 6 months provided that they can&#xD;
      tolerate the side effects, consider the treatment effective, and are willing to continue the&#xD;
      treatment. Titration of doses based on participants' tolerance and response is allowed based&#xD;
      on clinical decision of the treating pain provider. Concomitant use of other analgesics or&#xD;
      pain medications as well as pain interventions is also allowed. The investigators allow the&#xD;
      participants to stop medications in consultation with their primary pain provider if they&#xD;
      cannot tolerate side effects or experience no benefit. In these circumstances, we encourage&#xD;
      the patients and their physicians to choose another medication within the class of&#xD;
      randomization; however, the investigators will not limit the choices of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: The participants will receive electronic surveys similar to their routine&#xD;
      clinical care. The investigators will send out the surveys at one, three, and six months&#xD;
      after randomization. These surveys are going to be abbreviated to include average and worst&#xD;
      Numerical Rating Scale (11-point NRS) of pain; pain catastrophizing scale; National Institute&#xD;
      of Health (NIH) Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures&#xD;
      for pain interference, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance; and questions about&#xD;
      medication compliance, dose and adverse events.24-30 Data about use of other analgesics and&#xD;
      medications, and pain interventions will also be recorded at these intervals from&#xD;
      participants' electronic health records. If the participants do not complete the surveys&#xD;
      within five days of receipt of the survey link, they will be contacted to be reminded of the&#xD;
      survey. The investigators will also record participants' baseline characteristics including&#xD;
      age, sex, main pain diagnosis, other pain diagnoses, psychological comorbidities, medical&#xD;
      comorbidities, medication use, and education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation Arm: The patients who do not enter the randomization arms (patient refusal or&#xD;
      contraindication to receive one class of medications) will be included in an observation arm&#xD;
      after obtaining informed consent. The investigators will collect data from these patients&#xD;
      identical to what explained above for randomized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To characterize the level of satisfaction of physicians with pragmatic comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness trials. The investigators will perform a qualitative interview with all&#xD;
      physicians in our clinic before recruitment phase and then every six months until the end of&#xD;
      recruitment phase. Hypothesis. Integrating pragmatic randomized comparative effectiveness&#xD;
      research will not affect the satisfaction of physicians in our clinic with the flow of&#xD;
      clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To characterize factors impacting responsiveness to anti-convulsants and&#xD;
      anti-depressants in treating chronic pain. The investigators will use reduction in patients'&#xD;
      reported pain as response to a treatment. The investigators will use multivariate logistic&#xD;
      regression and machine learning algorithms to identify predictive factors for response to&#xD;
      these two treatment arms. The investigators predict that lower socioeconomic status; longer&#xD;
      duration of pain; widespread pain; and worse scores in pain catastrophizing, physical&#xD;
      function, pain interference, depression, anxiety, and social function will predict lower&#xD;
      responses to anti-convulsants and anti-depressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary: Successful completion of these aims will advance the ability to: (1) use flexible&#xD;
      point-of-care randomization to compare the effectiveness of different treatments in different&#xD;
      subgroups of patients whenever equipoise exists; (2) apply the identified predictive factors&#xD;
      to develop decision support systems to determine best choice of medication for individual&#xD;
      patients; inching closer to precision health; and (3) use the feedback from our physicians to&#xD;
      better integrate research and clinical care.&#xD;
