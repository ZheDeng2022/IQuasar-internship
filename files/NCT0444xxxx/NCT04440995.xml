  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pectoral nerve blocks (PECS blok) are used in postoperative analgesia after breast surgery in&#xD;
      nowadays. Many studies shows that pectoral nerve blocks is effective for reducing pain and&#xD;
      postoperative opioid consumption undergoing mastectomy. This study was planned to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of intraoperative PECS block for postoperative analgesia after robot breast&#xD;
      surgery and immediate breast reconstruction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty patients were randomly allocated into two groups by computerised process, each&#xD;
      including 30 patients. PECS group (P) received general anesthesia and pectoral nerve&#xD;
      block(PECS block) with 025% ropivacaine after surgical resection of breast by operator.&#xD;
      Control group(C) only received general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Patient -controlled analgesia(PCA) device provides fentanyl for postoperative pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary outcome measures total dose of fentanyl consumption during the postoperative 24&#xD;
      hours, and secondary outcome measures pain scores at rest and movement.&#xD;

PECS block were applied under vision using blunted tip cannula(27G, 30mm) after surgical resection of breast by operator. 0.25% ropivacaine 10ml was injected into fascia between pectoralis major and minor muscles. 0.25% ropivacaine 20ml was injected into fascia between pectoralis minor and serratus anterior muscles at the level of the third rib. Breast reconstruction is performed after PECS block</description>
