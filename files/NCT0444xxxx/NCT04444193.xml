    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of durvalumab in combination with lenvatinib&#xD;
      in participants with advanced and recurrent endometrial carcinoma.The primary hypothesis of&#xD;
      this study are that patients with advanced and recurrent endometrial carcinoma could benefit&#xD;
      from durvalumab plus lenvatinib with respect to: 1)Progression Free Survival (PFS) ; 2)&#xD;
      Objective Response Rate (ORR); and Overall survival (OS). The investigators design a clinical&#xD;
      study to explore whether the combination above as a treatment in patients with advanced and&#xD;
      recurrent endometrial carcinoma could prolong PFS and to analyze potential immune biomarker&#xD;
      of therapeutic response.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The combination of Lenvatinib and Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking has great&#xD;
      potential in the treatment of advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer. This trial is&#xD;
      designed as a prospective, open label study for 20 patients with advanced (recurrent,&#xD;
      refractory or metastatic) endometrial cancer, including carcinosarcoma of the uterus. The aim&#xD;
      is to investigate the efficacy of the combination therapy of Lenvatinib 80-120mg daily orally&#xD;
      and durvalumab 1500mg by IV infusion every 4 weeks in terms of progression free survival.&#xD;
