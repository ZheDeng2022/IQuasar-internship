  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke impacts nearly 400,000 Canadians annually. Three quarters of stroke survivors will&#xD;
      live with minor to severe impairments or disabilities; which require rehabilitation care.&#xD;
      Strong evidence supports beginning rehabilitation as soon as the patient's medical status has&#xD;
      stabilized and continuing following discharge from acute care. Access to optimal services is&#xD;
      hampered, however, by travel distances to access rehabilitation, the lack of opportunities&#xD;
      for structured and formal interprofessional communication among service providers, and&#xD;
      failures to engage the patient and family members in a structured decision making process.&#xD;
      Moreover, adherence to rehabilitation treatments has been shown to be suboptimal. Many&#xD;
      patients refuse their outpatient rehabilitation treatments outright or decrease the duration&#xD;
      and/or frequency of their treatments over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this proposed mixed methods pragmatic clinical trial is to evaluate an&#xD;
      intervention that provides patients who have experienced stroke the opportunity to return&#xD;
      home safely after their acute hospital stay, to encourage patient (and family) engagement in&#xD;
      their rehabilitation care, and to overcome challenges of access to patient-centered&#xD;
      interprofessional rehabilitation care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed intervention will entail 220 patients (and family) to receive rehabilitation&#xD;
      care through remote, live treatment sessions with an interdisciplinary group of clinicians&#xD;
      (called telerehabilitation) versus standard of care (n = 110 patients). Five rehabilitation&#xD;
      teams will be trained to develop rehabilitation treatment plans that engage the patient and&#xD;
      family, while taking advantage of a telerehabilitation platform to engage the patient/family.&#xD;
      Grounded in findings gathered through a Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR) funded&#xD;
      pilot study, the primary study objective is to evaluate process, clinical outcomes and costs&#xD;
      of telerehabilitation in comparison with usual care. Through qualitative interviews with&#xD;
      patients and family as well as clinicians, a second objective of this pragmatic, controlled&#xD;
      trial is to explore and describe contextual factors (both personal and environmental) that&#xD;
      will help the delivery of care, and improve patient's outcomes while fully using technology&#xD;
      to deliver stroke rehabilitation care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study represents a unique, highly relevant opportunity to minimize both knowledge and&#xD;
      practice gaps, while producing robust, indepth data on the factors related to the&#xD;
      effectiveness of telerehabilitation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Stroke impacts nearly 400,000 Canadians annually. Three quarters of stroke survivors will&#xD;
      live with minor to severe impairments or disabilities; which require rehabilitation care&#xD;
      representing &gt;$3.6 billion in Canadian healthcare expenditure every year. Strong evidence&#xD;
      supports beginning rehabilitation as soon as the patient's medical status has stabilized and&#xD;
      continuing following discharge from acute care, ideally in the patient's community. Access to&#xD;
      optimal services is hampered, however, by travel distances to access rehabilitation, the lack&#xD;
      of opportunities for structured and formal interprofessional communication among service&#xD;
      providers, and failures to engage the patient and family members in a structured decision&#xD;
      making process. Even when travel is not a barrier, adherence to rehabilitation treatments has&#xD;
      been shown to be suboptimal. Many patients refuse their outpatient rehabilitation treatments&#xD;
      outright or decrease the duration and/or frequency of their treatments over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this proposed mixed methods pragmatic clinical trial is to evaluate an&#xD;
      intervention that provides patients who have experienced stroke the opportunity to return&#xD;
      home safely after their acute hospital stay, to encourage patient (and family) engagement in&#xD;
      their rehabilitation care, and to overcome challenges of access to patient-centered&#xD;
      interprofessional rehabilitation care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed intervention will entail 220 patients (and family) to receive rehabilitation&#xD;
      care through remote, live treatment sessions with an interdisciplinary group of clinicians&#xD;
      (called telerehabilitation) versus standard of care (n = 110 patients). Five rehabilitation&#xD;
      teams will be trained to develop rehabilitation treatment plans that engage the patient and&#xD;
      family, while taking advantage of a telerehabilitation platform to engage the patient/family.&#xD;
      Grounded in findings gathered through a CIHR funded pilot study, the primary study objective&#xD;
      is to evaluate process, clinical outcomes and costs of telerehabilitation in comparison with&#xD;
      usual care. Through qualitative interviews with patients and family as well as clinicians, a&#xD;
      second objective of this pragmatic, controlled trial is to explore and describe contextual&#xD;
      factors (both personal and environmental) that will help the delivery of care, and improve&#xD;
      patient's outcomes while fully using technology to deliver stroke rehabilitation care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This application has been developed by an interdisciplinary team of researchers, local&#xD;
      healthcare providers from each region involved, two patient partners who have experienced&#xD;
      stroke, provincial network stakeholders, and decision makers, all engaged in the successful&#xD;
      implementation of stroke guidelines and jurisdictional strategic plans. A panel of Canadian&#xD;
      health system knowledge users rounds out the team, to enhance the proposed intervention, to&#xD;
      communicate the relevance and anticipated use of the findings within their province, and to&#xD;
      foster adaptation of improved stroke care elsewhere. Finally, the study has been endorsed by&#xD;
      several knowledge users from the Quebec Ministry of Health as well as the Quebec Heart and&#xD;
      Stroke Foundation. Considering contrasts between rehabilitation practices and the Canadian&#xD;
      Stroke recommendations and the lack of relevant, robust data, this study represents a unique,&#xD;
      highly relevant opportunity to minimize both knowledge and practice gaps, while producing&#xD;
      robust, indepth data on the factors related to the effectiveness of telerehabilitation.&#xD;
