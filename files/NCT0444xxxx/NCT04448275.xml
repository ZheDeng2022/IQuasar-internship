  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the effect of Neurodynamics Nerve flossing on femoral neuropathy in patients&#xD;
      with haemophilia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: heamophilia is one of the serious chronic disorders in children and adolescents&#xD;
      which results in less physical activities and restlessness hours than their peer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will hypnotize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurodynamics Nerve flossing will have a significant effect on femoral neuropathy in patients&#xD;
      with haemophilia&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      will the Neurodynamics Nerve flossing has an effect on femoral neuropathy in patients with&#xD;
      haemophilia?&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Haemophilic patients with Femoral Neuropathy will be randomly divided in two equal groups&#xD;
      control group which will receive conventional selected exercise program and study group will&#xD;
      receive the same exercise training program in addition to Neurodynamics Nerve flossing three&#xD;
      times per week for three successive months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Evaluation will done pre and post interventions included:&#xD;
&#xD;
      femoral nerve motor conduction velocity, muscle test For Iliopsoas and Quadriceps muscles and&#xD;
      Pain visual analogue scale.&#xD;

    <description>Femoral Nerve Tension Test is a neural tension test used to stress the femoral nerve&#xD;
A positive test was be reproduction of the patient's symptoms as burning discomfort in the groin or anterior thigh occurred if there was femoral nerve involvement.</description>

    <description>The group Manual muscle test was used for testing the strength of iliopsoas and quadriceps muscles, according to the Oxford Scale as the Muscle strength is often rated on a scale of 0/5 as follow:&#xD;
(0/5) no contraction of muscle, (1/5) muscle flicker contraction, but no movement (2/5) movement possible, but not against gravity (test the joint in its horizontal plane), (3/5) movement possible against gravity, but not against resistance by the therapist, (4/5) movement possible against some resistance by the examiner and (5/5) normal strength</description>
