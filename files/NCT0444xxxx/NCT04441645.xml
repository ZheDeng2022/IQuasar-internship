    <textblock>
      The study aims to (1)compare differences of global cognitive function, working memory,&#xD;
      executive function, language function, and quality of life between institutionalized older&#xD;
      adults with MCI and with mild AD. Doing so, we can have a better understanding of the&#xD;
      cognitive performance and life quality at pre-dementia and dementia;(2)explore the effects of&#xD;
      the interventions with different acupoints(acupoints on head, acupoints on body, and&#xD;
      acupoints on head and body) on global cognitive function, working memory, executive function,&#xD;
      language function, and quality of life among institutionalized older adults with MCI and with&#xD;
      mild AD;(3) further investigate the long-term effects of the interventions on global&#xD;
      cognitive function, working memory, executive function, language function, and quality of&#xD;
      life among institutionalized older adults with MCI and with mild AD; doing this, we can&#xD;
      explore the pathological mechanism of the changes in the cognitive function through&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessments and the association between the changes in cognitive function&#xD;
      and in quality of life. We will recruit 32 residential care homes, with 256 older adults with&#xD;
      MCI and with mild AD for this single blind cluster randomized controlled trial with repeated&#xD;
      measures study. The facilities will be randomly assigned to the acupoint-on-head group,&#xD;
      acupoint-on-body group, acupoint-on-head-and-body group and control group, with a ratio of&#xD;
      1:1:1:1. Interventions are developed based on the theory of Chinese medicine. Except routine&#xD;
      care, the intervention groups will receive the acupressure once per day, five times per week,&#xD;
      a total of 12 weeks. Data will be collected at baseline, the 4th and 8th weeks during the&#xD;
      intervention, the end of the intervention, and the1st, 4th, and 8th months after the&#xD;
      intervention. The control group only will receive routine care and data collection is the&#xD;
      same as the intervention groups. Data assessors will not involve in the interventions and not&#xD;
      know the group allocation. The data analysis will use intent-to-treat analysis. The multiple&#xD;
      regression analysis, mixed effect model for repeated measure analysis, subgroup analysis, and&#xD;
      product-of-coefficient test will be performed to examine the effects of the interventions on&#xD;
      cognitive function and quality of life, and the associations among the changes in the&#xD;
      dependent variables.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Although evidence has demonstrated that acupressure effectively improves older patients'&#xD;
      symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbance, behavior and psychological symptoms of dementia, etc.), it&#xD;
      is still lack of the study to investigate the effect of the acupressure on cognitive function&#xD;
      and quality of life among older adults with cognitive impairment in long-term care settings&#xD;
      and its long-term effects. In addition, according to statistical data for epidemiological&#xD;
      investigation, the majority is people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia&#xD;
      (mild AD); hence, it is vital to prevent these two groups from having dementia or getting&#xD;
      worse. The study aims to (1)compare differences of global cognitive function, working memory,&#xD;
      executive function, language function, and quality of life between institutionalized older&#xD;
      adults with MCI and with mild AD. Doing so, we can have a better understanding of the&#xD;
      cognitive performance and life quality at pre-dementia and dementia;(2)explore the effects of&#xD;
      the interventions with different acupoints(acupoints on head, acupoints on body, and&#xD;
      acupoints on head and body) on global cognitive function, working memory, executive function,&#xD;
      language function, and quality of life among institutionalized older adults with MCI and with&#xD;
      mild AD;(3) further investigate the long-term effects of the interventions on global&#xD;
      cognitive function, working memory, executive function, language function, and quality of&#xD;
      life among institutionalized older adults with MCI and with mild AD; doing this, we can&#xD;
      explore the pathological mechanism of the changes in the cognitive function through&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessments and the association between the changes in cognitive function&#xD;
      and in quality of life. This single blind cluster randomized controlled trial with repeated&#xD;
      measures study will complete in 2 years. We will recruit 32 residential care homes in Taipei&#xD;
      City, with 256 older adults with MCI and with mild AD. The facilities will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the acupoint-on-head group, acupoint-on-body group, acupoint-on-head-and-body&#xD;
      group and control group, with a ratio of 1:1:1:1. Interventions are developed based on the&#xD;
      theory of Chinese medicine and the trained research assistants, also having traditional&#xD;
      Chinese nursing training, will perform the interventions. Except routine care, the&#xD;
      intervention groups will receive the acupressure once per day, five times per week, a total&#xD;
      of 12 weeks. Data will be collected at baseline, the 4th and 8th weeks during the&#xD;
      intervention, the end of the intervention, and the1st, 4th, and 8th months after the&#xD;
      intervention. The control group only will receive routine care and data collection is the&#xD;
      same as the intervention groups. Data assessors will not involve in the interventions and not&#xD;
      know the group allocation. The data analysis will use intent-to-treat analysis. The multiple&#xD;
      regression analysis, mixed effect model for repeated measure analysis, subgroup analysis, and&#xD;
      product-of-coefficient test will be performed to examine the effects of the interventions on&#xD;
      cognitive function and quality of life, and the associations among the changes in the&#xD;
      dependent variables. This study will promote the professional nursing autonomy and improve&#xD;
      life quality of the institutionalized older adults.&#xD;
