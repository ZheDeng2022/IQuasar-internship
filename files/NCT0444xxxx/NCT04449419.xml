      The most important pathogenic factor of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in the&#xD;
      Western world is chronic exposure to tobacco smoke, which induces oxidative stress not only&#xD;
      in the respiratory system, but in all the body. Mitoquines are circulating hormones directly&#xD;
      or indirectly produced by dysfunctional mitochondria, whose function is to protect the body&#xD;
      of the consequences of oxidative stress. The objective of this project is to study the&#xD;
      modifications that are produced in the serum mitoquines from patients with COPD of varying&#xD;
      severity and to assess their potential applications in the clinic.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterized by progressive and&#xD;
      hardly reversible obstruction of the airways, which basically affects the small airways&#xD;
      (chronic obstructive bronchiolitis), variably associated with destruction of the pulmonary&#xD;
      parenchyma (emphysema). 10% of people over the age of 45 years have COPD . COPD is expected&#xD;
      to be the third leading cause of mortality in the world by 2020. The leading cause of COPD in&#xD;
      Western countries is chronic tobacco smoke contact with the airways, with massive entry of&#xD;
      many toxic substances and reactive oxygen species (ROS) to the body that induce oxidative&#xD;
      stress (OS). OS in COPD is both exogenous (ROS inhaled) and endogenous (ROS induced by&#xD;
      tobacco toxics and by the own disease). Some researchers consider that OS in COPD is closely&#xD;
      related to a peculiar type of accelerated cellular senescence associated with a chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory process which not only affects to the respiratory system, but also many other&#xD;
      parts of the body (skeletal muscle, cardiovascular system, global metabolism, immunological&#xD;
      system, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central, but not exclusive, role in oxidative stress,&#xD;
      cellular senescence and chronic inflammation. Therefore, a better understanding of the&#xD;
      mitochondrial dysfunction underlying COPD would make possible to better understand the&#xD;
      physiopathology and to identify new possible therapeutic targets. The mitochondrial&#xD;
      alterations of COPD at the bronchopulmonary, muscular and immunological areas are widely&#xD;
      documented both morphologically and pathophysiologically. Mitochondrial dysfunction may be&#xD;
      primary (congenital) or secondary (acquired, as in the case of tobacco smoking). It is a&#xD;
      broad concept including impaired cellular energy production, excessive generation of ROS or&#xD;
      of some metabolites from the Krebs cycle in the mitochondria, and loss of quality control of&#xD;
      essential mitochondrial components that finally lead to abnormal output of intramitochondrial&#xD;
      molecules (mtDNA, ATP, cytochrome c, Romo1 etc.) to the cytosol and extracellular fluids.&#xD;
      Some of these molecules behave like DAMPs (damage associated molecular patterns) and induce&#xD;
      an activation of innate immunity, and thus inflammation. Blood levels of Cytochrome C and&#xD;
      Romo1 have been proposed as markers of oxidative stress. The main function of the&#xD;
      mitochondria is the generation of ATP, the basic energy- carrying molecule for the&#xD;
      maintenance of the living cell. The generation of ATP is produced from other energy&#xD;
      precursors in the mitochondria through the oxidative phosphorylation system coupled to the&#xD;
      electron transport chain (OXPHOS/ETC). These organelles also play a fundamental role in 1)&#xD;
      the generation of specific metabolites of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins, which are&#xD;
      essential for multiple cellular functions, 2) the synthesis of hemes and steroid hormones, 3)&#xD;
      the management of the &amp;quot;clusters&amp;quot; of Fe and S, 4) cellular homeostasis of&#xD;
      intracellular calcium, 5) immune response, both innate and acquired, and 6) the regulation of&#xD;
      some types of apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cells react continuously to the environmental changes to which they are exposed. In&#xD;
      situations of cellular stress (e.g. caloric deprivation, lack of specific nutrients, changes&#xD;
      in temperature, etc.) cell nucleus reacts by sending signals to the mitochondria so that they&#xD;
      modify their function to adapt to the change (anterograde signaling from the nucleus to the&#xD;
      mitochondria: for example physical exercise consumes ATP in the muscle cell, which activates&#xD;
      the AMPK, which activates the nuclear transcription cofactor PGC-1alpha, which in turn&#xD;
      activates OXPOS/ETC and mitochondrial biogenesis). On the other hand, when there is a&#xD;
      stressful situation in the mitochondria themselves (e.g. excessive production of oxygen free&#xD;
      radicals, unfolded intramitochondrial proteins, etc) signals are sent to the nucleus for it&#xD;
      to modify the production of proteins intended to prevent/correct mitochondrial damage,&#xD;
      including chaperones, antioxidants or proteolytic enzymes proteolytic (autonomic or&#xD;
      intracellular retrograde signalling).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitochondria have recently been shown to be capable of directly or indirectly generate&#xD;
      peptides that not only influence the own cell that produces them, but they have at distance&#xD;
      effects(non-autonomous or extracellular retrograde signalling). These substances, discovered&#xD;
      by Dillin´s group are called mitoquines and send signals from tissues with stressed&#xD;
      mitochondria to the whole body, being hormones that prepare the whole organism to respond to&#xD;
      the cellular stress it´s going to be subjected to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitoquines are released when there is any kind of mitochondrial stress (congenital or&#xD;
      acquired mutations in the mtDNA, disorders of the OXPHOS/ETC that generate oxidative stress,&#xD;
      mitochondrial toxins, etc.). In mammals mitochondrial stress is generally associated with the&#xD;
      so-called integrated cellular response to the stress (ICRS)&amp;quot;. One of the most important&#xD;
      mechanisms of ICRS is the UPR (Unfolded protein response), in which mitochondria participate&#xD;
      in a coordinated way with the endoplasmic reticulum system, and the cell nucleus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are at least two different types of mitoquines: 1) primary mitoquines, encoded in&#xD;
      mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and 2) secondary mytokines, encoded in the nucleus DNA (nDNA),&#xD;
      whose secretion is regulated through activation signals from the stressed mitochondria to the&#xD;
      nDNA (e.g. ATF4, etc). Humanin (HN), MOTS-c (Mitochondrial ORF of the Twelve S-c), and six&#xD;
      peptides similar to humanin (SHLPs 1-6) are considered primary mitoquines, although the&#xD;
      number may be higher. Until recently, it was thought that mitochondrial DNA encoded only 37&#xD;
      genes (13 peptides found exclusively into the mitochondria, all of them sub-units of the ETC,&#xD;
      22 transfer RNAs -tRNA-, and 2 ribosomal RNAs -rRNA-) RNAs. We now know that 16s and 12s rRNA&#xD;
      contain sORFs (&amp;quot;short open reading frames&amp;quot;) that translate secretory peptides from&#xD;
      20-30 aa. It is not known what intimate mechanisms regulate the synthesis and release of&#xD;
      these mitoquines, although it is possible that they are related to a mitochondrial ribosomal&#xD;
      activation. Regarding secondary mitoquines (those encoded in nuclear DNA) under the&#xD;
      activation of ATF4 we know fibroblastic growth factor 21 (FGF21), growth and development&#xD;
      factor 15 (MIC1/GDF15), follistatin and intermedin-adrenomedullin2. These mitoquines also&#xD;
      respond to other stimuli, independent of the mitochondria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Humanin is a peptide of 21 or 24 aa, with multiple cytoprotective functions against&#xD;
      mitochondrial damage (increases the synthesis of antioxidants and chaperones for 4 unfolded&#xD;
      proteins). It is anti-inflammatory (lowers the inflammatory cytokines and raises the&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory cytokines) and antiapoptotic (blocks apoptotic factors such as Bak and&#xD;
      IGFBP3), through at least 2 membrane receptors and several interactions with other&#xD;
      intracellular and extracellular proteins, in many tissues (nervous system, liver, heart,&#xD;
      vascular wall, skeletal muscle, retinal pigment epithelium, gonads etc). It also has&#xD;
      beneficial metabolic effects (decreases insulin resistance at the central level, protects the&#xD;
      pancreatic beta cell from oxidative stress and has negative feedback with IGF1). Recently it&#xD;
      has been proven that people with high levels of this hormone have less cognitive impairment&#xD;
      with age and are also very longevous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MOTS-c is another small peptide of 16 aa, encoded mtDNA, but synthesized exclusively in the&#xD;
      cytosolic ribosomes, that also has beneficial antioxidant and metabolic effects, as it&#xD;
      decreases insulin resistance and prevents obesity. On the other hand, it increases resistance&#xD;
      against some infections increases and decreases bone resorption, so it may have&#xD;
      antiosteoporotic effects. Both hormones are measurable in the blood by ELISA, although there&#xD;
      are certain discrepancies in their plasma levels depending on the test used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FGF21 is a well-characterized hormone that stimulates ketogenesis and beta oxidation of fatty&#xD;
      acids. Its secretion is regulated by fasting and activation of receptors PPAR-α, but it is&#xD;
      also known that it rises in any situation of mitochondrial stress that activates&#xD;
      mitochondria- to-nucleus signals. The MIC1/GDF15 is another circulating hormone that reduces&#xD;
      hunger, activating a specific receptor level (GFRAL) found in the postrema area and the&#xD;
      nucleus of the solitary tract. Elevated levels of GDF15 have been found in cancer cachexia&#xD;
      and in many other situations, among them COPD . It is also released when the&#xD;
      mitochondrial-to-nucleus signals are activated. In COPD, of all the mitoquines reviewed here,&#xD;
      there is only information regarding GDF15 blood levels, but there are no data in the&#xD;
      literature regarding the levels of the other mitoquines. As COPD progresses, mitoquines blood&#xD;
      levels are likely to increase progressively, expressing further deterioration of&#xD;
      mitochondrial function, although their levels could increase only up to a certain level, and&#xD;
      then decrease when mitochondrial damage is unbearable, thus constituting a kind of&#xD;
      mitohormetic response. HYPOTHESIS Mitoquines, expressed in the context of mitochondrial&#xD;
      dysfunction, are altered in COPD patients and are associated with worst clinical outcomes.&#xD;
      Furthermore, mitoquines can be used as prognostic factors and potential therapeutic targets&#xD;
      in COPD. OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - To describe mitoquines levels in a control group, a group of stable COPD outpatients&#xD;
           and a group of exacerbated COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - To describe differences in semitones levels in different groups of COPD patients&#xD;
           (different levels of obstruction, patients with high risk of exacerbation vs. no risk of&#xD;
           exacerbation, patients with CAT score&amp;lt;10 vs rest of patients, patients with low&#xD;
           Fat-Free- Mass index (FFMI) vs. rest of the patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. -To evaluate the correlation between semitones and different clinical outcomes such as&#xD;
           FFMI, distance walked in 6 minute walking test, FEV1, CAT score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - To evaluate if mitoquines can be used to predict future risk of exacerbation and&#xD;
           hospital admission.&#xD;

      respiratory condition and and patients relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.2 in two-sided test 30 subjects are&#xD;
      necessary in the first group and 90 in the second to find as statistically significant&#xD;
      proportion difference expected to be of 0.45 in group 1 and 0.1 in group 2. Anticipating a&#xD;
      drop-out rate of 5%. The ARCSINUS approximation. This calculation has been performed&#xD;
      according to previously published studies performed by our group. We calculate a simple size&#xD;
      of 120 patients with COPD, 30 patients with COPD exacerbation, and 30 controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target enrollment/sample size 180 Anticipated rate of enrollment 25 patients each month&#xD;
      Estimated study start date: Samples collected in Biobank from 01.12.2019 Samples sent to&#xD;
      biochemistry lab 01.03.2020 Estimated study completion date: (end of follow up) 05.04.2021&#xD;
      Study Design and methods Observational prospective study. Patients will be recruited from&#xD;
      COPD outpatient clinics, Smoking cessation outpatient clinics and from patients hospitalized&#xD;
      due to COPD exacerbation. All patients will be given written informed consent to participate.&#xD;
      This study was already approved by the Ethics Committee of Cantabria (CEIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stable COPD (40 years or older with baseline post-bronchodilator forced expiratory&#xD;
           volume in 1 s [FEV1]/forced vital capacity [FVC] ≤0.70) will be recruited during their&#xD;
           regular follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control group: age- and sex-matched volunteers without previous diagnosis of COPD or&#xD;
           other respiratory conditions, and with post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1&#xD;
           s [FEV1]/forced vital capacity [FVC] &amp;gt;0.70.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exacerbated COPD patients: Patients with previous diagnosis of COPD (40 years or older&#xD;
           with baseline post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1]/forced vital&#xD;
           capacity [FVC] ≤0.70) admitted to hospital pulmonology Ward due to COPD exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Charlson Comorbidity Index will be recorded from all participants in the study. Patients with&#xD;
      acute exacerbations 1 month prior to the study, patients included in pulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
      during the study or 6 months before the inclusion period, with other potential causes of&#xD;
      sarcopenia (malignant diseases, heart failure, hyperthyroidism or other chronic devastating&#xD;
      diseases) and patients with known chronic kidney diseases or recent acute kidney injury will&#xD;
      be excluded from the study. Blood samples and all other measurements will be made the same&#xD;
      day patients accept to enter the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the enrollment in the study, COPD patients will be divided into different categorical&#xD;
      groups: (1) non symptomatic patients (COPD Assessment Test [CAT] score &amp;lt; 10) versus&#xD;
      symptomatic patients (CAT score ≥10), (2) non dyspneic patients (modified Medical Research&#xD;
      Council dyspnea score [mMRC] &amp;lt; 2) versus dyspneic patients (mMRC ≥2), high risk of&#xD;
      exacerbation patients (those with 2 or more exacerbations requiring treatment with&#xD;
      antibiotics or systemic steroids or at least one hospital admission in the previous year)&#xD;
      versus low risk of exacerbation patients, and (4) former smokers versus active smokers. After&#xD;
      entering the study, blood samples will be obtained, and patients will be followed up for 1&#xD;
      year (one visit after 6 months and one visit after 12 months) and exacerbations and hospital&#xD;
      admissions will be recorded prospectively. During the follow-up period, all clinical&#xD;
      investigators in the study will be blinded to the mitoquines results. Along this period,&#xD;
      patients with possible pulmonary exacerbations will be instructed to go freely to the&#xD;
      Emergency Department of the Hospital and that team of doctors will freely decide to&#xD;
      hospitalize them or not, according to their own clinical criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the mitoquines levels patients will be divided into two groups: one composed of&#xD;
      those within the highest quartile of the mitoquines and the other group will include patients&#xD;
      in the other three quartiles of the levels of mitoquines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements Basal Dyspnoea will be recorded using mMRC dyspnoea scale. CAT score will be&#xD;
      recorded by self-administered questionnaire. Previous exacerbations will be recorded from&#xD;
      clinical records from patients included in the study. Spirometry will be measured according&#xD;
      to the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) in all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition will be estimated by a bioelectrical impedance device (OMROM BF511, Omrom,&#xD;
      Japan), and the FFMI will be calculated as the ratio of the FFM to the height in meters&#xD;
      squared. The 6-min walking test will be performed according to the protocol of the American&#xD;
      Thoracic Society: patients were asked to walk as far as they can in 6 min in a 30-m straight&#xD;
      corridor without any interruption. At the end of the test, the distance walked by the&#xD;
      patients and dyspnea will be recorded. Humanin and MOTS-c will be measured by ELISA&#xD;
      (Mybiosource), FGF21 y GDF15. Will be measured by ELISA (Quantikine). If possible Romo1 will&#xD;
      be measured also by ELISA. The study will be divided in 3 visits: VISIT 1: Blood sample&#xD;
      collection and clinical characteristics. VISIT 2: 6 months after visit 1: Exacerbations and&#xD;
      hospital admissions (number and date) after visit 1. VISIT 3: 12 months after visit 1:&#xD;
      Exacerbations and hospital admissions (number and date) after visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints Primary endpoint: Mitoquines can be used to estimate hospital admission risk&#xD;
      in COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. -Mitoquines can be used to estimate COPD exacerbation risk in COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Mitoquines are altered in COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - Mitoquines are altered in COPD exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - Mitoquines correlate with different COPD variables (FEV1, FFMI..).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical plan or data analysis Data will be presented as mean ± SD for normally&#xD;
      distributed data or median (interquartile range) for nonparametric data. Differences between&#xD;
      groups will be analyzed using unpaired t tests for parametric data or Mann-Whitney tests for&#xD;
      nonparametric data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlations between data sets were examined using the Pearson (r) correlation coefficient&#xD;
      for parametric data or the Spearman rank (rs) correlation coefficient for nonparametric data.&#xD;
      Normal distribution will be tested using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier estimates will be used to calculate the proportion of participants who have an&#xD;
      event over time. Univariate and multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional risk&#xD;
      analysis will be performed using SPSS Software version 25.00 for PC to analyze the&#xD;
      development of the first events according to basal levels of mitoquines, and to identify risk&#xD;
      factors associated with exacerbations and hospitalization. Differences will be considered&#xD;
      significant if p values were less than 0.05. All reported p values will be two-sided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations and ethical considerations This is a single-centre study thus, it must be&#xD;
      replicated in multicentric studies, using a higher number of patients coming from different&#xD;
      countries. Although expensive and complicated, some techniques such as muscle biopsy,&#xD;
      ergometry, muscle mass quantified using CT or shuttle test could be performed in order to&#xD;
      have a better overview of muscle mass and function in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No potential harm for patients is expected from this study. This study was approved by&#xD;
      Cantabria ethics committee (Code: :2018.276). Although the study is funded by the company&#xD;
      GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) it is an independent study and the investigators do not receive any&#xD;
      financial compensation.&#xD;
