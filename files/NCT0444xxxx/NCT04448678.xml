  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a test of an existing health insurance education program (HIEP) in adolescent and&#xD;
      young adult (AYA) individuals (aged 18-39) diagnosed with cancer. The study will evaluate&#xD;
      whether the HIEP delivered by patient navigators improves participants' health insurance and&#xD;
      cost-related literacy compared to usual navigation care, which does not include education on&#xD;
      insurance and medical costs. The study team hypothesizes that: The HIEP will improve&#xD;
      participants' health insurance and cost-related literacy compared to usual navigation care.&#xD;
      Specifically, that participants in the intervention arm will report greater 1) health&#xD;
      insurance and cost literacy, including confidence with provider communication about costs, 2)&#xD;
      familiarity with ACA policies, and 3) improvement in financial distress related to medical&#xD;
      costs. Participants will fill out a survey upon enrollment and a follow up survey 3 months&#xD;
      after meeting with a patient navigator where they may or may not receive the HIEP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to refine and pilot test an existing health insurance education&#xD;
      program (HIEP) to improve health insurance and cost-related literacy among adolescent and&#xD;
      young adult (AYA) individuals who have recently been diagnosed with cancer. This study will&#xD;
      be conducted within the Huntsman-Intermountain Adolescent and Young Adult (HI-AYA) Cancer&#xD;
      Care Program, which is a unique collaboration between the Huntsman Cancer Institute and&#xD;
      Intermountain Healthcare, the largest oncology providers in Utah. Initially, age-related&#xD;
      differences related to health insurance and cost literacy among AYAs diagnosed with cancer&#xD;
      ages 18-26 and 27-39 years will be identified, and the HIEP materials will be adapted&#xD;
      accordingly. The HIEP delivered by the HI-AYA patient navigators, will be investigated to see&#xD;
      if it improves participants' health insurance and cost-related literacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon enrollment, participants will fill out a survey containing questions about their current&#xD;
      health insurance plan, financial status, demographics, health insurance knowledge, and&#xD;
      financial toxicity. Participants will then be randomized into separate trial arms after which&#xD;
      participants in both groups will meet with a HI-AYA patient navigator. Participants in the&#xD;
      interventional arm will receive 4 educational sessions surrounding health insurance use and&#xD;
      laws (four sessions total occurring approximately every two weeks). These educational&#xD;
      sessions will be conducted, in person, over video conference calls, or over the telephone,&#xD;
      and will cover:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  health insurance terms and concepts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  insurance coverage (insurance cards, bills, schedule and explanation on benefits)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  health insurance laws, rights and the appeals process&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  budgeting and resources. These sessions will be scheduled with each participant&#xD;
           according to their availability, with the goal of meeting every other week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately three months after meeting with the patient navigator, participants in both&#xD;
      arms of the trial will fill out a second survey, including similar questions to those in the&#xD;
      first survey as well as questions surrounding satisfaction with the HIEP and the patient&#xD;
      navigator delivery for those who received the HIEP. After the post survey is complete, a&#xD;
      small subset of participants in both the intervention and control arm will be randomly&#xD;
      selected to complete an interview to better understand satisfaction with patient navigation,&#xD;
      the intervention, recommendations for modifications on delivery modality, and recommendations&#xD;
      for intervention topics and content modifications to identify components of the HIEP that&#xD;
      require refinement prior to potential scaling of the intervention to a larger sample. Another&#xD;
      small subset of participants will be randomly selected to complete an interview from the&#xD;
      control arm to discuss their satisfaction with their patient navigation and to ask how they&#xD;
      found resources concerning health insurance during their treatment.&#xD;
