  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-HBc positive liver donors frequently have occult HBV infection, and several studies in&#xD;
      HBsAg-negative subjects have shown that there is often the detection in the liver of&#xD;
      covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). In the setting of liver transplantation and&#xD;
      immunosuppresion, grafts from antiHBc positive donors may cause de novo HBV infection&#xD;
      (defined by the development of positive HBsAg and/or detectable serum or liver HBV DNA in&#xD;
      previously HBsAg recipients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active immunization may be successful in up to 20% of patients who received an anti-HBc+&#xD;
      liver during transplantation after the first vaccination schedule, and up to 30% after a&#xD;
      second vaccination course. Responders to vaccination could safely halt nucleos(t)ide analog&#xD;
      prophylactic therapy with no risk of HBV reactivation during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also hypothesize that an impaired antigen-specific adaptive cell-mediated immunity at&#xD;
      baseline explain the lack of response&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the efficacy of HBV vaccination in liver transplant recipients who&#xD;
           received a liver from an anti-HBc positive donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the safety of nucleos(t)ide treatment interruption in those patients achieving&#xD;
           a response to HBV vaccination&#xD;

      HYPOTHESIS The hypothesis of the study is that active immunization may be successful in up to&#xD;
      20% of patients who received an anti-HBc+ liver during transplantation after the first&#xD;
      vaccination schedule, and up to 30% after a second vaccination course. Responders to&#xD;
      vaccination could safely halt nucleos(t)ide analog prophylactic therapy with no risk of HBV&#xD;
      reactivation during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, an impaired antigen-specific adaptive cell-mediated immunity at baseline may explain&#xD;
      the lack of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the efficacy of HBV vaccination in liver transplant recipients who&#xD;
           received a liver from an anti-HBc positive donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the safety of nucleos(t)ide treatment interruption in those patients achieving&#xD;
           a response to HBV vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate which clinical and virological variables are associated with a protective&#xD;
           response to HBV vaccination (including time from liver transplant, type of&#xD;
           immunosuppressive therapy and vaccination prior liver transplantation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the role of HBV specific CD8 responses in developing a protective response to&#xD;
           vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the relationship between intrahepatic cccDNA-HBV levels and the outcome after&#xD;
           vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
           STUDY DESIGN This is a multi-center, open-label study in liver transplant recipients.&#xD;
           Four transplant centers will include non-HBV liver transplant recipients who received a&#xD;
           graft from an HBV anti-core positive donor. All patients should be under prophylactic&#xD;
           nucleos(t)ide treatment (NA). Individuals will undergo HBV vaccination with double dosis&#xD;
           vaccine (40 ug) and protective response will be evaluated at the end of a first course&#xD;
           of vaccination. Response will be defined as anti-HBs levels &gt; 100 IU/L. In patients who&#xD;
           do not respond to a first course of vaccination, a second course will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In patients achieving a protective immune response, prophylactic NA treatment will be&#xD;
           interrupted and follow-up will be extended until 2 years after treatment interruption.&#xD;
           Among those patients achieving vaccination response, a booster dose will be given if&#xD;
           antiHBs levels fall below 100 IU/L during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size calculation Sample size has been calculated in order to be able to identify&#xD;
           variables that able to predict response/non response. The estimated number of anti-core&#xD;
           positive recipients in all centers according to anti-core prevalence in general&#xD;
           population is 160 patients (40 patients/center). According to previous reported data,&#xD;
           around 20% would achieve a response to a first course of vaccination and an additional&#xD;
           30% would achieve response after a second course. With a confidance interval of 95% and&#xD;
           accepting a precision level of 5% and an estimated loss rate of 15%, the calculated&#xD;
           sample size would be 114 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study flowchart All patients will receive 40 ug of HBV vaccine, at 0, 1 and 3 months&#xD;
           time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In patients not achieving protective anti-HBs titers (≥ 100 IU/L) 1 month after the last&#xD;
           HBV vaccine dose, the same vaccine schedule will be repeated (40 ug of vaccine 0, 1 and&#xD;
           3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients not achieving protective anti-HBs titers (≥ 100 IU/L) 1 month after last HBV&#xD;
           vaccine dose will be considered non-responders and will continue on NA therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In patients achieving protective anti-HBs titers, prophylaxis with nucleoside analogues&#xD;
           will be interrupted and patients will be followed for a minimum period of 24 months.&#xD;
           Blood tests will be performed every 6 months including liver tests, markers of HBV&#xD;
           reactivation and anti-HBs. If anti-HBs levels fall below &lt;100 IU/L at any time point of&#xD;
           follow-up, a single boost (40 ug) will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In case of HBV reactivation (HBsAg or HBV-DNA positive) during follow-up, oral NA&#xD;
           therapy will be restarted with high barrier to resistance drugs such as entecavir or&#xD;
           tenofovir.&#xD;
