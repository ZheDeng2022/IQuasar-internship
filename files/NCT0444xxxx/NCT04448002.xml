      The aim is to test the efficacy of AIM2ACT and long-term maintenance of treatment effects in&#xD;
      a fully-powered randomized controlled trial with 160 early adolescents with poorly controlled&#xD;
      persistent asthma, ages 12-15 years, and a caregiver&#xD;

    <description>Measured via the Asthma Control Test questionnaire which has 5 items that assesses frequency of daytime and nocturnal asthma symptoms, activity limitations, and perceptions of disease control.Adolescents will complete all 5 items independently of caregivers. Scores range from 5 (poor control of asthma) to 25 (complete control of asthma), with higher scores reflecting greater asthma control. An ACT score &gt;19 indicates well-controlled asthma.&quot;</description>

    <description>AIM2ACT is a mobile health tool that is designed to facilitate collaborative asthma management between early adolescents and their caregivers. AIM2ACT contains the following components: 1) ecological momentary assessment to identify personalized strengths and weaknesses in asthma self-management behaviors; 2) collaborative identification and tracking of goals that help early adolescents to become increasingly independent in managing their asthma; and 3) a suite of engaging skills training videos to help dyads understand how to use AIM2ACT and work together to set asthma self-management goals, develop and achieve the goals articulated in a behavioral contract, and engage in problem-solving communication.</description>

    <intervention_name>mHealth Attention Control Condition</intervention_name>
    <description>Dyads in the mHealth attention control condition will not receive personalized asthma management feedback, will not be guided through collaborative identification and tracking of asthma self-management goals, and will not have access to skills training videos. Instead, dyads will receive static educational information on their smartphones about behavioral management techniques they can use to target improving asthma self-management.</description>
