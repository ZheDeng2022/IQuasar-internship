    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of atypical antipsychotics on cardiac&#xD;
      safety. The secondary purpose was to understand the rate of QTc prolongation in&#xD;
      electrocardiogram induced by atypical antipsychotics. And try to construct the model of&#xD;
      cardiac monitoring index. We conducted a randomized trial in which patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia who were first on or off medication for more than two weeks took a single&#xD;
      atypical antipsychotic (Risperidone, Aripiprazole, Ziprasidone, Amisulpride, Quetiapine) for&#xD;
      12 weeks and monitored changes in biochemical, electrocardiogram and other indicators. And&#xD;
      then 50 patients with adverse cardiac reactions (ADRs) taking antipsychotics were selected to&#xD;
      review the data, analyze and construct a monitoring model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that atypical antipsychotics with different mechanisms of action have&#xD;
      different effects on cardiac safety in patients with schizophrenia, and that they are&#xD;
      applicable to different populations. The monitoring index model can reduce the occurrence of&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity and improve the prognosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atypical antipsychotics, also known as new antipsychotics, are a group of drugs that act on&#xD;
      the central nervous system to treat schizophrenia, psychotic disorder or bipolar disorder.&#xD;
      Compared with typical antipsychotics, atypical antipsychotics have the advantages of good&#xD;
      efficacy and fewer side effects. Therefore, currently, atypical antipsychotics are widely&#xD;
      used in clinical practice. In recent years, the effects of atypical antipsychotics on&#xD;
      metabolism and cardiovascular system have attracted more and more clinical attention. Studies&#xD;
      have found that long-term use of atypical antipsychotics can lead to arrhythmias,&#xD;
      drug-induced myocarditis, and even cardiac arrest. Since antipsychotics can cause cardiac&#xD;
      adverse events in patients with schizophrenia, accompanied by medical complications,&#xD;
      resulting in a generally shorter life span of 15-25 years compared with the general&#xD;
      population, cardiac safety assessment of drugs for patients with schizophrenia is becoming&#xD;
      increasingly important. But the domestic study of antipsychotics in the cardiovascular field,&#xD;
      especially about the safety of heart systemic evaluation are few and far between, so this&#xD;
      research has focused on patients with schizophrenia in China people use different mechanisms&#xD;
      of atypical antipsychotics (Risperidone, Aripiprazole, Ziprasidone, Amisulpride, Quetiapine)&#xD;
      on heart safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage, a total of 350 schizophrenia patients were enrolled who were either not&#xD;
      on medication for the first time or stopped for more than 2 weeks. They were treated with&#xD;
      atypical antipsychotics respectively, follow-up of 12 weeks, evaluating the effects of&#xD;
      antipsychotics on cardiac function and structure in patients with schizophrenia from general&#xD;
      data, biochemistry, electrocardiogram, etc. In the second stage, 50 patients of adverse&#xD;
      cardiac reactions caused by taking antipsychotics were selected from enrolled subjects, and a&#xD;
      retrospective analysis(day1, week4, week12, and week24) was conducted to try to build a&#xD;
      cardiac safety detection indicator model, so as to understand the impact of antipsychotics on&#xD;
      cardiac safety. More rational use of antipsychotics in the context of ensuring clinical&#xD;
      efficacy and minimum side effects, and the use of monitoring indicator models to reduce the&#xD;
      occurrence of cardiac toxicity, improve the safety of antipsychotics in use.&#xD;
