    <textblock>
      This study developed a culturally appropriate cognitive behavioral group prevention program&#xD;
      for Mainland Chinese university students in Hong Kong. The effects of the group prevention&#xD;
      program on psychological distress, acculturative stress, cognitions, emotions, and&#xD;
      post-migration growth were examined.&#xD;

      Detailed description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research has found the effectiveness of group cognitive behavioral therapy in&#xD;
      improving international students' mental health and facilitating their psychological&#xD;
      adaptation. However, this kind of research in Chinese societies is scant and previous studies&#xD;
      lack control group in study design. This study developed an 8-session culturally appropriate&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral group prevention program for Mainland Chinese university students in&#xD;
      Hong Kong. Research design of randomized controlled trial was adopted. Program effectiveness&#xD;
      was evaluated at both cognitive and emotional levels, including psychological distress,&#xD;
      acculturative stress, emotions, automatic thoughts, sense-making coping, core belief&#xD;
      re-examination and post-migration growth.&#xD;
