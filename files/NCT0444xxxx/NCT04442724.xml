  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the usefulness of implanting small 24-K gold fiducial&#xD;
      markers around a bladder tumor site, so that a Radiation Oncologist can identify the original&#xD;
      tumor location at the time of radiation treatment. Other goals of the study include assessing&#xD;
      whether a new MRI imaging technology can help with detection of bladder cancer earlier and&#xD;
      more accurately when evidence of bladder cancer is not visible by scope.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study of fiducial markers in patients with localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer will&#xD;
      enroll patients electing bladder preservation with tri-modal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24-K gold fiducial markers will be endoscopically implanted around the tumor resection area&#xD;
      to mark the location of the tumor site, into the bladder wall submucosa space under direct&#xD;
      visualization via a coaxial needle. The markers are visible on all imaging modalities,&#xD;
      including all available on-table imaging (e.g., portal and cone-beam CT) used for&#xD;
      radiotherapy. Reliable fiducial marker placement within the bladder may have the potential to&#xD;
      advance bladder-sparing management of localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the effectiveness of bladder-preserving multi-modal treatment of&#xD;
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer with and without fiducial marker placement to guide&#xD;
      radiotherapy targeting and to minimize collateral radiation. In addition, this study intends&#xD;
      to verify the accuracy and report on the sensitivity and specificity of mp-MRI imaging to&#xD;
      detect the presence and location of bladder cancer.&#xD;
