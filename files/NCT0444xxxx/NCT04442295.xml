  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stoke Therapeutics is evaluating the safety and tolerability of single and multiple ascending&#xD;
      doses of STK-001 in patients with Dravet syndrome. Change in seizure frequency, overall&#xD;
      clinical status, and quality of life will be measured as secondary endpoints in this&#xD;
      open-label study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      STK-001 is an investigational new medicine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. STK-001 is&#xD;
      an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that is intended to increase the level of productive SCN1A&#xD;
      messenger RNA (mRNA) and consequently increase the expression of the sodium channel Nav1.1&#xD;
      protein. This RNA-based approach is not gene therapy, but rather RNA modulation, as it does&#xD;
      not manipulate nor insert genetic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STK-001 is designed to upregulate Nav1.1 protein expression from the nonmutant (wild-type)&#xD;
      copy of the SCN1A gene to restore physiological Nav1.1 levels. Nav1.1 levels are reduced in&#xD;
      people with Dravet syndrome. Stoke has generated preclinical data demonstrating&#xD;
      proof-of-mechanism for STK-001.&#xD;
