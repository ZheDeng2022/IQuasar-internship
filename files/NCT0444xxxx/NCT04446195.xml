      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the clinic. Colonoscopy&#xD;
      is an important means of screening, diagnosis and treatment of colorectal diseases. The&#xD;
      accuracy of diagnosis and the safety of treatment are closely related to the quality of&#xD;
      intestinal preparation. Inadequate bowel preparation leads to poor effect of colonoscopy,&#xD;
      which will reduce the effectiveness and safety of colonoscopy, increase the difficulty and&#xD;
      time of colonoscopy, and increase the need of repeated colonoscopy. There are many factors&#xD;
      that lead to poor bowel preparation. Recently, a number of studies at home and abroad have&#xD;
      evaluated the risk factors related to insufficient bowel preparation. Obesity, men, older&#xD;
      age, previous colon surgery history, accompanied by other diseases (such as diabetes,&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease), taking antidepressants and other factors can affect the effect of bowel&#xD;
      preparation. Although the research of intestinal preparation intervention and education&#xD;
      methods has made a lot of progress, but in a series of reports, there are still a&#xD;
      considerable number of patients in colonoscopy problems of intestinal preparation. At&#xD;
      present, there are few researches on individualized intervention aiming at the risk factors&#xD;
      of inadequate bowel preparation in China, so it is urgent to explore individualized bowel&#xD;
      preparation scheme suitable for different populations. Therefore, the purpose of this&#xD;
      experiment is to study individualized dryness aiming at the risk factors of insufficient&#xD;
      bowel preparation in patients with the risk factors of insufficient bowel preparation The&#xD;
      effect of pre-treatment on the quality of intestinal preparation can provide reference for&#xD;
      improving the quality of intestinal preparation in patients with inadequate intestinal&#xD;
      preparation.&#xD;

      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a malignant tumor originates from colorectal mucosa epithelium. It&#xD;
      is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world. Incidence rate of lung cancer is&#xD;
      second only to lung cancer and breast cancer worldwide. In recent years, with the continuous&#xD;
      improvement of people's living standard, changes in diet and diet structure and aging of&#xD;
      population, the incidence rate and mortality rate of colorectal cancer in China have been&#xD;
      increasing. A significant proportion of colorectal cancer patients have no characteristic&#xD;
      clinical symptoms and reported symptoms. Many colorectal cancers have reached the middle and&#xD;
      late stage when they are discovered, and their prognosis is poor. It can be seen that early&#xD;
      prevention of colorectal cancer is very important. Timely screening for colorectal adenomas&#xD;
      and endoscopic resection are the most effective measures to prevent colorectal cancer.&#xD;
      Colonoscopy is currently recognized as the gold standard for colorectal cancer screening,&#xD;
      which can not only detect early precancerous lesions, but also remove precancerous lesions&#xD;
      and block the formation of colorectal cancer.Colonoscopy is an important means of screening,&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of colonic diseases. The accuracy of diagnosis and the safety of&#xD;
      treatment are closely related to the quality of intestinal preparation. Adequate intestinal&#xD;
      preparation can make patients obtain higher intestinal cleanliness, ensure the integrity and&#xD;
      correctness of colonoscopy, improve the detection rate of polyps and adenomas, increase the&#xD;
      rate of cecal intubation and reduce the follow-up time The occurrence of adverse events such&#xD;
      as shortened interval, intestinal perforation and missed diagnosis is of great significance&#xD;
      for the realization of high-quality enteroscopy diagnosis and treatment.Bowel preparation is&#xD;
      not a simple cathartic process, it involves all aspects of communication between patients and&#xD;
      doctors. Good intestinal preparation includes following dietary restrictions before&#xD;
      examination, applying adequate amount of appropriate cathartic drugs during intestinal&#xD;
      preparation, waiting for the appropriate time interval between colonoscopies after intestinal&#xD;
      preparation, and appropriate amount of active drinking water, etc. Strict dietary restriction&#xD;
      and bowel cleaning are the necessary conditions to improve the quality of bowel preparation.&#xD;
      Kang x et al. Showed that 18% to 30.5% of patients had insufficient bowel preparation [.&#xD;
      Clinically, there may be more patients with poor bowel preparation. Inadequate bowel&#xD;
      preparation will lead to longer operation time, more difficult catheterization of cecum,&#xD;
      lower detection rate of adenoma and shorter follow-up time, which will increase the cost of&#xD;
      colonoscopy. At present, Boston scale is widely used to evaluate the quality of intestinal&#xD;
      preparation. The Boston scale divides the colon into three segments (cecum and ascending&#xD;
      colon; hepatic, transverse and splenic flexure; descending, sigmoid and rectum). According to&#xD;
      the worst-case to clean score, it is divided into four grades (0-3), with a total score of&#xD;
      0-9. Boston scale â‰¥ 6 points indicates that the intestinal preparation is qualified.There are&#xD;
      many factors that lead to poor bowel preparation. Recently, a number of studies at home and&#xD;
      abroad have evaluated the risk factors related to insufficient bowel preparation. Obesity,&#xD;
      men, older age, previous colon surgery history, accompanied by other diseases (such as&#xD;
      diabetes, Parkinson's disease), taking antidepressants and other factors can affect the&#xD;
      effect of bowel preparation. Combined with the literature at home and abroad and the&#xD;
      characteristics of Chinese people, the guidelines for gut preparation related to the&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of digestive endoscopy in China suggest that the following factors&#xD;
      are the risk factors for inadequate gut preparation in China: chronic constipation, failure&#xD;
      to prepare the gut in strict accordance with the requirements (such as high fiber diet before&#xD;
      operation, insufficient peg intake), body mass index &gt; 25 kg / m2, age &gt; 70 years old, colon&#xD;
      surgery history With other diseases (such as diabetes, Parkinson's disease, history of stroke&#xD;
      or spinal cord injury, etc.), application of tricyclic antidepressants or anesthetics.In&#xD;
      addition, the guidelines for gut preparation related to the diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
      digestive endoscopy in China suggest that if the patient's gut preparation is not sufficient&#xD;
      during the endoscopic examination, it should be actively evaluated and remedial measures&#xD;
      should be taken or the endoscopic examination should be rescheduled. For the patients with&#xD;
      the risk factors of insufficient intestinal preparation, other auxiliary measures can be&#xD;
      taken to improve the intestinal preparation, such as the 4L peg program, low residue diet&#xD;
      three days before endoscopic diagnosis and treatment, gastrointestinal motility promoting&#xD;
      drugs, etc.; in addition, it is also of great value to further strengthen the education&#xD;
      related to the optimization of intestinal preparation for the patients.In recent years, with&#xD;
      the continuous development of China's economy, the continuous improvement of people's living&#xD;
      conditions, and the continuous strengthening of patients' health awareness, colonoscopy has&#xD;
      become one of the necessary items for many people's routine physical examination. However, in&#xD;
      most medical institutions, when guiding patients to prepare for intestinal tract, there are&#xD;
      some problems, such as lack of management, lack of detailed explanation, and complex process.&#xD;
      These problems lead to the lack of understanding of intestinal tract preparation process for&#xD;
      patients, thus affecting the preparation work before patients' examination and the follow-up&#xD;
      treatment plan. Therefore, it has become one of the most important issues to study how to&#xD;
      improve the intervention and guidance methods of patients' intestinal preparation and improve&#xD;
      the quality of patients' intestinal preparation.Although the research of intestinal&#xD;
      preparation intervention and education methods has made a lot of progress, various methods of&#xD;
      intervention and guidance for patients before colonoscopy have been proposed at home and&#xD;
      abroad to improve the quality of intestinal preparation. However, in a series of reports,&#xD;
      there are still a considerable number of patients in the colonoscopy problems of intestinal&#xD;
      preparation.At present, there are few researches on individualized intervention aiming at the&#xD;
      risk factors of inadequate bowel preparation in China, so it is urgent to explore&#xD;
      individualized bowel preparation programs suitable for different populations. Therefore, in&#xD;
      this experiment, we designed individualized intervention for patients with insufficient bowel&#xD;
      preparation (mainly from the following aspects: chronic constipation, not strictly in&#xD;
      accordance with the requirements Bowel preparation, body mass index &gt; 25 kg / m2, age &gt; 70&#xD;
      years old, with other diseases such as diabetes, Parkinson's disease, history of stroke or&#xD;
      spinal cord injury, application of tricyclic antidepressants or anesthetics). The purpose of&#xD;
      the study is to study the effect of individualized intervention on the quality of intestinal&#xD;
      preparation for patients with insufficient intestinal preparation, and to provide reference&#xD;
      for improving the quality of intestinal preparation for patients with insufficient intestinal&#xD;
      preparation.&#xD;
