    <textblock>
      Radioligand therapy (RLT) using Lutetium-177 labelled PSMA is a promising new therapeutic&#xD;
      approach to treat metastatic prostate cancer. This tumor-specific treatment is directed&#xD;
      against prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which is overexpressed in prostate cancer&#xD;
      cells. In the last few years, several lutetium-177 (177Lu, β emitter) labeled PSMA ligands&#xD;
      have been developed and are currently applied to treat metastatic castrate resistant prostate&#xD;
      cancer patients. To date, there are no prospective randomized studies published using this&#xD;
      treatment in the hormone sensitive setting or in oligometastatic prostate cancer. Therefore,&#xD;
      this study we will evaluate the effect of 177Lu-PSMA in patients with hormone sensitive&#xD;
      oligo-metastatic prostate cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) radioligand therapy (RLT) is a promising new&#xD;
      therapeutic approach to treat metastatic prostate cancer. This tumor-specific treatment is&#xD;
      directed against PSMA, which is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells. In the last few&#xD;
      years, several Lutetium-177 (177Lu, β emitter) labeled PSMA ligands have been developed and&#xD;
      are currently applied in nuclear medicine departments worldwide to treat metastatic castrate&#xD;
      resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large retrospective study reported an overall biochemical response rate of 45% following&#xD;
      multiple 177Lu-PSMA RLT cycles in mCRPC patients, while 40% of patients already responded&#xD;
      after a single cycle. RLT with 177Lu-PSMA was generally well tolerated and 12% of the&#xD;
      patients suffered grade 3 to 4 hematological toxicity. In addition, mild and often transient&#xD;
      xerostomia occurred in 8%. A prospective study carried out in Australia confirmed these&#xD;
      results recently. Based on these outcomes Endocyte (a Novartis company) is currently carrying&#xD;
      out an international multicenter prospective registration study for end-stage mCRPC patients&#xD;
      (NCT03511664).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although these results are promising, it is noteworthy that most of the currently available&#xD;
      data is retrospective and 177Lu-PSMA has only been evaluated in end stage prostate cancer&#xD;
      patients to date. However, based on the mode of action, 177Lu-PSMA could also be effective in&#xD;
      low volume disease because of the very high tumor uptake of radioligands in smaller lesions.&#xD;
      Also, in a pilot study (NCT03828838) we were able to show that 177Lu-PSMA treatment is safe&#xD;
      coupled with promising response rates. Hence, the present randomized trial to investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA in patients with oligo-metastatic (≤5 metastases) metastatic prostate&#xD;
      cancer, prior to the hormone insensitive state. In this study, 58 patients will be included&#xD;
      in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 177Lu-PSMA or the current standard of care (deferred&#xD;
      androgen deprivation therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study period for answering the primary research question, patients&#xD;
      randomized to the control arm are eligible to receive 177Lu-PSMA if they meet the end of the&#xD;
      study period treatment (EOT 1) criteria and are willing to undergo 177Lu-PSMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EOT 1 is defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical progression determined by the treating physician (e.g. increasing pain from&#xD;
           metastases)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 100% increase in PSA after cycle one blood draw (BASELINE) during study. Exception:&#xD;
           PSA increase in the first 12 weeks after the first treatment injection as was defined by&#xD;
           the PCWG3 criteria.&#xD;
