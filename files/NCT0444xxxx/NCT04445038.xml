    <textblock>
      This study is Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetic of Recombinant anti-IL-5 Humanized&#xD;
      Monoclonal Antibody injection in Healthy Subjects. There are 6 Groups as follows: 0.03mg/kg&#xD;
      (S1), 0.2mg/kg (S2), 1.0mg/kg (S3), 3.0mg/kg (S4), 5.0mg/kg (S5) and 7.5mg/kg (S6); and 2&#xD;
      subjects were included in the S1 group (both received study drugs); 10 subjects were included&#xD;
      in each of the S2 ~ S6 groups (of which 8 received study drugs and 2 received placebo).&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics and Anti-drug antibody (ADA) data will be collected; Drug safety, tolerance,&#xD;
      efficacy and immunogenicity for healthy subjects will be evaluated.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel trial of safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and pharmacokinetic of Recombinant anti-IL-5 Humanized Monoclonal Antibody by&#xD;
      single subcutaneous injection with six different doses in healthy subjects. There are 6&#xD;
      groups as follows: 0.03mg/kg (S1), 0.2mg/kg (S2), 1.0mg/kg (S3), 3.0mg/kg (S4), 5.0mg/kg (S5)&#xD;
      and 7.5mg/kg (S6); and 2 subjects were included in the S1 group (both received study drugs);&#xD;
      10 subjects were included in each of the S2 ~ S6 groups (of which 8 received study drugs and&#xD;
      2 received placebo). In each group, two subjects were sentinels (1 received the study drug&#xD;
      and 1 placebo). Pharmacokinetics and Anti-drug antibody (ADA) data will be collected; Drug&#xD;
      safety, tolerance, efficacy and immunogenicity for healthy subjects will be evaluated.&#xD;
