  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes and according to several studies, even&#xD;
      lung can represent another target of the diabetic disease. Asthmatic patients often show&#xD;
      comorbidities and obesity is one of the main.Several studies in literature suggest that&#xD;
      patients with higher Body Mass Index (i.e. overweight and obese) have a greater risk of&#xD;
      developing asthma compared to normal weight subjects. Considering inflammation, asthma is&#xD;
      usually characterized by an increase of eosinophils in the airways and by a Th2 type&#xD;
      inflammation, while a immunological type Th1 switch systemically characterizes diabetes. Even&#xD;
      asthmatic patients, especially if diabetic, might have an increase of glucose in their&#xD;
      airways, that could favourite or feed an inflammatory/infective state. Up to-day there are&#xD;
      not in literature studies that have investigated the airways inflammatory pattern and the&#xD;
      exercise capacity in relation to functional characteristics in diabetic patients affected by&#xD;
      asthma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The basic therapy for asthma treatment involves the use of corticosteroids that can lead to&#xD;
      the development of glucose intolerance and to the onset of diabetes. Moreover, several works&#xD;
      in literature highlight the fact that patients with diagnosis of both asthma and diabetes&#xD;
      have a scarcer glycaemic control, a reduced life expectancy, and a higher risk of pneumonia&#xD;
      when compared to patients with only asthma or only diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in the last years the evaluation of the inflammatory patterns in asthmatic patients&#xD;
      has revealed a heterogeneity of the inflammation, with patients characterized by neutrophilic&#xD;
      phenotype, mixed granulocytic or without a well-defined inflammatory component&#xD;
      (pauci-granulocytic phenotype).On the other side, a immunological type Th1 switch&#xD;
      systemically characterizes diabetes. The impact of diabetes, therefore, as a comorbidity in&#xD;
      asthmatic patients could influence the inflammatory status of airways. Moreover, studies have&#xD;
      reported that glucose is higher in the airways of subjects affected by chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease and it correlates with bacterial and viral load compared to healthy&#xD;
      controls. Even asthmatic patients, especially if diabetic, might have an increase of glucose&#xD;
      in their airways, that could favourite or feed an inflammatory/infective state. Although&#xD;
      physical exercise is able to reduce the level of systemic inflammation, improving asthma&#xD;
      symptoms and glycaemic control, it is well known that asthmatic and diabetic patients tend to&#xD;
      lead a more sedentary life style compared to healthy subjects.A limiting factor that bonds&#xD;
      the two pathologies is obesity, since the gain of weight causes exacerbation of respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms, resulting in lower effort tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to-day there are not in literature studies that have investigated the airways inflammatory&#xD;
      pattern and the exercise capacity in relation to functional characteristics in diabetic&#xD;
      patients affected by asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study is to characterize the airways inflammatory pattern of patients affected by&#xD;
      bronchial asthma, patients affected by type II diabetes and patients with concomitant&#xD;
      diagnosis of asthma and diabetes by using induced sputum. Secondary objective is to&#xD;
      characterize the exercise capacity in relation to the functional and anthropometric&#xD;
      characteristics of patients with diabetes, with asthma and diabetes, compared to patients&#xD;
      with only asthma.&#xD;
