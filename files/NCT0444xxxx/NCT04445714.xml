      During the study, an AstraZeneca representative/delegate will have regular contacts with the&#xD;
      study site, including visits to site for the site monitoring and source data verification&#xD;
      activities. Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRF) will be used for data collection and query&#xD;
      handling. The investigator will sign the completed electronic Case Report Forms. A copy of&#xD;
      the completed electronic Case Report Forms will be archived at the study site. Authorized&#xD;
      representatives of AstraZeneca or delegate, a regulatory authority, or an Ethics Committee&#xD;
      may perform audits or inspections at the center's. Number and percentages of Incidence of&#xD;
      adverse events will be presented, stratified by age/gender/baseline medications. Annualised&#xD;
      event rate shall also be presented in addition to the incidence rate during the study. Mean&#xD;
      change in HbA1C from baseline to 6 months for patients will be analysed using paired t test /&#xD;
      Wilcoxon signed-rank test at 5% level of significance.&#xD;
