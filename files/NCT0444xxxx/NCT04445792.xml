      This study is comprised of three separate pharmacogenetic trials grouped into a single&#xD;
      protocol due to similarities in the intervention, the hypotheses, and the trial design. The&#xD;
      three trials are the Acute Pain Trial, the Chronic Pain Trial, and the Depression Trial.&#xD;
      Participants can enroll in only one of the three trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute Pain Trial: A prospective, multicenter, two arm randomized pragmatic trial.&#xD;
      Participants meeting eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to either immediate&#xD;
      pharmacogenetic testing and genotype-guided post-surgical opioid therapy (Intervention arm)&#xD;
      or standard care and pharmacogenetic testing after 6 months (Control arm). The investigators&#xD;
      will test the hypothesis that pharmacogenetic testing and genotype guided pain management&#xD;
      therapy improves pain control after surgery in participants who's body processes some pain&#xD;
      medicines slower than normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic Pain Trial: A prospective, multicenter, two arm randomized pragmatic trial.&#xD;
      Participants meeting eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to either immediate&#xD;
      pharmacogenetic testing and genotype-guided opioid therapy (Intervention arm) or standard&#xD;
      care with 6-month delayed pharmacogenetic testing (Control arm). The investigators will test&#xD;
      the hypothesis that pharmacogenetic testing and genotype guided pain therapy improves pain&#xD;
      control after surgery in participants who's body processes some pain medicines slower than&#xD;
      normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression: A prospective, multicenter, two arm randomized pragmatic trial. Participants&#xD;
      meeting eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to either immediate pharmacogenetic&#xD;
      testing and genotype-guided anti-depressant therapy (Intervention arm) or standard care with&#xD;
      6-month delayed pharmacogenetic testing (Control arm). The investigators will test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that pharmacogenetic testing and genotype-guided anti-depressant therapy will&#xD;
      reduce depression symptoms in participants who's body processes some anti-depressants faster&#xD;
      or slower than normal.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pain and depression are conditions that impact substantial proportions of the US population.&#xD;
      Finding safe and effective drug therapies for both conditions is challenging. In the case of&#xD;
      treatment for acute and chronic pain, the challenge is finding effective therapy while&#xD;
      minimizing adverse effects or opioid addiction (and the ensuing consequences). For&#xD;
      depression, there are few clinically relevant predictors of successful treatment leading to&#xD;
      multiple trials of inadequate therapy for some patients. Both opioid and antidepressant&#xD;
      prescriptions can be guided by pharmacogenetics (PGx) data based on existing guidelines from&#xD;
      the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to evaluate the impact of pharmacogenetic testing and genotype-guided&#xD;
      pain or anti-depressant therapy on pain control or depression symptoms in a pragmatic&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for examining a genotype-guided approach to acute and chronic pain management&#xD;
      is based on the importance of CYP2D6 for the bioactivation of tramadol, codeine, and&#xD;
      hydrocodone and data from a pilot study supporting improved pain control in intermediate and&#xD;
      poor CYP2D6 metabolizers in the genotype-guided arm who are taking these drugs at baseline.&#xD;
      Similarly, the rationale for examining a genotype-guided approach to depression medication&#xD;
      therapy is based on the demonstrated role of CYP2D6 in the bio inactivation and CYP2C19&#xD;
      oxidation of select, commonly used SSRIs. Secondly, data from industry sponsored trials&#xD;
      support the hypothesis of improved depression symptom control in a genotype-guided arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute Pain Trial: Determine if a genotype-guided approach to acute post-surgical pain therapy&#xD;
      leads to improved pain control compared to usual care, as defined by a decrease in the SIA&#xD;
      score. Secondarily, The investigators will evaluate whether this approach leads to reduced&#xD;
      use of DEA Schedule II opioids and reduced pain intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic Pain Trial: Determine if a genotype-guided approach to pain therapy in participants&#xD;
      with at least 3 months of chronic pain leads to improved pain control compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression Trial: Determine if genotype-guided dosing or selection of antidepressants among&#xD;
      participants with at least 3 months of depressive symptoms who require new or revised&#xD;
      antidepressant therapy leads to improved control of depression, compared to usual care.&#xD;
