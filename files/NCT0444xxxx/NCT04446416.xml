  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-arm, two stages, open-label, pilot study to investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of FUS add-on bevacizumab (BEV) in rGBM patients. The BEV is the best&#xD;
      physician's choice of standard of care for rGBM after prior radiotherapy and temozolomide&#xD;
      chemotherapy in the LinKou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Eligible patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      through the process of informed consent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will be divided into two stages. The study design and procedures will be as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will first be administered with BEV 10 mg/kg intravenous (IV) infusion.&#xD;
      After 30-60 minutes, patients will receive microbubbles (MB) (SonoVue®) 0.1 mL/kg and optimal&#xD;
      ultrasound exposure doses (based on the acoustic emission feedback FUS power control&#xD;
      algorithm) generated from the NaviFUS System single exposure unit for up to two minutes every&#xD;
      2 weeks to transiently open the BBB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 4 weeks of treatment with BEV and single unit FUS-MB treatment, if the patient&#xD;
      experienced BBB opening using FUS treatment and BEV IV infusion without any serious adverse&#xD;
      effects (such as brain significant bleeding), then the patient may proceed to stage 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who complete stage 1 will enter stage 2 to receive the BEV with MB-mediated multiple&#xD;
      units of FUS treatment for up to five minutes (but the maximum exposure time per single unit&#xD;
      is two minutes) every 2 weeks for up to 30 weeks or until evidence of progressive disease,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, non-compliance with study follow-up, or withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients will be followed up for 28 days.&#xD;
