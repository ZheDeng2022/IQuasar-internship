      Part 1: A first-in-human, open-label, Phase I dose escalation study of DSP107 monotherapy and&#xD;
      combination therapy with atezolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Preliminary efficacy assessment of DSP107 single agent treatment and DSP107 in&#xD;
      combination with atezolizumab in second line treatment of non small cell lung cancer&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first time that DSP107 is administered to human subjects. The aim of&#xD;
      the study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of DSP107 monotherapy and combination therapy in a two-part design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 will involve DSP107 monotherapy dose escalation in subjects with advanced solid tumors&#xD;
      that are not amenable to surgical resection or other approved therapeutic options that have&#xD;
      demonstrated clinical benefit. Additional dose finding cohorts will be enrolled to establish&#xD;
      a safe dose of DSP107 when given in combination with atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will comprise a single expansion cohort consisting of two treatment arms in which&#xD;
      subjects will be treated either with DSP107 monotherapy or DSP107 in combination with&#xD;
      atezolizumab. This part of the study will enrol subjects with non small cell lung cancer who&#xD;
      have progressed following first line treatment with PD-1 or PD-L1 targeting agents having&#xD;
      previously achieved a best response of stable disease or better.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Part 1 will involve sequential enrolment of patient cohorts to investigate the safety of up to 7 potential dose levels. Dose escalation will commence with up to 3 single subject cohorts before moving to a 3 + 3 dose escalation scheme to determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended phase II dose.&#xD;
Up to 3 additional dose finding cohorts will be enrolled in parallel to the monotherapy dose escalation to establish a safe dose of DSP107 when given in combination with atezolizumab. These dose-finding combination arms will start at least one dose level below a DSP107 monotherapy dose that has already been deemed safe.&#xD;
Part 2 information will be updated on completion of Part 1.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>
