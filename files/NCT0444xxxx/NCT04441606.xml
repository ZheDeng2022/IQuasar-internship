  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the suggested study is to assess the added value of 68Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT over&#xD;
      18F-FDG PET/CT in evaluating the extent of disease in patients with various malignancies, in&#xD;
      whom a diagnostic challenge is met, such as inconclusive findings on 18F-FDG PET/CT or other&#xD;
      imaging studies, better delineation of tumor extent prior to therapy, and with emphasis on&#xD;
      malignancies known to show variable avidity to FDG and at times, no uptake at all. Also&#xD;
      patients unable to optimally comply with the required preparation for FDG imaging, such as&#xD;
      diabetic patients who struggle in achieving glycemic control.&#xD;

    <description>The study population will include up to 50 patients with disease in whom a diagnostic challenge is met, including but not limited to:&#xD;
Inconclusive findings on 18F-FDG PET/CT or other imaging modalities.&#xD;
Better delineation of tumor extent prior to therapy&#xD;
Malignancies known to show variable avidity to FDG and at times, no uptake at all (e.g. Exocrine Pancreatic cancer, Gastric carcinoma, Mucin-producing or Signet-ring carcinoma).&#xD;
Patients unable to optimally comply with the required preparation for FDG imaging.&#xD;
The study population will include only patients treated in Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel-Aviv, Israel, and referred by their attending physicians, of whom are part of the hospital staff.</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo two scans: first a routine FDG PET scan and a FAPI PET scan, within 10 days.&#xD;
Scans will be interpreted by board certified Nuclear medicine physicians and board certified radiologists.&#xD;
Immunohistochemical analysis with specific staining for FAP will be performed in removed malignant tissues, either at surgery or from biopsy, to assess a possible correlation between the intensity of uptake and the level of FAP expression.</description>
