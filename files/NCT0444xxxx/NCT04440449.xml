  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study team want to see if changes in lifestyle and behaviors and self-monitoring of diet&#xD;
      and physical activity in older adults who have type 2 Diabetes (T2D) may help to prevent or&#xD;
      reduce frailty. Frailty occurs in older adults and leads people to have falls, become&#xD;
      disabled, require nursing home placement, and have increased risk of death. T2D is one of the&#xD;
      major risk factors for frailty. T2D is a significant problem in older adults and is known to&#xD;
      increase the risk of future frailty.&#xD;

      Behavioral lifestyle intervention: Participants (N=40) will be randomized to the mHealth+&#xD;
      group Intervention group (Group A; n=20)and mHealth+ individual intervention group (Group B;&#xD;
      n=20) group using a randomization table. (1) The mHealth+ group Intervention group (Group A)&#xD;
      will receive a modified Look AHEAD behavior lifestyle intervention with smartphone-based&#xD;
      self-monitoring of diet and physical activity. This comprises ten group sessions for&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention in 6-months. The group will receive three weekly classes in the first&#xD;
      month and then bi-weekly classes for month 2-3, and three monthly session in month four,&#xD;
      five, and six. The frequency and layout of these classes will allow participants to master&#xD;
      new skills gradually, then eventually wean off, and adopt the modified lifestyle as the part&#xD;
      of their daily lives. (2) The mHealth+ individual intervention group (Group B) will receive&#xD;
      an abbreviated behavior lifestyle intervention with smartphone-based self-monitoring of diet&#xD;
      and physical activity in one face-to-face individual session at the beginning of the study.&#xD;
      In addition, participants will receive self-study materials, from Look Ahead modules, and a&#xD;
      monthly follow-up phone calls for the duration of the study (6-months). The goal for these&#xD;
      follow up phone calls are to assess understanding of the modules, to promote continued&#xD;
      engagement with the study material, and to provide clarification on materials as needed.&#xD;
      Participants in the mHealth+ group Intervention group (Group A) and mHealth+ individual&#xD;
      intervention group (Group B will receive instruction on how to download an app to help them&#xD;
      record their diet and physical activity at the beginning of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fitbit offers a simple, easy-to-use tool for tracking food and physical activity. It helps&#xD;
      set daily calorie budget, and set and work towards goals for nutrient intake, weight loss,&#xD;
      exercise, and more. https://www.fitbit.com/inspire 04.12.20: Due to SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) and&#xD;
      social distancing order, the study team are adding hemoglobin Hba1c home test.&#xD;

    <measure>Frailty Scale Using Fried's Phenotype Method Based on Five Frailty Characteristics</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported (SR) exhaustion (Y/N ) on Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale: &quot;Do you feel full of energy?&quot; &quot;No&quot; scored a 1 (exhausted).&#xD;
SR unintentional weight loss: &quot;In the last year, have you lost more than 10 pounds unintentionally?&quot;. &quot;Yes&quot; scored a 1.&#xD;
SR physical activity over the last year using the Minnesota Leisure Time Activity Questionnaire, (energy expenditure in kcal/week, standardized for sex). The lowest quintile for each sex group received a score of 1&#xD;
Grip strength measured (Kg) with a dynamometer in the dominant hand, standardized using body mass index quartiles and sex. The average of 3 trials was recorded. The lowest quintile for each sex group received a score of 1 (for weak).&#xD;
10 feet walked at usual pace, standardized based on height and sex. The fastest of 2 trials was recorded. Participants in the lowest quintile for each sex group were considered slow (score =1) A higher scale score from 0-5 indicates greater frailty</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The balance test assesses a person's ability to stand with the feet together in side-by-side, semi-tandem, and full-tandem positions for 10 seconds each, responses ranging between 0-4 with a higher score indicating better balance. Three balance tests are performed and scoring is as follows:&#xD;
Side-by-side stand: person attempts to stand with feet together, side-by-side, for 10 seconds.&#xD;
1 point if held for 10 seconds&#xD;
0 points if not held for 10 seconds or not attempted Semi-tandem stand: person attempts to stand with the side of the heel of one foot touching the big toe of the other foot for 10 seconds.&#xD;
1 point if held for 10 seconds&#xD;
0 points if not held for 10 seconds or not attempted Tandem stand: person attempts to stand with the heel of one foot in front of and touching the toes of the other foot for about 10 seconds.&#xD;
2 points if held for 10 seconds&#xD;
1 point if held for 3 to 9.99 seconds&#xD;
0 points if held for &lt;3 seconds or not attempted</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SPPB Gait Speed</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Gait speed at a 4-meter walk is timed in seconds as participants walk at their usual pace. Two trials were administered, time (in seconds) was recorded for each trial. The fastest walk of two trials was recorded. Score is recorded between 0-4 with a higher score indicating a faster gait speed. Scoring is as follows:&#xD;
0 points if unable to do the walk&#xD;
1 point if time is more than 8.70 sec&#xD;
2 points if time is 6.21 to 8.70 sec&#xD;
3 points if time is 4.82 to 6.20 sec&#xD;
4 points if time is less than 4.82 sec</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Chair stand represents the time to complete five chair rises, sit to stand from a chair, as quickly as possible, without using hands, responses ranging between 0-4. Scoring is as follows:&#xD;
0 points if unable to complete 5 chair stands or completes stands in &gt;60 seconds&#xD;
1 point if chair stand time is 16.70 sec or more&#xD;
2 points if chair stand time is 13.70 to 16.69 sec or more&#xD;
