  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes between the use of the erbium:&#xD;
      YAG (Er:YAG) laser, intraurethrally administered in long non-ablative SMOOTH™ train of pulses&#xD;
      applied at the level of the male prostatic urethra, to the use of the pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment of oral tadalafil for the treatment of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain&#xD;
      syndrome (CP/CPPS). The results show that both treatments are effective in alleviating&#xD;
      symptoms of CP/CPPS. The non-ablative Er:YAG SMOOTHTM laser seems to be a promising treatment&#xD;
      for this widely spread condition. More studies are needed to confirm its safety and efficacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostatitis is the most common diagnosis (&gt;50%) in men visiting outpatient urological clinics&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NIH classification classifies prostatitis into 4 types: category I - acute bacterial&#xD;
      prostatitis, which is very rare, affecting only up to 5% of patients; category II- chronic&#xD;
      bacterial prostatitis, also affecting up to 5% of patients; category III- chronic&#xD;
      nonbacterial prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS), which is the most common, as&#xD;
      it affects 90%-95% of cases; and Category IV- asymptomatic inﬂammatory prostatitis, which has&#xD;
      unknown prevalence and also unknown clinical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although category III or CP/CPPS is the most prevalent form of prostatitis, its causes are&#xD;
      largely unknown and treatments often fail to alleviate symptoms in the long term. In&#xD;
      contrast, patients suffering from type I and II prostatitis are successfully treated with&#xD;
      antibiotics, as a uropathogen or an infectious agent is usually identified as the cause .&#xD;
&#xD;
      CP/CPPS is characterized by pain in the perineum and tenderness in the prostate and various&#xD;
      urological symptoms (urgency, frequency, low urethral pressure) and sometimes also&#xD;
      ejaculatory symptoms, such as painful ejaculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently used treatments for CP/CPPS are mainly pharmacological, including alpha blockers,&#xD;
      5-alpha reductase inhibitors, anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, phytotherapy, allopurinol,&#xD;
      botulinum toxin and traditional Chinese medicine . Non-pharmacological therapies include&#xD;
      acupuncture, prostatic massage, extracorporeal shockwave therapy, pulsed magnetic field&#xD;
      therapy, transrectal and transurethral thermotherapy and others . Some of the abovementioned&#xD;
      therapies alleviate symptoms by improving vascularisation and blood flow of the prostate and&#xD;
      peri-prostatic area. This is also the mechanism of action of the erbium:YAG (Er:YAG) laser&#xD;
      with non-ablative SMOOTH™ mode - it works by thermal pulsing of the treated surface, with&#xD;
      microsecond-range long pulses combined into long (several hundred millisecond range)&#xD;
      sequences. Each laser micropulse sharply increases tissue temperature and acts as a&#xD;
      stimulative trigger. Long pulse trains cause slower diffusion of heat to deeper layers of the&#xD;
      skin or mucosa, causing initially vasodilation and then collagen remodelling and stimulation&#xD;
      of fibroblasts with collagen remodelling. It has shown to improve vascularisation and&#xD;
      alleviate symptoms of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) in women, including&#xD;
      irritation, dryness and pain. It has also been used intraurethrally in women to alleviate&#xD;
      urinary symptoms of GSM. Intraurethral thermal therapy has been previously shown promising in&#xD;
      the treatment of CP/CPPS in men. In this study the investigators aimed to assess the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of transurethral non-ablative Er:YAG laser therapy applied at the level of&#xD;
      the male prostatic urethra and to compare it with pharmacological treatment of 5 mg oral&#xD;
      tadalafil for the treatment of CP/CPPS.&#xD;
