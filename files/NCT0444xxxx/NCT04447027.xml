  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mature T-cell malignancies (TCM) are rare and heterogeneous group of leukemias and&#xD;
           lymphomas accounting for 5 to 10% of all lymphomas in the US&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with systemic TCM are most commonly treated with a CHOP (cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
           doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone)-like regimens, that produce long-term&#xD;
           progression-free survival in about 30% of these cases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) TCM have very poor prognosis with median overall&#xD;
           survival of less than 1 year. Treatment options for R/R TCM are very few and of limited&#xD;
           efficacy, thus novel treatment strategies are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mutations in epigenetic regulators are common in aggressive TCMs and standard treatment&#xD;
           with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) such as romidepsin show modest clinical&#xD;
           activity with single agent the overall response (ORR) around 25%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combination of romidepsin and 5-azacitidine (hypomethylating agents) was synergistic in&#xD;
           preclinical models, and has demonstrated high clinical activity with an ORR of 79%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Many TCMs rely on The Ikaros-dependent NF-kB/IRF4 signaling pathway to maintain&#xD;
           proliferation, which is why lenalidomide, which induces degradation of Ikaros and&#xD;
           downregulates IRF4, has single agent activity in R/R TCM with ORR of 26% to 42%,&#xD;
           depending on the subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lenalidomide synergizes with romidepsin and enhances tumor cell death in TCM cell lines,&#xD;
           predicting that the addition of lenalidomide to the established romidepsin/ CC-486 (5-&#xD;
           azacitidine) combination will further improve efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety and toxicity profile and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the&#xD;
      four-drug combination of CC-486 (5-azacitidine), romidepsin, lenalidomide and dexamethasone&#xD;
      in patients with TCM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refractory/relapsed TCM defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with systemic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Have received at least one line of prior therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Must have received brentuximab vedotin if the disease is anaplastic large cell&#xD;
                lymphoma or CD30-positive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status of less than or equal to 2 (or less than or equal to 3 if&#xD;
           decrease is due to the disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed relapsed and/or refractory mature TCM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ and marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Open-label, single-center, uncontrolled Phase 1 study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  '3 + 3' design will be used to determine the MTD of dose-escalated lenalidomide with&#xD;
           fixed dose of romidepsin and CC-486 (5-azacitidine)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An expansion cohort of 9 patients will be evaluated at the MTD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum 6 cycles (21-day cycle) of combination therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore all dose levels, including further evaluation in a dose expansion cohort, the&#xD;
           accrual ceiling will be set at 30 patients&#xD;

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension, i.e., blood pressure (BP) of greater than or equal to&#xD;
             160/95; patients who have a history of hypertension controlled by medication must be&#xD;
             on a stable dose (for at least one month) and meet all other inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Triplicate average baseline QTcF interval greater than or equal to 480 ms&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking drugs leading to significant QT prolongation. Note: A 5 half-life&#xD;
             washout period must have elapsed following the use of these drugs prior to&#xD;
             administration of romidepsin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant use of rifampin and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers within 2&#xD;
             weeks prior to starting protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including psychiatric conditions such&#xD;
             as recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior; or&#xD;
             laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study&#xD;
             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the&#xD;
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make&#xD;
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because&#xD;
             lenalidomide is a Class X agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient&#xD;
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with lenalidomide, breastfeeding should&#xD;
             be discontinued if the mother is treated with lenalidomide. These potential risks may&#xD;
             also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
