    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with rare cancers often have limited treatment options. The biology of rare cancers is&#xD;
      not well understood. Researchers want to find better treatments for these cancers. They want&#xD;
      to test 2 drugs that, taken separately, have helped people with non-rare cancers. They want&#xD;
      to see if these drugs together can make rare cancers shrink or stop growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if nilotinib and paclitaxel will benefit people with rare cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People age 18 and older who have a rare, advanced cancer that has progressed after receiving&#xD;
      standard treatment, or for which no effective therapy exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will have blood&#xD;
      and urine tests. They will have a pregnancy test if needed. They will have an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram to check their heart. They will have imaging scans to measure their tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will repeat the screening tests during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive nilotinib and paclitaxel. The drugs are given in 28-day cycles.&#xD;
      Nilotinib is a capsule taken by mouth twice a day. Paclitaxel will be given intravenously by&#xD;
      peripheral line or central line once a week for the first 3 weeks of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will keep a medicine diary. They will track when they take the study drugs and&#xD;
      any side effects they may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have optional tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can stay on the study until their disease gets worse or they have intolerable&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up phone call about 30 days after taking the last dose of&#xD;
      study drugs.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rare tumors constitute a heterogeneous group of cancers associated with limited&#xD;
           treatment options and poor outcomes. Due to their rarity, there are few good models for&#xD;
           these diseases to support preclinical evaluation of new anticancer agents. To address&#xD;
           these challenges, DCTD s Patient-Derived Models Repository (PDMR) is generating&#xD;
           patient-derived xenograft models of adult and pediatric rare cancers and has screened&#xD;
           combinations of approved and investigational anticancer agents in these models.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Based on preclinical activity, drug combinations are being tested in patients with rare&#xD;
           cancers in a series of connected Phase 2 clinical trials (Rapid Analysis and Response&#xD;
           Evaluation of Combination Anti-Neoplastic Agents in Rare Tumors [RARE CANCER]);&#xD;
           responses may trigger further evaluation of a treatment in that rare cancer type to&#xD;
           further evaluate response rate and mechanism-of-action. Patients who progress will be&#xD;
           offered another RARE CANCER trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The agents used in this trial are the BCR-Abl kinase inhibitor nilotinib and the&#xD;
           anti-tubulin agent paclitaxel, which showed greater than additive activity in&#xD;
           combination in preclinical xenograft models and subsequently demonstrated clinical&#xD;
           efficacy (including partial responses) in patients with solid tumors on the Phase 1&#xD;
           trial 15-C-0086 (NCT02379416).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the proportion of patients with advanced rare cancers who have objective&#xD;
      responses (OR) to treatment with nilotinib and paclitaxel&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the proportion of patients alive and progression free at 6 months on study&#xD;
           agents&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify genomic and transcriptomic determinants of response and resistance in tumor&#xD;
           biopsy specimens&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine genomic alterations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and circulating tumor&#xD;
           cells (CTCs) that may be associated with response or resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of the combination on biomarkers of cell death&#xD;
           and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in tumor tissue and CTCs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study participants must have a histologically confirmed solid tumor meeting the RARECARE&#xD;
           definition of rare tumor that has progressed on standard therapy known to prolong&#xD;
           survival or for which no standard treatment options exist&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &gt;= 18&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No major surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy within 3 weeks prior to entering the study&#xD;
           (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and mitomycin C) or 5 half-lives of the agent, whichever is&#xD;
           shorter; toxicity from prior treatment must have recovered to eligibility levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ function; performance status ECOG 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nilotinib will be administered at 300 mg orally BID and paclitaxel will be administered&#xD;
           IV at 80 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 in 28-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A single-stage design will be used with a target accrual of 30 eligible patients. If at&#xD;
           least 4/30 patients experience an objective response (PR or CR by RECIST 1.1), the&#xD;
           combination of nilotinib and paclitaxel will be considered promising. The accrual&#xD;
           ceiling is 34 patients.&#xD;

             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;

                    -  Evaluable or measurable disease outside the CNS&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  No metastases to brain stem, midbrain, pons, medulla, or cerebellum&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  No history of intracranial hemorrhage or spinal cord hemorrhage&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  No ongoing requirement for dexamethasone for CNS disease; patients on a&#xD;
                       stable dose of anticonvulsants are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  No neurosurgical resection or brain biopsy within 28 days prior to Cycle 1,&#xD;
                       Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with asymptomatic treated CNS metastases may be enrolled, provided all&#xD;
                  the criteria listed above are met as well as the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Radiographic demonstration of improvement upon the completion of&#xD;
                       CNS-directed therapy and no evidence of interim progression between the&#xD;
                       completion of CNS-directed therapy and radiographic screening for the&#xD;
                       current study&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  No stereotactic radiation or whole-brain radiation within 28 days prior to&#xD;
                       Cycle 1, Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Screening CNS radiographic study &gt;=4 weeks from completion of radiotherapy&#xD;
                       and &gt;=2 weeks from discontinuation of corticosteroids&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, serious untreated&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic respiratory failure/congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would&#xD;
             limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because nilotinib and paclitaxel have been&#xD;
             assigned to pregnancy category D by the FDA. Because there is an unknown but potential&#xD;
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             the study drugs, breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
             drug and women should refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and for 3&#xD;
             months following the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are known to be HIV-positive and on combination antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
             are ineligible because of possible PK interactions with study drugs.&#xD;
