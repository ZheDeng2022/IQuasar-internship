  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses&#xD;
      of ASP8062 or placebo alone and in combination with a single dose of morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study also assessed the potential for pharmacokinetic interaction between ASP8062 and&#xD;
      morphine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants were screened for up to 28 days prior to first investigational product&#xD;
      administration. Eligible participants were admitted to the clinical unit on day -1 and were&#xD;
      residential for a single period of 17 days/16 nights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were discharged from the clinical unit on day 16 on the condition that all&#xD;
      required assessments had been performed and that there were no medical reasons for a longer&#xD;
      stay in the clinical unit.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug up to end of study visit (up to day 25)</time_frame>
    <description>Safety was assessed by adverse events (AEs), which included abnormalities identified during a medical test (e.g. laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiogram, etc.) if the abnormality induced clinical signs or symptoms, needed active intervention, interruption or discontinuation of study drug or was clinically significant. A Treatment emergent AE (TEAE) was defined as any AE that started or worsened after the first dose of study drug up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug. AEs were considered serious (SAEs) if the AE resulted in death, was life-threatening, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, resulted in congenital anomaly, or birth defect or required inpatient hospitalization or led to prolongation of hospitalization.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to day 25</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS is a clinician administered assessment tool that evaluates suicidal ideation and behavior. Number of participants with at least one affirmative response to the 5 items for suicidal ideation (1. Wish to be dead, 2. Non-specific active suicidal thoughts, 3. Active suicidal ideation with any methods (not plan) without intent to act, 4. Active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan, 5. Active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent) and/or to the 5 items for suicidal behavior (1. Preparatory acts or behavior, 2. Aborted attempt, 3. Interrupted attempt, 4. Actual attempt, 5. Completed suicide) were reported.</description>

AEs were considered serious (SAEs) if the AE resulted in death, was life-threatening, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, resulted in congenital anomaly, or birth defect or required inpatient hospitalization or led to prolongation of hospitalization.</description>
