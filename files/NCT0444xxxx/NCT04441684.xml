  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a new emerging disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, with&#xD;
      no specific therapeutic options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the end of February 2020, the Strasbourg University Hospital (HUS) had faced a sudden&#xD;
      increase of patients with COVID-19 resulted from a SARS-CoV-2 superspreading event (religious&#xD;
      meeting). Infected individuals went to regional hospitals, and this led to a cluster of&#xD;
      infected healthcare workers at the Strasbourg University Hospitals from the first week of&#xD;
      March. To date, several hundred Strasbourg hospital workers have presented a SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection confirmed by the RT-PCR test from a nasopharyngeal sample. Most of them developed a&#xD;
      mild form of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to understand how far the infection has spread in the hospital staff, and to&#xD;
      which extent the individuals who have been infected develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
