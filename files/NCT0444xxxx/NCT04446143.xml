  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigator-initiated study is to evaluate if mindfulness-based stress&#xD;
      reduction (MBSR) will improve satisfaction and reduce anxiety during a urodynamic study&#xD;
      (UDS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urodynamic studies (UDS) are used to measure the functionality of the bladder and urethra to&#xD;
      be able to evaluate lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). UDS consists of catheterization,&#xD;
      uroflow and cystometrogram. Intravesical, vaginal or rectal transducer placements, and&#xD;
      placement of perineal electrodes are part of the study protocol. During the study the bladder&#xD;
      will be filled slowly with sterile fluid and the patient will be asked about sensation of&#xD;
      filling. At the end of the study the patient will be asked to void.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although beneficial for diagnosis of underlying LUTS, UDS maybe associated with heightened&#xD;
      patient anxiety and feeling of discomfort. In a recently published pilot study, it was shown&#xD;
      that a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) protocol may help improve a patient's&#xD;
      emotional health and perception of UDS. To validate the findings from this previous study,&#xD;
      the current study aims to implement a MBSR protocol in a randomized prospective study.&#xD;
      Patients scheduled for UDS will be randomized into two groups. One group will listen to&#xD;
      mindfulness meditation prior to the UDS and the other group won't.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will complete validated questionnaires to assess their satisfaction, anxiety and&#xD;
      pain level as well as lower urinary tract symptoms before and after intervention.&#xD;

    <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI 6) score will be obtained before and after the study. It measures stress and anxiety. It ranges from: not al all=1, somewhat=2, moderately so=3, very much so=4), with 4 as the worse outcome.</description>

    <description>The visualised analog pain score (VAS) will be obtained before and after the study. It measure the degree of pain and a range between 0-10 (0=no pain et all and 10=worst pain ever), with 10 as the worse outcome.</description>
