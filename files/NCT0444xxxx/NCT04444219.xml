  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity, characterized by an increase in body weight that results in excessive fat&#xD;
      accumulation, is a global health problem. Recently, it has also been shown that obesity is&#xD;
      associated with low-grade chronic systemic inflammation in adipose tissue. This condition is&#xD;
      mediated by activation of the innate immune system in adipose tissue that promotes&#xD;
      inflammation and oxidative stress and triggers a systemic acute-phase response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research points towards the potential of phytochemicals in food as part of&#xD;
      nutritional strategies for the prevention of obesity and associated inflammation, as well as,&#xD;
      increase in insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last decade, mushrooms have attracted the research interest as functional foods rich in&#xD;
      beta-glucan with desirable health benefits in several metabolic disorders without the side&#xD;
      effects of pharmacological treatment. Edible mushrooms are highly nutritious and exhibit&#xD;
      beneficial effects on several inflammatory diseases such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes,,&#xD;
      high blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the postprandial effect of mushrooms in human biological samples is still&#xD;
      undetermined. To this end, the current study aims to investigate if there is any effect at&#xD;
      postprandial glucose, insulin responses and appetite hormones. Fifteen apparently men and&#xD;
      women with Metabolic Syndrome, aged 18-65 years old, will be enrolled based on certain&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment, the volunteers will undergo a medical and dietary assessment and their&#xD;
      health status will be evaluated through a complete blood count. On the day of the experiment&#xD;
      and after overnight fasting, the volunteers will consume one of two breakfast meal, including&#xD;
      114g bread, 40g cheese and 15g dry mushrooms (meal 1) or 114g bread, 40g cheese and 200g&#xD;
      tomatoes (meal 2). Blood samples will be obtained on timepoints 0h, 30min, 1h, 1,5h, 2h, 2,5h&#xD;
      and 3h after breakfast intake. Two weeks later, the same volunteers will consume the other&#xD;
      breakfast meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collection, the glucose and insulin values will be identified in plasma samples.&#xD;
      Additionally, some appetite hormones will be measureD in serum samples.&#xD;
