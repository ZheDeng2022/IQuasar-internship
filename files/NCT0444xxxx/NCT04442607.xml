  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open label, unblinded, non-randomized interventional study, comparing the&#xD;
      investigational artificial intelligence tool with the current &quot;gold standard&quot;: Data&#xD;
      acquisition will be obtained during one scheduled colonoscopic procedure by a trained&#xD;
      endoscopist. During insertion, no action will be taken, colonoscopy is performed following&#xD;
      the standard of care. Once withdrawal is started, a second observer (not a trained&#xD;
      endoscopist but person trained in polyp recognition) will start the bedside Artificial&#xD;
      intelligence (AI) tool, connected to the endoscope's tower, for detection. This second&#xD;
      observer is trained in assessing endoscopic images to define the AI tool's outcome. Due to&#xD;
      the second observer watching the separate AI screen, the endoscopist is blinded of the AI&#xD;
      outcome. When a detection is made by the AI system that is not recognized by the endoscopist,&#xD;
      the endoscopist will be asked to relocate that same detection and to reassess the lesion and&#xD;
      the possible need of therapeutic action. All detections are separately counted and&#xD;
      categorized by the second observer. All polyp detections will be removed following standard&#xD;
      of care for histological assessment. The entire colonoscopic procedure is recorded via a&#xD;
      separate linked video-recorder.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated non-randomized prospective interventional trial to validate&#xD;
      the performance of a novel state-of-the-art computer-aided detection (CADe) tool for&#xD;
      colorectal polyp detection implemented as second observer during routine diagnostic&#xD;
      colonoscopy and to evaluate its feasibility in daily endoscopy. Consecutive patients referred&#xD;
      for a screening, surveillance or diagnostic colonoscopy will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a standard colonoscopy performed by a trained endoscopist. A second&#xD;
      observer, who is not a trained endoscopist, will follow the procedure on a bedside AI-tool to&#xD;
      count the number of detections made by the AI system and categorize the results into positive&#xD;
      or negative results as follows (1) true positive, (2) false negative or (3) false positive.&#xD;
      In case of a detection of the AI-system that was not seen by the endoscopist or unclear to&#xD;
      the second observer, the second observer will ask to re-evaluate the indicated region to&#xD;
      determine whether after second look the endoscopist has to take extra action. The entire&#xD;
      procedure will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no additional risks specific to the use of the AI tool to be taken into account.&#xD;
      General risk of colonoscopy (i.e.: perforation, bleeding or post-polypectomy syndrome) could&#xD;
      occur with the same frequency as that of a colonoscopy without the use of this AI tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive a standard of care protocol during their colonoscopy. The AI system&#xD;
      can only have a beneficial outcome for the patient, a better polyp detection, as it has shown&#xD;
      to be non-inferior in terms of accuracy when compared to high detecting endoscopist in our&#xD;
      pilot trial&#xD;
