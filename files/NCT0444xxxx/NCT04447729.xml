  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of fremanezumab in reducing&#xD;
      pain in patients with interstitial cystitis-bladder pain syndrome (IC-BPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary efficacy objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of fremanezumab on&#xD;
      other efficacy measures, including pain, voiding frequency, urinary symptoms, and quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And another secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      fremanezumab administered subcutaneously in adult patients with IC-BPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned active study period is 8 weeks; the entire planned study duration for each&#xD;
      patient is 13 weeks.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has a diagnosis of IC-BPS according to the American Urological Association endorsed&#xD;
             criteria for a duration of ≥6 months to ≤15 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has IC-BPS with moderate to severe bladder pain and urinary frequency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has urinary frequency of ≥8 voids/day&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has had a cystoscopy within 6months before screening with report indicating absence of&#xD;
             Hunner lesion(s). A patient who has not had a cystoscopy within 6months may undergo&#xD;
             cystoscopy, at the physician's discretion, and be rescreened for study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has persistent symptoms despite an adequate trial of 3 months of dietary counseling&#xD;
             and modification&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has a body mass index within 18.5 to 39 kg/m2 and a body weight ≥99 lbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has non-pharmacologic interventions (such as physical therapy, pelvic floor massage,&#xD;
             acupuncture, naturopathy, new initiation of mindfulness exercises, or cognitive&#xD;
             behavioral therapy) that are unchanged for a minimum of 30 days before the screening&#xD;
             visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  if of childbearing potential, must meet any of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must use 1 form of highly effective contraception with their partners&#xD;
                  during the entire study period and for 5 months after the last dose of the IMP&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sexual abstinence is only considered a highly effective method if defined as&#xD;
                  refraining from heterosexual intercourse in the defined period. The reliability&#xD;
                  of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the&#xD;
                  clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic&#xD;
                  abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods),&#xD;
                  declaration of abstinence for the duration of a study, and withdrawal are not&#xD;
                  acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum beta-human&#xD;
                  chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) pregnancy test at the screening visit (confirmed&#xD;
                  by urine dipstick β-HCG pregnancy test at baseline)&#xD;

             incontinence), radiation cystitis, tuberculosis cystitis, vaginitis, neurogenic&#xD;
             bladder, or any other condition/disease which, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;

                  with any of these mAbs, it has to be confirmed that the subject received placebo&#xD;
                  in order to be eligible for this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has a known history of previous urinary diversion procedure with or without bladder&#xD;
             removal or bladder augmentation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has a known history of a cystoscopy with bladder biopsy, hydrodistention, or&#xD;
             fulguration or triamcinolone injection ≤3 months before the screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  was diagnosed with and/or treated for chronic migraine, defined as headaches occurring&#xD;
