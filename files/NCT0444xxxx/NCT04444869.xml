  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will explore giving standard dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy to sites of&#xD;
      disease including all lymph nodes involved with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer, but&#xD;
      administer lower doses of radiation therapy to the lymph nodes that are not known to be&#xD;
      involved with cancer. By doing so, it is hypothesized that there will be equally good long&#xD;
      term loco-regional and distant disease control but will reduced long term treatment side&#xD;
      effects and improved quality of life in persons living well beyond their cancer treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a trial of definitive chemotherapy and radiation therapy in human papilloma virus&#xD;
      positive oropharyngeal cancers, in a population whose cancer is thought to be highly&#xD;
      radio-sensitive. This is a population whose outcomes are already known to be very good with&#xD;
      high rates of local and distant control of the disease. With the long term disease control&#xD;
      and survival of patients with this disease, long term treatment toxicity and resulting&#xD;
      reduction in quality of life poses new problems. This has lead to several studies to examine&#xD;
      the role of radiation dose de-escalation through various strategies in attempt to reduce long&#xD;
      term toxicity from treatment and yet achieve equivalent long term disease control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial specifically hypothesizes that a lower dose of radiation therapy to the clinically&#xD;
      and radiographically uninvolved lymph nodes will no detrimental effect on loco-regional&#xD;
      control or overall survival and will improve the long-term side effect profile, particularly&#xD;
      with regards to xerostomia and dysphagia. The goal of this study is therefore to determine&#xD;
      whether a lower dose to the clinically and radiographically uninvolved lymph nodes can be&#xD;
      done safely and with better long-term toxicity profile and better overall quality of life&#xD;
      without compromising the expected outcomes of progression free survival.&#xD;

             completion of the study requirements and required follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active should be willing and&#xD;
             able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception throughout the treatment phase&#xD;
             of the trial and until at least 60 days following the last study treatment.&#xD;

             palate, or oropharyngeal walls); cytologic diagnosis from a cervical lymph node is&#xD;
             sufficient in the presence of clinical evidence of a primary tumor in the oropharynx.&#xD;
             Clinical evidence should be documented, may consist of palpation, imaging, or&#xD;
             endoscopic evaluation, and should be sufficient to estimate the size of the primary&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have clinically or radiographically evident measurable disease at the&#xD;
             primary site or at nodal stations. Tonsillectomy or local excision of the primary&#xD;
             without removal of nodal disease is permitted, as is excision removing gross nodal&#xD;
             disease but with intact primary site. Limited neck dissections retrieving ≤ 4 nodes&#xD;
             are permitted and considered as non-therapeutic nodal excisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunohistochemical staining for p16 must be performed on tissue and documented in the&#xD;
             pathology report(s) with reported result positive for p16.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  One of the following combinations of imaging is required within 45 days prior to&#xD;
                  registration:&#xD;
&#xD;

                       contrast);&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. or an MRI of the neck (with contrast) and a chest CT scan (with or without&#xD;
                       contrast);&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. or a CT scan of neck (with contrast) and a PET/CT of neck and chest (with or&#xD;
                       without contrast);&#xD;
&#xD;
                    4. or an MRI of the neck (with contrast) and a PET/CT of neck and chest (with&#xD;
                       or without contrast).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: A CT scan of neck and/or a PET/CT performed for the purposes of radiation planning&#xD;
        may serve as both staging and planning tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be asked about their personal smoking history prior to enrollment. Only&#xD;
             active smokers with greater than 10 pack years will be excluded from the trial. The&#xD;
             total number of pack years will be collected at baseline. Current smokers who wish to&#xD;
             discontinue will be offered smoking cessation information, and if they are able to&#xD;
             discontinue smoking prior to initiation of radiation therapy, they can remain eligible&#xD;
             for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Number of pack-years = [Frequency of smoking (number of cigarettes per day) × duration of&#xD;
        cigarette smoking (years)] / 20 Note: Twenty cigarettes is considered equivalent to one&#xD;
        pack. The effect of non-cigarette tobacco products on the survival of patients with&#xD;
        p16-positive oropharyngeal cancers is undefined.&#xD;
