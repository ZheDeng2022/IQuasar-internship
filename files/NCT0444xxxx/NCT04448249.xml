  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is the most frequent chronic pathology in France and in the world. It is one of&#xD;
      the main modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. In France, 50% of treated hypertensives are&#xD;
      uncontrolled and only 30% of treated patients are fully adherent to their antihypertensive&#xD;
      treatment. Poor adherence to drug treatments is considered as one of the main causes of&#xD;
      non-control of hypertension. Since 2018, a new profession has entered the French healthcare&#xD;
      system: Advanced Practice Nurses (APN). They have many broad skills, at the interface of&#xD;
      nursing and medical exercises. The purpose of this interventional study is to assess the&#xD;
      impact of APN on blood pressure (BP) control in the context of usual care of hypertension&#xD;
      thanks to a better adhesion of patients and a better therapeutic alliance. The hypothesis&#xD;
      formulated is that an individual APN intervention, included in a usual hypertension&#xD;
      management, improves BP control.&#xD;

    <description>APN intervention is divided into five main steps:&#xD;
clinical and paraclinical examinations,&#xD;
appraisal of patient's knowledge,&#xD;
health education on hypertension and treatments,&#xD;
setting a written medication plan with the patient to invest him in his management with adjusting or renewing treatments identically if necessary,&#xD;
decision-making balance between the benefits and risks of non-adherence to medication. A time is scheduled at the end of the intervention to let the patient ask questions or express his difficulties if he needs to.</description>
