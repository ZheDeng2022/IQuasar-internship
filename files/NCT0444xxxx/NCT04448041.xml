      Aims: The CRANE feasibility study (A mixed methods study of malnutrition and sustainable&#xD;
      nutritional intervention for patients undergoing cancer surgery in low- and middle-income&#xD;
      countries) aims to investigate the identification of pre-operative malnourishment, data&#xD;
      collection methods and acceptability of a nutritional intervention for a future trial to&#xD;
      improve outcomes after cancer surgery in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify and validate the most relevant nutritional screening tool for patients in&#xD;
           LMICs undergoing surgery for cancer;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify a low cost sustainable nutritional intervention for patients in LMICs&#xD;
           undergoing surgery for cancer;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To establish the feasibility of delivering a randomised trial of a sustainable&#xD;
           nutritional intervention for patients in LMICs undergoing surgery for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A mixed-methods study comprising of qualitative work including focus groups and&#xD;
      interviews, trial of data collection and validation to test feasibility in clinical practice&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Patients undergoing elective surgery for suspected cancer in LMICs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Work package (WP) 1: The primary deliverable is the identification of a relevant,&#xD;
      pragmatic, and acceptable nutritional screening tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP 2: The primary deliverable is the identification of a low-cost and sustainable nutritional&#xD;
      intervention. Focus groups and interviews will be held with patients and clinicians to&#xD;
      explore the sustainability, implementation and acceptability of screening and interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP 3: The primary outcome will be to determine feasibility and acceptability of trial design.&#xD;
      A number of outcome assessments and data collection instruments will be evaluated for&#xD;
      feasibility, including anthropometric parameters and patient outcomes (30-day mortality,&#xD;
      major post-operative complications, length of hospital stay and quality of life). A final&#xD;
      study design, analysis plan, and health economic plan will be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: For this feasibility study, the investigators will conduct multidisciplinary&#xD;
      focus groups and interviews, perform and validate malnutrition screening in 200 patients&#xD;
      across four countries and record patient 30-day outcomes. This will also include the time&#xD;
      taken to collect data on 200 eligible patients. This sample size has been informed from&#xD;
      previous malnutrition data originating from a large prospective international multicentre&#xD;
      observational cancer study (GlobalSurg 3).&#xD;
