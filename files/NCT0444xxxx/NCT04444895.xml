      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of repeated&#xD;
      subcutaneous (SC) administration of lanadelumab in adolescents and adults with&#xD;
      non-histaminergic angioedema with normal C1-inhibitor who completed study SHP643-303&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants with Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of the study up to follow-up (Day 196)</time_frame>
    <description>A TEAE is defined as any event emerging or manifesting at or after the initiation of treatment with an investigational product or medicinal product or any existing event that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to the investigational product or medicinal product. A SAE is any untoward clinical manifestation of signs, symptoms or outcomes (whether considered related to investigational product or not and at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital abnormality/birth defect, an important medical event. AESI will include hypersensitivity reactions, events of disordered coagulation such as bleeding AESI, hypercoagulable AESI. Number of participants with TEAEs including AESI and SAE will be assessed.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 0 through Day 182</time_frame>
    <description>An angioedema attack is defined as the symptoms or signs consistent with an attack in at least 1 of the following locations: peripheral angioedema (cutaneous swelling involving an extremity, the face, neck, torso, and/or genitourinary region), abdominal angioedema (abdominal pain, with or without abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea), laryngeal angioedema (stridor, dyspnea, difficulty speaking, difficulty swallowing, throat tightening, or swelling of the tongue, palate, uvula, or larynx).

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Moderate or Severe Angioedema Attacks During the Treatment Period of Day 0 Through Day 182</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 through Day 182</time_frame>
    <description>The overall severity of angioedema attack will be determined by the site using following definitions: mild (transient or mild discomfort), moderate (mild to moderate limitation in activity), severe (marked limitation in activity). Number of moderate or severe angioedema attacks during the treatment period of Day 0 through Day 182 will be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Plasma Kallikrein (pKal) Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, 84, 140 and 182</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma Kallikrein activity will be measured by biomarker cleaved high molecular weight kininogen (cHMWK ) with factor XIIa activation level to assess pharmacodynamics of lanadelumab.</description>

    <measure>Angioedema Quality of life (AE-QoL) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, 28, 84, 140 and 182</time_frame>
    <description>The AE-QoL questionnaire is a self-administered validated instrument to assess health related (HR)QoL among participants with recurrent angioedema (including HAE). The AE-QoL consists of 17 disease-specific quality-of-life items, to produce a total AE-QoL score and 4 domain scores (functioning, fatigue/mood, fear/shame, and nutrition) and each of the 17 items has a five-point response scale ranging from 1 (Never) to 5 (Very Often).</description>
