  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study aims to examine the effectiveness of an online, self-paced post-adoption&#xD;
      intervention to improve understanding, well-being, and connection within adoptive families.To&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention, a mixed method, pre-post design with two&#xD;
      conditions will be used. Data from standard, reliable measures and free-response items will&#xD;
      be collected pre- and post-intervention from participants in two conditions: the intervention&#xD;
      condition and the waitlist condition. The intervention condition involves receiving the&#xD;
      intervention immediately following pre-assessments; the waitlist condition involves receiving&#xD;
      the intervention approximately 3 months after the intervention condition once all data&#xD;
      collection is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to answer six research questions. Each research question involves analyses of&#xD;
      the differences between the intervention and waitlist conditions across multiple time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the intervention's effect on improving awareness of the needs of different&#xD;
           family members and understanding how to meet these needs? Hypothesis 1: At&#xD;
           post-intervention, parents in the intervention condition will report an improved&#xD;
           awareness of the needs of each family member and greater understanding of how to meet&#xD;
           these needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the intervention's effect on parent well-being (i.e., parenting confidence and&#xD;
           parenting stress) from pre- to post-intervention? Hypothesis 2: Parents in the&#xD;
           intervention condition will report increased parenting confidence and trending decreases&#xD;
           in parenting stress from pre- to post-intervention compared to those in the waitlist&#xD;
           condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What is the intervention's effect on child well-being (i.e., self-esteem and emotional&#xD;
           and behavioral problems) from pre- to post-intervention? Hypothesis 3: Children in the&#xD;
           intervention condition will report increased self-esteem and trending decreases in&#xD;
           emotional and behavioral problems from pre- to post-intervention compared to those in&#xD;
           the waitlist condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What is the intervention's effect on the quality of the parent-child relationship from&#xD;
           pre- to post-intervention? Hypothesis 4: Both parents and children in the intervention&#xD;
           condition will report improved connection in the parent-child relationship from pre- to&#xD;
           post-intervention compared to those in the waitlist condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. As an exploratory question, what is the intervention's effect on the quality of the&#xD;
           sibling relationship from pre- to post-intervention? Hypothesis 5: Children in the&#xD;
           intervention condition will report an improvement in the quality of their relationship&#xD;
           with their sibling(s) from pre- to post-intervention compared to children in the&#xD;
           waitlist condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. What is the intervention's effect on connection and communication within the overall&#xD;
           family system from pre- to post-intervention? Hypothesis 6: Parents and children in the&#xD;
           intervention condition will report increased family communication and family connection&#xD;
           in the whole family system from pre- to post-intervention compared to parents and&#xD;
           children in the waitlist condition.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      One member of the family will complete a survey to ensure eligibility criteria have been met.&#xD;
      In the recruitment application, the individual who completes the application will include an&#xD;
      email address to be used as the primary contact person for the family. If the family meets&#xD;
      the eligibility criteria, the primary contact person will receive consent forms to complete&#xD;
      for each member of the family. Once consent forms are completed for the entire family and&#xD;
      each member has agreed to participate in research, the primary contact will complete a&#xD;
      demographic survey of basic household information. In the demographic survey, the primary&#xD;
      contact will include email addresses for each family member 18 years and older. See timeline&#xD;
      below for reference. *Note: dates are approximate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once consented, online surveys of pre-assessments will be sent to families via email (via&#xD;
      individual links; survey links for children under 18 will be sent to the primary contact).&#xD;
      Pre-assessments include individual, dyad, and family measures to examine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the intervention in multiple systems of the family. Each family member who is 12 years and&#xD;
      older will complete pre-assessments during a one-week data collection period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After pre-assessments are complete, families will be randomly assigned to the intervention or&#xD;
      waitlist condition using a random number generator, and families will be notified of their&#xD;
      assigned condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the waitlist and intervention condition will complete pre-assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the pre-assessment data collection period is complete, families in the intervention&#xD;
      condition will have one week before the intervention begins. The primary contact of families&#xD;
      assigned to the intervention condition will receive an email with instructions to register&#xD;
      and to prepare for the 4-week intervention series. The waitlist condition will do nothing&#xD;
      during this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week after pre-assessment data collection is complete, the 4-week intervention series&#xD;
      will begin. The intervention includes 4 weekly sessions. Each weekly session involves parents&#xD;
      watching a 15-minute mini-webinar, children watching a 5-minute video, parents and children&#xD;
      12 years and older completing separate reflection questions (*note these questions will be&#xD;
      used as data for analysis), and families completing two family activities together (an&#xD;
      activity aimed at improving connection and an activity aimed at improving communication). The&#xD;
      primary contact will complete a checklist of which activities were completed that week. The&#xD;
      intervention should take approximately 1.5-3 hours each week for the whole family for a total&#xD;
      of 6-12 hours over the 4-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention condition will complete the first week's activities at their own pace within&#xD;
      the seven days. On each subsequent Monday of the four weeks, the next week's activities will&#xD;
      open for the intervention condition to access. The previous weeks' activities will still be&#xD;
      available to the families during the duration of the intervention. All intervention&#xD;
      activities will be completed within the four-week time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two weeks after the intervention condition completes the intervention series,&#xD;
      post-assessments will be sent to both the intervention and waitlist conditions.&#xD;
      Post-assessments will be the same as the pre-assessments in order to examine differences&#xD;
      between pre- and post-intervention. Families will have a one-week period to complete the&#xD;
      post-assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three months after the intervention condition completed the intervention, 3-month follow-up&#xD;
      assessments will be sent to both the intervention and waitlist conditions. 3-month follow-up&#xD;
      assessments will be the same as the pre- and post-assessments. This follow-up data collection&#xD;
      period is to determine any longer-term changes that may occur in the family systems&#xD;
      post-intervention that may not occur closely following the intervention at the&#xD;
      post-intervention data collection time point. Families will have a one-week period to&#xD;
      complete the 3-month follow-up assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week after the three-month follow-up data collection period is completed, families&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the waitlist condition will receive the invitation to register for the&#xD;
      intervention. The waitlist condition will receive instructions to register for the&#xD;
      intervention and to prepare for the 4-week intervention series. The waitlist condition will&#xD;
      receive the intervention series in the same order and manner as the intervention condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 6 months after the intervention condition completed the intervention, the&#xD;
      intervention condition will complete 6-month follow-up assessments. This follow-up data&#xD;
      collection is to determine the long-term changes that may occur in the family system&#xD;
      post-intervention. Only the intervention condition will complete this data collection period&#xD;
      as the waitlist condition would have completed the intervention at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, participation in this study will take approximately 15-20 hours during a 6-month&#xD;
      period with approximately 4 hours total to complete surveys and assessments and 6-15 hours to&#xD;
      participate in the intervention.&#xD;
