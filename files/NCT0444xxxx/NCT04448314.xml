  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a study about the usability of PointCheck a novel non-invasive technology for monitoring&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The study will include patients with cancer visiting the&#xD;
      outpatient hematology clinic for their standard of care chemotherapy administration. A final&#xD;
      sample size of 60 oncologic outpatients will be enrolled and studied with the technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the usability of PointCheck. Secondary outcomes include a&#xD;
      preliminary assessment of PointCheck diagnostic accuracy and precision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this, study subjects will be tested twice with PointCheck during the same session and the&#xD;
      usability in an at-home simulated environment by naïve users will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <measure>PointCheck's Usability</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to two-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To gather data with the ultimate goal of determining the usability of the proposed non-invasive method measured by the the number and % of user errors (globally and per error type) observed in the clinic visits. In addition, the number and % of users successfully completing the test without errors will be measured.</description>

        The study will be conducted in participants with malignancies who are scheduled to receive&#xD;
        cytotoxic chemotherapy agents with any risk of neutropenia (e.g. antimetabolites, platins,&#xD;
        taxanes, topoisomerase inhibitors, Vinca alkaloids, anthracyclines, among others).&#xD;
        Participants will be in an ambulatory stable condition as described in the criteria below&#xD;
        and according to the investigator's assessment.&#xD;
