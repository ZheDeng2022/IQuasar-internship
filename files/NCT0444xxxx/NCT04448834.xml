    <textblock>
      Hypotheses: The Investigator hypothesizes that targeting ALL cells with 2 different&#xD;
      modalities, ie liposomal vincristine sulfate as a microtubule inhibitor and blinatumomab as a&#xD;
      BITE immuno-oncology therapy, will have at least additive benefits and allow an effective,&#xD;
      safe therapeutic option for patients. Further, the Investigator hypothesizes that the&#xD;
      combination will result in a high rate of response and thus allow enhanced immunologic&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives To evaluate whether the combination will result in a median&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) of at least 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate if the complete remission/complete remission with incomplete hematological&#xD;
      recovery (CR/CRi*) rate is ≧ 75% following 2 cycles in adult subjects with R/R Ph- ALL and&#xD;
      duration of remission Secondary Objectives To evaluate the rate of Minimal Residual Disease&#xD;
      (MRD) and duration To evaluate the proportion of patients who are able to progress to&#xD;
      allogeneic transplantation To evaluate the safety of blinatumomab and liposomal vincristine&#xD;
      sulfate in combination To evaluate the effect of the combination and response on measures of&#xD;
      immune reconstitution&#xD;
