    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to realize a randomized open-label study (EudraCT number:&#xD;
      2020-000120-19) to evaluate the safety and the anti-tumor activity of peptide(s)-based&#xD;
      immunotherapy in an umbrella window pre-operative opportunity phase II study in patients with&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.&#xD;

      This proof of concept study will start with one control arm and one vaccine arm. The target&#xD;
      of the first studied vaccine &quot; IO102 &quot; is the enzyme Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). The&#xD;
      vaccine is a amino acid peptide from indoleamine 2,3-dioxigenase. We are planning to add&#xD;
      several other arms when other vaccines become clinically available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the T-cell peptide-specific response to the vaccine in a interferon(INF)-γ&#xD;
           ELISpot assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the decreased action of the IDO enzyme in evaluating the increased&#xD;
           tumoral infiltration by CD8+ T-lymphocytes and by measuring the serum levels of&#xD;
           kynurenin, tryptophan,...&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the anti-tumor effect (objective response rate, overall survival, disease&#xD;
           free- survival, disease specific survival).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pre-operative activity of peptide vaccine using MRI (Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
           Imaging), DWI-MRI (Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI) and MRS (Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
           Spectroscopy) to visualize possible significant tumor modifications.&#xD;
