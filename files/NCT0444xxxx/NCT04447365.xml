  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll 30 subjects recruited from the electrophysiology device clinic at the&#xD;
      VA medical center. All patients will have a pre-existing implantable cardioverter&#xD;
      defibrillator and a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy with left ventricular systolic function of&#xD;
      35% or less by echocardiogram done within 3 years of the time of enrollment. 10 patients who&#xD;
      have had no device-monitored ventricular fibrillation/ ventricular tachycardia for the 3&#xD;
      months prior to recruitment will comprise a group of controls. 20 patients will comprise a&#xD;
      group of patients with high burden of ventricular arrhythmias, defined as patients with at&#xD;
      least one sustained episode of ventricular tachycardia/ ventricular fibrillation requiring&#xD;
      implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapies in the 3 months preceding study enrollment.&#xD;
      This information will be obtained from device interrogation at the time of recruitment.&#xD;
      Patients will provide a fecal sample for analysis at the time of enrollment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit patient from the VA pacemaker/ implantable cardioverter&#xD;
      defibrillator clinic. Patients with ICDs will be identified before scheduled clinical visit.&#xD;
      Patients whose ICDs on remote monitoring show evidence of VT/VF and who are being admitted to&#xD;
      the VA medical center for expedited inpatient work up and treatment will also be offered&#xD;
      enrollment in the study. Patients will be approached and educated about the study rationale&#xD;
      and their involvement. Patients will be consented for participation in the study after their&#xD;
      approval. Patients will be educated about donating fecal samples. Patients will be given&#xD;
      fecal sampling kits to collect and subsequently mail in those samples to the University of&#xD;
      Florida physiology laboratory where there will be processed in a HIPAA compliant way. These&#xD;
      samples will be subjected to laboratory analysis which will be outsourced. Fecal samples will&#xD;
      be analyzed by shotgun metagenomics to characterize the taxonomy of the gut flora and compare&#xD;
      the taxonomic and physiologic differences between the groups.&#xD;

        Differences in gut microbiome in patients prone to clinically significant ventricular&#xD;
        arrhythmias compared with matched controls with no ventricular arrhythmias. Evaluate&#xD;
        potential clinical implications of the gut microbiome as it relates to ventricular&#xD;
        arrhythmia burden and severity. Patients with an ICD and underlying cardiomyopathy to&#xD;
        analyze fecal samples. The patients with high burden will be re-tested after undergoing a&#xD;
        period of treatment for their arrhythmias and demonstrating a 3 month period wherein there&#xD;
        are no recurrent device therapies. Fecal analysis of the groups will be compared.&#xD;
