  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is composed of two parts. Part A: will test single doses of ZF874 in a&#xD;
      double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled and dose-escalating design (except Group 7,&#xD;
      which will be open-label and without placebo). Up to 7 groups of 6-8 healthy volunteers will&#xD;
      receive an oral dose of ZF874 or matching placebo (6 active: 2 placebo in Groups 1-6; 6&#xD;
      active in Group 7). The dosing of the first 2 subjects (1 active and 1 placebo) will take&#xD;
      place before dosing of the remainder of the group in Groups 1-6, with morning doses given in&#xD;
      the fasted state. The dose will be escalated only if the safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      previous highest dose are acceptable, and the plasma concentrations of ZF874 are predicted to&#xD;
      remain below the toxicokinetic exposure limit, as determined by the Safety Review Group.&#xD;
      Group 7 will consist of 6 subjects, all of whom will receive ZF874 after consuming a standard&#xD;
      high-fat breakfast. Dosing of the first 2 subjects before the rest of the group is not&#xD;
      required in Group 7, as 6 subjects have already safely received ZF874 at this dose in Group 3&#xD;
      and 12 subjects have already safely received higher doses in Groups 4 and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose selected for Part A, Group 7 was chosen as the dose has previously been given to&#xD;
      subjects fasted in Group 3, and it was safe and well tolerated, allowing for comparison for&#xD;
      the food effect, and higher doses have been tested in Part A with no safety concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Multiple Ascending Doses in subjects carrying at least one Z mutated&#xD;
      alpha-1-antitrypsin (Z-A1AT) allele (PiXZ subjects): Up to 4 groups of up to 5 PiXZ subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled in Part B (Groups 1-4). In Group 1, up to 4 subjects will receive twice&#xD;
      daily doses of either ZF874 or placebo on 28 consecutive days. The dose level (dose and dose&#xD;
      regimen) selected for Part B Group 1 will be based on review of the available results from&#xD;
      Part A. In Groups 2-4, up to 5 PiXZ subjects will receive ZF874 twice daily by mouth for 28&#xD;
      days; no subjects will receive placebo. The dose for Groups 2 - 4 will not exceed the doses&#xD;
      already given in Part A.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Part A: Enrolment of up to 54 healthy men and women is planned, in up to 7 groups. Each of&#xD;
      the first 6 groups will consist of 8 subjects and the 7th group will consist of 6 subjects.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive either one or two oral dose(s) of either ZF874 or placebo, in the&#xD;
      fasted state in the first 6 groups. There will be up to 7 dose levels of ZF874. In each of&#xD;
      the first 6 groups, two subjects (one placebo, one ZF874) are to be dosed in a double-blind&#xD;
      manner at least 23 hours prior to the remainder of the group. In the absence of any safety&#xD;
      concerns in the leading subjects, the remaining subjects will be dosed, at intervals of at&#xD;
      least 10 minutes. Dosing of the first 2 subjects before the rest of the group is not required&#xD;
      in Group 7, as 6 subjects have already safely received ZF874 at this dose in Cohort 3, and 12&#xD;
      subjects have already safely received higher doses in Cohorts 4 and 5. In Group 7, all&#xD;
      subjects will receive a single dose of ZF874 by mouth, after consuming a high-fat breakfast.&#xD;
      All subjects will be screened in the 28 days before their dose of trial medication. Subjects&#xD;
      will be resident on ward from 1 day before their dose (Day -1) until 48 hours after dosing&#xD;
      (Day 3). They will return for a follow-up visit 5-7 days after their dose (Day 6-8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: In Group 1, up to 4 subjects will receive twice daily doses of either ZF874 or&#xD;
      placebo on 28 consecutive days (up to 3 active: up to 2 placebo). The dose level (dose and&#xD;
      dose regimen) selected for Part B Group 1 will be based on review of the available results&#xD;
      from Part A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Groups 2-4, up to 5 PiXZ subjects will receive ZF874 twice daily by mouth for 28 days; no&#xD;
      subjects will receive placebo. The doses will be selected after reviewing the available&#xD;
      safety and pharmacokinetic results from previous groups, but will not exceed the doses&#xD;
      already given in Part A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be pre-screened to confirm PiXZ genotype within 84 days before their dose of&#xD;
      trial medication. Once their genotype is confirmed, they will be screened in the 28 days&#xD;
      before their dose of study medication. Subjects will be resident on the ward from 1 day&#xD;
      before their first dose (Day -1) until 1 hour after they receive their second dose (Day 2).&#xD;
      They will then attend 6 outpatient visits before returning to the ward and be resident from&#xD;
      Day 27 until 24 hours after the final dose (Day 29). They will return for further outpatient&#xD;
      visits on Days 36, 43 and 50, and for a follow-up visit 28-30 days after their final dose&#xD;
      (Day 56-58).&#xD;

    <description>ZF874 is a novel chemical chaperone that is specifically designed to rescue the folding of the Z variant of alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT). It is being developed for the treatment of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) caused by the Z-mutation.</description>
