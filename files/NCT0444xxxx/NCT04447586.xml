      Is there any possibility that patients who undergone thoracic surgery could use a simple soft&#xD;
      drink straw as an alternative PEP device? The present study was performed to test the&#xD;
      suitability and effect of a soft drink straw as an alternative Positive Expiratory Pressure&#xD;
      device in patients undergone thoracic surgery and includes two sub-exploratory areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after the measurements, the volunteers' saturation, heart rate, respiratory rate,&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure, dyspnea, thoracotomy pain and Cough Peak Expiratory&#xD;
      Flow was measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part of the research, that refers to the most appropriate command for exhalation&#xD;
      from a straw of a certain inner diameter (5mm), was carried out by using a device consisted&#xD;
      of drinking straw, disposable mouthpiece and manometer, which valued the developed pressures&#xD;
      during the exhalation attempts. Patients did not have visual contact with the manometer. The&#xD;
      effectiveness of two commands (Command A: &quot;blow continuously so that you feel little&#xD;
      resistance during exhalation&quot; and Command B: &quot;blow continuously so that you feel moderate&#xD;
      resistance during exhalation&quot;) was estimated by comparing the average of the developing&#xD;
      pressures for every command, that occur during exhalation, with the therapeutic range of&#xD;
      pressure. This part of the study was a cross-sectional transition and every volunteer&#xD;
      performed 3 attempts, for each command.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of the research was conducted for the evaluation of the benefits of the use&#xD;
      of a drinking straw as an alternative device. A number of n = 8 volunteers (intervention&#xD;
      group), who were selected from the overall sample using the closed envelope method. Taking&#xD;
      into account the results of the first part of the research, the respondents were asked to&#xD;
      exhale as indicated by the command that was selected before, performing 3 sets of 10&#xD;
      repetitions, that included short breaks between sets. The remaining volunteers (n = 5)&#xD;
      consisted the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, all patients were re-examined in order to measure the Cough Peak Expiratory Flow ,&#xD;
      dyspnea, pain, saturation, heart and respiratory rate, and systolic and diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure, after the intervention.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of positive expiratory pressure devices is considered beneficial in patients who have&#xD;
      undergone abdominal and thoracic surgery with an impact on blood gas measurement values, the&#xD;
      hospitalization length, the use of antibiotics and the pathology of the chest. Of course,&#xD;
      there are researchers who doubt the effectiveness of the method, mainly due to the fact that&#xD;
      it does not possibly reduce the risk of atelectasis, especially in patients who undergone&#xD;
      cardiac surgery. However, the method is very popular in physiotherapy, and the use of&#xD;
      alternative devices that create positive expiratory pressure, such as water bottles or&#xD;
      gloves, is suggested, especially in cases when the access to the classic devices is not easy,&#xD;
      mainly during the periods of crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coughing is a process that ensures the cleaning and protection of the airways. The outcome of&#xD;
      the thoracic surgery may often depend on the quality of the patient's cough postoperatively&#xD;
      which may put the patient at risk that could last for up to eight weeks. The effectiveness of&#xD;
      the cough can be assessed by measuring the peak cough flow using a peak flow meter, method&#xD;
      that many researchers in Europe and America prefer. Cough with a maximum expiratory flow over&#xD;
      160 L/min could ensure a safe extubation or decannulation of severely ill and postoperative&#xD;
      patients. Therefore, if there was a way leading to cough enhancement, this could be a&#xD;
      lifeline to the recovery of these type of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study was performed to test the suitability and effect of a soft drink straw as&#xD;
      an alternative positive expiratory pressure device in patients undergone thoracic surgery and&#xD;
      includes two sub-exploratory areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first one, it was investigated the most appropriate command of exhalation into a&#xD;
      specific internal diameter straw, whereas on the other hand, it was examined the improvement&#xD;
      of patient's overview by using the particular alternative device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is there any possibility of a simple soft drink straw being an alternative PEP device which&#xD;
      could improve the cough flow of patients who undergone thoracic surgery?&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research was approved by &quot;ATTIKON&quot; University General Hospital (with reference number&#xD;
      725/25/11/2019) and by the University of Thessaly (with reference number 101SE2/16-01-2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was performed at the Cardiac Surgery Clinic of &quot;ATTIKON&quot; University General&#xD;
      Hospital and participated all the adult thoracic surgical patients, with no limit of age,&#xD;
      from 12-02-2020 to 08-03-2020 Patients beforehand, are informed with the purpose of the study&#xD;
      and necessarily sign the Patient Consensus Form for their participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample of present study included all adult patients that undergone thoracic surgery, with&#xD;
      no limit of age, with a mesosternal or lateral incision, who considered hemodynamically&#xD;
      stable, were supplied with an O2 mixture of below 50%, full-conscious, with systolic pressure&#xD;
      below 150 cmH20. The records were carried out on the 2nd and 3rd postoperative day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with history of chronic respiratory disease, with severe symptoms, tendency to&#xD;
      vomit, cardiac arrhythmia due to atrial fibrillation postoperatively, and patients with&#xD;
      angina were excluded from the study. The records were carried out in the morning or at noon&#xD;
      and were automatically stopped if patient had any difficulty, decrease in saturation ≤90,&#xD;
      feeling of dizziness, fainting and palpitations. The number of volunteers excluded from the&#xD;
      study was n = 4 (2 people due to dizziness during the sitting position, 1 person with a&#xD;
      tendency to vomit before the beginning of the process and 1 person due to re-intubation&#xD;
      before the beginning of the process).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were beforehand informed about the purpose of the study and signed the Patient&#xD;
      Consensus Form in order to participate the study. Data, such as age, height and weight, type&#xD;
      of surgery and concomitant pathologies, if any, were collected. Patients' medical records&#xD;
      were examined to verify the collected information and find any indication that could have led&#xD;
      to their exclusion from the study. Records and measurements were begun only after&#xD;
      consultation with patient's doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant was placed in a sitting position, with his popliteal region of the knees&#xD;
      near the edge of the bed and stayed in this position for at least 2 minutes in order to be&#xD;
      checked that he won't develop any symptom such as discoloration of the face's skin, dizziness&#xD;
      or fainting. In case of appearance of any of the above symptoms, patient was placed back in a&#xD;
      supine position and the procedure stopped. Patients who felt a very light dizziness detected&#xD;
      by overview or oral evaluation, remained seated until the symptom passes and then records and&#xD;
      measurements were started. If the symptom continued, the procedure was stopped and patient&#xD;
      returned to the supine position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first phase of the study, all volunteers' saturation and heart rate was recorded using&#xD;
      oximeter or monitor's indications, whereas the recording of respiratory rate followed by&#xD;
      placing one researcher's hands on the subject's epigastrium. Both systolic and diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressure were recorded with an analog pressure gauge, as well dyspnea (calibrated using&#xD;
      the borg scale) and thoracotomy pain, which was quantified using the numerical pain scale&#xD;
      (Numeric Rating Scale - oral application).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum expiratory flow of air during coughing was estimated with a Peak Flow Meter (PFM)&#xD;
      device. Participants applied their lips to a disposable mouthpiece, which was connected to&#xD;
      the PFM and followed the command &quot;please cough hard inside the device&quot;. The value recorded&#xD;
      through the PFM device, which was the airflow during coughing, corresponded to the Cough Peak&#xD;
      Expiratory Flow. Patients' surgical trauma was supported by holding a pillow on the incision&#xD;
      during cough attempts, whereas there was no visual contact with PFM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part of the study was to investigate the most appropriate command for exhalation&#xD;
      through a straw of a certain inner diameter (5mm) and carried out by using a device consisted&#xD;
      of a drinking straw, a disposable mouthpiece and a manometer to quantify the developed&#xD;
      pressures during the exhalation attempts. The sample of this part included all the&#xD;
      volunteers. Patients did not have visual contact with the manometer. The effectiveness of&#xD;
      each command (Command A: &quot;please blow continuously so that you feel low resistance during&#xD;
      exhalation&quot; and Command B: &quot;please blow continuously so that you feel moderate resistance&#xD;
      during exhalation&quot;) was estimated by comparing the average of the developing pressures during&#xD;
      exhalation attempts arose by the corresponding command with the therapeutic range of pressure&#xD;
      (10-20 cmH2O). This part of the study was a cross-sectional transition and every volunteer&#xD;
      performed 3 attempts for each command. The outputs of the above attempts were recorded but&#xD;
      only the ones of the 3rd attempt were used to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of the study was conducted to evaluate the benefits arising from the use of a&#xD;
      drinking straw as an alternative PEP device. A number of n = 8 volunteers (intervention&#xD;
      group) was selected from the total sample, using the closed envelope method. The remaining&#xD;
      volunteers (n = 5) consisted the control group. Taking into account the results of the first&#xD;
      part of the study, intervention group was requested to exhale as indicated by the &quot;right&quot;&#xD;
      command, performing 3 sets of 10 repetitions, included short breaks between sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention phase, all patients were re-examined to measure the Cough Peak&#xD;
      Expiratory Flow, dyspnea, pain, saturation, heart and respiratory rate, systolic and&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure.&#xD;
