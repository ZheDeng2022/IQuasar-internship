      Pectus excavatum (PE) or funnel breast is the most common congenital deformity of the chest&#xD;
      wall, which occurs in about 1 in 400 births with a boy to girl ratio of 4: 1 to 3: 1. The&#xD;
      etiology of PE is largely undefined, but there are numerous indications that genetic factors&#xD;
      play a role in the development of PE. Up to 40% of patients report affected family members&#xD;
      with similar congenital deformities. In many families, PE follows a pattern that would be&#xD;
      compatible with an autosomal dominant or recessive pattern of inheritance. The data on the&#xD;
      frequent occurrence of PE in family members fluctuate greatly and only a few genes associated&#xD;
      with a PE have been identified so far.&#xD;

      Previous studies suggest that sulfation of proteoglycans plays a crucial role in the normal&#xD;
      development of cartilage and bone and could therefore be crucial in the genesis of the&#xD;
      disease. The main catalytic machinery responsible for the biosynthesis and breakage of&#xD;
      sulfate esters in the proteoglycans consists of various enzymes and transporters. Mutations&#xD;
      in Sphingosine Kinase 1 (SK1) and Sphingosine Kinase 2 (SK2) genes that encode the&#xD;
      transmembrane transporters of sulfate or enzymes that are involved in 3'-phosphoadenosine&#xD;
      5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) synthesis have been identified as the cause of several inherited&#xD;
      diseases that all have skeletal system deformities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Connections between chest wall deformities with syndromes (e.g. Marfan, Noonan), anomalies&#xD;
      (e.g. Poland, Moebius) or associations (e.g. Cantrell Pentalogy, PHACE) are well known. In&#xD;
      contrast, there have so far been hardly any genetic studies of the isolated congenital chest&#xD;
      wall deformities. Epidemiological data are insufficient and only a few groups deal with the&#xD;
      inheritance and the incidence of this disease when it occurs in isolation.&#xD;
