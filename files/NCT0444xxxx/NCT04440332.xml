  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy treatment represents the standard approach for resectable&#xD;
      locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The incidence of pulmonary infection and&#xD;
      other perioperative complications were higher in patients who received esophagectomy and&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy than those without neoadjuvant treatment and surgery patients.&#xD;
      However, reliable clinical data can quantify the damage degree of immunologic function caused&#xD;
      by chemotherapy and radiotherapy is still unknown. This project regards the level of&#xD;
      lymphocyte and immunocyte in peripheral blood as a quantitative index to reflect the dynamic&#xD;
      change of the immunologic function of patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy treatment. Meanwhile, the investigators will&#xD;
      also investigate the relationship between the level of lymphocyte and immunocyte in&#xD;
      peripheral blood and the response rate of neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;

      Peripheral blood will be collected from patients who will undergo esophagectomy and/or&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy. The setting time is before chemoradiotherapy, finishing&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy, pre-operation, postoperative day 1, day 3, day 5, and day 7. These blood&#xD;
      samples will be used for detection and analysis in lymphocyte and immunocyte by flow&#xD;
      cytometry.&#xD;
