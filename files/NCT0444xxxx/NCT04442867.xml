  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health-social partnership has been governed by regulations in many developed countries for&#xD;
      some years. For instance, the government of United Kingdom has implemented a policy&#xD;
      specifically designed to facilitate the discharge of older adults by collaborating health and&#xD;
      social care workers in hospitals. The United States also formulated a policy to support the&#xD;
      development of collaborative and multi-agency care services in community setting for helping&#xD;
      those who are vulnerable and underserved including ethnic minorities, homeless people, and&#xD;
      those without health insurance. While these services were shown to reduce the delays in&#xD;
      hospital discharge and improve access to services, they were found to be health-dominated and&#xD;
      the involvement of service users in strategic design and planning was lacking. As a result,&#xD;
      the actual process in practice was reported to be poor and a true model of health and social&#xD;
      care partnership was not attained. Currently in Hong Kong, health-social partnership has not&#xD;
      yet been driven and guided by policy. It is still unknown for researchers and practitioners&#xD;
      as how to effectively build a seamless working partnership among two different disciplines&#xD;
      and sustain in the community to support the independent living of older adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: There is a growing body of literature supporting the involvement of a&#xD;
      health-social approach using complex interventions in enhancing self-care management among&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults. However, there is a paucity of research on how this&#xD;
      intervention strategy implements and disseminates in a real community setting. Bridging the&#xD;
      gap between research-based evidence and primary health policy and practice is a considerable&#xD;
      challenge to researchers, service providers and policymakers. The present pilot study aims to&#xD;
      test the feasibility and acceptability of an evidence-based health-management intervention&#xD;
      programme to be incorporated into the existing community services provided in the elderly&#xD;
      centers. Results of this pilot study will provide important information if the health-social&#xD;
      partnership program rooted in the community is acceptable and feasible and factors that may&#xD;
      facilitate or hinder implementation when reaching the target group of older adults dwelling&#xD;
      in the community. The preliminary outcomes of enhancing self-management and older adults in&#xD;
      maximizing their independence in their home environment will also be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The present pilot study adopts an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design and&#xD;
      intends to 1) evaluate the effectiveness of a community-based Health-Social Partnership&#xD;
      Programme (HSPP) and 2) explore the reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of&#xD;
      adopting HSPP in the community. The potential subjects will be recruited from the member list&#xD;
      of a community centre of the Hong Kong Lutheran social services if they are (1) aged 60 or&#xD;
      above, and (2) cognitively competent. Subjects will receive nurse-led case management&#xD;
      supported by a social service team. Factors that hinder or facilitate the program delivery&#xD;
      will also be examined to determine the implementation and sustained effects of the programme.&#xD;
      The measures include the components of RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,&#xD;
      Implementation, and Maintenance) framework. Data will be collected at pre-intervention (T1),&#xD;
      post-intervention (T2), and 3 months after intervention (T3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: There are conventional randomized controlled trials testing the effects of&#xD;
      community-based programs but these trial designs tend to control the contextual factors&#xD;
      rather than incorporating the program in the real environment. Positive outcomes may have&#xD;
      been produced in these trials but it is uncertain whether the tested intervention program can&#xD;
      be rooted in the real life context and sustain in practice. This pilot study chooses to use&#xD;
      the hybrid model to not only test the effectiveness but also examine the measures relating to&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;

    <description>The change of self-efficacy in three time-points. Self-efficacy will be measured by using the Chinese version of the General Self-efficacy Scale. The scale was validated in Chinese population and had a reliability alpha coefficient of 0.89. The scale consists of ten questions, scores ranging from 10 to 40, with higher scores representing better self-efficacy.</description>

The scale has been used in numerous studies with reliability confirmed when used locally. The rating of the items ranged from 0 to 100, with 50 indicating the standardized norm score.</description>
