    <textblock>
      The study is a non-interventional prospective observational study in patients with trigeminal&#xD;
      neuralgia that undergoes micovascular decompression. The aim is to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      complications 2 years after microvascular decompression&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate effect and complications 2 years after MVD&#xD;
      using independent assessors of outcome and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data of outcome and complications is collected prospectively based on based on standardized&#xD;
      follow-up schemes and questionnaires. Patients were assessed by independent assessors before&#xD;
      surgery and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery. Current pain level was evaluated according&#xD;
      to VAS and BNI pain scale. Complications were evaluated by the assessors by a questionnaire&#xD;
      and physical examination. All patients undergo a pre-surgical protocolized 3.0 Tesla MRI of&#xD;
      the brain and brainstem.&#xD;

        We consecutively evaluated patients with the diagnosis of TN seen at the Danish Headache&#xD;
        Center (DHC), a tertiary medical referral centre for headache and facial pain. Patients who&#xD;
        were treated with MVD at the Department of Neurosurgery were included in the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Most give Signed informed Consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must fullfil the ICHD-3 beta diagnostic criteria for classical TN.Patients with purely&#xD;
             paroxysmal TN and patients with TN with concomitant persistent facial pain will be&#xD;
             included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the ICHD-3 beta diagnostic criteria is fulfilled and if complete clinical history,&#xD;
             neurological and physical examination and a 3.0 Tesla MRI do not raise any suspicion&#xD;
             of another causative disease such as painful posttraumatic trigeminal neuropathy or&#xD;
             symptomatic TN, subjects with sensory abnormalities detected at clinical neurological&#xD;
             examination are also included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had a 3.0 Tesla MRI according to the trigeminal neuralgia protocol, prior to the&#xD;
             surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Semi-structured interview and neurological examination by the independent assessors&#xD;
             prior to neurosurgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has tried at least one, preferably two, sodium channel blocker (either carbamazepine&#xD;
             or oxcarbazepine) before referral to neurosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded if one of the following exclusion criteria is met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric or mental illness or condition that might interfere with the ability of&#xD;
             the patients to fill in the Informed Consent and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous microvascular decompression as a treatment for trigeminal neuralgia&#xD;
