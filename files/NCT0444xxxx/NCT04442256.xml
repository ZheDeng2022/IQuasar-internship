  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test the efficacy of dupilumab in patients with AERD regarding the intolerance to&#xD;
      salicylic acid after 6 months. This will be evaluated by oral drug provocation testing with&#xD;
      low dose salicylic acid after 6 months of dupilumab treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6 months of therapy, patients will tolerate aspirin dose levels as tested with&#xD;
      different dosages (125mg, 250mg and 500 mg).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 patients suffering from AERD will be included in this single-center, prospective,&#xD;
      explorative study for treatment with dupilumab. Before study initiation, informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained from all subjects. All patients with AERD can be included according to&#xD;
      inclusion- and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AERD patients who had already obtained a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of asthma or&#xD;
      polyps will also be included if at least a wash out period of 5 half -lives or 3 months has&#xD;
      passed. The first visit will be performed at screening (day 0, V1/before dupilumab therapy).&#xD;
      Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values will be ruled out prior to the first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be administered subcutaneous doses of dupilumab in a biweekly fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For several reasons comparison with placebo will not be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients included are in urgent need for an effective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The only currently available alternative treatment option is a functional endoscopic&#xD;
           sinus surgery (FESS). Usually there is a high recurrence rate after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All included patients have a long medical history concerning AERD. The rate of a&#xD;
           spontaneous improvement or resolution in this patient population is negligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry (peak-flow and FEV1) and an asthma control test will be performed prior to&#xD;
      dupilumab therapy, after 1, 3 and 6 months. In addition, the sinonasal outcome test-22 and&#xD;
      the total nasal endoscopic polyps score as well as nasal congestion score, disease severity&#xD;
      (by visual analogue scale=VAS), total symptom score (TSS) will be performed at baseline,&#xD;
      after 1,3 and 6 months. To further evaluate the polyp size, a nasal CT will be performed at&#xD;
      screening visit. To evaluate the sense of smell we will perform UPSIT testing before and&#xD;
      after 6 months dupilumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have routine laboratory testing (blood chemistry, hematology) before and&#xD;
      after 6 months of therapy. Adverse events will be recorded at each visit. Biological activity&#xD;
      will be evaluated based on peripheral blood eosinophil counts, serum total Immunoglobulin E&#xD;
      (IgE) levels and measurement of eosinophilic cationic protein in patients' sera at baseline&#xD;
      and after 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess local changes in the nose caused by dupilumab treatment, nasal secretions, nasal&#xD;
      mucosa samples (nasal curette), nasal microbiome as well as nasal biopsies will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of study, treatment will be continued in all patients with significant&#xD;
      improvement in asthmatic symptoms, nasal symptoms as well as a reduction of polyps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who did not experience clinical improvement, dupilumab treatment will be&#xD;
      discontinued after 6 months.&#xD;
