      Objective: To assess whether basal hormonal level can predict the elevation of P4 on the day&#xD;
      of oocyte retrieval, as well as to examine the impact of P4 elevation on the day of oocyte&#xD;
      retrieval on the outcome of assisted reproduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective cohort study Setting: Department of In Vitro Fertilization, Gynecology&#xD;
      and Obstetrics Institute, Clinical Center of Serbia Patient(s): One hundred sixty four&#xD;
      patients enrolled in the ART procedure Main Outcome Measure(s): Pregnancies, miscarriages,&#xD;
      biochemical pregnancies and deliveries&#xD;

      A prospective clinical trial was conducted at the Clinic for Gynecology and Obstetrics&#xD;
      Clinical Center of Serbia from January 1st to December 31st 2015. The study included 164&#xD;
      patients enrolled in the ART procedure at the Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basal hormonal status - serum levels of estradiol (E2 - pg/ml), progesterone (P4 - ng/ml),&#xD;
      follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH - mIU/ml), luteinizing hormone (LH - mIU/ml) and&#xD;
      anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH - ng/l) were measured on the 2ndor 3rd cycle day before&#xD;
      stimulation commencement. During COS levels of estradiol were determined, while levels of&#xD;
      progesterone were determined on the day of oocyte retrieval i.e. aspiration. Blood samples&#xD;
      were taken by Vacutainer tubes (BD Vacutainer Systems) and centrifuged according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's instructions for the preparation of the serum samples. AMH value (Gen II ELISA&#xD;
      ref. No. A79765; Beckman Coulter) in serum was measured by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent&#xD;
      assay), 1 ng / ml). FSH, LH, estradiol, and progesterone were analyzed by chemiluminescent&#xD;
      immunoassay (Access 2 immunoassay system, Beckman Coulter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measures were the procedure success as well as the pregnancy outcome.&#xD;
      Pregnancy was confirmed by a positive finding of serum β-hCG (&gt;25 MIU/ml) 14 days after&#xD;
      embryo transfer. Clinical pregnancies were confirmed by transvaginal ultrasound findings of a&#xD;
      gestational sac with a vital embryo at the 6th gestational week.&#xD;

        The study evaluated 164 patients undergoing ART procedure - oocyte retrieval and embryo&#xD;
        transfer in our Clinic. Patients in average had 34.66 ± 3.39 years, mean BMI was 22.23 ±&#xD;
        2.65, and their infertility mostly lasted for 4.86 ± 2.61 years (range 1 to 17 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
        The mean P4 values on OR day were 1.26 ± 0.46 ng/ml in group P4 &lt;2ng/ml, while in the group&#xD;
        of patients with P4 values ≥2ng/ml, the average P4 was 3.74 ± 1.62 ng/ml.&#xD;
