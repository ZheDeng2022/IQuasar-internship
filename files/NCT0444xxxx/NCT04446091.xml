  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single center, non-randomized, phase Ⅱ trial to evaluate safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of using the combination treatment of Camrelizumab with anti-angiogenic drugs and&#xD;
      Chemotherapy of metastatic colorectal mucinous adenocarcinoma(MAC).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer contains multiple pathological types, and one of the more special&#xD;
      pathological types is mucinous adenocarcinoma. The prognosis of patients with mucinous&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma is not ideal.Some molecular and genetic factors may be related to the&#xD;
      characteristics of mucinous adenocarcinoma, in which microsatellite instability and loss of&#xD;
      mismatch repair proteins are a focus of current research. Microsatellite instability is often&#xD;
      associated with poor differentiation and higher tumor stage. Adenocarcinoma that secretes a&#xD;
      large amount of mucus in pathological features.so,In this study, the incidence of ORR and AEs&#xD;
      was the main endpoint, and the efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab combined with&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic drugs in the treatment of advanced colorectal mucinous adenocarcinoma were&#xD;
      observed and evaluated.&#xD;
