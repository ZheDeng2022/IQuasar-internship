  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of INCMGA00012&#xD;
      and pelareorep and to see how well they work in treating patients with triple negative breast&#xD;
      cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCMGA00012 is a monoclonal antibody that works by attaching to the programmed cell death&#xD;
      protein 1 (PD-1) and blocking this pathway, allowing the immune system to recognize and&#xD;
      attack the cancer cells. Pelareorep is a type of virus called reovirus which occurs naturally&#xD;
      and may break down cancer cells. Giving INCMGA00012 and pelareorep may slow the growth and&#xD;
      spread of the cancer to another part of the body.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy of the combination of retifanlimab (INCMGA00012) and pelareorep&#xD;
      for patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer in the second and third line&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the safety, tolerability and feasibility of INCMGA00012 in combination with the&#xD;
      oncolytic virus pelareorep for patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer in the&#xD;
      second and third line setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and duration of response&#xD;
      (DOR) in patients receiving INCMGA00012 in combination with the oncolytic virus pelareorep&#xD;
      for patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer in the second and third line&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess quality of life measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess whether pre-treatment PD-L1 expression is associated with treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine if changes in T cell repertoire as measured by T-cell receptor (TCR)&#xD;
      sequencing is predictive of treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pelareorep intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 2, 15, and 16.&#xD;
      Patients also receive retifanlimab IV over 60 minutes on day 3. Cycles repeat every 28 days&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days, then every 6&#xD;
      months for up to 2 years.&#xD;
