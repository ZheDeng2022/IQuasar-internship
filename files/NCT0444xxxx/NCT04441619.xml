  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project proposes to understand the sources of pain variability, and demonstrate that&#xD;
      pain variability represents fluctuation in natural pain management. The project further&#xD;
      proposes to determine if endogenous capacity to modulate pain can be trained to maximize&#xD;
      their body's ability to manage pain, much as the way in which athletic performance can be&#xD;
      trained.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many physiological systems (bioenergy, immune etc.) involve feedback mechanisms to respond to&#xD;
      challenges, with increased output or capacity for adaptive change. A similar process is&#xD;
      plausible for pain modulation where previous successful pain experience and resolution&#xD;
      suggests a pain modulatory system with adaptive capacity. The proposed research examines how&#xD;
      a musculoskeletal training program modulates pain response in people with fibromyalgia&#xD;
      compared to healthy individuals. Previous research suggests that moderate-high level exercise&#xD;
      is associated with attenuation of pain sensitivity and clinical pain intensity in healthy&#xD;
      individuals. The proposal seeks to extend findings from previous research and examine how&#xD;
      repeated exposure and subsequent adaptations to musculoskeletal pain over time influence pain&#xD;
      modulation (PMC). The first outcome is that people with fibromyalgia (FM) will have PMC&#xD;
      trainability similar to asymptomatic controls, with the obvious implications for clinical&#xD;
      application. The second outcome is that FM patients will demonstrate a deficit in PMC&#xD;
      trainability. This outcome will represent an important diagnostic sign, and guide research to&#xD;
      additional mechanistic investigation. The third outcome is that impaired or lessened PMC&#xD;
      trainability is evident in FM patients and this variability can be explored as an individual&#xD;
      difference with clinical implications. The theoretical fourth potential outcome is&#xD;
      sensitization in FM patients, however pilot data show that DOMS resolves within the same&#xD;
      relative time window as controls. Though not hypothesized, the data and design will allow for&#xD;
      examination of this possibility. One potential conclusion from these projects could be that&#xD;
      FM arises from an inability to enter a recovery period within which PMC could adapt and&#xD;
      increase resilience. The proposal will be able to address at least some of the potential for&#xD;
      this inability to recover.&#xD;
