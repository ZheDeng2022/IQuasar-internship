  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arterial Fibrillation (AF) is well-recognized as a cause for cryptogenic Acute Ischemic&#xD;
      Stroke (AIS) and is associated with Silent Brain Infarction (SBI). However, the role of AF in&#xD;
      the formation of lesions (SBIs) is less well established than its role in AIS and needs&#xD;
      clarification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that continuous rhythm monitoring will yield a similar&#xD;
      incidence of AF diagnosis in patients with SBI as compared to patients with cryptogenic AIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the cumulative incidence of AF diagnosis at 24 months in&#xD;
      patients with SBI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arterial Fibrillation (AF) is well-recognized as a cause for cryptogenic Acute Ischemic&#xD;
      Stroke (AIS) and searched for in clinical practice. However, although AF is associated with&#xD;
      Silent Brain Infarction (SBI), its role in the formation of these lesions is less well&#xD;
      established and needs clarification. A multitude of clinical, laboratory, echocardiographic&#xD;
      and electrocardiographic parameters are associated with AF. Although no single one of these&#xD;
      parameters has sufficient specificity to rule-in AF, their combined use may nevertheless help&#xD;
      to identify patients with SBI at highest risk for AF. The study is expected to provide&#xD;
      evidence that long term monitoring in subjects with SBI yields similar rates of AF as in AIS&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged ≥65 years with a presumably silent brain lesion in a brain magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging fulfilling inclusion criteria and consenting get a subcutaneous implantation of a&#xD;
      cardiac monitor (Reveal LINQ). Data will be directly transferred to the treating physician by&#xD;
      the Medtronic MyCareLink Patient Monitor. In case of a relevant arrhythmia, the respective&#xD;
      study site will be informed by the staff of Inselspital. Relevant arrhythmias are defined as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First episode of atrial fibrillation (≥30 seconds)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sustained ventricular tachycardia (≥30 seconds)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sustained supraventricular tachycardia (≥30 seconds)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Asystoly of ≥6 seconds duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atrial fibrillation with pause of ≥6 seconds duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Higher degree atrioventricular (AV) block (3° AV bloc; 2:1 AV conduction; 2° AV block&#xD;
           type Mobitz)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sustained bradycardia &lt;30 beats per minute (≥30 seconds) It is the responsibility of the&#xD;
           respective study sites to take appropriate actions and inform the patients and treating&#xD;
           physicians about relevant findings. The maximal timeframe from data transmission to data&#xD;
           analysis is one week and from data transmission to patient notification two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected results of the study would be supportive in introducing long term monitoring to&#xD;
      the care pathway in subjects with SBI. Since SBI are more prevalent than AIS and current&#xD;
      recommendations very restrictive, this would have a relevant impact on SBI management.&#xD;
