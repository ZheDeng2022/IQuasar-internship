  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia with an expected rise in prevalence&#xD;
      over the next decade. Beyond causing troublesome symptoms AF is associated with increased&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity. Catheter ablation is a safe treatment which is effective for&#xD;
      paroxysmal AF but the success rate for persistent AF remains approximately 50% at 1 year. A&#xD;
      new mapping technique, called Stochastic Trajectory Analysis of Ranked signals (STAR&#xD;
      Mapping™) Method, has recently been developed. In a pilot study, localised sources driving AF&#xD;
      were consistently mapped and ablated with excellent acute and long term outcomes. This trial&#xD;
      will test the clinical effectiveness of this approach by comparing conventional ablation with&#xD;
      pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) to PVI plus STAR mapping™ guided ablation. We plan to test&#xD;
      this through a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial including 177 patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective multi-centre randomised controlled trial with two treatment arms.&#xD;
      We plan to include up to 15 UK centres. Patients that have been referred for catheter&#xD;
      ablation of symptomatic persistent AF will be recruited. Patients will be consented and have&#xD;
      their baseline review after having been listed for AF ablation on the hospital waiting list.&#xD;
      They will be randomized to one of two treatment arms. All patients will undergo their&#xD;
      procedure using a 3D mapping system. Standard catheters will be used during the ablation&#xD;
      procedure. Because the STAR mapping™ system will be configured for use with a special version&#xD;
      of the 3D mapping system Carto (BIosense Webster) the study will mandate use of clinically&#xD;
      approved Carto catheters: Smarttouch thermocool ablation catheter and the Pentarray mapping&#xD;
      catheter. Ablation procedures will be carried out using the usual policies and protocols of&#xD;
      the institutions involved except for the specific points below. The two treatment arms&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control arm - PVI alone After PVI, no further ablation in AF will be allowed. If the&#xD;
           patient organizes into an atrial tachycardia (AT) during PVI this will be mapped and&#xD;
           ablated. Otherwise, in accordance with common clinical practice, a 30 minute waiting&#xD;
           period will be observed following PVI to watch for acute pulmonary vein reconnection.&#xD;
           During this waiting period, mapping data will be acquired using the multipolar pulmonary&#xD;
           vein mapping catheter to acquire STAR mapping™ data. The operator will be blinded to&#xD;
           these data. This is done using the pentarray mapping catheter to acquire a minimum of 10&#xD;
           widely spaced globally distributed left atrial recordings of 30 seconds each outside the&#xD;
           pulmonary veins. If the patient has remained in AF post PVI then electrical&#xD;
           cardioversion will be performed, the pulmonary veins checked and re-isolated if needed,&#xD;
           and the procedure terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Experimental arm - PVI followed by STAR guided ablation. If the patient organises to&#xD;
           sinus rhythm after PVI alone then a 30 minute wait will be observed to ensure sustained&#xD;
           PVI and the procedure terminated. If patients remain in AF following PVI, the left&#xD;
           atrium will be mapped using a multipolar mapping catheter to acquire a minimum of 10&#xD;
           widely spaced globally distributed recordings outside the pulmonary veins. STAR mapping™&#xD;
           data will be exported and maps generated. Ablation will then be targeted at the leading&#xD;
           sites identified by STAR mapping™ in order of ranking (1st first, 2nd second, etc.) with&#xD;
           the end-point of AF termination. If AF terminates further sites will not be targeted. If&#xD;
           patients terminate to an atrial tachycardia then this will be mapped and ablated as per&#xD;
           standard clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If AF persists following ablation of all STAR mapping™ identified sites then mapping of the&#xD;
      right atrium may be considered if the septum consistently activates early and the coronary&#xD;
      sinus activation is predominantly proximal to distal, and further ablation permitted in the&#xD;
      right atrium if indicated. If patients remain in AF following ablation then they will be&#xD;
      electrically cardioverted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up All patients will undergo 12 months follow-up with an ECG at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months,&#xD;
      and a 48h ambulatory Holter monitor at 6 and 12 months. Patients will routinely continue&#xD;
      anti-arrhythmic therapy for up to 3 months post procedure which will be considered a blanking&#xD;
      period. After 3 months rhythmically active antiarrhythmic drugs will be stopped.&#xD;
