  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of multiple&#xD;
      ascending iv doses of MEDI341 in male and female subjects with Parkinson's Disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include up to 3 cohorts, with 12 subjects in each, for a total of up to 36&#xD;
      randomised subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study comprises a screening period of up to 49 days, an 8-week double-blind treatment&#xD;
      period, and a 13-week follow-up period. Each subject will receive three 60 minute iv&#xD;
      infusions of MEDI1341 or placebo during the 8-week treatment period, with 4 weeks between&#xD;
      infusions. The overall study duration (enrolment, treatment, and follow-up periods) will be&#xD;
      up to 28 weeks per subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Dose Escalation Committee will review data from each cohort to allow progression to the&#xD;
      next higher dose cohort in the study.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must be aged 40 to 85 years, inclusive, on the day of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Meet criteria for a diagnosis of mild-to-moderate idiopathic PD according to the&#xD;
             United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria (Hughes et al 1992)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. PD should be stage 1 to 3 using the Hoehn and Yahr scale as modified (Goetz et al&#xD;
             2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects receiving medications for PD should have been on a stable dosing regimen of&#xD;
             their medication(s) for ≥ 1 month before randomization, with no expectation of a need&#xD;
             to change the medications or dosing regimen for the duration of the study, barring&#xD;
             unforeseen circumstances. (For subjects who are not currently receiving medications to&#xD;
             treat PD, there should be no expectation of a need to initiate these for the duration&#xD;
             of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must have a body weight of 45 to 120 kg, inclusive, and a body mass index of&#xD;
             18 to 34 kg/m2, inclusive at screening and at check-in for the first infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects may be male or female. Female subjects must of non-childbearing potential&#xD;
             (postmenopausal and/or surgically sterile.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Postmenopausal women must have had ≥ 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (with a&#xD;
             follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] concentration ≥ 26 mIU/mL in women ≤ 60 years of&#xD;
             age; women &gt; 60 years of age do not require an FSH test) and must have had a negative&#xD;
             serum pregnancy test result at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Surgically sterile women are defined as those who have had a hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
             ovariectomy (oophorectomy), salpingectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation. Women who are&#xD;
             surgically sterile must provide documentation of the procedure by an operative report,&#xD;
             ultrasound, or other verifiable medical documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Men who are biologically capable of fathering children must agree and commit to use an&#xD;
             adequate form of double-barrier contraception for the duration of the treatment period&#xD;
             and for 5 half lives (100 days) after the last administration of study intervention. A&#xD;
             male subject is considered capable of fathering children even if his sexual partner is&#xD;
             sterile or using contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Men who are biologically capable of fathering children must also agree to refrain from&#xD;
             sperm donation for the duration of the treatment period and for 5 half-lives or 90&#xD;
             days (whichever is longer) after the last administration of study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects must, in the investigator's opinion, understand the nature of the study and&#xD;
             must provide signed and dated written informed consent before the conduct of any&#xD;
             study-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects must, in the opinion of the investigator, be able to participate in all&#xD;
             scheduled evaluations, likely to be compliant, and likely to complete all required&#xD;
             tests, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans and lumbar punctures&#xD;
             (LPs). (Note: The investigator should assess the physical and functional needs of the&#xD;
             subject at screening, as participation in the study may be contingent upon the&#xD;
             availability and willingness of a caregiver to attend with the subject at all study&#xD;
             visits.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects must be able to read, write, and speak fluently in English and/or Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects must agree not to post any personal medical data related to the study or&#xD;
             information related to the study on any website or social media site (eg, Facebook,&#xD;
             Twitter, Instagram, etc) until the study has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects must have a MoCA total score of ≥ 24.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. In the opinion of the investigator, a recent clinically significant illness (other&#xD;
             than PD), infection, medical/surgical procedure, or significant trauma within 30 days&#xD;
             prior to screening, or between screening and randomization, that is likely to&#xD;
             deteriorate, compromise the subject's safety or ability to complete the study, or&#xD;
             compromise the interpretation of the study results (Note: a history of coronavirus&#xD;
             disease 2019 [COVID 19] infection with unresolved medical sequelae would be considered&#xD;
             exclusionary.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of a serious or unstable clinically significant illness, including hepatic,&#xD;
             renal, gastroenterologic, respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrinologic, immunologic or&#xD;

             parkinsonism, metabolic diseases with parkinsonian signs and symptoms (eg, Wilson&#xD;
             disease, manganese exposure) or other secondary forms of Parkinsonism, and ischemic or&#xD;
             traumatic brain injury (including multiple episodes of head trauma, or head trauma&#xD;
             resulting in protracted loss of consciousness within the 5 years prior to screening or&#xD;
             between screening and randomization)&#xD;

             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-V; APA 2013) or symptom if,&#xD;
             in the judgment of the investigator, the psychiatric disorder or symptom is likely to&#xD;
             confound interpretation of the study results, affect motor function assessment, or&#xD;
             affect the subject's ability to complete the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. A diagnosis of intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or mental&#xD;

             exclusionary unless there is a documented legitimate medical reason for the subject's&#xD;
             cannabinoid use (eg, chronic pain) or the investigator and medical monitor agree that&#xD;
