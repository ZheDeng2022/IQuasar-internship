  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Literature is contradictory about the impact of mediolateral episiotomy during operative&#xD;
      vaginal delivery in obstetric anal sphincter injuries prevention explaining the absence of&#xD;
      international guidelines. The investigators consider that a randomized trials does not&#xD;
      appears feasible for both ethical and practical reason and so we suggest a large national&#xD;
      observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will include all nulliparous women that underwent an operative vaginal&#xD;
      delivery within the 72h following the delivery at more than 34 weeks of amenorrhea. The&#xD;
      investigators will collect data about the history of pregnancy, the course of labor, the mode&#xD;
      of delivery, maternal immediate and one-year morbidity, neonatal immediate morbidity. The&#xD;
      investigators expect a one-year study in 129 recruiting center with 15000 included women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the protective effect of mediolateral episiotomy against&#xD;
      obstetric anal sphincter injury during instrumental delivery in nulliparous women according&#xD;
      to the type of instrument used. The secondary endpoints are to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      mediolateral episiotomy on one-year maternal morbidity, immediate maternal morbidity. The&#xD;
      investigators also aim to develop a clinical score to assess the absolute risk of obstetric&#xD;
      anal sphincter injury during instrumental delivery. Finally, the investigators will&#xD;
      investigate the impact of fetal presentation ultrasound assessment immediately before&#xD;
      instrumental delivery on the mode of delivery.&#xD;

        We will include in 121 centers in France during women year women who gave birth to their&#xD;
        first child with requirement of an operative delivery. We will compare those who underwent&#xD;
        a mediolateral episiotomy to those wo have not for the occurrence of obstetric anal&#xD;
        sphincter injury according to the type of instrument used&#xD;
