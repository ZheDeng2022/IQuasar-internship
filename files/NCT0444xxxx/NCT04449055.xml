      This is a pilot study to test the feasibility of a recruitment strategy and study protocol to&#xD;
      examine the effects of a dual target transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment in&#xD;
      methamphetamine use disorder. The study will test intermittent theta burst stimulation (TBS)&#xD;
      targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) combined with continuous TBS targeting&#xD;
      the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) in people with methamphetamine use disorder (MAUD) who&#xD;
      are engaged in psychosocial treatment. Intermittent TBS targeting the DLPFC is approved by&#xD;
      the Food and Drug Administration for major depressive disorder, and continuous TBS targeting&#xD;
      the MPFC has been studied in cocaine use disorder. We will administer this dual target TBS&#xD;
      daily for 2 weeks, followed by three times weekly for 2 weeks, and monitor depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, anxiety, sleep, craving, quality of life, and methamphetamine use for three months.&#xD;
      Changes in functional connectivity of brain circuits will be evaluated with functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after treatment. We expect to observe changes in&#xD;
      connectivity between the DLPFC, MPFC, and other regions implicated in addiction and&#xD;
      impulsivity. Furthermore, we will evaluate if baseline differences in functional connectivity&#xD;
      can be used to predict response. Psychological tests focusing on state impulsivity and risk&#xD;
      taking will be administered, and we expect to observe reductions in these characteristics&#xD;
      after treatment. We will test this protocol in 20 patients recruited from clinical care&#xD;
      settings at University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, University of New Mexico Health System,&#xD;
      and University of Utah Health to illustrate the feasibility of recruitment and completing the&#xD;
      protocol, to support an external funding proposal.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Overview: This is a single-arm clinical trial, with historical controls as a comparison group&#xD;
      for select outcomes. Subjects with MAUD will receive 16 sessions of dual-target theta burst&#xD;
      stimulation to the DLPFC and MPFC over 4 weeks. We will follow outcomes for 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Outcomes include treatment retention, craving, self-reported MA or stimulant use, urine drug&#xD;
      screen results, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, sleep quality, quality of life,&#xD;
      response inhibition, and functional connectivity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure&#xD;
      functional connectivity and a flanker task to measure response inhibition will be completed&#xD;
      at baseline and four weeks. More detail is provided in the outcome measures section. Subjects&#xD;
      will also complete the Big Five Inventory at baseline, a measure of personality&#xD;
      characteristics, to explore how these relate to outcomes including retention in treatment and&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR Image Acquisition: MRI will be completed at baseline and after the last TMS session. The&#xD;
      MRI sessions will be conducted using research dedicated MRI scanners at each site. Anatomical&#xD;
      images will include volumetric T1 and T2 weighted images with a 1.0 mm isotropic spatial&#xD;
      resolution. Resting state fMRI will be performed to collect 20 minutes worth of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retention in the Study and Psychosocial Treatment: We will describe the proportion of&#xD;
      subjects who complete the 4-week TMS treatment period and complete each subsequent monthly&#xD;
      follow-up visit. We will use Kaplan-Meier curves to describe retention in the study and in&#xD;
      psychosocial treatment. If non-retention is common enough, we will use Cox regression to&#xD;
      explore baseline measures as predictors of retention. We anticipate that multivariate&#xD;
      analysis will not be feasible with the sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms and Impulse Control Measures: Primary analyses for other measures will focus on&#xD;
      changes over the 4-week TMS treatment period. Changes in symptoms evaluated weekly or&#xD;
      biweekly (e.g. craving, depression, affect, anxiety, sleep) will be assessed using&#xD;
      generalized linear mixed models with appropriate distributions. We anticipate a Poisson&#xD;
      distribution for days of MA or other stimulant use and will use a binomial distribution with&#xD;
      a logit link to evaluate changes in positive urine drug screens. Time will be the primary&#xD;
      variable of interest to assess the slopes of change during treatment. Paired t-tests or&#xD;
      Wilcoxon signed-rank tests will be used to evaluate changes in measures completed at baseline&#xD;
      and after 4 weeks of treatment. We will compare measures at baseline and 4 weeks to those at&#xD;
      8 weeks and 12 weeks similarly, but in separate analyses since decay in effects may occur&#xD;
      after TMS ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional Connectivity Analysis: fMRI functional connectivity analysis will be performed&#xD;
      using a standard analysis pipeline. Functional images will undergo pre-processing including&#xD;
      brain extraction, motion correction, spatial smoothing (6 mm FWHM), and temporal filtering&#xD;
      (.008 Hz &lt; f &lt; 0.08 Hz). Following preprocessing, the fMRI signal will be corrected for&#xD;
      potential sources of noise using image-based estimates and motion correction parameters. The&#xD;
      resulting corrected time-series will be used for all functional connectivity analyses.&#xD;
      Functional connectivity will be measured by extracting time-series data from the&#xD;
      pre-processed imaging data for the regions of interest (ROIs). Multiple ROIs will be examined&#xD;
      and will be defined as spheres (6mm radius) based on coordinate locations previously&#xD;
      published by Yeo and colleagues. Specifically, we will focus on connectivity in the&#xD;
      cingulo-opercular network involved in cognitive control and salience (DLPFC - anterior&#xD;
      insula; DLPFC - anterior cingulate) and reward processing/motivation circuit (MPFC - ventral&#xD;
      striatum). Analyses will be averaged across right and left hemispheres but we will also&#xD;
      explore differences between right and left hemispheres. The time series from the ROIs will be&#xD;
      cross-correlated with the time-series from the other ROIs to determine the strength of&#xD;
      functional connectivity between regions. The resulting Pearson's r will be converted to&#xD;
      Fisher's z scores to improve normality for the statistical analysis. We will treat each ROI&#xD;
      pair connection (DLPFC - anterior insula, DLPFC - anterior cingulate, MPFC - ventral&#xD;
      striatum) as a dependent variable. Primary analyses will use paired t-tests or Wilcoxon&#xD;
      signed-rank tests to compare connectivity at baseline vs. after TMS treatment. We will&#xD;
      explore correlates of connectivity and changes using Pearson or Spearman correlations and&#xD;
      linear regression or mixed models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Analysis: Follow-up exploratory voxel-wise analyses will be conducted for&#xD;
      functional connectivity, which will provide thousands of individual predictors. This will&#xD;
      help confirm findings in large parcel ROI based analysis. We will use the same statistical&#xD;
      models as used for the ROI based analysis described above but at the voxel level. Voxel-wise&#xD;
      data creates a high-dimensional problem in which the number of predictors far exceeds the&#xD;
      number of participants. Machine learning methods, such as random forest will be used to&#xD;
      handle the high-dimensional sub-analyses. Random forest requires a minimum of data&#xD;
      assumptions, automatically accounts for non-linear and interaction effects, and it has proven&#xD;
      useful in identifying useful predictors in high-dimensional contexts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison with Historical Controls: We will compare retention in psychosocial treatment&#xD;
      programs and positive urine drug screens from chart review with a historical control group of&#xD;
      patients with MA use disorder matched on age, sex, site, and psychosocial treatment modality.&#xD;
      Treatment retention will be compared using a log-rank test. Positive urine drug screens in&#xD;
      each week of follow-up will be compared using generalized estimating equation models with a&#xD;
      logit link, clustered on subject, with participation in the TMS study as the variable of&#xD;
      interest.&#xD;
