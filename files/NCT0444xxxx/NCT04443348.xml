    <textblock>
      This research trial is studying a combination of neoadjuvant radiotherapy (RT), immunotherapy&#xD;
      (pembrolizumab) and chemotherapy for lymph node-positive, triple negative (TN) or hormone&#xD;
      receptor positive/HER2-negative breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation Therapy (RT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunotherapy: Pembrolizumab (MK-3475)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemotherapies:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Paclitaxel&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Doxorubicin (also called Adriamycin)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cyclophosphamide&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Carboplatin (optional, and in TN only)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Capecitabine (optional, and in TN only)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to find out what is the best dose of preoperative RT when&#xD;
      combined with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. The study will assess if combining the RT with&#xD;
      the immunotherapy agent, pembrolizumab, will increase the ability of the immune system to&#xD;
      destroy cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment,&#xD;
      including evaluations and follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to assess the effectiveness of pembrolizumab (study drug) with or without RT&#xD;
      directed to the breast tumor. Participants will then undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, followed by treatment that can consist of one or more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab (optional, per MD discretion)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard of Care Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Breast surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy) and axillary surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adjuvant radiation to the entire breast or chest wall, plus or minus the lymph&#xD;
                nodes after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adjuvant chemotherapy (optional Capecitabine for TNBC patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hormone therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to 1 of 3 groups. Neither the participant not the research&#xD;
      doctor will choose the group that the participant is assigned to. However, the participant&#xD;
      will be notified of the group prior to the start of study treatment. Participants will&#xD;
      receive study treatment for up to 13 months. Participants will be followed for 2 years after&#xD;
      the end of the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that a total of 120 people will be participating in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a randomized, phase II study. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) has not approved pembrolizumab for your specific disease, but it has been approved for&#xD;
      other uses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the chemotherapies being&#xD;
      used in this study (Paclitaxel, Doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide, Carboplatin, Capecitabine).&#xD;
