  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib and pembrolizumab work for the first-line&#xD;
      treatment of patients with liver cancer who are not eligible for local therapy (i.e. advanced&#xD;
      stage). Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some cell surface&#xD;
      receptors and signaling pathways inside the tumor cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer.&#xD;
      Giving cabozantinib and pembrolizumab together may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      advanced liver cancer compared to cabozantinib or pembrolizumab alone.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cabozantinib S-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up&#xD;
      to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Disease assessment&#xD;
      by imaging will be performed every 9 weeks.&#xD;
