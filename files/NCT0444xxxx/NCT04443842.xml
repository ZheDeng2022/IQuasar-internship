      A feasibility pilot study of a randomised control trial of adults newly diagnosed with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes to compare the effectiveness of financial and social incentives on healthy lifestyle&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of testing the feasibility of the interventions being implemented in&#xD;
      our main trial in local settings. Adults newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes without&#xD;
      receiving any anti-diabetic medication in Hong Kong are randomised to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of financial and social incentives against a control group receiving standard&#xD;
      care. The investigators follow participants for 9-months (6-month intervention period and a&#xD;
      3-month post-intervention follow-up period) to assess glycemic control and other health&#xD;
      indicators. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups (in ratio 3:1): arm A&#xD;
      (financial and social incentives in addition to standard care), and arm B (control arm&#xD;
      receiving standard care). Financial incentives will be framed around loss aversion and the&#xD;
      endowment effect. Social incentives will include peer competition, and social support.&#xD;
      Financial and social incentives are to encourage increased physical activity and participants&#xD;
      will use a pedometer to track activity. Participants are followed for an additional 3-months&#xD;
      after the cessation of incentives to assess the sustainability of lifestyle changes.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be credited with HK$1000 in their virtual accounts at the beginning of the trial. After baseline step counts are gathered in the second week, participants will lose HK$40 for each subsequent week that they do not meet their personal weekly step target.&#xD;
The social incentives are peer comparison and social support. Participants receive feedback of their physical activity performance by assessing whether they met or exceeded their step count target, followed by positive messages for encouragement. Nominated supporters will be informed of participants' performance for social support.</description>
