  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lien Centre for Palliative Care has been commissioned by Lien Foundation to produce the 2020&#xD;
      rankings of the Quality of End of Life Care across countries. This index will focus on&#xD;
      patients with life limiting illnesses and their families and aims to produce an index and&#xD;
      rankings that take into account the preferences of patients, their caregivers and providers&#xD;
      in terms of what is truly important at end of life. The aim of this research is to&#xD;
      investigate best practices in palliative care policy and implementation as they relate to&#xD;
      end-of-life care for individuals with life-limiting or life-threatening conditions. This task&#xD;
      will be completed through a systematic review of peer reviewed and grey literature,&#xD;
      supplemented with qualitative interviews to identify the list of the candidate indicators to&#xD;
      be used in the index. A final instrument when completed by country experts will allow for&#xD;
      ranking countries in their ability to deliver high quality end of life care.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Palliative care has gained considerable attention at the global, regional and national levels&#xD;
      and there has been follow-up on actions outlined in the 2014 World Health Assembly (WHA)&#xD;
      Resolution on palliative care. The WHA Resolution called countries to action to integrate&#xD;
      palliative care into their national health strategies and as part of universal health&#xD;
      coverage (UHC) efforts. Further, important contributions have been made to the literature on&#xD;
      palliative care overall and at the end of life, such as by the Lancet Commission on Global&#xD;
      Access to Palliative Care and Pain Relief as well as on quality healthcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through this research, the Quality of Death and Dying Index will be published and it seeks to&#xD;
      facilitate monitoring of country-level progress based on domains/sub-domains and indicators&#xD;
      used to define quality of death and dying in the discourse on end-of-life care, and within&#xD;
      the context of the contrasting realities occurring worldwide. Examining the various&#xD;
      trajectories that countries have followed and the experiences of end-of-life care design and&#xD;
      delivery by countries from different income groups and based on the viewpoint of diverse&#xD;
      stakeholders will provide critical information for metrics development, namely the 2020&#xD;
      Quality of Death and Dying Index&#xD;
