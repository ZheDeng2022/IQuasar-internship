    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single center, pharmacokinetic (PK) study to assess valacyclovir&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in neonates and compare to the pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of the standard of care treatment dose of intravenous acyclovir. 6 (up to 10&#xD;
      infants) with virologically confirmed neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) disease who meet&#xD;
      all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. Study duration is 5 years.&#xD;
      Primary objective is to define the pharmacokinetics of valacyclovir and assess its safety in&#xD;
      neonates 2-12 weeks of age who are ≥ 34 weeks gestation.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, single center, PK study to assess valacyclovir pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics in neonates and compare to the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the&#xD;
      standard of care treatment dose of intravenous acyclovir. Only those babies with&#xD;
      virologically confirmed neonatal HSV disease will be enrolled in the study. The decision to&#xD;
      initiate valacyclovir for 2 (up to 7) days will be made by a physician based on&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, and those who meet entry criteria will be eligible for the&#xD;
      study. Those enrolled in the study will have daily random parenteral acyclovir PK levels&#xD;
      drawn during the first week of treatment (drawn only at times of other lab draws). These&#xD;
      infants will also have a pharmacokinetic sampling profile obtained on or after dose 22 and&#xD;
      before dose 42 of intravenous acyclovir. The PK samples for the sampling profile will be&#xD;
      collected just prior to the next dose of intravenous acyclovir (within 30 minutes prior to&#xD;
      the start of the infusion), within 15 minutes of completion of the infusion, and 3-4 hours&#xD;
      after infusion. Upon completion of the recommended treatment course duration with intravenous&#xD;
      acyclovir determined by disease classification (skin, eye, and mouth; central nervous system;&#xD;
      or disseminated disease), the infant will be started on enteral valacyclovir 20 mg/kg every 8&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 2 and no more than day 7 of valacyclovir 20 mg/kg every 8 hours, a pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      sampling profile will be obtained. The PK samples will be collected just prior to the enteral&#xD;
      dose of valacyclovir (hour 0; 8 hours after previous dose and immediately before next dose),&#xD;
      1-2 hours after dose, and 3-5 hours after dose. Primary objective is to define the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of valacyclovir and assess its safety in neonates 2-12 weeks of age who are&#xD;
      ≥ 34 weeks gestation. Secondary objectives are to: 1) assess the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      high-dose parenteral acyclovir in neonates ≥ 34 weeks gestation with virologically confirmed&#xD;
      neonatal HSV disease who are receiving acyclovir as standard of care, 2) compare the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of high-dose parenteral acyclovir to the pharmacokinetics of the proposed&#xD;
      study dose of valacyclovir (20 mg/kg every 8 hours).&#xD;
