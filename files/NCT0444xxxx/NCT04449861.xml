             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement,&#xD;
             substantially increase risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient&#xD;
             to give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. History of active primary immunodeficiency.&#xD;

                  articular&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  injection).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of&#xD;
                  prednisone or its equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (eg, CT scan&#xD;
