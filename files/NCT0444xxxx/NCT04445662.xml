    <textblock>
      This community-based randomized controlled trial will test the effect of contingent financial&#xD;
      rewards on smoking abstinence among homeless-experienced adult cigarette smokers.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from 3 Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program locations:&#xD;
      a shelter clinic, a day center clinic, and a medical center clinic. All participants will be&#xD;
      offered a varenicline prescription and tobacco coaching. Incentive arm participants will&#xD;
      receive escalating financial rewards for saliva cotinine levels &lt;30 ng/ml, assessed 14 times&#xD;
      over 24 weeks. Embedded qualitative interviews will explore the mechanisms of on-treatment&#xD;
      and post-treatment effects of financial incentives on smoking abstinence in the context of&#xD;
      homelessness.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People experiencing homelessness have a 3.5-fold higher prevalence of cigarette smoking in&#xD;
      comparison to non-homeless people, contributing to 2-fold higher rates of lung cancer and 3-&#xD;
      to 5-fold higher rates of tobacco-attributable death. Homeless smokers want to quit, but&#xD;
      studies have not yet uncovered the optimal approach to help them do so. In an 8-week pilot&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) at Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program (BHCHP), we&#xD;
      found that financial incentives for smoking abstinence were associated with 7-fold higher&#xD;
      odds of brief smoking abstinence in comparison to a non-incentivized control condition. These&#xD;
      results suggest that financial incentives are a promising approach for reducing smoking in&#xD;
      this vulnerable population, but further investigation in a larger sample is needed to improve&#xD;
      the duration of on-treatment abstinence, assess post-treatment effects, and better understand&#xD;
      mechanisms of action and contextual factors that may influence treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the above gaps in evidence, we will conduct a community-based RCT of financial&#xD;
      incentives for smoking abstinence among adult smokers at BHCHP. We will randomize 400&#xD;
      participants recruited from 3 BHCHP sites: a shelter clinic, a day center clinic, and a&#xD;
      medical center clinic. All participants will be offered 12 weeks of varenicline, 5 sessions&#xD;
      of tobacco coaching, and 14 cotinine monitoring visits over a 24-week period. Participants&#xD;
      randomized to the financial incentives arm (n=200) will receive escalating debit card&#xD;
      payments (range $25-$70) at each monitoring visit for saliva cotinine levels &lt;30 ng/ml.&#xD;
      Control arm participants (n=200) will receive a fixed payment ($10) at each monitoring visit&#xD;
      regardless of their saliva cotinine level. We will use an embedded-experiment mixed methods&#xD;
      design, where qualitative ('qual') data collection is embedded within a larger quantitative&#xD;
      ('QUAN') RCT with the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. (QUAN) To determine the effect of the financial incentives intervention on&#xD;
      cotinine-verified 7-day smoking abstinence at A) the end of treatment (24 weeks) and B) 24&#xD;
      weeks after treatment (48 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: Incentive arm participants will have significantly greater cotinine-verified&#xD;
      7-day smoking abstinence than control arm participants at A) 24 weeks and B) 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. (qual) To assess why, how, and under what circumstances homeless smokers A) achieve&#xD;
      abstinence in response to financial incentives and B) maintain abstinence after incentives&#xD;
      are stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews with participants at A) 24 weeks (N=30) and B) 48 weeks (N=20) will examine&#xD;
      cognitive ('why?'), procedural ('how?'), and contextual ('under what circumstances?')&#xD;
      dimensions of their response to financial incentives to generate hypotheses about potential&#xD;
      mechanisms for on-treatment and post-treatment effects and to inform modifications of the&#xD;
      intervention for future use.&#xD;
