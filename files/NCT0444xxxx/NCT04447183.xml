      This is a randomized, open, parallel controlled, multi-center clinical trial; 120 subjects&#xD;
      were randomly assigned to the test group and the control group according to 3:1.&#xD;

      This study was conducted in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer who had undergone&#xD;
      near-total thyroidectomy. After surgery patients were randomized to one of two methods of&#xD;
      performing thyroid remnant ablation (use of radioiodine to remove any remaining thyroid&#xD;
      tissue). One group of patients who took thyroid hormone medicine and were euthyroid [i.e.&#xD;
      their thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are normal], and received injections of&#xD;
      Thyrogen (0.9 mg daily on two consecutive days) followed by oral radioiodine. The second&#xD;
      group of patients did not take thyroid hormone medicine so that they were hypothyroid (i.e.&#xD;
      their TSH levels were high), and were given oral radioiodine. All patients received the same&#xD;
      amount of radioactive iodine (30mCi±1.5mCi or 1.11GBq of 131I). Approximately 9 months later,&#xD;
      whole body scans were performed on all patients to learn whether the thyroid remnants had&#xD;
      been successfully ablated.&#xD;
