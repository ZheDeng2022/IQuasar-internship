    <textblock>
      Asthma is the most common respiratory disorder in children that causes breathing problems.&#xD;
      The patients may have respiratory symptoms such as cough, wheeze, or short of breath. Asthma&#xD;
      can be mild or severe when daily activities become compromised. Generally, by application of&#xD;
      proper treatment, asthma symptoms can be well controlled. However, the exacerbation of the&#xD;
      disease often leads to acute respiratory adverse events that require hospitalization and&#xD;
      school absenteeism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we plan the remote monitoring of lung function parameters in asthmatic&#xD;
      children (under 18 years of age). We hypothesize that the daily home monitoring of&#xD;
      respiratory indices will predict the occurrence of exacerbation and the hospitalization can&#xD;
      be lowered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthmatic children arriving for the regular examinations to the Department of Pediatrics and&#xD;
      Pediatric Health Care Center of the University of Szeged will be involved. The patients are&#xD;
      randomly divided into two treatment groups, telemonitoring and control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both groups, general patient characteristics will be recorded, and lung function&#xD;
      parameters will be measured with a clinical spirometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the telemedicine group receive the home mobile controlled spirometer and trained&#xD;
      by a pediatric pulmonologist for home examination. The spirometers are handed for 12 months,&#xD;
      and children are asked to perform measurements minimum 4 times per week (at least one day a&#xD;
      week in the morning and in the evening). In the case of asthma attacks, more frequent&#xD;
      measurements repeated several times a day are required. Children in the telemedicine group&#xD;
      complete the Asthma Control Test (ACT) after each measurement, which provides a numerical&#xD;
      score related to the severity of asthma symptoms. Lung function parameters measured by&#xD;
      children and the ACT results are automatically uploaded to a clinical server where the&#xD;
      pulmonologists and built-in algorithms are monitoring the quality of the data. In case of&#xD;
      deterioration of the lung function parameters, the patients are called for a personal visit&#xD;
      and their treatment can be revised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every three months, members of both groups come to the outpatient clinic for a personal&#xD;
      visit, where the same examinations are performed.&#xD;

      Asthma is the most common respiratory disorder in children characterized by periodic airway&#xD;
      obstruction, bronchial hyper-responsiveness, and airway inflammation. The symptoms of asthma&#xD;
      may include cough, wheeze, or bronchoconstriction with airflow limitation. The severity of&#xD;
      asthma may vary from mild to severe. Mild asthma is associated with rear events of short of&#xD;
      breath. However, the exacerbation of the disease often leads to acute respiratory adverse&#xD;
      events with severe hypoxia that requires hospitalization. The hospital care involves travel&#xD;
      costs for the children and parents, school and work absenteeism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate whether the annual occurrence of asthma&#xD;
      exacerbation can be decreased by the use of the telespirometry system. Another objective is&#xD;
      to determine which lung function parameters are best to predict asthma exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these aims we plan to involve two groups (telemonitoring and control) of asthmatic&#xD;
      children with GINA 2-5 stage under 18 years of age. Poor general condition, any disease which&#xD;
      endangers the health of the volunteer or contraindicates the study and lack of parental&#xD;
      consent are defined as the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lung function in the children in both groups will be monitored by conventional&#xD;
      spirometric assessment performed at the Department of Pediatrics and Pediatric Health Care&#xD;
      Center of the University of Szeged. After each lung function assessments children will be&#xD;
      asked to fill the Asthma Control Test (ACT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the telemedicine group receive the home mobile controlled spirometer and trained&#xD;
      by a pediatric pulmonologist for home examination. The spirometers are handed for 12 months,&#xD;
      and children are asked to perform measurements minimum 4 times per week (at least one day a&#xD;
      week in the morning and in the evening). In the case of asthma exacerbation, more frequent&#xD;
      measurements repeated several times a day are required. Children in the telemedicine group&#xD;
      complete the ACT after each measurement, which provides a numerical score related to the&#xD;
      severity of asthma symptoms. Lung function parameters measured by children and the ACT test&#xD;
      results are automatically uploaded to a clinical server where the pulmonologists and built-in&#xD;
      algorithms are monitoring the quality of the data. In case of deterioration of the lung&#xD;
      function parameters, the patients are called for a personal visit and their treatment can be&#xD;
      revised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every three months, members of both groups come to the outpatient clinic for a personal&#xD;
      visit, where the same examinations are performed.&#xD;
