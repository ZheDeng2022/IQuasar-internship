  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose a cross-sectional, observational pilot study to examine the&#xD;
      contribution of stress, family dynamics, and peer relationships to quality of life (QOL) in&#xD;
      adolescents with Tourette syndrome (TS). Investigators will recruit two groups of&#xD;
      participants: 1) adolescents aged 13-17 years of age with TS and 2) adolescents aged 13-17&#xD;
      without any neurologic or psychiatric diagnoses. Participants and one of their&#xD;
      parents/caregivers will complete a series of questionnaires screening for and quantifying the&#xD;
      extent of stress and mental health symptoms, including anxiety, depression, obsessive&#xD;
      compulsive disorder (OCD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Participants will&#xD;
      also complete instruments characterizing family interactions and peer relationships.&#xD;
      Adolescents with TS will also undergo a semi-structured interview assessing the severity of&#xD;
      their tics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tourette syndrome (TS) is a multi-faceted neurodevelopmental disorder with wide-ranging&#xD;
      impact on adolescent quality of life (QOL). Comorbid psychiatric and psychological factors&#xD;
      exert greater influence on QOL than tics in TS, but the specific role of stress, family&#xD;
      dynamics, and peer relationships has been largely overlooked, despite the fact that these&#xD;
      factors are known to impact QOL in those with chronic disease. Investigators propose a&#xD;
      cross-sectional, observational pilot study to examine the contribution of stress, family&#xD;
      dynamics, and peer relationships to QOL in adolescents with TS. The primary goal of this&#xD;
      study is to collect sufficient data for hypothesis-generation and power analysis refinement&#xD;
      in planning of a larger scale study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will recruit adolescents aged 13-17 years of age with TS presenting for regular&#xD;
      care at the Vanderbilt Pediatric Neurology Clinic. Adolescents without any neurologic or&#xD;
      psychiatric diagnoses will be recruited as a control population. Participants and one of&#xD;
      their parents/caregivers will complete a series of questionnaires screening for and&#xD;
      quantifying the extent of stress and mental health symptoms, including anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).&#xD;
      Participants will also complete instruments characterizing family interactions and peer&#xD;
      relationships. The scale battery can be completed by the adolescent and caregiver in parallel&#xD;
      and is anticipated to take 60-75 minutes total to complete. Adolescents with TS will also&#xD;
      undergo a semi-structured interview assessing the severity of their tics. The study plans to&#xD;
      enroll subjects over a 12-month time frame.&#xD;
