      Background Frequent attenders (FAs) at emergency department (ED) in Singapore hospitals have&#xD;
      been increasing over the years. More than half of the FAs are reported to be alcohol-related&#xD;
      frequent attenders (ARFA) and they were found to be using EDs unnecessarily. We aim to assess&#xD;
      if there will be a difference in patient outcomes in terms of ED usage and cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      by implementing an assertive community treatment (ACT) program to manage AFRAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This is a prospective, multi-centre, before-and-after, superiority and cohort study&#xD;
      to assess the impact of ACT from 4 study sites. 200-300 patients will be recruited and&#xD;
      followed up for 12 months. The primary objective of the study is to investigate whether there&#xD;
      will be a reduction in AFRA ED attendances. The secondary objective is to estimate the change&#xD;
      in total cost utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion/Significance All patients who are on ACT programme will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
      The study intervention will be used as a new mode of care at participating hospitals. We&#xD;
      expect to see reduced alcohol addiction level, reduced isolation level, improved motivation&#xD;
      and better overall health. With reduced alcohol-related hospital visits, we would also expect&#xD;
      to see improved healthcare utilization by ARFAs which will lead to increased cost savings to&#xD;
      the healthcare systems and decreased social costs.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Singapore has seen a steady growth in the use of emergency department (ED)&#xD;
      services. ED visits increased from 752,122 in 2007 to 1,006,800 in 2013. Despite efforts to&#xD;
      redirect low acuity ED patients to primary care, EDs continue to be busy and with long waits&#xD;
      for patients. Data suggest that frequent attenders to ED take up a disproportionate share of&#xD;
      the resources. Based on a set of pre-determined criteria, frequent attenders were found to be&#xD;
      more likely to make inappropriate and unwarranted visits to ED. These ED visits would be&#xD;
      better served by a different part of the healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with alcohol misuse problems are known to make up a significant proportion of&#xD;
      frequent attenders. Such patients are referred to as Alcohol-Related Frequent Attenders&#xD;
      (ARFAs).This population of patients exist in the community and tend to cycle through the&#xD;
      healthcare system through emergency departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARFA's are characterized by poor physical and mental health and a high level of unmet social&#xD;
      needs, contributing to markedly poor engagement with appropriate services. They belong to the&#xD;
      segment of patients with severe alcohol misuse disorders that have low motivation for change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that traditional clinic-based alcohol services have difficulty engaging ARFAs.&#xD;
      Traditional treatment focuses on abstinence-based therapies. Its emphasis has been on&#xD;
      patients who are ready to change their drinking and can organize their time sufficiently for&#xD;
      on-site clinic treatment. Traditional treatment excludes ARFAs who are the most severe&#xD;
      alcohol misuse patients. Such an approach has been supported by the argument that it is&#xD;
      therapeutically appropriate to concentrate on patients that want to change while others are&#xD;
      allowed to reach their personal rock bottom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The traditional approach has been ineffective in treating the ARFA population. The majority&#xD;
      of ARFAs do not present for treatments to reduce their drinking. Amongst alcohol misuse&#xD;
      patients that present for treatment, the drop-out rate is high. Local data from the National&#xD;
      Addictions' Management Service (NAMS) Specialist Outpatient Clinic shows that up to 75% of&#xD;
      such patients drop-out of follow-up with a counsellor in just 3 months. Patients who engage&#xD;
      poorly with addictions treatment tend to present instead to emergency services and have&#xD;
      unplanned hospital admissions for alcohol-related consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the failure of the traditional, clinic-based, abstinence approach, an alternative means&#xD;
      to treat the ARFA population is needed. Inappropriate and substantial utilization of public&#xD;
      emergency medical resources by ARFAs provides a strong impetus to focus on an alternate&#xD;
      strategy to mitigate demand. Community-based strategies may provide the answer. Treatment in&#xD;
      the community may mean that abstinence remains a lofty goal. With a paradigm shift towards&#xD;
      using harm-reduction strategies, evidence shows that reducing morbidity and mortality is&#xD;
      achievable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASSERTIVE COMMUNITY TREATMENT Assertive community treatment (ACT) refers to a model of&#xD;
      community service provided to people with severe mental illness originally pioneered by Stein&#xD;
      and Test20. Key components include: i) rapid access to services, ii) a small case load per&#xD;
      case worker, iii) a high ratio of community to office-based appointments, iv) assertive&#xD;
      engagement - with multiple attempts, v) a shared care approach with care coordinators working&#xD;
      within a multidisciplinary team that meets frequently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARFAs have multiple medical issues that may be related to alcohol misuse such as liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis, gouty arthritis, alcoholic gastritis etc. In Singapore, local hospitals' community&#xD;
      health services have access to specialist support and are embedded with community social&#xD;
      services. Hospitals' community health services are well-positioned to serve ARFAs within&#xD;
      their area of coverage. With the guidance and support from addictions specialists from the&#xD;
      NAMS, ACT teams from hospitals' community health services would be able to tackle the alcohol&#xD;
      addiction, manage the multiple medical problems, apply synergies with local community&#xD;
      services in helping these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACT for ARFAs is well-established in the UK. With differing burden of disease, demographics,&#xD;
      culture and drinking habits, it is unclear if this treatment would be effective here.&#xD;
      Singapore had previously implemented ACT for non-alcohol misuse patients with severe and&#xD;
      persistent psychiatric illness which demonstrated improved outcomes and reduced healthcare&#xD;
      utilization. There is a need to evaluate the impact of ACT on healthcare utilization and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in Singapore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will utilize ACT with the aim of reducing ED use, usage of other emergency services&#xD;
      and decrease the addiction to alcohol in the ARFA population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMH NAMS - ACT TEAM PILOT This study will be an extended pilot, utilizing and building upon&#xD;
      the system and intervention as established by the NAMS ACT team, which commenced its service&#xD;
      in April 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NAMS ACT pilot (for its first year of service) led to a 45% reduction in alcohol-related&#xD;
      misuse in a group of 14 patients, for whom 6 months of ACT was provided. The pilot is&#xD;
      currently undergoing write-up and data analysis, with the intention for publishing by the&#xD;
      year-end (Study Title: Alcohol Assertive Community Treatment in Singapore: Reducing&#xD;
      alcohol-related A&amp;E presentations and impact on psychosocial functioning).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS The primary objective of the study is to investigate whether the implementation of&#xD;
      ACT can reduce ED attendances by ARFAs. A secondary objective is to estimate the change in&#xD;
      total cost utilisation from the implementation of ACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RISKS AND BENEFITS It is intended that all patients on assertive community treatment&#xD;
      will be enrolled in this study. The intervention will be implemented as part of a new&#xD;
      standard of care of the hospitals involved - Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH), Tan Tock Seng&#xD;
      Hospital (TTSH), Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and Ng Teng Fong Hospital (NTFGH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected risks include poor responses to the intervention. However, based on the experience&#xD;
      with ACT in the UK and in Singapore among non-alcohol misusers, we believe this presents an&#xD;
      acceptable low risk of occurrence. The collection of data poses the usual minimal risk of&#xD;
      privacy breach. Safeguards for study participants will be put in place. Prior to data&#xD;
      analysis, all patients' identifiers will be removed from the dataset to safeguard the&#xD;
      patients' privacy and confidentiality. Data will be securely stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to study participants include reductions in the level of addiction to alcohol,&#xD;
      reduction of isolation, improved motivation and better overall health. Benefits to society&#xD;
      include reduced unnecessary healthcare utilisation by the ARFA population leading to cost&#xD;
      savings to the system and reduced social cost when the level of alcohol misuse is controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN AND PROCEDURES/METHODOLOGY This is a prospective, multi-centre,&#xD;
      before-and-after, superiority, cohort study to assess the impact of ACT. We adhered to the&#xD;
      SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guideline for a&#xD;
      clinical trial protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As identifiable data would be collected and intervention in the form of ACT is proposed,&#xD;
      consent for participation will be obtained from study subjects. Consent for participation&#xD;
      will include consent to release retrospective data of 5-years from time of recruitment for&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STANDARD TREATMENT PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION OF ASSERTIVE COMMUNITY TREATMENT Standard&#xD;
      treatment includes episodic treatment for individual visits depending on the reason for the&#xD;
      ED presentation. Presently, Singapore does not have national clinical guidelines on treatment&#xD;
      of alcohol misuse. Treatment of the ARFA population varies as per local hospital policies and&#xD;
      may include follow-up with psychiatrists, clinical psychologist, counsellors, nurses, social&#xD;
      workers and community support workers. Referrals may be made to the national referral center,&#xD;
      National Addictions Management Service (NAMS) for addictions follow-up. NAMS is a&#xD;
      clinic-based service managed by a multidisciplinary team of specialists, providing individual&#xD;
      counselling and psychotherapy for alcohol addictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients undergoing ACT, the new standard of care will supersede local hospital policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION: ASSERTIVE COMMUNITY TREATMENT Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) is part of a&#xD;
      6-month program ARFAs will undergo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACT teams will engage with ARFAs on a dedicated schedule. Each visit would last an average of&#xD;
      60 minutes. There will not be a re-arrangement of no-show visits. ACT teams will re-engage&#xD;
      the ARFA over the phone to plan for the next visit as per the schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In keeping with principles of ACT, ARFA's will be assertively sought out in the community and&#xD;
      provided intensive engagement, with holistic and supportive care alongside a harm reduction&#xD;
      approach. Care will also involve case management and involvement of SSA's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each interaction during the treatment period will focus on various aspects covering physical&#xD;
      health, mental health, and addiction 14. ACT team members will explore for problems across 4&#xD;
      life domain categories; Medical, Psychiatric/Psychological, Social, and Substance, also&#xD;
      referred to collectively as an acronym - MPSS. Weekly Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) meetings&#xD;
      will be conducted and problems will be discussed according to the MPSS format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COMPOSITION OF ACT MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAM Each hospital's ACT team will be comprised of&#xD;
      nurses and/or allied health practitioners the backbone of the team. Doctors have received the&#xD;
      requisite training by the NAMS will be involved in leadership of these teams. In view of the&#xD;
      intensity of the program, in line with international practice, each ACT team would manage 16&#xD;
      active patients over a period of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION FIDELITY ACT workers providing care to participants will complete a contact log&#xD;
      detailing the care provided for each patient following each contact. There will not be a&#xD;
      replacement for non-contact visits. The contact log will include details about the member of&#xD;
      staff involved, the mode (i.e. telephone or face-to-face) and setting of the contact (i.e.&#xD;
      patient's home, community setting etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE AND STATISTICAL METHODS Determination of Sample Size As this is a real-life&#xD;
      implementation study, we aim to recruit all eligible patients in the ARFA program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a single hospital's data, the ARFAs utilize Emergency Department services at a mean&#xD;
      of 30.15 visits/year (Standard deviation of 23.47). Assuming a 40% decrease in usage, a&#xD;
      standard deviation of 23 visits, a power of 80% and alpha of 0.05, we calculate the required&#xD;
      sample size to be 29 patients. Assuming a 15% drop-out rate, we will require 34 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical and Analytical Plans Using complete set data analysis, cases undergoing ACT will&#xD;
      be compared to their own historical outcomes as controls. ED, EMS utilization, variables from&#xD;
      SPF, CISS and UCLA 3-point loneliness scales will be compared. Using the paired sample t-test&#xD;
      or Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, the post-intervention utilization of ARFAs undergoing ACT will&#xD;
      be compared to the pre-intervention utilization. To adjust for potential confounders linear&#xD;
      regression analysis will be undertaken. Normality of the variables included in the model will&#xD;
      be assessed using PP plots. Interactions will be tested for [Variables] that are clinically&#xD;
      relevant and if found statistically significant. Model adequacy will be assessed through&#xD;
      coefficients of determination (R2) and by plotting error terms against predicted values.&#xD;
      Presence of multicollinearity will be evaluated by VIF statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should complete set analysis show efficacy, we will proceed to analyse data using an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incremental costs of delivering the intervention will be estimated and compared to any&#xD;
      observed cost savings from reduce usage of ED services and other health services.&#xD;
      Uncertainties will be modelled and an estimate of the change to total costs made.&#xD;

    <description>Christo Inventory of Substance-misuse services (CISS) scores are a validated marker of the severity of alcohol dependence. It is a quantitative, outcome evaluation tool to be completed by a trained healthcare professional from direct patient interviews. It consists of 10 items reflecting patients' problems with social functioning, general health, sexual/injecting risk behavior, psychological functioning, occupation, criminal involvement, drug/alcohol use, ongoing support, compliance and working relationships. The simplicity, brevity and flexibility of CISS make it a useful tool to allow comparison before, during and after treatment. The minimum score is 0 while the maximum score is 20. Lower scores indicate better outcomes.&#xD;

        Singapore has a population of 5.7 million, served by 7 adult EDs. Based on unpublished&#xD;
        data, we estimate a population of 200-300 patients who would meet the criteria to be&#xD;
        classified as ARFA in Singapore. Our study will implement the community-based intervention&#xD;
        in ARFAs from 4 adult EDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Once patients are recruited, individual, identifiable 5-year historical data from the point&#xD;
        of study enrolment will be obtained from the electronic medical records system. This data&#xD;
        will include dates of ED visits and ED diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Each intervention site will recruit up to 32 patients per year. The ACT teams will see a&#xD;
        maximum of 16 patients over a period of 6 months (Appendix 1). Four hospitals will&#xD;
        participate in the study over a period of 4 years with different initiation dates at each&#xD;
        site. The setting up of such a service requires on-site specialist guidance and the&#xD;
        specialist addictions team from NAMS is only able to guide one hospital's ACT team at a&#xD;
        time for a period of 12 months.&#xD;
