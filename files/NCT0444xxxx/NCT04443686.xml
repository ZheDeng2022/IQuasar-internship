  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open label, dose-escalation, safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      study to determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) or recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) of&#xD;
      both ALA and RT. Once the MTDs are identified, the cohort providing the highest dose&#xD;
      intensity at or below the MTD (if supported by emerging PK and biomarker data) will be&#xD;
      selected for an expansion phase for the purpose of refining the safety assessment and&#xD;
      assessing preliminary efficacy. The initial dose escalation phase will enroll at least 20&#xD;
      patients across a variety of tumor types, after which concurrent disease site-specific&#xD;
      expansion cohorts will accrue, each consisting of 20 patients. Anatomic site-specific cohorts&#xD;
      will include patients with symptomatic metastatic disease to specific anatomic regions, where&#xD;
      varying toxicity may be expected (Head and Neck, Thorax and Abdomen/Pelvis).&#xD;

             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study&#xD;
             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, or in&#xD;
             the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             10. Patients with implanted battery-controlled devices (including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             pacemakers and implanted cardiovascular defibrillator (AICDs)) that may suffer&#xD;
