  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a study about the usability of PointCheck a novel non-invasive technology for monitoring&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include patients with cancer visiting the outpatient hematology clinic for&#xD;
      their standard of care chemotherapy administration. A final sample size of 90 oncologic&#xD;
      outpatients will be enrolled and studied with the technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the usability of PointCheck. Secondary outcomes include a&#xD;
      preliminary assessment of PointCheck diagnostic accuracy and precision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this, study subjects will be tested twice with PointCheck during the same session and the&#xD;
      usability in an at-home simulated environment by naïve users will be evaluated&#xD;
