  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of severe (grade 3-4) and steroid refractory acute graft-versus-host disease&#xD;
      (GVHD) continues to be dismal. Sitagliptin given as GVHD-prophylaxis has recently been shown&#xD;
      to reduce the incidence of acute GVHD to less than 10% with an excellent safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this single center and single arm phase 2 study we aim to explore the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of sitagliptin in the treatment of severe and refractory acute GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient with new onset grade 3-4 acute GVHD will receive standard treatment consisting CNI&#xD;
      and methylprednisolone 1-2 mg/kg/day or an equivalent dose of prednisone. Patients with&#xD;
      refractory grade 2-4 acute GVHD will continue their current treatment; however&#xD;
      methylprednisolone dose will be reduced to ≤ 1 mg/kg/day or an equivalent dose of prednisone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral sitagliptin will be commenced at a dose of 100 mg BID. The dose will be increased by 100&#xD;
      mg every three days up to a maximal dose of 300 mg BID. In the case of significant drug&#xD;
      related side effects or drug intolerance, the last tolerated dose will be resumed. Patients&#xD;
      responding well to lower doses of sitagliptin, will not be given higher doses of the drug.&#xD;
      Sitagliptin will be provided as long as deemed effective by the treating physician up to&#xD;
      three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point will be the proportion of patients achieving complete remission(CR),&#xD;
      very good partial response (VGPR) or partial response (PR) by day 28.&#xD;

      death), proportion of patients discontinuing immunosuppressive treatment by 3 and 6 months,&#xD;

      response, specific organ response, biomarker profile (ST2 and REG3a), Infection profile, OS&#xD;
      at 6 months, GVHD free - disease free survival at 6 months.&#xD;
