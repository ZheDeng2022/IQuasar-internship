    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of durvalumab in combination with lenvatinib&#xD;
      in participants with locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma before liver transplant and&#xD;
      metastatic unresectable HCC.The primary hypothesis of this study are that patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced HCC could benefit from durvalumab plus lenvatinib before liver transplant;&#xD;
      patients with metastatic unresectable HCC could also benefit from durvalumab plus lenvatinib&#xD;
      with respect to: 1)Progression Free Survival (PFS) ; or recurrence-free survival (RFS) if&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced HCC underwent liver transplant; 2) Objective Response Rate&#xD;
      (ORR); and 3) Overall survival (OS). The investigators design a clinical study to explore&#xD;
      whether the combination above as a treatment in patients with advanced and recurrent&#xD;
      endometrial carcinoma could prolong PFS and to analyze potential immune biomarker of&#xD;
      therapeutic response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of Lenvatinib and Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking has great&#xD;
      potential in the treatment of locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma before liver&#xD;
      transplant and metastatic unresectable HCC. This trial is designed as a prospective, open&#xD;
      label study for 20 patients with locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma before liver&#xD;
      transplant and metastatic unresectable HCC. The aim is to investigate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      combination therapy of Lenvatinib 80-120mg daily orally and durvalumab 1500mg by IV infusion&#xD;
      every 4 weeks in terms of progression free survival.&#xD;
