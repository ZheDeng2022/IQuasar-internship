      It is necessary to evaluate the outcome of implant supported fixed prosthetic rehabilitations&#xD;
      using peek material. To test this, the study design to be used will be a prospective single&#xD;
      cohort to evaluate the long term outcome of fixed prosthetic implant supported&#xD;
      rehabilitations. The cohort will be evaluated after 5 years of follow-up, regarding&#xD;
      prosthetic survival, implant survival, marginal bone resorption, incidence of mechanical&#xD;
      complications (loosening or fracture of prosthetic components), biological complications&#xD;
      (peri-implant pathology, suppuration, fistulae), incidence of biological complications&#xD;
      (peri-implant pathology, suppuration, excessive marginal bone resorption) in-mouth comfort,&#xD;
      overall chewing feeling, framework integrity, veneer adhesion, veneer chipping, patient&#xD;
      tissue reaction, denture staining, manufacture issues,&#xD;

      Problem Peek material is already used in the dentistry field, but proof on its long-term&#xD;
      outcome in implant supported fixed rehabilitations is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the long term outcome of fixed prosthetic implant supported rehabilitations&#xD;
           using peek material.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To report the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance This investigation is of interest, because it will provide an overview of the&#xD;
      long term outcome of implant supported fixed prosthetic rehabilitations using peek material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The hypothesis that this study will evaluate, will be the distribution of survival&#xD;
      and other variables of interest in implant supported fixed prosthetic rehabilitations using&#xD;
      peek material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods Methodology This study will be performed at Malo Clinic in Lisbon. It&#xD;
      is estimated to last for approximately 5 years. The study design to be used will be a&#xD;
      prospective single cohort study to evaluate the long-term outcome of implant supported fixed&#xD;
      prosthetic rehabilitations using peek material. The cohort will be evaluated in at least 5&#xD;
      interventions (1 per year), regarding survival and the clinical/technical parameters&#xD;
      established in this study. There will be no risk for the participants, has all procedures for&#xD;
      collecting information will be minimally invasive and non- traumatizing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population The population of this study consists in individuals rehabilitated with a fixed&#xD;
      prosthetic rehabilitation supported by immediate function implants, of both genders, without&#xD;
      age restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size It is expected that the sample will consist of 37 consecutively treated patients&#xD;
      during the year of 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      External variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Withdrawal of the patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient missing the control appointment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interruption of the treatment by the patient;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient deceased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the data will be treated by means of descriptive and inferential statistics.&#xD;
      The data will be treated using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows&#xD;
      version 17.0 ®. Survival will be estimated through life tables. Inferential analysis will be&#xD;
      performed for characterization of the cohort and independent variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adverse event is defined as any undesirable clinical occurrence in a subject whether it is&#xD;
      considered to be device related or not. If the adverse event is regarded as device related it&#xD;
      is stated as an adverse device effect. An adverse event or adverse device effect may be&#xD;
      serious\severe or non-serious\non-severe. If, as result of an adverse event during a clinical&#xD;
      investigation, a subject has to be hospitalized, or their hospitalization is unduly prolonged&#xD;
      due to potential disability or danger to life because an intervention has been necessitated&#xD;
      or the event is terminal, the adverse event or adverse effect is regarded as serious. All&#xD;
      serious adverse events must be reported to the Ethic Committee and without any delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation will be carried out in accordance to the ethical principles and guidelines&#xD;
      stated in the Declaration of Helsinki. The Investigation should be evaluated and approved by&#xD;
      a National Ethic Committee prior to including the first subject in the investigation. The&#xD;
      application to the Ethic committee is to be made by the responsible investigators, and a copy&#xD;
      of the approval should be sent to the monitor before the investigation starts. It is also of&#xD;
      great importance that each subject receives oral and written information about the&#xD;
      investigation, and that she/he must only participate if they truly want to do so. Also, the&#xD;
      subjects must be aware of the fact that they can withdraw from the investigation at any time&#xD;
      and for any reason without jeopardizing their future treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the subjects should be made aware of the fact that the data from his/her&#xD;
      treatment will be registered in a computer database, but that she/he will only be registered&#xD;
      through a code system. This means that the identity of each subject will be unknown to all&#xD;
      others than the doctor performing the treatment. Each subject is entitled to take part of the&#xD;
      information stored about her/his treatment. This information is to be handed out by the&#xD;
      treating doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Database management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected from the forms will be introduced in a digital database (Microsoft Office&#xD;
      Excel 2003®). The database management will be the responsibility of the Malo Clinic.&#xD;
