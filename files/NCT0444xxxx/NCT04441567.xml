  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Developing novel methods of patient communication is crucial in providing value-based care to&#xD;
      orthopedic patients. Healthcare technology platforms have been developed to improve patient&#xD;
      communication methods particularly for the administration of patient-reported outcome&#xD;
      measures (PROMs). However, the majority of these interventions rely on web-based platforms&#xD;
      that require patients to have computer access. Among American households earning less than&#xD;
      $30,000 per year, only 59% have access to a desktop or laptop and just 47% have broadband&#xD;
      internet at home compared to mobile phone penetration which is estimated at 95% of which 93%&#xD;
      regularly use text messages. The use of phone messaging may be the most effective means to&#xD;
      have patients complete PROMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is an NIH-funded,&#xD;
      clinically validated method of tracking patient-reported outcomes to efficiently assess&#xD;
      patient health status. PROMIS utilizes Item Response Theory (IRT) and computerized adaptive&#xD;
      testing (CAT) to improve measurement precision and decrease survey time as compared to&#xD;
      traditional PROMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this two-phase study is to utilize Memora Health's text-messaging platform to&#xD;
      collect web-based PROMIS CAT surveys from patients (Phase 1) and use this information to&#xD;
      right-size clinic visits (Phase 2).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 will be a prospective evaluation of patients with the conditions listed. After&#xD;
      consent, participants will complete PROMIS CAT questionnaires on their mobile phones to&#xD;
      assess health status. During enrollment, participants will choose a method of completing the&#xD;
      surveys throughout the duration of the study. The participants will either 1) receive a short&#xD;
      message service(SMS) with a secure weblink to complete these PROMIS CAT questionnaires on a&#xD;
      secure website, or 2) engage in two-way SMS communication by answering the survey questions&#xD;
      individually by texting back their answers. The investigators will explain that the desired&#xD;
      method of participation is by weblink due to privacy issues associated with two-way texting.&#xD;
      The frequency at which the questionnaires will be sent is condition-specific. All patients&#xD;
      will be seen in clinic at standard follow up time-points and will be asked to complete PROMIS&#xD;
      questionnaires during each clinic visit, identical to the delivery of surveys while at home.&#xD;
      The PROMIS measures collected over a 1-year period will be used to develop patient-based&#xD;
      recovery curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will begin at the end of Phase 1 and compare each participant's recovery (based on&#xD;
      the PROMs) against the established recovery curve that was generated in Phase 1 for their&#xD;
      orthopedic condition. The investigators will right-size in-person clinic visits based on&#xD;
      individual recovery as compared with expected recovery. Earlier clinic appointments will be&#xD;
      given to participants at risk for a poor outcome (defined as any PROMIS score â‰¥1 standard&#xD;
      deviation below the mean). All other participants will receive a phone call to make sure that&#xD;
      participants feel they are doing well and to have any issues addressed. If it is felt that a&#xD;
      visit is warranted, it will be recommended, and if a subject wishes to have a visit it will&#xD;
      be scheduled. If the subject is happy with their progress, then that in-person clinic visit&#xD;
      will be deferred until the next standard follow-up visit and the same process will occur.&#xD;
      Some in-person visits will be mandatory when a physical exam or x-ray is required for optimal&#xD;
      care. These are condition specific. For all participants, a final in-person follow-up visit&#xD;
      will occur unless the subject is happy and does not want to be seen in person.&#xD;
