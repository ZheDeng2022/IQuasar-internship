      A Phase I trial to evaluate the feasibility, toxicity and effectiveness of cisplatin&#xD;
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus TIL in treating patients with FIGO stage IIIA to IVA&#xD;
      cervical carcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) was the standard treatment for locoregionally advanced&#xD;
      cervical cancer, while the incidence of treatment failure is still high. Adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy or inducing chemotherapy addition to CCRT did not significantly improve patient&#xD;
      survival compared to CCRT alone. Hence, there is a need for novel therapies to improve&#xD;
      survival for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accumulating evidence shows that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) selected for tumor&#xD;
      recognition and greatly expanded in vitro are effective for treating cervical cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase I trial to evaluate the feasibility, toxicity and effectiveness of cisplatin&#xD;
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus TIL in treating patients with FIGO stage IIIA to IVA&#xD;
      cervical carcinoma.&#xD;
