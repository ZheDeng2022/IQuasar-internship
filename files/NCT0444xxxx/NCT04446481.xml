  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Military deployment is associated with increased risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&#xD;
      Combat stress related memory deficits has been well documented. Mild cognitive impairment&#xD;
      such as memory deficits are the most common and earliest symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and&#xD;
      related dementia (ADRD). The complaints about declined memory are common in healthy and&#xD;
      cognitively intact civilian older adults, but less understood in aging Veterans. Brain&#xD;
      training strategies to enhance cognitive skills and especially memory processes are unmet&#xD;
      needs in aging Veterans who are at additional risk for MCI induced by ADRD. Since currently&#xD;
      there is no effective drug treatment to stop cognitive decline, non-invasive brain training&#xD;
      to boost memory functions in older Veterans is an increasingly attractive option to&#xD;
      attenuating decline in memory.&#xD;

      The proposed project is poised to investigate state-of-art neurofeedback (NF; biofeedback of&#xD;
      brain activity) training for self-modulation of neural plasticity to boost memory performance&#xD;
      in Veterans. The recent advance of NF with Brian-Computer Interface (BCI) has provided a&#xD;
      novel way to examine brain functions and plasticity. Thus far, there have been limited&#xD;
      applications that have developed effective experimental and clinical paradigms for&#xD;
      rehabilitation in Veterans. Historically, brainwave patterns during memory task performance&#xD;
      have been analysed offline, a methodology which does not allow real-time NF modulation and&#xD;
      training. The central hypothesis guiding this research is that optimal memory-related&#xD;
      brainwave patterns of a Veteran can be trained. The online NF allows maximization of&#xD;
      brainwave patterns associated with healthier memory states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of efficient NF paradigms to augment memory performance is an important first&#xD;
      step for the application of this nonpharmacologic intervention to improve combat Veterans'&#xD;
      memory functions and potential for treating MCI due to mild TBI or pain. The pilot work will&#xD;
      start with wider range of Veterans using state-of-the-art wearable wireless brain-computer&#xD;
      interface headset, which is affordable and can be easily set up in VAMCs and eventually in&#xD;
      remote assessment settings. This innovative, cognitive neuroscience based, nonpharmacologic&#xD;
      intervention serves to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of combat Veterans who are&#xD;
      at risk for degenerative dementia.&#xD;
