  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates an investigational vaccine that is designed to protect humans against&#xD;
      infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and is administered as drops in the nose.&#xD;
      Specifically, the study analyzes the safety of, and the immune response to, the vaccine when&#xD;
      administered to healthy children between the ages of 15 and 59 months who are seropositive to&#xD;
      RSV.&#xD;

    <intervention_model>Sequential Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>The first 15 enrolled participants will be assigned to Dosage Group 1 and be randomly allocated to receive either investigational vaccine at Dosage 1 or placebo. The Safety Monitoring Committee will subsequently review Dosage Group 1 safety data through Day 14, to allow dosage escalation. The next 15 enrolled participants will be assigned to Dosage Group 2 and be randomly allocated to receive investigational vaccine at Dosage 2 or placebo. The Safety Monitoring Committee will subsequently review Dosage Group 2 safety data through Day 14, to allow dosage escalation. The final group (Dosage Group 3) will consist of up to 12 enrolled participants who will be allocated to receive investigational vaccine at Dosage 3.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Solicited adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post-vaccination period</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of solicited AEs will be measured, categorized by severity. Solicited AEs are predefined AEs that may occur after investigational vaccine administration</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Unsolicited AEs</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post-vaccination period</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of unsolicited AEs will be measured, categorized by severity. Unsolicited AEs are any untoward medical occurrences in a participant administered the investigational vaccine, regardless of causal relationship to the investigational vaccine. Unsolicited AEs can include unfavorable and unintended signs (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptoms, or diseases temporally associated with the use of the investigational vaccine.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Serious adverse events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Full study duration, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of SAEs will be measured, categorized by vaccine-relatedness. SAEs are AEs, whether considered causally related to the investigational vaccine or not, that threaten life or result in any of the following: death, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Medically attended adverse events (MAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Full study duration, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of MAEs will be measured, categorized by vaccine-relatedness. MAEs are AEs, whether considered causally related to the investigational vaccine or not, with unscheduled medically attended visits, such as urgent care visits, acute primary care visits, emergency department visits, or other previously unplanned visits to a medical provider. Scheduled medical visits such as routine physicals, wellness checks, 'check-ups', and vaccinations, are not considered MAEs.</description>

    <measure>Potential vaccine virus shedding: frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Day 28, an average of four (4) weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of any post-vaccination shedding of vaccine virus (as detected by viral culture) will be measured per dosage group and overall.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Potential vaccine virus shedding: magnitude</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Day 28, an average of four (4) weeks</time_frame>
    <description>If post-vaccination shedding of vaccine virus is detected by culture, peak viral titer (measured in plaque forming units, PFU) will be measured per dosage group and overall.</description>

    <measure>Potential vaccine virus shedding: duration</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Day 28, an average of four (4) weeks</time_frame>
