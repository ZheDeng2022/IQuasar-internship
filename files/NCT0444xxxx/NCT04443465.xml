      Resection of brain tumours forms a large proportion of work in brain surgery. One important&#xD;
      aspect is to minimize damage to normal brain structures during this process. This improves&#xD;
      patient outcomes and reduces complications. To identify normal brain structures from the&#xD;
      abnormal tumours, the brain surgeons use a 'guidance' technique called intraoperative&#xD;
      neuro-monitoring (IONM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IONM uses various electrodes to observe spontaneous electrical activity of the brain or its&#xD;
      reaction to a stimulus such as muscle contraction, light or sound. It is now becoming common&#xD;
      practice for neurosurgeons to use this tool during brain and spinal surgery to provide a&#xD;
      real-time feedback under anaesthesia to help them minimise injury to important and normal&#xD;
      brain and spine structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IONM interpretation needs fulfilment of multiple preconditions and major modifications to the&#xD;
      anaesthetic to reduce its inaccuracies. This invites added risks and complications such as&#xD;
      awareness, convulsions and heart problems under anaesthesia. A team approach between the&#xD;
      surgeon, anaesthetist and neurophysiologist (IONM specialist) is also crucial to obtain&#xD;
      meaningful results. Therefore, the usefulness of this technique is still not perfect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although, benefits of IONM are obvious, information on associated complications and patient&#xD;
      experience are not commonly found in the literature. Information on other effects such as&#xD;
      hormonal balance and tumour recurrence are also scarce. In general, these aspects have little&#xD;
      scientific exploration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are anecdotal reports of recurrent seizures during IONM leading to serious heart&#xD;
      problems, teeth and tongue damage due to grinding and postoperative calf muscle injury&#xD;
      necessitating further surgery to save limbs. Neither of these is in the literature including&#xD;
      unorthodox treatments such as the use of cold saline to control IONM triggered fits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to observe complications and outcome and explore patient experiences&#xD;
      following IONM in an observational capacity not interfering with the clinical management or&#xD;
      treatment of these patients. The investigators intend to interview the participants after&#xD;
      surgery, at a convenient time before leaving hospital to understand their views and&#xD;
      experiences during and after surgery and their general progress in the following one year.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Intraoperative neuro-monitoring (IONM) is a 'SAT NAV' used by neurosurgeons to&#xD;
      prevent injury to normal structures during brain and spinal surgery under anaesthesia. It&#xD;
      involves the use of surface and implanted electrodes to observe spontaneous electrical&#xD;
      activity of the brain or evoked responses to an electrical stimulus (motor, visual or&#xD;
      auditory). This requires major modifications to the anaesthetic that provides lighter planes&#xD;
      of anaesthesia with no muscle relaxation inviting added risks and complications such as&#xD;
      awareness, seizures and cardiac events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cohort study over a period of one year will include a qualitative enquiry of patient&#xD;
      experience and a quantitative evaluation of the immediate postoperative course and&#xD;
      complications at 28 days and 1 year. It will explore the relatively unknown area of emotional&#xD;
      experiences of participants under anaesthesia who undergo various types of neuro stimulation&#xD;
      and related post-operative sequelae. The results are expected to assist improve patient&#xD;
      experiences and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Resections of brain tumours constitute a significant proportion of&#xD;
      work in neurosurgery. One important aspect is minimizing injury to normal neural structures&#xD;
      during this process to improve outcomes of such operations and reduce complications. This&#xD;
      involves intraoperative neuro-monitoring (IONM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IONM uses surface and implanted electrodes to observe spontaneous electrical activity of the&#xD;
      brain or evoked response to a motor, visual or auditory stimulus. It is now becoming common&#xD;
      practice for neurosurgeons to use this tool during brain and spinal surgery to provide a&#xD;
      real-time feedback under anaesthesia to help them minimise injury to critical and normal&#xD;
      neural structures by 'mapping' normal from abnormal areas of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IONM interpretation needs fulfilment of multiple preconditions and major modifications to the&#xD;
      anaesthetic to reduce its inaccuracies. This invites added risks and complications such as&#xD;
      awareness, seizures and cardiac events. A team approach is also crucial to obtain meaningful&#xD;
      results. Therefore, the utility of this technique is still evolving based on personal&#xD;
      experiences and perceptions and the understanding between the surgeons, anaesthetists and&#xD;
      neurophysiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although, benefits of IONM are obvious, data on associated post-operative morbidity and&#xD;
      patient experience and complications are scarce. The data is also scarce on tumour recurrence&#xD;
      or tumour behaviour following IONM guided neurosurgery. More precise excision may reduce&#xD;
      tumour recurrence. On the other hand IONM related electrical stimulation may impose humoral&#xD;
      effects on tumour behaviour. These aspects have little scientific exploration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are anecdotal reports of recurrent seizures during IONM leading to cardiac events such&#xD;
      as asystole, teeth grinding and damage and tongue injury in the absence of a 'bite block' and&#xD;
      postoperative calf muscle necrosis necessitating fasciotomies. Neither of these is in the&#xD;
      literature including the unorthodox effective treatments used such as pouring 'cold' saline&#xD;
      on the surface of the brain to control seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place in a major neurosurgical centre in the UK that uses IONM.&#xD;
      Therefore, the study population is vast for appropriate sampling and recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This is an observational cohort study based on data retrieved from clinical&#xD;
      notes and direct patient interview in hospital. The qualitative enquiry will address&#xD;
      emotional aspects and the process experience. The quantitative survey will investigate&#xD;
      morbidity (post-operative recovery, complications) and outcomes including mortality at 28&#xD;
      days and 1-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligible patients will be identified by the published elective neurosurgery lists and&#xD;
      approached for informed consent before surgery at the time of preoperative assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anaesthetist or the surgeon directly involved with his/her clinical care will first&#xD;
      approach the patient and subsequently introduced to the medical student for post-operative&#xD;
      data collection. Their demographic data, disease data, and neurological assessment scores&#xD;
      will be obtained from medical records. Direct patient interviews will be carried out by the&#xD;
      investigators postoperatively, using a structured open questionnaire format. This activity&#xD;
      will merge with the postoperative clinical rounds where possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergoing elective neurosurgery guided by IONM will be eligible for the study&#xD;
      and recruited with informed consent. The exclusion criteria shall be aged less than 10 years,&#xD;
      lack of informed consent and who are unable to communicate verbally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A convenient sample of 50 is a realistic number of patients who can be recruited within a&#xD;
      3-month period at this centre. However, the qualitative enquiry may be stopped at an earlier&#xD;
      time if the data collected is felt to be at the saturation point by the investigators. The&#xD;
      participants shall be followed up at 28 days and 1-year post surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous data will be described and analysed based on their distribution, be it parametric&#xD;
      or non-parametric. Dichotomous data will be described as number of patients/episodes and&#xD;
      percentage.The patient experiences reported will be subjected to a thematic analysis&#xD;
      following the principles of qualitative research grounded theory.&#xD;
