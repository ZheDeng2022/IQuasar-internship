  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Modern immunosuppression is characterized by a combination of different immunosuppressants.&#xD;
      As a result, the dose of the individual substances, and thus also their side effects can be&#xD;
      reduced. Immunosuppression on the basis of low-dose calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) with&#xD;
      comparatively low CNI target levels could therefore prevail. Despite all efforts to optimize&#xD;
      the treatment regimen after liver transplantation from deceased donors, the amount of&#xD;
      medication remains high throughout the postoperative course with CNIs being the main&#xD;
      component of immunosuppressive treatment. The main substance used is Tacrolimus in&#xD;
      combination with steroids and possibly Mycophenolic acid. Tacrolimus is considered a narrow&#xD;
      therapeutic index drug requiring individual dose titration, to achieve a satisfactory balance&#xD;
      between maximizing efficacy and minimizing dose-related toxicity. Furthermore, transplanted&#xD;
      recipients have to remain to a very demanding medication regimen for a long time. The burden&#xD;
      of pills required is associated with decreased adherence, and lack of adherence can lead to&#xD;
      rejection and possibly graft loss. The aim of present study is to assess the tough levels and&#xD;
      need of doses adaptation in de novo liver transplantation with Tacrolimus in the clinical&#xD;
      routine, without any intervention in the treatment regimen.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Tacrolimus is considered a narrow therapeutic index drug requiring individual dose titration,&#xD;
      to achieve a satisfactory balance between maximizing efficacy and minimizing dose-related&#xD;
      toxicity. The pharmacokinetic profile of Tacrolimus is characterized by a high degree of&#xD;
      inter- and intraindividual variability. Although it is rapidly absorbed, the bioavailability&#xD;
      of Tacrolimus in the twice-daily capsule formulation is low and variable, ranging from 17 to&#xD;
      23%. This could be due to poor water solubility, extensive first pass metabolism,&#xD;
      p-glycoprotein-mediated efflux and the ingestion of food. Tacrolimus twice-daily capsules are&#xD;
      also associated with a characteristic high peak following dosing, which may be associated&#xD;
      with increased toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, transplanted recipients have to remain to a very demanding medication regimen&#xD;
      for a long time. The burden of pills required is associated with decreased adherence, and&#xD;
      lack of adherence can lead to rejection and possibly graft loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of once-daily Tacrolimus forms without any change of the form of dissolving&#xD;
      has already been shown to increase patients' adherence, while little difference has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in the Tacrolimus pharmacokinetic profile. The pharmacokinetic profile of&#xD;
      Tacrolimus is characterized by flatter kinetics (i.e., less fluctuation and swing) compared&#xD;
      to twice-daily Tacrolimus providing for a balanced concentration-time consistency over 24&#xD;
      hours which can also lead to reduced incidence and/or intensity of drug toxicity-related&#xD;
      adverse events. Since the development of LCP-Tacrolimus once-daily tablets, with the use of&#xD;
      MeltDose® technology, clinical data have shown lower peak and reduced peak-to-tough&#xD;
      fluctuations.&#xD;

    <description>Similar to the clinical routine, as soon as a patient is able to swallow and has a sufficient gastrointestinal activity, Tacrolimus-based immunosuppression using Prograf®, Advagraf® or Envarsus® will be started. Furthermore, calcineurin inhibitors-based immunosuppression will be used (initial dose based on the patients' body weight) with the goal of tough levels of 3-7 ng/mL in the first seven days after liver transplantion, depending on immune status and indication for transplantation. Further tough levels will be determined based on factors such as patients' history and indication for liver transplant.</description>
