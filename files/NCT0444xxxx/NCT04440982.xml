  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, two-arm, randomized, clinical trial evaluating patients&#xD;
      undergoing breast conserving surgery using the LUM Imaging System.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>

      Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be injected with LUM015. The injection of the study drug will occur 2-6&#xD;
      hours prior to surgery at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg. Surgeons will perform main specimen resection&#xD;
      per standard of care. Prior to removing any shaves as part of the standard of care, the&#xD;
      surgeon will use the Lum System to scan and image all orientations within the cavity. The LUM&#xD;
      Imaging System will guide shave removal. Then, comprehensive shaved margins are removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the initial cohort is a &quot;training set&quot; with 10 patients receiving neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy to refine the tumor detection algorithm, if needed. After completion of enrollment of&#xD;
      the initial 10 subjects for algorithm training, the Investigators will then enroll a cohort&#xD;
      of patients who received neoadjuvant therapy to further evaluate the performance of the LUM&#xD;
      Imaging System in this important subset of breast cancer patients. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized 3:1 to a LUM-assisted lumpectomy versus a standard lumpectomy. In both arms,&#xD;
      shaved margins will be taken from the entire lumpectomy cavity to compare the extent of&#xD;
      residual tumor after standard and LUM-assisted lumpectomies to evaluate the negative&#xD;
      predictive value of the LUM Imaging System following neoadjuvant therapy. The LUM Imaging&#xD;
      System will be used in both arms to capture images of each tissue removed, whether LUM-guided&#xD;
      or part of the final comprehensive shave removal. Data from both arms of the study will be&#xD;
      used to determine the diagnostic performance (sensitivity and specificity) of the LUM Imaging&#xD;
      System in patients who have received neoadjuvant therapy. Only the group of patients&#xD;
      randomized to the device (intervention) arm will have the LUM Imaging System guide the&#xD;
      removal of tissue prior to the removal of final comprehensive shaves of the entire cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment ends when the surgery is completed. Patients are followed for adverse events&#xD;
      until their standard of care follow-up visit or after any secondary surgery, whichever is&#xD;
      longer.&#xD;

    <description>The LUM Imaging Device will be used to look inside the lumpectomy cavity to see if the dye indicates any areas that may contain residual tumor. If the imaging identifies that there may be cancer cells remaining in the lumpectomy cavity, the surgeon will remove an additional piece of tissue. This process will be continued until a negative reading from the device is obtained or a maximum of 2 shaves of additional tissue has been removed. Patients in this arm will receive the study drug, LUM015</description>
