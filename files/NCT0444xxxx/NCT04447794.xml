  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A wide gap exists between the number of people needing alcohol treatment and those actually&#xD;
      receiving it. This study builds on a previous one that indicated that smartphone-based&#xD;
      intervention can help increase the number of people who receive alcohol intervention services&#xD;
      and decrease treatment barriers. Improvements to the previously developed app, Step Away,&#xD;
      will be made. In addition, a new method of delivering the Step Away intervention via an&#xD;
      online, interactive chatbot, will be developed with the goal of improving engagement and&#xD;
      effectiveness. Participants will be recruited and outcomes between the two interventions&#xD;
      examined to determine if the Step Away chatbot has enhanced user engagement, intervention&#xD;
      fidelity and outcome efficacy in comparison to the Step Away app amongst a group of problem&#xD;
      drinkers. Participants will also be interviewed to determine their perceptions of both&#xD;
      interventions with a view towards understanding barriers to user engagement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A wide gap exists between the number of individuals needing alcohol treatment and those&#xD;
      actually receiving it. Technologically-delivered interventions may dramatically increase the&#xD;
      number of individuals who receive needed alcohol intervention services due to their ability&#xD;
      to circumvent treatment barriers. Smartphones are the ideal devices to provide&#xD;
      empirically-supported intervention assistance whenever and wherever it is needed. Our&#xD;
      research team previously developed and tested a stand-alone, self-administered&#xD;
      smartphone-based intervention system for alcohol use disorders that was based on empirically&#xD;
      supported face-to-face treatments (the Location-Based Monitoring and Intervention for Alcohol&#xD;
      Use Disorders (LBMI-A) system). A revised and improved iPhone-based version, Step Away, was&#xD;
      developed. Step Away usage data indicate that user engagement with modules that are not&#xD;
      &quot;pushed&quot; to the user is relatively low, which is a problem that many health apps experience.&#xD;
      A new method of delivering Step Away through an artificially intelligent (AI) chatbot will be&#xD;
      developed that holds potential for providing enhanced user engagement and effectiveness as it&#xD;
      can reach out through a text interface to introduce new intervention steps and respond to the&#xD;
      user with Step Away's in-the-moment help with having a craving, experiencing distress or&#xD;
      needing social support. The first phase of this study will focus on developing a Step Away&#xD;
      chatbot and enhance the existing Step Away app's user interface. The second phase will entail&#xD;
      a pilot study to determine if the Step Away chatbot has enhanced user engagement,&#xD;
      intervention fidelity and outcome efficacy in comparison to the Step Away app amongst a group&#xD;
      of problem drinkers. Participants will be interviewed to determine their perceptions of both&#xD;
      interventions with a view towards understanding barriers to user engagement. Finally, this&#xD;
      project will set the stage for a further, large-scale evaluation of Step Away, the content of&#xD;
      which will be determined by the outcome of the pilot study.&#xD;

    <description>The Timeline Followback (TLFB) will be used to gather information on alcohol and drug use. The TLFB method has demonstrated good test-retest reliability and high correlations with prospective daily recording methods for quantifying alcohol use. In the current study, a 90-day online version will be administered at baseline and the 4 month post-intervention follow-up assessment. Online versions of the TLFB have been shown to have high correlations with phone and in-person interviewer administered versions of the TLFB The TLFB will be used to calculate the following drinking variables: average (mean) drinks per week, days abstinent, and heavy drinking days. Heavy drinking days will be defined as days with 4 or more standard drinks for women and 5 or more standard drinks for men.</description>

    <description>The Drinkers' Inventory of Consequences (DrInC) is a 50-item measure that assesses consequences of drinking across five domains: physical, intrapersonal, social responsibility, interpersonal, and impulse control. In this study, participants will rate their frequency of experiencing each problem in the past 3 months from 0 (never/not at all) to 3 (almost daily/very much) at the baseline and at the 4 month follow up assessment. The DrInC has high test-retest reliability and internal consistency, and has been found to have convergent, divergent, and discriminant validity among alcohol treatment seekers. The DrInC will be administered at baseline and follow-up to examine between-group changes over time.</description>

    <measure>Readiness to change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Given that the main underlying theoretical framework of Step Away is motivational enhancement (ME), we want to examine readiness to change as a mediating variable. We will utilize the Readiness to Change Treatment Version (RCQTV) in this study to assess this construct. The RCQTV has been shown to have solid reliability and validity and has been modified for individuals contemplating or engaged in treatment for alcohol problems.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention utilization data</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Data will be used to calculate the number of unique users per week, number of unique active users per week. We will calculate the number of times each module in both interventions are viewed and completed, as well as the number of times in-the-moment-tools are accessed, and the number of daily questionnaires completed by each participant using either intervention. Means (standard deviations) and confidence intervals (CI) and medians (interquartile ranges) will be used to calculate these measures. We will also review interactions between chatbot users and the chatbot by viewing chat histories and where a user ended a conversation.</description>

    <description>The Step Away chatbot utilizes AI technology to provide mobile, web-based, person-centered, behavioral-based interventions and timely support for individuals seeking to reduce their alcohol use. Participants interact with the chatbot through interactive text.&#xD;
The Step Away chatbot is informed by the following theoretical constructs: (1) motivational enhancement; (2) relapse prevention; and (3) community reinforcement. It uses the Relapse Prevention (RP) model, which is informed by cognitive behavioral theory and has evolved to reflect the dynamic, non-linear relationships between contextual triggers and coping, as mediated by motivation, mood, and self-efficacy. It proactively encourages the user to identify and include supportive others in treatment; to identify and plan non-drinking, recreational activities; and to develop other non-drinking lifestyle skills and strategies.</description>

    <description>The Step Away app is a smartphone-based mobile intervention system.&#xD;
It is informed by three theoretical constructs that are considered the most important &quot;active ingredients&quot; for person-centered, behavioral-based intervention and treatment in addictions: (1) motivational enhancement; (2) relapse prevention; and (3) community reinforcement. Step Away uses the Relapse Prevention (RP) model, which is informed by cognitive behavioral theory and has evolved to reflect the dynamic, non-linear relationships between contextual triggers and coping, as mediated by motivation, mood, and self-efficacy. Step Away proactively encourages the user to identify and include supportive others in treatment; to identify and plan non-drinking, recreational activities; and to develop other non-drinking lifestyle skills and strategies.</description>
