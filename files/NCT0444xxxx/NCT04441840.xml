    <textblock>
      This study proposal seeks to examine the efficacy of probiotic supplementation at mitigating&#xD;
      changes in immune function and recovery after completion of intense, stressful exercise while&#xD;
      also allowing for a better understanding of its ability to promote recovery and maintenance&#xD;
      of physical performance.&#xD;

      Study Visit 1 - Familiarization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the familiarization visit, participants will first read and sign an IRB-approved&#xD;
      informed consent document and complete a short form of the International Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire (IPAQ). Participants will then have their height, weight, and body composition&#xD;
      determined using Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) (Hologic Discovery A). To&#xD;
      standardize body composition assessment, participants will be required to observe an 8-hour&#xD;
      fast and maintain a well-hydrated state. Each participant will provide a urine sample to&#xD;
      confirm a hydrated stated through determination of a urine specific gravity values greater&#xD;
      1.020. Participants will then complete a peak oxygen consumption test (VO2Peak) using&#xD;
      indirect calorimetry on a ParvoMedics TrueOne (Sandy, UT) metabolic cart interfaced to a&#xD;
      motorized cycle ergometer (Lode Corival). The peak oxygen consumption test protocol will&#xD;
      require each study participants to start at 100 watts before progressively increasing by 1&#xD;
      watt every two seconds. To determine whether maximal effort occurred a respiratory exchange&#xD;
      ratio of &gt;1.00 must be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the peak oxygen consumption assessment, participants will perform practice&#xD;
      repetitions of all performance tests (force plate vertical jumps, isometric mid-thigh pulls,&#xD;
      Biodex isometric and isokinetic knee extensor testing) as well as the exercises that will be&#xD;
      performed during Visit 3 (leg press, hex bar deadlift, and drop jump).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit 2 - Pre-Supplementation Baseline Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be asked to complete a 24-hour food recall between each testing&#xD;
      condition and will be asked to replicate their diet prior to this visit for all subsequent&#xD;
      visits. Upon arrival, participants will first have their blood drawn from a forearm vein&#xD;
      before completing a perceived soreness, pressure-pain threshold, and recovery assessment.&#xD;
      Prior to testing, participants will complete the same standardized warm-up consisting of 5&#xD;
      minutes of light cycling, 10 body weight squats, 10 body weight walking lunges, 10 dynamic&#xD;
      walking hamstring stretches (straight-leg march), and 10 dynamic walking quadriceps&#xD;
      stretches. After the warm-up, participants will complete five countermovement jump squats on&#xD;
      top of bilateral triaxial force plates (Hawkins Dynamics) interfaced to a personal computer&#xD;
      to derive relevant force-time variables. Next, participants will complete two assessments of&#xD;
      peak isometric force production. Using an electronic load cell with a 5,000-N capacity (Load&#xD;
      Star load cells) connected to a computer, three 5-second maximal isometric mid-thigh pulls&#xD;
      will be completed. Participants will then be outfitted on a Biodex isokinetic dynamometer&#xD;
      where they will complete three maximal isometric knee extensions. Following the isometric&#xD;
      knee extensor testing, participants will complete a 50-repetition test of concentric-only&#xD;
      repetitions to assess changes in force production, torque, and rates of fatigue development.&#xD;
      After the baseline performance testing, participants will have their leg press and hex bar&#xD;
      deadlift one-repetition maximum (1RM) determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Supplementation (14 days, described below) followed by exercise trial.*&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit 3 (Post-Supplementation Testing, Exercise Trial):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival, study participants will be asked to complete a 24-hour food recall and between&#xD;
      each testing condition, study participants will be asked to replicate their diet. Upon&#xD;
      arrival, participants will first have their blood drawn from a forearm vein before completing&#xD;
      perceived soreness, pressure-pain threshold, and recovery assessments. Prior to testing,&#xD;
      participants will complete the same standardized warm-up consisting of 5 minutes of light&#xD;
      cycling, 10 body weight squats, 10 body weight walking lunges, 10 dynamic walking hamstring&#xD;
      stretches (straight-leg march), and 10 dynamic walking quadriceps stretches. After the&#xD;
      warm-up, participants will complete five countermovement jump squats on top of bilateral&#xD;
      triaxial force plates (Hawkins Dynamics) interfaced to a personal computer to derive relevant&#xD;
      force-time variables. Using an electronic load cell with a 5,000-N capacity (Load Star load&#xD;
      cells) connected to a computer, three 5-second maximal isometric mid-thigh pulls will be&#xD;
      completed. Participants will then be positioned on a Biodex isokinetic dynamometer where they&#xD;
      will complete three maximal isometric knee extensions. Lastly, participants will complete a&#xD;
      50-repetition test of concentric-only repetitions to assess changes in force production,&#xD;
      torque, and rates of fatigue development. Following the completion of these tests,&#xD;
      participants will perform an exercise trial according to the methods described below.&#xD;
      Following completion of the exercise trial, participants will undergo the previous testing&#xD;
      battery (blood sample, perceived soreness, pressure-pain threshold assessment, recovery&#xD;
      assessment, countermovement vertical jumps, isometric mid-thigh pulls, Biodex isometric and&#xD;
      isokinetic testing) at five time points: immediately after exercise, 30 minutes&#xD;
      post-exercise, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 5 hours post-exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits 4 - 6: Post-Exercise Performance In an identical fashion, with the exception of&#xD;
      1RM assessment, study visits 4, 5, and 6 will be completed 24, 48, and 72 hours,&#xD;
      respectively, after completion of the exercise bout. Briefly, study participants will return&#xD;
      to the laboratory after an overnight fast (10 hours). Participants will bring in the&#xD;
      completed 24-hour dietary recall, donate venous blood samples, assess their soreness,&#xD;
      pressure-pain threshold, and recovery, complete the warm-up, perform five countermovement&#xD;
      jumps, assess peak isometric force production, and complete a 50-repetition muscle fatigue&#xD;
      test during each visit.&#xD;
