  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carotid diaphragms are a non-atheromatous arterial cause of cerebral infarction, especially&#xD;
      in young people (≤65 years old). This anomaly is more common in the African or&#xD;
      African-American population, although it is more and more often discovered in young&#xD;
      Caucasians. This cause of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), known until the 1970s, was later&#xD;
      forgotten until a recent revival of interest, probably in connection with the improvement of&#xD;
      imagery but also by the discovery that these lesions have a high rate of recurrence in the&#xD;
      absence of interventional care. In a Brazilian study, the carotid diaphragm was reported in&#xD;
      10% of patients under the age of 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The carotid diaphragm is a non-atheromatous overgrowth of the intima of the arterial wall. It&#xD;
      appears in imagery in the form of an endoluminal web wider than it is tall. Its preferred&#xD;
      seat is the carotid bulb. It is a source, by an embologenic mechanism, of cerebral infarction&#xD;
      starting from local thrombus developed within large cerebral arteries. In histology, the&#xD;
      lesions are different from atherosclerosis and characterized by a thickening of the intima&#xD;
      with proliferation of loose and strewed spindle cells mainly involving the intima.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An atheromatous plaque or dissection with detachment of the intima are the two main&#xD;
      differential diagnoses of the carotid web. However, the appearance of a diaphragm implanted&#xD;
      on a regular wall and the absence of any other localization of atheroma distinguish the&#xD;
      lesion of the carotid web from that of a focal atheromatous plate. In addition, the very&#xD;
      proximal localization of the carotid web, from the emergence of the internal carotid artery,&#xD;
      does not suggest a dissection, the localization of which is usually downstream of the bulb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline exam to detect a carotid diaphragm is a carotid angiography scan, but the&#xD;
      abnormalities are often inconspicuous, making diagnosis difficult. We can be led in case of&#xD;
      doubt to perform a conventional arteriography, which remains the &quot;gold standard&quot;. The latter,&#xD;
      dynamic examination compared to the CT scan, shows above all a stasis of blood flow in the&#xD;
      recess created by the diaphragm, stasis at the origin of the formation of thrombi. It has&#xD;
      been suspected that the maximum risk of infarction is upon waking, at the time of&#xD;
      verticalization, with mobilization of the thrombus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutically, the discovery of a symptomatic carotid diaphragm (ischemic swallowing&#xD;
      accident) justifies radical treatment. The risk of recurrence of a patient on antithrombotic&#xD;
      (antiplatelet or anticoagulant) being too high, it is proposed either surgery, or carotid&#xD;
      angioplasty with stent placement. No comparative study of the 2 techniques has been carried&#xD;
      out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides radiological examinations, ultrasound is another technique for studying the cervical&#xD;
      arteries. It is reputed to be of little contribution in the search for a carotid diaphragm,&#xD;
      but few publications exist to date even though the cervical Doppler is often the first&#xD;
      arterial examination carried out after an ischemic stroke. Two series reported Doppler&#xD;
      ultrasound data in the carotid diaphragm. A recent retrospective study evaluated, in&#xD;
      multimodal imaging [Doppler, CT scan of the Supra-Aortic Trunks (ASD) and conventional&#xD;
      arteriography], 30 patients (60 carotids) with diaphragm or atherosclerosis. The correlation&#xD;
      between conventional arteriography and CT angiography was perfect, but the correlation&#xD;
      between Doppler and CT angiography for diaphragm diagnosis was moderate. In another series&#xD;
      studying 15 diaphragms diagnosed by CT angiography, the retrospective analysis of doppler&#xD;
      reports revealed that 40% were considered normal and 60% mentioned nonspecific hyperechoic&#xD;
      lesions, but this work remained in the form of a presentation. at a congress. With the&#xD;
      improvement of the technique and the resolution of the Doppler ultrasound as well as the&#xD;
      knowledge of the particular ultrasound characteristics, it seems to us that this examination&#xD;
      could regain a place in the diagnosis of the pathology. The carotid diaphragm is also largely&#xD;
      unknown to vascular doctors practicing cervical Doppler ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This descriptive study of the diagnostic contribution of the echo-doppler for a carotid&#xD;
      diaphragm has for perspective the establishment of a prospective study of the contribution of&#xD;
      a combined expertise angiologist-neurologist in the echo-Doppler for patients &lt;60 years&#xD;
      hospitalized for an ischemic stroke.&#xD;
