      The aim of this study is to evaluate analgesic effects Bupivacaine, Bupivacaine plus&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine and Bupivacaine plus Fentanyl in relieving pain after knee arthroscopic&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Forty-five patients ASA I - II aged 21-45 years for elective knee arthroscopy were divided&#xD;
      into 3 groups: Group B, BD and BF. Group B received Intra-articular injection of 20 ml&#xD;
      bupivacaine 0.25%+ 1 ml saline. Group BD received Intra-articular injection of 20 ml&#xD;
      bupivacaine 0.25%+ 1 ml dexmedetomidine (100 ug).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group BF received Intra-articular injection of 20 ml bupivacaine 0.25%+ 1 fentanyl (50 ug).&#xD;
      The time of first request of analgesia and analgesic effect by VAS during the first 24 hr.&#xD;
      postoperatively are recorded.&#xD;
