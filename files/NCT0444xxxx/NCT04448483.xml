  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate safety, tolerability and efficacy of a new treatment for upper&#xD;
      limb motor rehabilitation after severe stroke using non-invasive neurotechnologies. The&#xD;
      investigational system is used alone or coupled with brain stimulation provided by&#xD;
      transcranic direct current stimulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at providing two interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first intervention, a brain computer interface able to non-invasively detect motor&#xD;
      intention from the non-invasive measure of brain activity by using electroencephalography&#xD;
      (BrainVision, V-amp) activates a robotic glove (Gloreha Sinfonia, Idrogenet Srl) that will&#xD;
      assist-as-needed hand movements and paretic upper limb functional electric stimulation&#xD;
      (RehaStim, Hasomed). The latter will activate upper limb muscles to perform motor&#xD;
      rehabilitation exercises for the upper limb. The motor rehabilitation exercises include upper&#xD;
      limb and hand mobilization and functional tasks, such as hand open/closing, wrist&#xD;
      flexion/extension, and reach and grasp a cup, keep and release.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second intervention, non-invasive brain stimulation (DC-Stimulator, NeuroConn) in the&#xD;
      form of transcranial direct current stimulation will be provided in addition to the previous&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will perform a minimum of 11 rehabilitative sessions for the first&#xD;
      intervention and a minimum of 11 rehabilitative sessions for the second intervention, for a&#xD;
      total minimum of 22 rehabilitative sessions. If the participant recovers with the&#xD;
      intervention, the relative rehabilitative session continues to be proposed until patients&#xD;
      will reaches a &quot;plateau&quot;. The intervention will switch from 1 to 2 if the participant does&#xD;
      not improve anymore with the 1st intervention. If the patient does not improve anymore with&#xD;
      the 2nd intervention the interventional part of the trial will be finished. The&#xD;
      intervention(s) will terminate also if the participant continues to progress after 6 months&#xD;
      of inclusion. As the study is especially designed for personalization of intervention for&#xD;
      every patient, it is not possible to determine a priori the number of sessions for each&#xD;
      participant, because they depend on the response of each participant to the intervention. The&#xD;
      duration of each rehabilitative visit is about two and half hours.&#xD;

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brain stimulation effectiveness in BCI-aided motor therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>10 months average</time_frame>
    <description>The measurement of the effectiveness of brain stimulation is measured by FMA scores of all patients at initial, inter-intervention and final evaluation. This measurement is made between the end and the beginning of each intervention for each patient.&#xD;
Comparison is made by using one-way ANOVA if data normally distributed, or Kruskal Wallis test if otherwise. Secondary analysis measures are calculated for each patient once they complete the study. It will consist in the evaluation of effectiveness of BCI-aided motor therapy without and with brain stimulation. Group comparison is done with inferential statistics for full and partial populations. Similar comparisons and judgement criteria are applied for clinical scales and questionnaires.</description>
