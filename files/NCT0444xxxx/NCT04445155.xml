  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The DECIDE Parent-Provider Intervention is designed to support parents caring for adolescents&#xD;
      who are receiving treatment for Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct disorders.&#xD;
      Participating in DECIDE study may help you effectively ask questions and participate in&#xD;
      decisions about your adolescent's care.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interventions to optimize parent-provider interactions are urgently needed to ensure&#xD;
      adolescents aged 6 to 17 years with Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct disorders (DIC)&#xD;
      receive the behavioral health care they need. For these adolescents, behavioral health care&#xD;
      is complex, long-term, and requires parental participation. Research shows providers have&#xD;
      biases and limited skills and confidence to communicate with these parents to encourage them&#xD;
      to voice their concerns and care preferences. Low income and minority parents are at greatest&#xD;
      risk of not being involved in their adolescents' behavioral health care, having poor&#xD;
      interactions with providers, and are more likely to perceive poor quality of their&#xD;
      adolescents' behavioral health care, and low treatment engagement. If unaddressed, poor&#xD;
      parent-provider interactions interfere with adolescents' retention in behavioral health care.&#xD;
      No evidence-based interventions have targeted both parents and providers to optimize their&#xD;
      interactions and improve behavioral health care for adolescents with DIC. To address these&#xD;
      problems, the investigators propose modifying the evidence-based DECIDE intervention to&#xD;
      target parents and providers of adolescents with DIC. DECIDE stands for Decide the problem;&#xD;
      Explore the questions; Closed or open-ended questions; Identify the who, why, or how of the&#xD;
      problem; Direct questions to your health care professional; Enjoy a shared solution. DECIDE&#xD;
      was developed for ethnically/racially diverse adult patients with serious mental illness and&#xD;
      the latest evidence-based iterations include intervention components targeted to and shown to&#xD;
      increase patient activation, provider communication, and patient-provider interactions.&#xD;
      DECIDE has two primary components: 1) three patient training sessions designed to help&#xD;
      patients effectively ask questions and participate in decisions about their care: and 2) a&#xD;
      12-hour workshop and up to 4 individual coaching sessions for providers to improve&#xD;
      perspective-taking, reduce attributional errors, and increase receptivity to parent&#xD;
      participation and collaboration. The purposes of this two-phase study are: Phase I, Aim 1.&#xD;
      Modify the DECIDE intervention for parents and providers of adolescents with DIC. Phase II,&#xD;
      Aim 2. Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of modified DECIDE. Aim 3. Estimate&#xD;
      preliminary effects of modified DECIDE to improve parent, provider, and adolescent outcomes.&#xD;
      Innovative features of this study are the proposed focus on both parents and providers; and&#xD;
      inclusion of parent activation and provider communication, which are new in field of child&#xD;
      and adolescent behavioral health care, and focus on low income and minority parents. The&#xD;
      investigators expect to find that compared to usual care: Hypothesis 3.1. Modified DECIDE&#xD;
      parents will show greater improvements in: 1) activation; 2) parent-provider interactions; 3)&#xD;
      perceived management of adolescents' behavioral health care, 4) perceived quality of&#xD;
      adolescents' behavioral health care, and 5) engagement in adolescents' behavioral health&#xD;
      care. Hypothesis 3.2. Modified DECIDE providers will show greater improvements in: 1)&#xD;
      communication skills; and 2) parent-provider interactions. Hypothesis 3.3. Adolescents of&#xD;
      modified DECIDE parents and providers will show higher rates of retention in behavioral&#xD;
      health care. Sample will include 16 providers and their parents ( ~ 5 parents per provider, n&#xD;
      = 80) recruited from the Child and Adolescents Program of a large safety net health system&#xD;
      setting that serves predominately low income and minority persons. Feasibility will be&#xD;
      assessed using tracking logs and field notes, and acceptability through parent and provider&#xD;
      satisfaction scores and in depth, semi structured interviews. Outcomes will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline and within 4 weeks post- intervention using standardized questionnaires or surveys&#xD;
      from parents, providers, and independent observers reports. Effects sizes will be estimated&#xD;
      using linear mixed models. If study findings are positive, we will be poised to test the&#xD;
      modified DECIDE intervention in a fully powered R01 level randomized, controlled, multi-site&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;

    <description>It will include three 60 minutes sessions. Session 1 (Decisions and Agency) is designed to increase awareness of their role in clinical interactions and encourage participation and decision making in care. Session 2 (the Who, How, and Why of Decisions) teach skills for understanding treatment decisions in terms of roles, processes, and reasons involved. Session 3 (Self-efficacy and Consolidation) encourages parents to ask questions about their adolescents' behavioral health and health care and treatment options. The provider component is designed to improve provider communication in three key areas: 1) perspective taking to understand circumstances and perceptions; 2) attributional errors or attributing negative parent behaviors to character traits; and 3) receptivity to parent participation and collaboration.</description>

        1. CAP staffs who do not meet the inclusion criteria in phase 2 (i.e. manager and clinical&#xD;
        coordinators or supervisors, clinic nurse, advanced practice registered nurses, or&#xD;
        psychiatrists). (We will invite two other direct care providers who work in the healthcare&#xD;
        system but not at recruitment site. No providers or parents will be excluded on basis of&#xD;
        race/ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation.)&#xD;
&#xD;

             site locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        (We focus on this category of providers because they have primary clinical contact with&#xD;
        parents; thus, activation/communication is particularly important for the dyad.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Parent Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Will have an adolescent with DIC receiving services from a participating CAP/other&#xD;
             site location provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Must be aged 21 or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Speak English&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Are the biological parent of the adolescent or a parent surrogate serving in a primary&#xD;
             caregiver role (for at least past 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Parent Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. If they are a foster parent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. If they show significant cognitive impairment or acute emotional distress on screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. If they have an incarcerated adolescent. No providers or parents will be excluded on&#xD;
             basis of race/ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Specifically for semi-structured interview post intervention. Include: All intervention&#xD;
        providers (n = 8) and two of each of their parents (n = 16). To explore different levels of&#xD;
        acceptability by parents, for each provider, one parent will be chosen who has a high score&#xD;
        (&gt; 3) on the CSQ and one parent who has a low score (&lt; 3). Both parents and providers will&#xD;
        be asked about their experience with the intervention, what was helpful or not, and how&#xD;
        they would change the intervention.&#xD;
