  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Semaglutide is a Glucagon Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist recently approved in Israel&#xD;
      to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Semaglutide is&#xD;
      currently administered as a weekly subcutaneous injection.Treatment with semaglutide is&#xD;
      associated with the occurrence of gastrointestinal adverse events (GI-AEs) commonly observed&#xD;
      during GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment. The most common adverse reactions, reported in ≥5%&#xD;
      of patients treated with semaglutide are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and&#xD;
      constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial we plan to explore the effect of a slower titration regimen of semaglutide vs.&#xD;
      the current label-recommended dose escalation regimen on the occurrence of GI-AEs.&#xD;

                  becoming pregnant: while receiving study drug and for 60 days after the last dose&#xD;
                  of study drug by complying with one of the following: (1) practice abstinence†&#xD;
