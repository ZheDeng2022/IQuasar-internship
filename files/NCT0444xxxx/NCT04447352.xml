      This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label study including patients with&#xD;
      localized and locally advanced diffuse and mixed type adenocarcinoma of the stomach and Type&#xD;
      II/III GEJ scheduled to receive perioperative chemotherapy combined with intraoperative HIPEC&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scope of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy as well as the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      the combination of perioperative chemotherapy combined with an intraoperative HIPEC for&#xD;
      resectable diffuse and mixed type gastric and GEJ (types II/III) adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
      Intraoperative hyperthermic chemoperfusion is summarized under the abbreviation HIPEC in the&#xD;
      following.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with localized and locally advanced diffuse or mixed type adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
      stomach and Type II/III GEJ (i.e. ≥cT3 any N or any T N-positive) with exclusion of distant&#xD;
      metastases and after receiving neoadjuvant FLOT- therapy will be included in this trial after&#xD;
      a central review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled patients will have received 3-6 pre-operative cycles (de-escalation or dose&#xD;
      modification allowed) of biweekly FLOT (Docetaxel 50 mg/m² in 250 ml NaCl 0.9%, iv over 1 h;&#xD;
      Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m² in 500 ml G5%, iv over 2h; Leucovorin 200 mg/m² in 250 ml NaCl 0.9%, iv&#xD;
      over 30 min; 5-FU 2600 mg/m², iv over 24 h, q2wk) in the preoperative treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of neoadjuvant FLOT- therapy followed by pre-operative tumor assessment,&#xD;
      (also including diagnostic laparoscopy prior to start of FLOT), patients without disease&#xD;
      progression (expected to be approximately 90% of the patients) will be included into the&#xD;
      trial, stratified by initial clinical stage (N- vs. N+), histological type of tumor (Lauren&#xD;
      classification diffuse vs. mixed) and study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either postoperative FLOT (Arm A) or postoperative&#xD;
      FLOT + intraoperative HIPEC (Arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A (FLOT) Surgery in Arm A is planned to occur 4 to 6 weeks after d1 of last FLOT. Surgery&#xD;
      is carried out in kind of gastrectomy, transhiatal extended gastrectomy. Following surgery,&#xD;
      patients will receive four further 2-week treatment cycles FLOT in the post-operative&#xD;
      treatment phase. Post-operative treatment should start 6 to 8 weeks, but at maximum 12 weeks&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B (FLOT/ HIPEC) Surgery in Arm B is planned to occur 4 to 6 weeks after d1 of last FLOT.&#xD;
      Surgery is carried out in kind of gastrectomy, transhiatal extended gastrectomy. Surgery will&#xD;
      be combined with an intraoperative Hyperthermic IntraPEritoneal Chemoperfusion (HIPEC)&#xD;
      including cisplatin solution administered at a temperature of 42°C for 90 minutes. Following&#xD;
      surgery, patients will receive four further 2-week treatment cycles FLOT in the&#xD;
      post-operative treatment phase. Post-operative treatment should start 6 to 8 weeks, but at&#xD;
      maximum 12 weeks after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both of the arms, tumor assessments (CT or MRI) are performed before randomization prior&#xD;
      to surgery, and then every 3 months (radiological tumor assessment) thereafter until&#xD;
      progression/relapse, death or end of follow-up. A change from CT into MRI in the follow up&#xD;
      period is possible at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment, clinical visits (blood cell counts, detection of toxicity) occur prior to&#xD;
      every treatment dose. Safety of FLOT/ HIPEC will be monitored continuously by careful&#xD;
      monitoring of all adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase III design starts with a safety run-in phase. After 20 patients had curatively&#xD;
      intended resection in Arm B, an interim safety analysis is performed that shows feasibility,&#xD;
      safety, and tolerability of Arm B planned at the time 8 weeks after the 20th patient in Arm B&#xD;
      had curatively intended resection. It is not planned to discontinue recruitment for the&#xD;
      interim safety analysis.&#xD;
