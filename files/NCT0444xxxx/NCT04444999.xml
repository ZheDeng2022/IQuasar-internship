      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has lower short-term morbidity and mortality than open&#xD;
      surgery. Intra-arterial contrast agents are an important component of successful EVAR as the&#xD;
      tool of choice for preoperative evaluation of aortic aneurysm morphology as well as precise&#xD;
      sizing and intraoperative visualization of the ostia of the renal and hypogastric arteries&#xD;
      for graft replacement. Although iodinated contrast (IC) is overwhelmingly the most common&#xD;
      contrast agent, the perioperative use of IC agents is not recommended in patients with renal&#xD;
      dysfunction or allergies to IC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many strategies have been proposed with the aim of reducing IC developed, such as the use of&#xD;
      intravascular ultrasound, high-quality 3-dimensional imaging techniques, and fusion of&#xD;
      preoperative and intraoperative imaging. However, despite reports of various methods of renal&#xD;
      protection, including the use of perioperative hydration, acetylcysteine, mannitol, dopamine,&#xD;
      and fenoldopam, the effects of these methods are controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbon dioxide (CO2)-guided angiography is an alternative contrast approach first described&#xD;
      for diagnostic purposes by Hawkins. Although many studies have demonstrated the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of CO2-EVAR and its noninferiority to Iodinated Contrast Angiography during&#xD;
      EVAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has been used as an alternative to IACA(intra-arterial&#xD;
      contrast agents). Originally, IVUS images had low accuracy, but recent improvements have&#xD;
      resulted in very high-quality images of intra-aortic structures, which makes the use of&#xD;
      IACA(intra-arterial contrast agents) almost unnecessary. An additional advantage of IVUS is&#xD;
      that it facilitates the precise placement of stent grafts, because it is more accurate in&#xD;
      locating hypogastric arteries and renal arteries which have parallax from the anteroposterior&#xD;
      (A-P) view rather than from angiography. In this study, investigators will compare Carbon&#xD;
      Dioxide Guided Angiography in relation to Iodinated Contrast Angiography during EVAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the work The aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility, efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      carbon dioxide (CO2) digital subtraction angiography (DSA) to guide endovascular aneurysm&#xD;
      repair (EVAR) in a cohort of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Primary outcomes: Validity of CO2 in Visualizing of Renal and hypogastric arteries.&#xD;
      Neck of the aneurysm measurements. Endoleaks Secondary outcomes: Safety of CO2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods Study location: The study will be conducted at the department of&#xD;
      vascular surgery in Mansoura university hospitals Study population: The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in patients with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Sample size: It will include all patients presented to our department fulfilling the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria; sample size will be 50 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      n=(Z^2 p(1-p))/d^2 Where: Z= 1.96 at 95% confidence level, P= expected prevalence, d=&#xD;
      precision (margin of error) Inclusion criteria Age 18 years old. Less than 50 years old&#xD;
      Abdominal Aortic above Aneurysm candidate for EVAR. Exclusion criteria: previous abdominal&#xD;
      aortic surgery, , mycotic aneurysm and secondary intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: The demographics, Symptoms and preoperative clinical data will be collected&#xD;
      Consent: Patients after signing informed consent that possible complication from the&#xD;
      procedure ought to happen and what are the alternatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures are performed using two angiographic methods in each procedure: automated&#xD;
      conventional ICM digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and CO2 automated DSA, in a Philips&#xD;
      hybrid operating theatre. IVUS method (instead of ICM) will be used in chronc kidney disease&#xD;
      patients Proximal and distal sealing zone are evaluated before and after endograft&#xD;
      deployment, for diagnostic and completion evaluation respectively, by both imaging methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of endoleaks will be also evaluated at the completion angiography, by both&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The angiographic results that will be obtained by CO2 and ICM will be compared. Preoperative&#xD;
      imaging will be performed by contrast enhanced computed tomography (CTA); analyzed with&#xD;
      dedicated software for vessels analysis. centerline will be manually calculated by selecting&#xD;
      points at the center of aorta and iliac arteries using multi planar reconstructions (axial,&#xD;
      sagittal and coronal views).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abdominal aortic aneurysm volumetric evaluation is performed by selecting points of the&#xD;
      external aortic wall (AAA total volume) and of the internal aortic lumen (AAA true luminal&#xD;
      volume) from the lower renal artery to the aortic bifurcation, using a dedicated software of&#xD;
      volumetric CTA analysis (3MensioTM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional contrast media angiography: Iodinate contrast media DSA will be performed by&#xD;
      automatic and manual injection. For the automatic DSA, isotonic ICM is injected trough a&#xD;
      pigtail catheter (5F/65 mm length) positioned just above the renal arteries, using automated&#xD;
      injector. During each procedure two automated ICM DSA, with a volume of 20 mL at a rate of 14&#xD;
      mL/s, are performed: a diagnostic injection before the deployment of the endograft, in order&#xD;
      to visualize the proximal sealing zone, the aortic bifurcation and the distal sealing zone,&#xD;
      and a completion angiography to confirm the technical success and to evaluate the presence of&#xD;
      endoleaks. Manual retrograde injections (3 mL ICM each) are performed from the femoral access&#xD;
      by 10 F /11mm length sheet to visualize the hypogastric arteries origin and confirm the&#xD;
      distal sealing zone just before the limb deployment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) will have been used as an alternative to iodinated contrast&#xD;
      in if the iodinated contrast contraindicated patients. The IVUS procedure steps used are&#xD;
      summarized here.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the bilateral common femoral arteries were exposed and a 9-F sheath introducer the&#xD;
      lowest profile adjusted to the 8.2-F of the outer diameter of the IVUS transducer is inserted&#xD;
      retrograde. A soft guidewire is used to introduce a calibrated pigtail catheter, graduated in&#xD;
      centimetres, up to the thoracic aortic arch. The guidewire is then replaced with a stiff wire&#xD;
      followed by IVUS insertion. IVUS is used to locate the renal arteries and hypogastric&#xD;
      arteries by mapping them on the monitor; then, IVUS is switched to the calibrated catheter to&#xD;
      determine the length of the main body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVUS is introduced using the monorail system. After deployment of the main body, the soft&#xD;
      guidewire is cannulated into the contralateral limb. The guidewire is replaced with the stiff&#xD;
      wire, followed by the IVUS insertion. The length of the contralateral site is determined by&#xD;
      measuring the length from the edge of the main body to the site of the hypogastric ostium.&#xD;
      Using the same technique, investigators will estimate the stent graft length with the&#xD;
      calibrated catheter. Automated carbon dioxide angiography: Patients are placed in the&#xD;
      Trendelenburg position with the feet elevated of 10 º degrees. Carbon Dioxide automatic&#xD;
      injection will be performed by digital Angiodroid injection system (Angiodroid SRL, San&#xD;
      Lazzaro, Bologna, Italy) connected to the sidearm of 10F/11mm length sheet. Ten milliliters&#xD;
      of CO2 are infused to fill the tubing with gas and eliminate the air. Then by apposite&#xD;
      manipulation of the stopcocks, the sheath is back-bled through its sidearm, and CO2 infused,&#xD;
      creating a blood-CO2 interface with no air in the system 12. The 10F sheet is positioned at&#xD;
      the level of the external iliac artery at the contralateral access of the main body. Each&#xD;
      injection volume will be 100 mL of CO2 and the injection pressure is 300 mmHg (Figure 1D). To&#xD;
      avoid gas fragmentation, the catheter will be purged prior to each injection and delivery is&#xD;
      in a continuous controlled fashion. During each procedure a diagnostic evaluation, before the&#xD;
      deployment of the endograft, an angiography to visualize the hypogastric arteries origin and&#xD;
      a completion angiography, is performed after the positioning of the endograft. Both the&#xD;
      endograft deployment angiography and the completion angiography will be performed maintaining&#xD;
      a constant blood systolic pressure, between 100 and 120 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative technique: All the procedures are performed in a Philips hybrid operating theatre&#xD;
      and all angiograms are obtained using the Integris Allura 12 DSA. Bilateral common femoral&#xD;
      artery access is obtained through surgical cut down under spinal or general anesthesia.&#xD;
      According with the vertebral bone landmarks, identified pre-operatively, the main-body&#xD;
      endograft is advanced up to the juxta-renal aortic segment. An angiographic evaluation is&#xD;
      performed before the endograft deployment. After contra-lateral gate cannulation, a marked&#xD;
      pig tail will be used to measure the iliac limb length and to identify the origin of the&#xD;
      hypogastric artery from the contralateral access. When a trimodular endograft is deployed,&#xD;
      the same maneuver will be performed for the ipsilateral access. Patients considered at high&#xD;
      risk for persistent type II endoleak (ELII) underwent intraoperative AAA sac embolization as&#xD;
      reported in a previous experience. After the endograft deployment a completion angiography is&#xD;
      performed in all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints and definition Primary endpoints are to determine the efficacy of CO2 automated DSA&#xD;
      in proximal/distal sealing zone evaluation and endoleaks detection, in comparison with ICM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint is to evaluate the safety of CO2 standardized automated injection (any&#xD;
      side effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are defined fit for standard EVAR when proximal and distal neck length was ≥ 15 mm&#xD;
      and aortic neck β angle and angles at the level of iliac arteries were &lt; 60°.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic angiography is defined as the first angiography performed with the main body&#xD;
      advanced at the level of the lower renal artery according to bone landmarks, just before its&#xD;
      deployment, in order to visualize the optimal proximal sealing zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intraoperative proximal sealing zone evaluation is defined effective when the lower renal&#xD;
      artery and the proximal aortic neck just below it, are correctly visualized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intraoperative distal sealing zone evaluation is defined effective if the origin of the&#xD;
      hypogastric artery and the distal segment of the common iliac artery just above it, are&#xD;
      visualized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical success (TS) is defined as the complete endograft deployment with patency of renal&#xD;
      and hypogastric arteries, absence of type I/III endoleaks and iliac leg kinking or stenosis,&#xD;
      no conversion to OR or 24-hour mortality. Endoleaks are defined according to White and May&#xD;
      classification .&#xD;
&#xD;
      CO2 side effects (CO2 narcosis) are defined as any adverse events correlate to CO2 automated&#xD;
      injection. As reported in literature, abdominal pain, transient hypotension, nausea, ischemic&#xD;
      colitis occurring intraoperatively or within 30 minutes from the procedure, are considered&#xD;
      adverse events correlate to CO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Every patient will be followed first week and month, then every 3 months For at&#xD;
      least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation made by CTA or duplex ultrasonography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical characteristics of the study population is summarized by descriptive statistics.&#xD;
      The following tests Fisher's exact test and the Mann-Whitney U test; used for categorical and&#xD;
      continuous variables, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity will measures of the&#xD;
      performance of the test Individual differences were considered to be statistically&#xD;
      significant at p &lt; 0.05 Continuous data are presented as median and interquartile range&#xD;
      (IQR).&#xD;
