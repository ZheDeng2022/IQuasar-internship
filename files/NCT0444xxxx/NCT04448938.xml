  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When patients arrive in the waiting room of the MRI department, patients will be given the&#xD;
      briefing note explaining the purpose of the study and how it is going. During the&#xD;
      consultation, the radiologist will check the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria, and will&#xD;
      take the time to answer all of the patient's questions about the study. If the patient agrees&#xD;
      to participate in the research, the investigating doctor will obtain his consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI examination will be performed on a 3T multi-parametric MRI. Compared to the standard&#xD;
      protocol, patients will benefit from an additional sequence of f-mRI, called resting state,&#xD;
      and performed before injection of gadolinium contrast agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A consultation with an ophthalmologist will also be carried out the same day, at the Adolphe&#xD;
      de Rothschild Foundation. During this visit, an OCT examination (optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography), a visual field as well as the measurement of visual acuity will be carried out,&#xD;
      in accordance with the treatment usually practiced at the Adolphe de Rothschild Foundation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects of the control group who agreed to participate will benefit from an MRI&#xD;
      examination which will include, in addition to the sequences planned for these patients&#xD;
      according to their indications, the two non-injected sequences which will be performed on&#xD;
      patients with suspected NO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible existence of visual problems in the subjects of the control group will also be&#xD;
      asked to them by interrogation. No eye exams or follow-up visits are planned, and control&#xD;
      group participation will end after the MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with NO will be seen in consultation by an ophthalmologist during a follow-up visit&#xD;
      approximately 6 months after diagnosis. During this consultation, an OCT, a visual field and&#xD;
      the measurement of visual acuity will be performed. This visit and the examinations carried&#xD;
      out correspond to the usual care of patients suffering from NO and followed at the Adolphe de&#xD;
      Rothschild Foundation Hospital.&#xD;
