  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limited mobility of the uterine cervix and alignment with the vaginal canal is often required&#xD;
      during insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD). Currently, the available&#xD;
      instruments are traumatic tenacula, which could cause pain and bleeding and therefore&#xD;
      represent an obstacle for certain patients to pursue their medical follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AspivixTM is a new device, which enables atraumatic traction of the cervix while respecting&#xD;
      its specific semi-circular anatomic shape through a system powered by a vacuum chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our comparative study is to assess the patient's pain and bleeding using the&#xD;
      AspivixTM device in comparison with a commonly used single-tooth tenaculum (Pozzi forceps).&#xD;
      Additionally, the comparative study aims to assess and compare the safety of the AspivixTM&#xD;
      device with the single-tooth tenaculum (Pozzi forceps).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Study is made of 2 phases (pilot phase followed by a comparative phase). Details&#xD;
      regarding pilot study is registered separately.&#xD;
