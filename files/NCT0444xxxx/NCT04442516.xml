  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cisplatin (CisP) is a chemotherapeutic agent used to treat head and neck and lung cancer in&#xD;
      adults and over 15 different pediatric cancers. Despite its known toxicity, CisP is still&#xD;
      widely used as a first line chemotherapy as it is so effective. Nephrotoxicity is one of the&#xD;
      most common adverse effects of CisP, occurring in 20-50% of patients. It manifests as acute&#xD;
      kidney injury (AKI) typically within the first few days of exposure and is associated with&#xD;
      short and long-term morbidity. Furthermore, AKI diagnosis is only possible once kidney damage&#xD;
      has progressed to functional impairment, when mitigation strategies are ineffective. Tests&#xD;
      that could predict AKI risk pre-emptively or diagnose early-stage AKI before functional loss&#xD;
      would be very impactful, affording opportunities for prevention or early intervention to&#xD;
      mitigate CisP nephrotoxicity, reduce morbidity and improve health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The field of metabolomics seeks to identify patterns of small molecules (metabolites)&#xD;
      involved in cell or tissue metabolism related to disease states, or patient factors like&#xD;
      lifestyle and genetics. Plasma and urine are ideal for sampling the metabolome, which can&#xD;
      identify at-risk patients and reveal disease-related changes earlier than existing diagnostic&#xD;
      methods do.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In CisP-treated children and adults from across Canada, we will identify urine and plasma&#xD;
      metabolite profiles a) prior to CisP dosing that predict CisP AKI risk, and b) shortly after&#xD;
      dosing to identify early-stage nephrotoxicity, before clinical signs of AKI are detectable.&#xD;
      Our identified biomarkers will allow individualization of CisP treatment based on the level&#xD;
      of nephrotoxicity risk and the design of trials to mitigate the progression and complications&#xD;
      of CisP nephrotoxicity.&#xD;

        Child Cohort. We already performed these study procedures on 159 children in the &quot;ABLE&quot;&#xD;
        study, a 12-centre cohort study.Eligibility criteria and data/samples collected on these&#xD;
        patients during their initial CisP treatment are almost identical to the present study. The&#xD;
        cohort diagnoses include neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, osteosarcoma, germ cell tumour,&#xD;
        hepatoblastoma, and other cancers. Data and specimens from the pediatric study subjects in&#xD;
        the ABLE study who were recruited during their first CisP infusion (about half) will be&#xD;
        included in the current study. The remaining children (to reach a target of 300) will be&#xD;
        recruited over 3 years from the following centres: McGill, UBC, SickKids, U. Manitoba and&#xD;
        UWO. Adult Cohort. 300 adults (18 years of age or older) initiating CisP (≥75 mg/m2)&#xD;
        treatment for head/neck or lung cancers will be recruited to participate in this study from&#xD;
        PMH (Toronto), UBC and UWO over 2 years. Over 500 new patients/year are available across&#xD;
        all sites.&#xD;
