    <textblock>
      Dignity is an integral part of quality of life (QoL). Older adults often face with situations&#xD;
      that are related with the development of dementia and that might significantly affect their&#xD;
      feeling of personal dignity. The aim of the project is to investigate the changes in the&#xD;
      perception of personal dignity amongst older adults with dementia (OAwD) over the course of&#xD;
      three years and to define factors that threaten their dignity. A mixed methods design&#xD;
      (longitudinal prospective study) will be used. In the quantitative part, a battery of Czech&#xD;
      questionnaires will be used, and a translation and validation of a Czech version of the&#xD;
      ACE-III will be carried out. The qualitative part will include in-depth interviews (narrative&#xD;
      and semi-structured). The sample will comprise of OAwD living in home setting. Knowledge of&#xD;
      the changes in the perception of personal dignity and related factors may aid the healthcare&#xD;
      staff in choosing interventions that support and preserve dignity of OAwD as a significant&#xD;
      part of their QoL. The project is a follow-up of a previous project No. 16-28628A.&#xD;

      A. Introduction to project, current state of art As the population ages, an increasing number&#xD;
      of people will be diagnosed with dementia. At present, there are some 47 million people&#xD;
      living with dementia worldwide. In Czech Republic, there are about 156,000 people suffering&#xD;
      from dementia. Regional estimates of dementia prevalence in people aged 60 years and over now&#xD;
      range from 4.6% in Central Europe to 8.7% in North Africa and the Middle East. It is&#xD;
      estimated up to 131 million people with dementia will live in the world by 2050. Thus, there&#xD;
      is a need of sensitive and specific cognitive assessment tools to detect cognitive&#xD;
      impairment. It enables to provide timely intervention to delay the disease progression,&#xD;
      prolong independence, and enhance the quality of life (QoL) and personal dignity of the&#xD;
      individual with dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dementia is neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive, irreversible and still&#xD;
      incurable cognitive decline. People suffering from dementia retain their positive personality&#xD;
      traits and character. However, as the illness progresses, symptoms such as memory loss,&#xD;
      speech impairment, disorientation, difficulties with activities of daily living, and&#xD;
      self-neglect are common. This leads to a significant interference with everyday social and&#xD;
      work activities and has a negative impact on subjective perception of dignity. At present,&#xD;
      the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is used in the Czech Republic to diagnose dementia.&#xD;
      Due to copyright issues with the MMSE (similar to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]&#xD;
      questionnaire), there is a need for another valid tool to be free available in the country.&#xD;
      Currently, the most frequently used tool in the world is the Addenbrooke's Cognitive&#xD;
      Examination III (ACE-III), which is composed of five domains: orientation and attention;&#xD;
      memory; fluency; language, and visuospatial function. The ACE-III-J is a sensitive and&#xD;
      specific screening test to diagnose dementia, and it was better than the MMSE in accuracy for&#xD;
      identifying dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dignity is described as an integral part of QoL. Similarly to QoL, dignity can also be&#xD;
      understood as a multidimensional concept including: dignity of identity&#xD;
      (self-worth/worthiness, integrity, trust); dignity as a human right (equality, freedom of&#xD;
      choice); and dignity as expression of autonomy (independence, control. There are three main&#xD;
      dimensions essential for constituting dignity: A historical dignity-dimension, acknowledging&#xD;
      one's own life projects and history; an intrapersonal dignity-dimension, recognizing one's&#xD;
      own human worth, and living according to individual values; and an interpersonal&#xD;
      dignity-dimension, experiencing being part of a caring and confirming society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jacobson (2007) says that dignity exists in two complementary, yet disparate forms. It is&#xD;
      understood as a dualistic concept incorporating absolute and relative dignity, objective and&#xD;
      subjective dignity, and personal and social dignity. Personal dignity is a type of dignity&#xD;
      that is subjectively perceived by an individual and is linked to a sense of worthiness.&#xD;
      However, personal dignity is also contingent and contextual, and can be influenced both by an&#xD;
      internal aspect, which is the worth and self-respect one ascribes to oneself, as well as by&#xD;
      an external aspect, which is the worth and value ascribed to the individual by others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a severe chronic disease (such as neurodegenerative) experience existential&#xD;
      concerns related to changes in the self because of the disease, as well as the social&#xD;
      consequences of the disease (e.g. embarrassment, role changes, loss of independence, and&#xD;
      stigmatization), which can severely affect the sense of personal dignity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Older adults with dementia (OAwD) are often experiencing an ongoing loss of personal dignity,&#xD;
      value and security, and experiencing cognitive decline can be a threat towards self-respect&#xD;
      and the sense of dignity. The key element of the dementia experience is the effort to&#xD;
      preserve one's identity or sense of self and to preserve a meaningful life. Multiple personal&#xD;
      losses and changes such as increased dependency, loss of autonomy and gradual loss of&#xD;
      abilities or competencies can have a negative impact on the sense of self and the self-esteem&#xD;
      of dementia sufferers. Thus, OAwD are in risk of personal dignity loss due to both impact of&#xD;
      the disease on their identity and self-esteem, and indirectly through negative social&#xD;
      interactions and experiences. Before entering the stage of severe dementia individuals are&#xD;
      aware of the progressive decline in their abilities and actively try to cope with this&#xD;
      decline. A sound sense of personal dignity is essential to the individual's overall&#xD;
      experience of well-being and his/her QoL. Investigation of the factors that maintain and&#xD;
      strengthen personal dignity needs to incorporate data collected from those afflicted.&#xD;
      However, research how having dementia may impact personal dignity into person's subjective&#xD;
      experience of mild to moderate dementia is only very recent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot data The proposed grant project builds on results of a previous project Trajectories of&#xD;
      quality of life by the elderly in in early-stage dementia (No. 16-28628A). The findings of&#xD;
      the project confirm that OAwD assess their QoL better when they have a greater sense of&#xD;
      personal dignity. The validated Czech version of Patient Dignity Inventory (PDI-CZ) created&#xD;
      and tested in our project No. 16-28628A will be used in the proposed project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Project objectives, project timeline and description of methods and approaches To define&#xD;
      the factors that pose a threat to personal dignity gives an opportunity for a deeper&#xD;
      understanding of these issues. This can subsequently assist healthcare staff with choosing&#xD;
      the optimum interventions supporting QoL amongst OAwD. The proposed project responds to a&#xD;
      society-wide need to identify and solve psychosocial needs of an ageing population with&#xD;
      emphasis on neurodegenerative diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the project is to investigate the changes in the perception of personal&#xD;
      dignity of OAwD. The opportunity to define risk factors threatening personal dignity over the&#xD;
      course of dementia will contribute to a deeper understanding of patients' needs. This will&#xD;
      help healthcare workers choose the optimum psychosocial interventions in accordance with&#xD;
      Evidence Based Practice and thus protect dignity of OAwD as a major component of QoL. This&#xD;
      may have a positive effect on the psycho-social dimension of QoL amongst OAwD and may lower&#xD;
      the frequency and length of hospitalizations as well as save costs on healthcare and social&#xD;
      services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim is to ascertain how the subjective perception of personal dignity in OAwD&#xD;
      changes throughout the course of this disease (trajectory of personal dignity perception) and&#xD;
      which factors affect it. Because different types of dementia might have different perceptions&#xD;
      of personal dignity related to specific disturbances of cognitive domains, post-hoc subgroup&#xD;
      analysis in different forms of dementia will be performed. For the assessment of cognition&#xD;
      and diagnosis of dementia, the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III), POBAV, and&#xD;
      ALBA questionnaires will be used. For this reason, we need to create and validate a Czech&#xD;
      version of the ACE-III as the first stage of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve the main aim, five sub-aims were identified which should make it possible&#xD;
      to ascertain subjective perception of personal dignity and factors which affect in amongst&#xD;
      OAwD:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to create a Czech version of the ACE-III and to conduct a psychometric validation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to ascertain how the assessment of personal dignity changes over the course of 2 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to identify sociodemographic and clinical factors perceived as a threat to dignity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. post-hoc subgroup analysis of results among the different types of dementia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to define the differences in the perception of personal dignity among OAwD when using&#xD;
           quantitative (PDI-CZ) and qualitative (in-depth interview) methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Methodology In order to reach the set aims, a mixed methods research design (quantitative&#xD;
      survey first follow by qualitative interview) will be used to carry out a longitudinal,&#xD;
      prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the quantitative phase of the project using a battery of standardized questionnaires (3&#xD;
      stages). Research nurse gave QAwD the questionnaires and explained how to complete them. The&#xD;
      questionnaires will be completed on project enrolment and then two more times at a 12-month&#xD;
      interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the qualitative phase of the research, individual in-depth interviews with OAwD on the&#xD;
      topic of dignity (two interviews with each respondent at a 12-month interval) will be&#xD;
      conducted, recorded, and transcribed with a subsequent interpretative phenomenological&#xD;
      analysis. Two psychologists will be undertaking the interviews, in order to ensure that the&#xD;
      interviews are conducted in the most sensitive manner. Informed consent will be secured&#xD;
      before each interview. This will be carried out throughout project lifetime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire battery will be included: Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III),&#xD;
      Amnesia Light and Brief Assessment (ALBA), POBAV, Patient Dignity Inventory (PDI-CZ), Bristol&#xD;
      Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADLS-CZ), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and a batch of&#xD;
      socio-demographic and clinical characteristics (including age, sex, level of education,&#xD;
      living arrangement, social life, frequency of social visits, telephone contact with&#xD;
      relatives/friends, and the daytime spent alone, illnesses, medication, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample The sample will consist of community-dwelling (i.e., living at home) older adults.&#xD;
      They will be addressed together with their family caregivers in neurologic and geriatric&#xD;
      outpatient offices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First sample (quantitative research) will comprise of 500 respondents (310 OAwD for the&#xD;
      longitudinal, three-stage study and 190 older adults for the validation study ACE-III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second sample (qualitative research) - after evaluating the 1st stage of the quantitative&#xD;
      research, we will select 10 OAwD from the sample group with high level (average scale more&#xD;
      than 3) and 10 OAwD who have low level of dignity to understand the different perspectives of&#xD;
      perception of personal dignity. The exact number of respondents will depend on the thematic&#xD;
      saturation in the course of interviewing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the quantitative research (validation study, and longitudinal study) will be&#xD;
      gathered using a questionnaire from 310 OAwD (longitudinal study) and 190 older adults (half&#xD;
      with dementia and half without dementia; validation study ACE-III) in neurologic and&#xD;
      geriatric outpatients' departments in four regions of the Czech Republic. All data will be&#xD;
      inserted into CASTOR database, from which they will be exported for statistical processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the qualitative phase will be gathered using in-depth interviews with 20 OAwD.&#xD;
      These respondents we will select after evaluation the 1st stage of the quantitative research&#xD;
      (10 OAwD with high and 10 OAwD with low levels of dignity to understand the different&#xD;
      perspectives in perception of personal dignity). An interpretative phenomenological analysis&#xD;
      (IPA) will be applied. The IPA is an approach of a qualitative research, which is used to&#xD;
      examine how people make sense of their major life experiences. The method is often used to&#xD;
      study patients' lived experience. The data will be coded in NVivo 12 software for analysis.&#xD;
      To assure reliability of the analysis, two researchers will code the interviews independently&#xD;
      and they will confront their results for similarities and differences.&#xD;
