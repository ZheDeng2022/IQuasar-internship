  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council for Harmonisation&#xD;
      (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good&#xD;
      Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 1/2 multicenter, single arm, open-label study in Japanese subjects with DIPSS&#xD;
      intermediate or high-risk PMF, post-PV or post-ET MF. The study consists of 2 parts: Phase 1&#xD;
      part to determine safety and tolerability and a RP2D. The Phase 1 portion of the study will&#xD;
      explore one or more drug doses for fedratinib (300 mg and 400 mg) using a mTPI-2 design.&#xD;
      Following completion of dose escalation and determination of MTD and/or a RP2D, the study&#xD;
      will progress into the Phase 2 part to further evaluate the efficacy and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 3 periods: a Screening Period, a Treatment Period including a&#xD;
      30-day follow-up after last dose visit and a survival follow-up period.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Subject must meet at least one of the following criteria of (a or b).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: reason to discontinue ruxolitinib treatment (lack of efficacy and/or&#xD;
             intolerability, etc) and physician decision as to the study participation as being&#xD;
             appropriate should be recorded in the case report form:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Previously received ruxolitinib treatment for PMF or post-PV MF or post-ET MF for&#xD;
                  at least 14 days (exposure of &lt; 14 days is allowed for subjects who discontinued&#xD;
                  ruxolitinib due to intolerability or allergy).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Never received ruxolitinib treatment and is expected to derive clinical benefit&#xD;
                  from this study participation based on the clinical judgement of the Investigator&#xD;
                  Only those subjects who previously received ruxolitinib treatment are eligible&#xD;
                  for the Phase 1 part of the study to avoid overestimating tolerability of&#xD;
                  fedratinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject must have treatment-related toxicities from prior therapy resolved to Grade 1&#xD;
             or pretreatment baseline before start of last therapy prior to starting the fedratinib&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Subject must understand and voluntarily sign an ICF prior to any study-related&#xD;
             assessments/procedures being conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  prior to starting fedratinib treatment. She must agree to ongoing pregnancy&#xD;
                  testing during the course of the study, and after end of fedratinib treatment.&#xD;
                  This applies even if the subject practices true abstinence* from heterosexual&#xD;
                  contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Either commit to true abstinence* from heterosexual contact (which must be&#xD;
                  reviewed on a monthly basis and source documented) or agree to use and be able to&#xD;
                  comply with highly effective contraception** without interruption, -14 days prior&#xD;
                  to starting investigational product, during the fedratinib treatment (including&#xD;
                  dose interruptions), and for 30 days after discontinuation of fedratinib&#xD;
                  treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. If breastfeeding, agree to stop breastfeeding prior to the participation in the&#xD;
                  study and not to resume breastfeeding for at least 30 days after treatment&#xD;

             menarche at some point, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy,&#xD;
             or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy or&#xD;
             amenorrhea due to other medical reasons does not rule out childbearing potential) for&#xD;
             at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the preceding 24&#xD;
             consecutive months).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. A male subject must:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Practice true abstinence (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to use a&#xD;
        condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential&#xD;
        while participating in the study, during dose interruptions and for at least 30 days&#xD;
        following fedratinib discontinuation, or longer if required by local regulations, even if&#xD;
        he has undergone a successful vasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
        of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation&#xD;
        methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Agreement to use highly effective methods of contraception that alone or in combination&#xD;
        resulting in a failure rate of a Pearl index of less than 1% per year when used&#xD;
        consistently and correctly throughout the course of the study. Such methods include&#xD;
        combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral),&#xD;
        progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral),&#xD;
        placement of an intrauterine device, placement of an intrauterine hormone-releasing system,&#xD;
        bilateral tubal occlusion, and vasectomized partner.&#xD;
