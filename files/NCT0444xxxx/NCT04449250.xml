    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the effect of food on the rate and extent of&#xD;
      absorption and the overall bioavailability of a single dose of CTx-1301 50 mg trimodal&#xD;
      tablets in healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, randomized, single-dose, two-sequence, two-period, in-clinic crossover study&#xD;
      with two treatments (fed vs fasted) in approximately 26 healthy adult subjects aged 18 to 55&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fed arm: Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects should begin consuming&#xD;
      the test meal 30 minutes prior to administration of CTx-1301. CTx-1301 (50 mg) should be&#xD;
      administered 30 minutes after the start of the meal. CTx-1301 (50 mg) should be administered&#xD;
      with approximately 240 mL (8 fluid ounces) of water. No food should be allowed for at least 4&#xD;
      hours post-dose. Water can be allowed as desired except for at least one hour before and at&#xD;
      least one hour after drug administration. Subjects should receive standardized meals as&#xD;
      defined in the study schedule for the fed treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasted arm: Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects should be administered&#xD;
      CTx-1301 (50 mg) with approximately 240 mL (8 fluid ounces) of water. No food should be&#xD;
      allowed for at least 4 hours post-dose. Water can be allowed as desired except for at least&#xD;
      one hour before and at least one hour after drug administration. Subjects should receive&#xD;
      standardized meals as defined in the study schedule for the fasted treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A high-fat (approximately 50 percent of total caloric content of the meal) and high-calorie&#xD;
      (approximately 800 to 1000 calories) meal is used as the test meal for food-effect&#xD;
      bioanalytical (BA) and fed bioequivalency (BE) studies. This test meal allows approximately&#xD;
      150, 250, and 500-600 calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively. The test&#xD;
      meal, eaten within 30 minutes prior to administration of CTx-1301, is two eggs fried in&#xD;
      butter, two strips of bacon, two slices of toast with butter, four ounces of hash brown&#xD;
      potatoes and eight ounces of whole milk.&#xD;
