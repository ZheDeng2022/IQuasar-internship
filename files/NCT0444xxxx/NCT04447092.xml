  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase 2 study of Pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy in&#xD;
      chemotherapy-naïve advanced pancreatic cancer&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  In unresectable advanced pancreatic cancer, palliative chemotherapy (mainly&#xD;
           Gemcitabine/nab-Paclitaxel or FOLFIRINOX) is the mainstay of treatment. Regardless of&#xD;
           the choice of first-line therapy, more than half of the patients with&#xD;
           advanced/metastatic disease will progress within six months and will not survive more&#xD;
           than one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immune cells (IC) are a significant part of the pancreatic tumor-associated stroma and&#xD;
           play a fundamental part in maintaining a non-immunogenic and immuno-suppressive&#xD;
           environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IO (Immuno-Oncology drug) monotherapy is not effective in advanced pancreatic cancer;&#xD;
           therefore, we need more active combination regimens including IO/IO or IO/chemotherapy,&#xD;
           etc. Furthermore, we need biomarker study to uncover which population is an optimal&#xD;
           target for this IO-based treatment strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Based on these rationale, we plan to conduct an open-label, phase 2 study to explore&#xD;
           biomarkers and evaluate the safety and efficacy of the pembrolizumab/chemotherapy&#xD;
           combination in an advanced pancreatic cancer primary environment.&#xD;
