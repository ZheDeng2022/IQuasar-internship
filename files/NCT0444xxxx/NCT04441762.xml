  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Pain is a common reason for individuals to seek health care, especially&#xD;
      emergency care. Ketorolac has numerous advantages over other pain medications, especially the&#xD;
      opioids. The intranasal administration of ketorolac has been shown to be safe and effective&#xD;
      in the treatment of postoperative pain following major abdominal surgery and post dental&#xD;
      surgery, but there have been no studies evaluating the use of intranasal ketorolac for the&#xD;
      treatment of acute renal colic pain in the emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a double blinded randomized controlled trial. two hundred renal colic&#xD;
      patients presented to the emergency department will be randomized to intervention (30 mg&#xD;
      intranasal ketorolac) and (30mg intravenous ketorolac) case groups. Their pain before and&#xD;
      after receiving ketorolac will be measured by visual Analog Scale (VAS pain score). Patient,&#xD;
      attending physician and administering nurse will be blinded throughout the study. The&#xD;
      analgesic effects will be assessed by several measures including pain relief, pain intensity&#xD;
      difference, global pain evaluation, global assessment of analgesia, and the summed pain&#xD;
      intensity difference. The safety will be assessed by documentation of adverse events, vital&#xD;
      signs, and clinical assessment before and after drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of this study is to compare analgesic effects of intranasal Ketorolac&#xD;
      tromethamine versus intravenous Ketorolac tromethamine in adult patients with moderate to&#xD;
      severe renal colic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: Analgesic effects of Intranasal Ketorolac on the visual analog scale&#xD;
      (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: Adverse Events, the need of rescue pain medications, time to discharge&#xD;
      and recurrent visit within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population: Adults (from age 18 to 64 years) who presents to emergency department&#xD;
      (ED) at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital with moderate to severe acute flank pain suggestive&#xD;
      of renal colic (visual analog scale 7 or more).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Single dose of intranasal ketorolac 30mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical measurement: Visual Analog Scale will be assessed at 0, 30 and 60 minutes after&#xD;
      intervention. Number and dosage of rescue medication, any reported events by patient or&#xD;
      attending physician will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: Decrease in pain measures by VAS pain score after intranasal ketorolac is given,&#xD;
      tolerability and safety evaluation.&#xD;

      Research objectives and hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the analgesic effects of intranasal Ketorolac&#xD;
      tromethamine versus intravenous Ketorolac tromethamine in adult patients with moderate to&#xD;
      severe renal colic seen at the Emergency Department at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective double-blinded randomized clinical trial in adults (from age 18 to 64 years) who&#xD;
      presents to the emergency department (ED) at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital with moderate&#xD;
      to severe acute flank pain suggestive of renal colic (visual analog scale 7 or more). Written&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from the patient. Eligible subjects will be enrolled (see section&#xD;
      5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group Will receive 30 mg intravenous ketorolac in 10 ml syringe + 1 ml Normal Saline&#xD;
      9% using the intranasal device (0.5 ml in each nostril).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Group Will receive 30 mg intranasal ketorolac in 1 ml intranasal device (0.5 ml&#xD;
      in each nostril) + 10 ml Intravenous Normal Saline 9%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analgesic effects of Intranasal Ketorolac on the visual analog scale (VAS). Change in visual&#xD;
      analog scale after receiving intranasal ketorolac. 0 (no pain) - 10 (worst possible pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse Event/Side Effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety assessed by reporting all adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The need of rescue pain medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recurrent visit within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      after 1 hour follow-up, 146 patient will be needed ( 73 on each arm) to have 90% power to&#xD;
      detect a difference of a 0.7 of the response of visual analog scale score ( which usually&#xD;
      ranges between 0 and 10 ) between the groups (5.3 vs 4.6) at the 5% alpha (significance)&#xD;
      level. Because of missing data and losses to follow-up, an additional 54 subjects will be&#xD;
      needed (100 in each arm) for a total of 200 subjects (study sample). A P-value &lt;0.5. Level of&#xD;
      significance to be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Present to the Clinical Site Adult subjects ages 18 to 64 years with a classical&#xD;
           presentation of acute renal colic being seen in the emergency department may be eligible&#xD;
           for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical sign and symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Severe flank pain radiating inferiorly and anteriorly with or without:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urinary symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Previous history of renal colic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Eligibility Assessments Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be check.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Informed Consent Potentially eligible participants will be identified by their treating&#xD;
           clinicians. Written informed consent to participate in this study will follow a process&#xD;
           of information exchange between clinicians and potential participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study Pain Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
           Three pain assessments will be done based on VAS-Pain at:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  0 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  30 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  60 minutes Pain scores will be recorded and documented before the administration of&#xD;
                medication for a baseline pain assessment and at specified intervals after the&#xD;
                administration. Post-treatment pain scores will be recorded at 0, 30 and 60&#xD;
                minutes. Pain assessments will be by the Visual Analog Scale for Pain. It is&#xD;
                usually presented as a 10cm horizontal line on which the patient's pain intensity&#xD;
                is represented by a point between the extremes of &quot;no pain at all&quot; and &quot;worst pain&#xD;
                imaginable.&quot; All patients must have a minimum of two pain scores. If rescue&#xD;
                medications were given, a VAS-Pain will be obtained immediately prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Standard-of-Care Procedures: Pain Management Patients may receive additional medications&#xD;
           as part of their emergency department treatment including additional pain medications,&#xD;
           such as opioids. Any additional medications administered will be recorded. The need for&#xD;
           additional medications (including the drug administered, the dose, the time, and the&#xD;
           route of administration) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Safety Assessments All adverse events will be documented on an adverse event case log.&#xD;
           Serious adverse events should be immediately reported to the primary investigator. Any&#xD;
           serious, adverse event will be reported immediately to the Institutional Review Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events is considered serious if it causes a threat to the patient's life or&#xD;
      functioning. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines a serious adverse event&#xD;
      (SAE) as any untoward medical occurrence that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results in death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Life-threatening (places the patient at risk of death).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Requires hospitalization or prolongs an existing hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Requires medical intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISKS AND BENEFITS Ketorolac has been proven effective for pain relief, especially for&#xD;
      certain types of pain, such as musculoskeletal pain, headaches and the pain from renal colic.&#xD;
      Inappropriate patients, ketorolac is a relatively safe drug for the treatment of pain. Side&#xD;
      effects and complications, such as gastrointestinal complaints (e.g. abdominal pain,&#xD;
      dyspepsia, GI bleeding) and renal dysfunction (elevation of the blood urea nitrogen and&#xD;
      creatinine) have been reported but with appropriate patient's selection are uncommon or rare.&#xD;
      The use of NSAIDS including ketorolac is not recommended in patients with active peptic ulcer&#xD;
      disease, renal disease or at risk for renal failure due to volume depletion, cerebrovascular&#xD;
      bleeding, hemorrhagic disorders, or those with a high risk of bleeding. With an appropriate&#xD;
      patient selection, ketorolac can be a safe and effective medication for the relief of pain.&#xD;
      The drug used in this study has a very low risk of developing any complications. However,&#xD;
      during visits patients will be monitored for any complications and all adverse effects if any&#xD;
      will be reported. With the proposed hypothesis, intranasal has the potential to reduce opioid&#xD;
      use in the ED, provides fast, needleless and easy methods to apply. It will decrease the&#xD;
      waiting time, cannulation and unnecessary blood investigations in patients with a classic&#xD;
      presentation of acute renal colic.&#xD;
