  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal jaundice is the most common reason for rehospitalization after postnatal discharge.&#xD;
      Jaundice due to breastfeeding failure is an important subtype of pathological neonatal&#xD;
      jaundice. Typically, it occurs with lactation failure, which results in dehydration (reducing&#xD;
      urine output), significant weight loss (&gt;10% of birth weight) and sometimes hypernatremia,&#xD;
      during the first postnatal week. Jaundice caused by breastfeeding failure is observed in one&#xD;
      third (31.8%) of total cases of pathological neonatal jaundice requiring rehospitalization.&#xD;
      Jaundice lasts for an average of 6.8 days and the length of hospital stay takes up to 3 days.&#xD;
      Jaundice due to breastfeeding failure requires focused efforts for a program structured with&#xD;
      breastfeeding education and special breastfeeding support. This support causes the role of&#xD;
      nurses to become even more important. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      support provided for breastfeeding and the feeding of infants' with breast milk on&#xD;
      hospitalization due to jaundice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: The support provided for breastfeeding and the feeding of infants' with breast milk has&#xD;
      no effect on hospitalization due to jaundice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: The support provided for breastfeeding and the feeding of infants' with breast milk&#xD;
      affects the consequences of hospitalization due to jaundice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Neonatal jaundice is a condition that is accompanied by hyperbilirubinemia.&#xD;
      Almost all newborns (60% term and 80% preterm) have more than 5mg/dl of bilirubin during the&#xD;
      first week of life, and approximately 6% of term infants may have levels exceeding 15 mg/dl&#xD;
      (Young Infants Clinical Signs Study Group, 2008). It is one of the most common causes of&#xD;
      morbidity during the first week of life. High serum bilirubin level leads to serious&#xD;
      consequences and neurologic disorders in some of the infants with jaundice. 5-10% of these&#xD;
      newborns have clinically important neonatal jaundice that requires treatment and care to&#xD;
      prevent neurotoxicity and reduce serum bilirubin level (Madan, Mac Mohan, Stevenson, 2005).&#xD;
      Recent studies in the literature have shown that there is a strong relationship between&#xD;
      hyperbilirubinemia and breastfeeding (Garg, 2018; Flaherman 2017). In a study, it was&#xD;
      indicated that breastfed infants had lower bilirubin levels on postnatal day 3 compared to&#xD;
      infants fed with infant formula. The problem of jaundice that increases due to insufficient&#xD;
      intake of breast milk/breastfeeding is usually underestimated, an exaggerated physiological&#xD;
      jaundice treatment is often administered (symptomatically phototherapy), and breastfeeding&#xD;
      problems are neglected (Stark, Bhutani 2016). Therefore, while the infant and the mother try&#xD;
      to adapt to each other for successful breastfeeding, the treatment process increases&#xD;
      breastfeeding difficulties and failure during the first postnatal week. The role and&#xD;
      counseling of the infant's nurse are of great importance in breastfeeding of the newborn and&#xD;
      the education of the family in neonatal jaundice. The first postnatal hours and days are the&#xD;
      most critical times for ensuring the success of breastfeeding. Jaundice due to breastfeeding&#xD;
      failure requires focused efforts for a program structured with breastfeeding education and&#xD;
      special breastfeeding support. This support causes the role of nurses to become even more&#xD;
      important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: This is a randomized controlled experimental study. The data of the study will be&#xD;
      collected from primiparous mothers who had normal delivery in the Gynecology and Obstetrics&#xD;
      Department in Sakarya Maternity and Children's Hospital Campus affiliated to the Ministry of&#xD;
      Health Sakarya University Training and Research Hospital between 01.08.2020-01.01.2021 and&#xD;
      their infants until January 2021. The sample of the study was calculated in accordance with&#xD;
      the intervention group selection criteria and by performing power analysis. Power analysis&#xD;
      was performed using G*Power (v3.1.7) program in order to determine sample size. The effect&#xD;
      range value was taken as 0.70 as the method used in cases where it is unknown how many units&#xD;
      difference is significant between the groups. In cases where Type 1 error probability (α) was&#xD;
      0.05 (at a confidence level of 95%), at a power level of 80% and the effect range was 0.70,&#xD;
      the study was planned with a total of 68 mothers, including 34 mothers women for each group.&#xD;
      The mothers to be allocated to the study and control groups will be ensured to have&#xD;
      similarity in terms of three factors (age, educational status, gender of the infants). The&#xD;
      individuals will be allocated into groups by simple random sampling. The sample of the study&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated into two groups: the intervention group will be supported for&#xD;
      breastfeeding and the feeding of infants' with breast milk, and the other group, which was&#xD;
      the control group, will be followed in routine care of the service. Single-blind (researchers&#xD;
      are not blind) randomization will be provided since the mothers will be provided with support&#xD;
      for breastfeeding and the feeding of infants' with breast milk by the researchers. The&#xD;
      statistician was also blinded for the data analysis purpose. With regard to data collection&#xD;
      tools, the &quot;Mother Introductory Information Form&quot; including socio-demographic characteristics&#xD;
      of the family, the &quot;Newborn Introductory Information Form&quot; including characteristic features&#xD;
      of the infants, the &quot;Infant Nutrition Follow-up Form&quot; for the follow-up of breast milk milked&#xD;
      after breastfeeding, and the &quot;Jaundice Follow-up Form&quot; including the follow-up of infants who&#xD;
      are hospitalized due to jaundice before/after discharge will be used. Mothers in the&#xD;
      experimental group will be provided with breastfeeding support, and if required, the mother's&#xD;
      both breasts will be milked by hand and the resulting breast milk will be collected in a&#xD;
      container. After milking, the milk will be given to the infant with the help of a teaspoon.&#xD;
      This practice will be shown to the mother and will be performed after each feeding during the&#xD;
      hospital stay. Mothers will be told to perform this practice at home until the infant sucks&#xD;
      effectively and strongly, and families will be called by phone daily. No intervention will be&#xD;
      made to the control group. Bilirubin measurements of both groups will be performed with a&#xD;
      transcutaneous bilirubin meter both before discharge from the hospital and at the end of week&#xD;
      1, and the values will be recorded. At the same time, the conditions of rehospitalization due&#xD;
      to jaundice at the end of week 1 will be recorded. In the evaluation of data, statistical&#xD;
      analyses will be performed using the SPSS package program. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test&#xD;
      will be used for normality. In order to determine whether there is a difference in the&#xD;
      dependent variables compared to independent variables, the independent group t-test will be&#xD;
      used if the distribution is normal in independent variables with two options, and Mann&#xD;
      Whitney-U test will be used if distribution is not normal. The results will be evaluated at a&#xD;
      confidence level of 95% and at a level of significance of p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
