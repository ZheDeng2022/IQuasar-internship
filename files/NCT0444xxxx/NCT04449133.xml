  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is the most common and serious of the sleep disorders.&#xD;
      Long-term, OSA is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, with a number of adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular, neurocognitive, metabolic, and daytime functioning consequences. No drugs are&#xD;
      currently approved for OSA treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, cross-over, inpatient phase 2&#xD;
      clinical trial to examine the efficacy and the safety of a fixed dose level of AD128 in&#xD;
      patients with OSA.&#xD;
