  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The issue Patients who are living with a life-limiting and progressive illness are often&#xD;
      encouraged by the healthcare professionals looking after them to undergo a process called&#xD;
      Advance Care Planning (ACP). An advance care plan is a written guide of a patient's likes,&#xD;
      dislikes, wishes, and the treatments they would want to refuse or the rituals they would want&#xD;
      to follow - whether during illness or at the end of life. The planning process helps patients&#xD;
      and their relatives think about different scenarios, and the plans that would be used by&#xD;
      medical staff if that patient becomes too ill to communicate. ACP discussions can take many&#xD;
      forms and are often described as a process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is accepted by healthcare professionals that ACP is useful to patients and their&#xD;
      relatives. Research has also focussed on the positive nature of ACP, traditionally looking at&#xD;
      issues such as how many patients have achieved their wishes and why, what makes ACP possible,&#xD;
      and what prevents patients or healthcare professionals from starting these discussions. Some&#xD;
      research has also looked at how patients experience the actual process of ACP itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there has been little research into the effect ACP discussions can have on a patient&#xD;
      and their relatives, or how patients react to ACP discussions. As a result, researchers and&#xD;
      healthcare professionals do not have a full understanding of the psychological impact on&#xD;
      patients and their families, and any resulting changes in patients' outlook, emotional state,&#xD;
      family and clinical relationships, and their behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Learning more about how patients respond to such important and challenging discussions about&#xD;
      their care will be vital in improving healthcare professionals' understanding of how best to&#xD;
      carry out ACP conversations, and how best to support patients and their relatives following&#xD;
      ACP conversations. It is also important to explore not only the benefits of ACP but also the&#xD;
      potential downsides or unexpected problems of having such a difficult conversation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What the investigators will do The aim of this study is to explore how patients are affected&#xD;
      by discussions about their future care, and if these discussions affect how patients think or&#xD;
      feel in themselves and what they do. The investigators will conduct qualitative interviews&#xD;
      with patients living with a life-limiting illness who have already had ACP discussions with a&#xD;
      healthcare professional, to explore how and in what ways ACP discussions have affected&#xD;
      patients and their families. Qualitative interviews are semi-structured interviews that are&#xD;
      designed to explore issues and what these mean to people in-depth, in order to gather rich&#xD;
      data that provides insight into a person's perspectives. They are well suited to exploring&#xD;
      subjects about which little is yet known, and also subjects which can be sensitive or&#xD;
      challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Location of the study, and participation The study will be conducted from Princess Alice&#xD;
      Hospice in Surrey, which provides both inpatient and community palliative care services to a&#xD;
      large catchment population of approximately 1 million people, in South West London and&#xD;
      Surrey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to recruit 20 participants to represent a broad range of clinical and&#xD;
      demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, ethnicity, diagnosis and borough in which&#xD;
      they live, in order to explore the experiences of as diverse a group as possible.&#xD;
      Participants will be interviewed in a place convenient for them, such as in their home or the&#xD;
      Hospice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Who the investigators are The study will be led by a clinician currently working in&#xD;
      Palliative Care, as part of a Masters in Palliative Care, being undertaken at King's College&#xD;
      London. The researcher will be supervised at all times by Dr Jonathan Koffman, Reader in&#xD;
      Palliative Care at King's College London, who possesses over 20 years of experience in&#xD;
      undertaking research among patients living with and dying from advanced disease, and their&#xD;
      families.&#xD;

        Patients will be recruited from Princess Alice Hospice. Princess Alice is a large Hospice&#xD;
        in Surrey which provides inpatient, day services and community services to 9 boroughs in&#xD;
        South London, Surrey and Middlesex, with a catchment population of approximately 1 million&#xD;
        people. Community home visit and outpatient services are provided by a Consultant led,&#xD;
        multi-disciplinary team, and provide care to approximately 850 patients at any one time.&#xD;
        Princess Alice has a 20 bedded Palliative Medicine inpatient unit and accepts referrals for&#xD;
        symptom control and terminal care admissions, with a typical length of stay of 7-10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are referred to Princess Alice Hospice for Specialist Palliative Care if they have&#xD;
        a diagnosis of a life-limiting or life-threatening disease. Princess Alice Hospice provides&#xD;
        holistic palliative care that is aimed to provide physical, psychological, spiritual and&#xD;
        social support.&#xD;
