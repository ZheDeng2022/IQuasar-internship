  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-diabetes (Pre-D) is a precursor to type 2 diabetes (T2D) and characterized by increased&#xD;
      exercise fatigability of lower limb muscles, that can impede exercise performance. The cause&#xD;
      for the increased fatigability in people with Pre-D is not known. Given the profound vascular&#xD;
      disease present in people who have had uncontrolled diabetes for several years, we will&#xD;
      determine whether dynamic, fatiguing contractions of the lower limb muscles in people with&#xD;
      Pre-D are limited by vascular dysfunction at multiple levels along the vascular tree&#xD;
      including the artery, arteriole, and/or capillary. This clinical trial involves a novel&#xD;
      exercise training regime involving blood flow restriction to the exercising limb will be used&#xD;
      as a probe to further understand the vascular mechanisms for increased fatigability in people&#xD;
      with Pre-D and T2D. The long-term goal is to better understand what limits exercise and&#xD;
      functional performance in people with diabetes to help develop targeted, more effective&#xD;
      exercise programs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the clinical trial is to determine the effectiveness of dynamic resistance&#xD;
      exercise training coupled with blood flow restriction to improve fatigability and vascular&#xD;
      function in people with Pre-D and T2D. People with Pre-D and T2D from Aim 1 will perform 8&#xD;
      weeks of dynamic unilateral resistance exercise training in which one leg is exercised with&#xD;
      freely perfused conditions and the other leg with blood flow restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will assess fatigability, skeletal muscle metabolism, capillary density, and vascular&#xD;
      function in people with Pre-D and T2D before and after a novel training intervention that&#xD;
      couples dynamic resistance training with blood flow restriction to the exercising limb. This&#xD;
      novel intervention has been shown to improve vascular function in young and older adults but&#xD;
      has not been investigated in people with Pre-D and T2D. Endothelial function in intact large&#xD;
      conduit arteries and arterioles isolated from skeletal muscle biopsies will be measured&#xD;
      before and after the training intervention to assess whether the novel training improves&#xD;
      vascular function along multiple levels of the vascular tree in people with Pre-D and T2D.&#xD;
      Skeletal muscle blood flow through the femoral artery will be quantified with Doppler&#xD;
      ultrasonography and skeletal muscle oxygenation will be measured with near infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy (NIRS) during a dynamic fatiguing knee extension exercise. We will closely match&#xD;
      participant groups for physical activity levels, age, sex, and body mass index (BMI), because&#xD;
      these confounders are not typically controlled for in other human studies.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Each participant will attend 3 sessions per week for 8 weeks. A training session will start with a 10-minute warm up on a bike ergometer. Each leg will then perform low-load resistance training (~20% of 1-RM) for 4 sets of contractions with 15 contractions per set of contractions with a 30 second rest between each set of contractions while seated in a knee extension weight machine. One leg will be randomized to always perform the training with blood flow restriction (BFR leg) while the contralateral leg performs the exercise training without blood flow occlusion (Control leg).</intervention_model_description>
