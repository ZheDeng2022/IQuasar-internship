      Patients will be included in a randomized controlled clinical trial, will enroll only adult&#xD;
      vitiligo patients with surface area of at least 10% who are being followed in the outpatient&#xD;
      dermatology clinics of King Abdullah University Hospital (KAUH) and are planned to start on&#xD;
      phototherapy Narrow Band Ultraviolet light B (NBUVB), regardless if they have previous&#xD;
      treatment for their disease, one month wash off period will be given for patients who are&#xD;

      Patients to be included in this randomized controlled study are adults with generalized&#xD;
      vitiligo of surface area of at least 10% who are being followed in the outpatient dermatology&#xD;
      clinics of King Abdullah University Hospital (KAUH) and are planned to start on phototherapy&#xD;
      Narrow Band Ultraviolet light B (NB-UVB), regardless if they have previous treatment for&#xD;
      their disease, one month wash off period will be given for patients who are already on&#xD;
      phototherapy or other treatments for vitiligo. In our going study, adult patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled into 2 groups ( around 20 patients per each) in which NBUVB will be given 2-3&#xD;
      sessions per week in combination with one of the following randomly; one group will start on&#xD;
      Tacrolimus 0.1% ointment twice daily, a second group will start on calcipotriol &amp;&#xD;
      betamethasone containing cream once daily, photos will be taken and the exact sites involved&#xD;
      will be detected, efficacy of treatment will be assessed according to repigmentation&#xD;
      percentages of vitiligo areas from baseline at 3 and 6 months. The improvement at 6 months&#xD;
      compared to baseline will be classified into 5 groups according to the percentage of&#xD;
      repigmentation as follow; excellent (76%-100%); moderate (51%-75%); mild (26%-50%); minimal&#xD;
      (1%-25%); or no response.&#xD;
