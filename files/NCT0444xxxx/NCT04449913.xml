  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at assessing neuro-behavioral changes occuring during an intensive ten days&#xD;
      meditation retreat. The investigator will study changes in tactile, auditory and pain&#xD;
      perceptions as well as changes in cognitive and affective mental contents and their neural&#xD;
      markers, as measured by self-reports, EEG event-related potentials, and functional&#xD;
      connectivity of resting state fMRI. He will recruit healthy participants with a prior&#xD;
      meditation experience. They will be randomly assigned to two groups, one active group who&#xD;
      will undergo measurements just before, during and 3 weeks after the retreat. The other group&#xD;
      will serve of control for task habituation, control participants will undergo the same&#xD;
      measurements, equally spaced in time, but before the retreat. The main hypothesis is that&#xD;
      meditation training strengthens meta-awareness, attention capacities resulting in enhanced&#xD;
      bodily- and self-awareness during sensory perception and emotion regulation during pain.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention consists in a 10 days contemplative retreat, with 6 to 8 hours of sitting and walking meditation per day, and 1 or 2 hours of meditation teachings. The meditation practice will mainly train in mindfulness practice. Mindfulness meditation intends to train attention to detect and regulate afflictive cognitive and emotional patterns. Mindfulness practice requires skills involved in openness to experience, in monitoring the focus of attention and in detecting distraction, disengaging attention from the source of distraction, and flexibly (re)directing and engaging attention to the intended object. A brief introduction to loving-kindness and compassion meditation will also be present throughout the retreat.</description>
