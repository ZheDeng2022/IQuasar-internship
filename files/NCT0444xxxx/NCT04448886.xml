      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug or a combination of investigational drugs to&#xD;
      learn whether the drug or drug combination works in treating a specific disease.&#xD;
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug or drug combination is being studied. The U.S. Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Sacituzumab Govitecan for your specific disease,&#xD;
      but it has been approved for other uses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not&#xD;

             to, ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled non-malignant systemic disease,&#xD;

             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following&#xD;
             cancers that have been diagnosed and treated within the past 3 years are eligible:&#xD;
             cervical/prostate carcinoma in situ, superficial bladder cancer, non-melanoma cancer&#xD;
             of the skin. Patients with other cancers diagnosed within the past 3 years and felt to&#xD;

             virus (defined as detected HCV RNA [qualitative]) infection. HIV-positive participants&#xD;
             are ineligible due to the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions of combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy with study drugs and the increased risk of fatal infections.&#xD;
             Note: No testing for HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C is required unless mandated by&#xD;

             measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid&#xD;
             vaccine. The use of the inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
