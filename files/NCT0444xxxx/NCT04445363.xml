      In phase I of this study, a multi-center, randomized, placebo parallel control design was&#xD;
      adopted. Enrolled subjects were randomly assigned to the experimental group or the placebo&#xD;
      group.A total of 40 subjects are expected to be enrolled in about 4 centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase II of this study, a multi-center, randomized, double-blind parallel,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled design was adopted. Enrolled subjects were randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      experimental group or the placebo group.About 120 subjects are expected to be enrolled in&#xD;
      about 10 centers.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>In phase I of this study, Forty enrolled subjects were randomly assigned to four groups at 1:1:1:1. (1) concentration of 0.5%, twice daily (Bid) group; (2) concentration of 1.5%, bid group; (3) concentration of 2.5%, oncedaily(Qd) group; (4) concentration of 2.5%, bid group.Ten subjects in each group were randomly assigned to receive jacatinib hydrochloride cream (8 cases) and placebo (2 cases) at 4:1, respectively,The duration of administration was 24 weeks.&#xD;
In phase II of this trial, 120Enrolled subjects are randomly assigned to 3 groups (placebo bid group,concentration of 1.5% bid group and concentration of 2.5% bid group).</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving 90% Improvement of Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT90)</measure>
    <time_frame>at week 24</time_frame>
    <description>SALT is a quantitative assessment of alopecia areata (AA) severity based on the scalp hair loss. A SALT 90 response is a 90% or greater reduction from baseline in SALT score. The SALT score can vary from 0 to 100%, with higher scores representing increasing severity of disease.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, at week 12 and at week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of Alopecia Tool Score (SALT) calculation is based on a scoring system. The scalp is divided into the following 4 areas: 1) Vertex: 40% (0.4) of scalp surface area, 2) Right profile of scalp: 18% (0.18) of scalp surface area, 3) Left profile of scalp: 18% (0.18) of scalp surface area, and 4) Posterior aspect of scalp: 24% (0.24) of scalp surface area. The percentage of hair loss in any of these areas is the percentage hair loss multiplied by percent surface area of the scalp in that area. The SALT score is the sum of percentage of hair loss in all the above-mentioned areas, so a lower number indicates a better outcome. The reported SALT score range is from a minimum of 0 (no hair loss) to a maximum of 100 (100% hair loss).</description>
