      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Evaluate changes in skin barrier function with transepidermal water loss (TEWL) assessed&#xD;
      after skin tape stripping (STS) in pre-defined lesional skin in patients with moderate to&#xD;
      severe atopic dermatitis (AD) treated with dupilumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate changes in skin barrier function with TEWL assessed after STS in pre-defined&#xD;
           lesional and non-lesional skin in patients with moderate to severe AD treated with&#xD;
           dupilumab in reference to normal skin of healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate time course of skin barrier function with TEWL assessed before and after STS in&#xD;
           pre-defined lesional and non-lesional skin in patients with moderate to severe AD&#xD;
           treated with dupilumab in reference to normal skin of healthy volunteers&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Willing to refrain from applying any topical medication products on the target&#xD;
             assessment areas (including lesional and non-lesional) throughout the study unless&#xD;
             necessary to alleviate intolerable symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to refrain taking showers or soaking in a bathtub with soaps and body washes&#xD;
             within 6 hours before TEWL assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to apply Cetaphil or Vanicream moisturizer up to twice a day with an exception&#xD;
             of moisturizer application on the targeted assessment areas (lesional and non-lesional&#xD;
             areas) during the entire study from Day -7 to end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to comply with all clinic visits and study-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age and gender matched to a selected AD patient. Adolescents aged 12 to 17 years will&#xD;
             be matched by post puberty status, and adults aged 18 to 65 years will be matched by&#xD;
             age as close as possible within 10 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No current dermatologic or systemic condition that could interfere with the&#xD;
             assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraceptive use by women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the&#xD;
             methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of understanding and giving signed informed consent/assent as will be&#xD;
             described in the protocol, which includes compliance with the requirements and&#xD;
             restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF) and in this protocol. For&#xD;
             adolescents ≥12 and &lt;18 years of age a specific ICF must also be signed by the&#xD;
             participant's legally authorized representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Skin conditions other than AD that can confound assessments in the area of TEWL&#xD;
             assessments in the opinion of the investigator (ie, skin atrophy, ichthyosis,&#xD;
             Netherton syndrome, severe photo damage).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cracked, crusted, oozing, or bleeding AD lesions in the designated lesional assessment&#xD;
             area leaving insufficient skin that is adequate for TEWL assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of dupilumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ocular disorder that in the opinion of the investigator could adversely affect the&#xD;
             individual's risk for study participation. Examples include -but are not limited to-&#xD;
             individuals with a history of active cases of herpes keratitis; Sjogren's syndrome,&#xD;
             keratoconjunctivitis sicca or dry eye syndrome that require daily use of supplemental&#xD;
             lubrication; or individuals with ocular conditions that require the use of ocular&#xD;
             corticosteroids or cyclosporine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic AD treatment or phototherapy within 4 weeks of baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Topical AD treatment within 1 week of baseline. Face and neck may be treated with&#xD;
             topical steroids during the washout period if approved by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe concomitant illness(es) that, in the investigator's judgment, would adversely&#xD;
             affect the patient's participation in the study. Examples include, but are not limited&#xD;
             to patients with short life expectancy, patients with uncontrolled diabetes&#xD;
             (hemoglobin A1c ≥9%), patients with cardiovascular conditions (eg, Class III or IV&#xD;
             cardiac failure according to the New York Heart Association classification), severe&#xD;
             renal conditions (eg, patients on dialysis), hepato-biliary conditions (eg, Child-Pugh&#xD;
             class B or C), neurological conditions (eg, demyelinating diseases), active major&#xD;
             autoimmune diseases (eg, lupus, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis,&#xD;
             etc), other severe endocrinological, gastrointestinal, metabolic, pulmonary,&#xD;
             psychiatric (known suicidal intentions) or lymphatic diseases. The specific&#xD;
             justification for patients excluded under this criterion will be noted in study&#xD;
             documents (chart notes, electronic case report forms [eCRF], screening logs, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity reaction to tape or adhesives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 8 weeks or within 5 half-lives (if&#xD;
             known) prior to Day 1, whichever is longer.&#xD;

          -  Current participation in another investigational clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals accommodated in an institution because of regulatory or legal order;&#xD;
             prisoners or subjects who are legally institutionalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants are dependent on the Sponsor or Investigator (in conjunction with section&#xD;
             1.61 of the ICH-GCP Ordinance E6).&#xD;
