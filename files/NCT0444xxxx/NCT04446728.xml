  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis and treatment of pediatric cancer adversely affects multiple levels of the&#xD;
      social ecology, including patient and caregiver physical and psychosocial health. It is the&#xD;
      strong recommendation from the first Standard of the Psychosocial Standards of Care in&#xD;
      Pediatric Cancer that cancer centers engage in universal, systematic, psychosocial risk&#xD;
      screening for newly diagnosed patients and their families. Universal screening at diagnosis&#xD;
      fosters early identification of psychosocial risks and provides the opportunity to match&#xD;
      psychosocial care to the level of family need for more equitable, effective and integrated&#xD;
      services. However, few programs offer such care in an efficient, comprehensive, and&#xD;
      consistent manner, potentially resulting in insufficient care that magnifies inequities in&#xD;
      outcomes. To support pediatric cancer centers in their goal of meeting the first Standard of&#xD;
      Psychosocial Care, this study will compare two implementation strategies for the Psychosocial&#xD;
      Assessment Tool (PAT), a validated parent report screener of family psychosocial risk in&#xD;
      English and Spanish, in a cluster randomized trial across 18 pediatric cancer programs in the&#xD;
      United States.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Childhood cancer affects multiple levels of the social ecology, including social&#xD;
      determinants of health (e.g. financial and resource issues, child and family problems). The&#xD;
      2015 Standards of Psychosocial Care in Pediatric Cancer outline optimal psychosocial care,&#xD;
      starting with a standard devoted to assessment of psychosocial healthcare needs. The&#xD;
      Psychosocial Assessment Tool (PAT) is a validated family psychosocial risk screener now ready&#xD;
      for broad implementation. Method: The PAT will be implemented across a national sample of 18&#xD;
      pediatric cancer programs in a comparative effectiveness study, guided by the Interactive&#xD;
      Systems Framework for Dissemination and Implementation, comparing two Strategies. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that implementation will be more successful at the patient/family, provider, and&#xD;
      institutional level when Training (Strategy I) is combined with Implementation Expanded&#xD;
      Resources (Strategy II). The trial will be informed by input from Stakeholders and will&#xD;
      result in a web-based Toolkit for dissemination nationally. Sites will be randomized to&#xD;
      cohort (one of three years) and strategy (Strategy I, II) for the trial. Outcomes include&#xD;
      adoption and penetration of screening (patient/family), staff job satisfaction/burnout&#xD;
      (provider), and cost effective use of resources consistent with family risk (institution).&#xD;
      Discussion Use of the PAT across children's cancer programs nationally can achieve the&#xD;
      assessment Standard and deliver psychosocial care matched to family need for all patients,&#xD;
      especially those most impacted by health inequities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the Interactive Systems Framework for Dissemination and Implementation (ISF), this&#xD;
      study is a comparative effectiveness trial of the two strategies at 18 childhood cancer&#xD;
      centers of three sizes based on new patients per year, examining family (penetration, health&#xD;
      equity), provider (feasibility, acceptability, burnout and job satisfaction), and institution&#xD;
      (adoption, sustainability, costs) implementation outcomes.7 Sites will be randomized to time&#xD;
      of implementation (three cohorts) and Strategy (two - I, II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim. Compare the two theoretically based and empirically informed strategies to implement the&#xD;
      PAT in English and Spanish using a cluster randomized controlled trial. Compared to Training:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1. At the patient/family level, TIER will be associated with: a) a higher proportion of&#xD;
      families of newly diagnosed children screened and provided with feedback (penetration); and&#xD;
      b) higher rates of screening for ethnic minority and socioeconomically diverse families&#xD;
      (health equity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2. At the provider level, TIER will be: a) more feasible and rated as appropriate and&#xD;
      acceptable; b) associated with greater engagement in addressing health disparities; and c)&#xD;
      associated with less burnout and better job satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3. At the institution level, TIER will be associated with: a) a higher rate of site&#xD;
      participation (adoption), b) more positive perceptions of implementation benefits and fewer&#xD;
      challenges (sustainability); and c) psychosocial care better matched to need demonstrating a&#xD;
      more equitable distribution of services and costs of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All sites, regardless of randomization to Strategy I or II, will participate in a 3-hour&#xD;
      professionally prepared internet based learning session (webinar) at the beginning of their&#xD;
      cohort. Each site PI, all staff who will be directly involved in screening, and the research&#xD;
      coordinator will participate. For sites randomized to Strategy II, the Champion will also&#xD;
      attend. The investigators will work with sites to identify the team that will participate in&#xD;
      screening and the Champion (in TIER) (&quot;individuals who dedicate themselves to supporting,&#xD;
      marketing, and driving through an implementation, overcoming indifference or resistance that&#xD;
      the intervention may encounter in an organization&quot;), recognizing that these determinations&#xD;
      will vary across programs. The webinar will be professionally prepared to be engaging and&#xD;
      effective as an educational approach with resource materials provided (Develop Educational&#xD;
      Materials, Distribute Educational Materials).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training webinar will include all information necessary to access the web-based PAT.&#xD;
      Sites will be provided with a User Agreement, user manual, and access to the password&#xD;
      protected site. The completed PAT is scored immediately and a summary of the score and&#xD;
      clinical concerns identified is sent. Only de-identified data will be transmitted to the&#xD;
      study data core. Sites will be supported in the technical aspects of the implementation&#xD;
      related to using the web-based forms (Centralize Technical Assistance). If any pattern of&#xD;
      problems with technical aspects of implementation is identified, the study staff will&#xD;
      communicate with sites promptly. During training, each site PI and staff involved in&#xD;
      screening will develop a specific implementation plan, describing who will implement the PAT,&#xD;
      who will be screened, where results will be stored, how results will be communicated and how&#xD;
      results will be used (Develop a Formal Implementation Blueprint). For TIER, the Plan includes&#xD;
      questions about the Champion and the Consultation Calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategy I. For sites randomized to Strategy I (Training), the webinar is the implementation&#xD;
      condition. Sites will also receive technology support, as needed, throughout the one-year&#xD;
      implementation period. These strategies correspond to implementation strategies: creating a&#xD;
      structure for implementation including creating implementation teams, developing an&#xD;
      implementation plan.2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategy II. Strategy II, Training + Implementation Expanded Resources (TIER), includes the&#xD;
      same webinar and technical support as in Strategy I with the addition of two evidence-based&#xD;
      resources that may improve implementation (as finalized from analysis of Aim 1 interviews).&#xD;
      The Site PI and center staff conducting screening will participate in a monthly one-hour PAT&#xD;
      Implementation Consultation Call (Provide Ongoing Consultation, Create a Learning&#xD;
      Collaborative). The group format of this strategy is intended to foster group problem-solving&#xD;
      about common issues in implementation and provide peer support for those implementing the&#xD;
      PAT. The data regarding implementation progress and challenges from the calls will be&#xD;
      addressed in subsequent calls and will be considered in the development of the Toolkit.&#xD;
      Second, sites will identify a Champion for PAT implementation (Identify and Prepare&#xD;
      Champions), most likely be a division chief, nurse in a leadership role, or clinical&#xD;
      administrator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Patient/Family level the following data for the English and Spanish versions of the&#xD;
      PAT will be reported monthly: new patients meeting eligibility requirements as outlined on&#xD;
      the PAT Implementation Plan (n); patients with documentation of PAT screening (n); patients&#xD;
      with evidence of family feedback letter (n); demographic data (race, ethnicity, zip code,&#xD;
      insurance). As part of the PAT Implementation Plan, the Site PI and Coordinator will&#xD;
      determine institution-specific ways to identify new patients and their demographic&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Provider level the Site PI and staff identified as screeners will complete self-report&#xD;
      measures at baseline and at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are four outcomes at the Institution level. The first outcome is adoption, or the&#xD;
      intention of sites to use the PAT, by examining the site participation rate. To evaluate the&#xD;
      extent to which screening is perceived as an asset to the institution electronic health&#xD;
      record data (EHR) data will be extracted and aggregated at the site level for each family at&#xD;
      30, 60 and 90 days after screening. It provides a sum of hospital based services and external&#xD;
      referrals and the number and length of inpatient and outpatient visits, missed appointments&#xD;
      and evidence of non-adherence or difficulties in delivering care, allowing determination of&#xD;
      healthcare utilization or medical services delivered. Cost will be assessed to understand the&#xD;
      relationship among PAT risk level, psychosocial services provided, and aspects of medical&#xD;
      care that may reflect unnecessary or inefficient services. Because the care provided may be&#xD;
      related to the intensity of medical treatment, the Intensity of Treatment Scale will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1. ANOVA will compare the effectiveness of the two implementation strategies on penetration&#xD;
      and health equity. The outcomes are proportions: families screened/families eligible,&#xD;
      families provided feedback/families screened, ethnic minority families screened/ethnic&#xD;
      minority families eligible, low socioeconomic status (SES) families screened/low SES families&#xD;
      eligible. Interclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) among the clusters will be calculated and&#xD;
      used to adjust for the cluster effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2. Three sets of outcome variables - perception of implementation, engagement in addressing&#xD;
      health disparities, and burnout/job satisfaction - will be tested. A two group analysis with&#xD;
      the framework of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) will be conducted to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the two strategies. To test the effect of time (T1, T2, T3), latent growth&#xD;
      curve analysis will be conducted; it is expected that provider outcomes will improve over&#xD;
      time. Analyses will be performed using Mplus 5.0 with ML estimation for outcome variables&#xD;
      that meet the distribution assumptions, and with Robust Least Weighted Squares (WLSMV)&#xD;
      estimation for outcome variables that do not. Potential mediating effects of favorable&#xD;
      perception of implementation on provider job satisfaction and burnout will be examined using&#xD;
      mediation models. TIER is expected to be associated with more favorable perceptions of&#xD;
      implementation, which in turn will lead to less burnout and higher job satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3. At the institution level adoption of the PAT will be measured by a ratio of sites that&#xD;
      initiate implementation/sites that agreed (H3a). If substitutions are necessary, sites that&#xD;
      are newly invited will be added to the denominator and adoption calculated by total&#xD;
      acceptances/total invited. ANOVA will be conducted to compare the effectiveness of the two&#xD;
      strategies. For H3b sustainability (PIQ perceptions of implementation benefits and&#xD;
      challenges), ANOVA will be conducted to compare the effectiveness of the two strategies on&#xD;
      benefits and challenges. For H3c the interest is in the extent to which psychosocial care is&#xD;
      matched to need and the extent to which intensive medical and psychosocial services are&#xD;
      delivered for those most in need. There has not yet been established a cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      threshold or criterion to which to compare costs of screening with these two implementation&#xD;
      strategies, necessitating our consideration of valued outcomes in the psychosocial screening&#xD;
      literature and resources available. ANOVA will be conducted to test whether psychosocial care&#xD;
      is matched with levels of psychosocial risks, resulting in a 2 (Strategy) x 3 (psychosocial&#xD;
      risks: clinical, targeted, universal) design on distribution of services and costs of care.&#xD;
      It is expected that the 3 levels of the Pediatric Psychosocial Preventative Health Model&#xD;
      (PPPHM) will be related to number and costs of services provided as measured on the&#xD;
      Psychosocial Services and Medical Treatment Checklist (PSMTC). Additional analyses will be&#xD;
      conducted to compare English speaking and Spanish speaking families, different ethnicity,&#xD;
      race, and SES and insurance status on the outcome variables.&#xD;
