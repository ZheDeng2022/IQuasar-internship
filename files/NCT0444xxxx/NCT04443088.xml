      Phase 1, open-label dose-escalation study to determine the MTD and RP2D, and to assess the&#xD;
      DLT of INV-1120 (also referred to as investigational product or IP). The safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and PK of INV-1120 will be assessed in adult patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors. Increasing doses of INV-1120 will be administered to cohorts of 3-6 participants,&#xD;
      until the MTD or MAD is reached. The MTD will generally be considered as the RP2D. However,&#xD;
      the RP2D may also be determined based on the data of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      biomarkers in blood and the preliminary clinical activity of INV-1120, as well as the&#xD;
      incidence rate and nature of the toxicities observed in subsequent cycles beyond Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total number of patients enrolled in the study will depend upon the number of&#xD;
      dose-escalation cohorts. It is estimated that approximately 36 evaluable patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the dose-escalation part of this study. This multicenter study will be conducted&#xD;
      in the United States.&#xD;

Three to six patients will be enrolled per cohort to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics for each dose level. After the last patient in each cohort completes Cycle 1 (DLT observation period of 28 days), the Safety Evaluation Team (SET) will evaluate the safety data and pharmacokinetic collected from Cycle 1, and make the decision whether to escalate the dose before opening the second cohort.</description>
