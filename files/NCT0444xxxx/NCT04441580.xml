  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even if colonoscopy is considered the reference standard for the detection of colonic&#xD;
      neoplasia, polyps are still missed. The risk of early post-colonoscopy cancer appeared to be&#xD;
      independently predicted by a relatively low polyp/adenoma detection rate. When considering&#xD;
      the very high prevalence of advanced neoplasia in the FIT-positive enriched population, the&#xD;
      risk of post-colonoscopy interval cancer due to a suboptimal quality of colonoscopy may be&#xD;
      substantial. Available evidence justifies therefore the implementation of efforts aimed at&#xD;
      improving adenoma detection rate, based on retraining interventions and on the adoption of&#xD;
      innovative technologies, designed to enhance the accuracy of the endoscopic examination.&#xD;
      Artificial intelligence seems to improve the quality of medical diagnosis and treatment. In&#xD;
      the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy, two potential roles of AI in colonoscopy have been&#xD;
      examined so far: automated polyp detection (CADe) and automated polyp histology&#xD;
      characterization (CADx). CADe can minimize the probability of missing a polyp during&#xD;
      colonoscopy, thereby improving the adenoma detection rate (ADR) and potentially decreasing&#xD;
      the incidence of interval cancer. GI Genius is the AI software that will be used in the&#xD;
      present trial and is intended to be used as an adjunct to colonic endoscopy procedures to&#xD;
      help endoscopists to detect in real time mucosal lesions (such as polyps and adenomas,&#xD;
      including those with flat (non-polypoid) morphology) during standard screening and&#xD;
      surveillance endoscopic mucosal evaluations. It is not intended to replace histopathological&#xD;
      sampling as a means of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study was to compare the diagnostic yield obtained by using CADe&#xD;
      colonoscopy to the yield obtained by the standard colonoscopy (SC).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Even if colonoscopy is considered the reference standard for the detection of colonic&#xD;
      neoplasia, polyps are still missed. In large administrative cohort or case-control studies,&#xD;
      the risk of early post-colonoscopy cancer appeared to be independently predicted by a&#xD;
      relatively low polyp/adenoma detection rate. The adenoma detection rate among different&#xD;
      endoscopists has been shown to be strictly related with the risk of post-colonoscopy interval&#xD;
      cancer. When considering the very high prevalence of advanced neoplasia in the FIT-positive&#xD;
      enriched population, the risk of post-colonoscopy interval cancer due to a suboptimal quality&#xD;
      of colonoscopy may be substantial. Available evidence justifies therefore the implementation&#xD;
      of efforts aimed at improving adenoma detection rate, based on retraining interventions and&#xD;
      on the adoption of innovative technologies, designed to enhance the accuracy of the&#xD;
      endoscopic examination.Nowadays, Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining increased attention&#xD;
      and investigation, since it seems to improve the quality of medical diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;
      In the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy, two potential roles of AI in colonoscopy have&#xD;
      been examined so far: automated polyp detection (CADe) and automated polyp histology&#xD;
      characterization (CADx). CADe can minimize the probability of missing a polyp during&#xD;
      colonoscopy, thereby improving the adenoma detection rate (ADR) and potentially decreasing&#xD;
      the incidence of interval cancer. GI Genius is the AI software that will be used in the&#xD;
      present trial. The software is developed by Medtronic Inc. (Dublin, Ireland) and is intended&#xD;
      to be used as an adjunct to colonic endoscopy procedures to help endoscopists to detect in&#xD;
      real time mucosal lesions (such as polyps and adenomas, including those with flat&#xD;
      (non-polypoid) morphology) during standard screening and surveillance endoscopic mucosal&#xD;
      evaluations. It is not intended to replace histopathological sampling as a means of&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study was to compare the diagnostic yield obtained by using CADe&#xD;
      colonoscopy to the yield obtained by the standard colonoscopy (SC). As the risk of&#xD;
      progression is higher for large than for small adenomas the specific contribution of the new&#xD;
      technique in reducing the miss rate of large neoplasms represents an important outcome to be&#xD;
      assessed in the study. In addition, given the suggested association of a higher miss-rate of&#xD;
      serrated and flat lesions with an increased risk of early post-colonoscopy CRC, the benefit&#xD;
      of the new technique in reducing the miss rate of these lesions will be assessed.&#xD;
