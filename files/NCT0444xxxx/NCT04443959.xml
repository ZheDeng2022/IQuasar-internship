  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over half of pregnant and postpartum women experience clinical insomnia. However, treatment&#xD;
      options are very limited for pregnant women and moms of newborns. Sleep aids are not&#xD;
      considered safe during pregnancy and may increase risks about safety for mom and baby during&#xD;
      postpartum. Recent clinical trials show that behavioral and mindfulness-based treatments can&#xD;
      safely improve sleep and mood during pregnancy. Yet, no published studies to date have&#xD;
      combined behavioral sleep treatment with mindfulness-based stress reduction to improve sleep&#xD;
      and mood at the same time in pregnant and postpartum women. This study is the first to&#xD;
      combine behavioral sleep strategies with mindfulness-meditation to improve sleep and&#xD;
      psychological wellbeing of expecting and new moms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to examine the effectiveness of online&#xD;
      mindfulness-based therapy for insomnia (MBTI) to improve sleep and mood as well as reduce&#xD;
      stress in pregnant and postpartum women. The online MBTI treatment will be assisted by a&#xD;
      psychologist who will check in with participants throughout treatment in pregnancy and after&#xD;
      childbirth to help them sleep and feel better.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open-label trial is to determine the efficacy of and patient engagement&#xD;
      in online mindfulness-based therapy for insomnia (MBTI). The investigators' long-term goal is&#xD;
      to improve sleep and mood of expecting and new mothers. Over half of pregnant women develop&#xD;
      insomnia, which is associated with high rates of depression during pregnancy and postpartum.&#xD;
      By successfully treating insomnia during pregnancy and improving cognitive-emotion&#xD;
      regulation, mental health of pregnant women and new moms may be greatly improved. In a prior&#xD;
      clinical trial, Dr. Kalmbach (PI) showed that online cognitive-behavioral therapy for&#xD;
      insomnia (CBTI) greatly improved sleep during pregnancy, and offered some protection against&#xD;
      sleep problems after childbirth. Women in this trial were highly satisfied with CBTI and&#xD;
      especially its online delivery. However, the investigators identified important shortcomings&#xD;
      of online CBTI in this population. Namely, patients provided feedback that reducing cognitive&#xD;
      arousal (ie ruminative or worrisome thinking) was an important therapeutic target, that more&#xD;
      mindfulness-based approaches and strategies would improve treatment, and that greater&#xD;
      emphasis on maternal and infant sleep would also enhance the treatment experience. Thus, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct an open label trial to collect pilot data on the efficacy of&#xD;
      digital mindfulness-based therapy for insomnia (MBTI) that has been tailored for pregnant and&#xD;
      postpartum women. Specifically, the investigators will conduct this open-label trial of 50&#xD;
      pregnant women to preliminary test the efficacy, patient adherence, patient engagement, and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction with this online MBTI program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open-label trial will enroll 50 pregnant women (gestational age 18-30 weeks at study&#xD;
      entry) who will receive 6 sessions of MBTI through the online program 'A Mindful Way to&#xD;
      Healthy Sleep' (https://amindfulway.com.au/). Patients will complete this treatment during&#xD;
      pregnancy. This program was based on Dr. Jason Ong's Mindfulness-Based Therapy for Insomnia,&#xD;
      which combined CBTI and mindfulness meditation, and it has been tailored for perinatal women.&#xD;
      The investigators will assess study outcomes before treatment, after treatment, 1 month after&#xD;
      childbirth, and 3 months after childbirth. Study outcomes will include insomnia symptoms,&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, and cognitive arousal. The investigators will also assess patient&#xD;
      engagement (number of completed sessions, homework adherence) and collect patient feedback&#xD;
      (e.g., treatment satisfaction).&#xD;

    <description>The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is a commonly used self-report measure of insomnia symptoms that has been validated for use in community samples and clinical trials. The ISI scores range from 0-28, with a higher score indicating a greater severity of insomnia. ISI scores &lt; 8 after treatment indicate remission.</description>
