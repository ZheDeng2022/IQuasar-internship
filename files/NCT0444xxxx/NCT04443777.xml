      This study have like aim to examine whether insulin secretagogues have a potential ergogenic&#xD;
      effect leading to a better exercise performance and post-exercise recovery in healthy&#xD;
      individuals after a resistance training session. METHODS: This is a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, clinical trial. The sample will consist of 44 men. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated (block randomization, www.randomizer.org) to the following groups: placebo&#xD;
      (PFG, n=22) and sulphonylurea (GFS, n=22). The study will consist of 3 visits 7 days apart.&#xD;
      On visit 1 the participants will ask to sign an informed consent form and will carry out&#xD;
      medical evaluation with anthropometric assessment. At that visit they will perform a&#xD;
      one-repetition maximum test of the upper limbs by using the horizontal bench press and of the&#xD;
      lower limbs by using the 45º leg press. On visit 2, they will perform a second round of&#xD;
      similar 1-RM tests to determine workloads for the study session [sulphonylurea (gliclazide)&#xD;
      vs. placebo]. The experimental exercise session will be held on visits 3. Gliclazide modified&#xD;
      release 60 mg (Diamicron® MR) or placebo (starch, sodium lauryl sulfate and Aerosil) will be&#xD;
      orally administered as matched capsules (same color, flavor, smell and size) 8 hours before&#xD;
      the beginning of exercise session, double-blind. In the experimental session, first, warm-up&#xD;
      on the bench press and leg press, both with workload at 50% of 1-RM will be carried out.&#xD;
      After a 2-minute rest, the resistance training session will be started. It will consist of 4&#xD;
      sets of bench press and leg press exercises at 65% of 1-RM with maximum repetitions until&#xD;
      concentric failure. The bench press exercises will be followed by the leg press exercises&#xD;
      with no interval between them. A 2-minute interval will allowed after each series of&#xD;
      exercises. Measurements for heart rate (HR) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for Pain will be&#xD;
      taken before, between each series of exercises and 24 and 48 hours after session. Venous&#xD;
      blood samples will be obtained before, immediately after, 24 and 48 hours after, for&#xD;
      determining serum levels of creatine kinase isoenzyme MM and lactate dehydrogenase. Capillary&#xD;
      blood for glucose determination will be collected from the digital pulp using a glucometer&#xD;
      before and immediately after. Resistance training volume will be calculated for each type of&#xD;
      exercise as well as total training volume for each session as a product of exercise workload&#xD;
      and number of series and repetitions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of performance-enhancing drugs is a major area of concern for high-performance&#xD;
      athletes because it may lead to serious health problems. It is also quite concerning that&#xD;
      these substances are also widely used without guidance among non-athletes for faster results&#xD;
      and aesthetic reasons. Several substances used for doping in sports have well-established&#xD;
      ergogenic and side effects. Studies have shown that insulin is used for its anabolic effects&#xD;
      mostly among recreational and professional weightlifters and bodybuilders. Currently, insulin&#xD;
      and its analogs are on the WADA list of prohibited substances for their anabolic effects&#xD;
      mostly in muscle tissues and side effects. However, a class of drugs known as insulin&#xD;
      secretagogues are used by some athletes to enhance performance. Few studies have examined the&#xD;
      potential effects of insulin secretagogues, especially sulfonylureas, on exercise performance&#xD;
      and post-exercise recovery among athletes as well as their potential side effects. Despite&#xD;
      insufficient data supporting the use of insulin secretagogues as ergogenic supplement well as&#xD;
      well its associated risks, these substances have been empirically used for both, acute and&#xD;
      chronic effects among professional athletes and non-athletes. Thus, the present study have&#xD;
      like aim to examine whether insulin secretagogues have a potential ergogenic effect leading&#xD;
      to a better exercise performance and post-exercise recovery in healthy individuals after a&#xD;
      resistance training session. METHODS: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      clinical trial. The sample will consist of 44 men, young adults, healthy and experienced in&#xD;
      strength training and who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria specified. The sample&#xD;
      calculation was determined by a pilot study conducted with 10 subjects, with strength&#xD;
      performance as the primary outcome, using drug (Gliclazide) or placebo, taking into account a&#xD;
      statistical power of 95% and a significance level of 5%. For this purpose, the GPower 3.1was&#xD;
      used. Subjects will be randomly allocated (block randomization, www.randomizer.org) to the&#xD;
      following groups: placebo (PFG, n=22) and sulphonylurea (GFS, n=22). The study will consist&#xD;
      of 3 visits 7 days apart. On visit 1 the participants will ask to sign an informed consent&#xD;
      form and will carry out medical evaluation with anthropometric assessment. At that visit they&#xD;
      will perform a one-repetition maximum test of the upper limbs by using the horizontal bench&#xD;
      press and of the lower limbs by using the 45º leg press. On visit 2, they will perform a&#xD;
      second round of similar 1-RM tests to determine workloads for the study sessions&#xD;
      [sulphonylurea (gliclazide) vs. placebo]. The experimental exercise session will be held on&#xD;
      visit 3. The participants will ask to follow a personalized food intake plan prescribed by a&#xD;
      skilled provider in the 24 hours proceeding both sessions. Gliclazide modified release (MR)&#xD;
      or placebo will be orally administered as matched capsules (same color, flavor, smell and&#xD;
      size) 8 hours before the beginning of exercise session. Gliclazide 60 mg (Diamicron® MR) or&#xD;
      placebo (starch, sodium lauryl sulfate and Aerosil) will administered double-blind. Upon&#xD;
      arrival at the study site, the participants will consum a pre-workout snack. The experimental&#xD;
      protocol will start 30 minutes later. First, warm-up on the bench press and leg press, both&#xD;
      with workload at 50% of 1-RM wil be carried out. After a 2-minute rest, the resistance&#xD;
      training session will be started. It will consist of 4 sets of bench press and leg press&#xD;
      exercises at 65% of 1-RM with maximum repetitions until concentric failure, with the&#xD;
      execution speed of 2x2. The bench press exercises will be followed by the leg press exercises&#xD;
      with no interval between them. A 2-minute interval will allowed after each series of&#xD;
      exercises. Measurements for heart rate (HR) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for Pain will be&#xD;
      taken before, between each series of exercises and 24 and 48 hours after session. Venous&#xD;
      blood samples will be obtained before, immediately after, 24 and 48 hours after session for&#xD;
      determining serum levels of creatine kinase isoenzyme MM and lactate dehydrogenase using a&#xD;
      colorimetric enzymatic assay. Capillary blood for glucose determination will be collected&#xD;
      from the digital pulp using a glucometer before and immediately after session. At the end of&#xD;
      exercise session, a custom will be offered to prevent potential hypoglycemic events.&#xD;
      Resistance training volume will be calculated for each type of exercise as well as total&#xD;
      training volume for each session as a product of exercise workload and number of series and&#xD;
      repetitions. The data will be present as means ± standard deviation (SD). Repeated measures&#xD;
      ANOVA Two Way using Bonferroni post-hoc tests will be used for comparisons between the study&#xD;
      drug and placebo over time. All data analyses will be carried out using SPSS 23.0 at a&#xD;
      significance level of p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
