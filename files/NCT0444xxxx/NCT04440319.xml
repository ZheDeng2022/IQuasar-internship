    <textblock>
      T2DM in Indonesia has increased dramatically from 7.0% in 2017 to 10.9% in 2018. In Padang,&#xD;
      West Sumatra, diabetes prevalence was 1.3% in 2013 and increased slowly in 2018. Majority of&#xD;
      T2DM were not able to achieve optimal glycaemic glucose control measured using HbA1c with a&#xD;
      target of less than &lt; 6.5% based on WHO recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem Statement NCD guidelines provided management DM in general. Pedoman Gizi Seimbang was&#xD;
      for healthy people. It is crucial to update the guideline following the current issues even&#xD;
      the Indonesian consensus in 2015 provided a T2DM management diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypotheses There is a significant difference in glycemic control (HbA1c and FBG)&#xD;
      nutritional status, knowledge, attitude, practice, quality of life, acceptability and&#xD;
      adherence behavior among individuals with T2DM in intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Subjects will be divided into Intervention and control groups after they finished&#xD;
      reading, signed a letter of agreement and informed consent. Subjects also have the right to&#xD;
      be withdrawn after listening explanation of the investigators to seeking the potential&#xD;
      participants based on inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individual with T2DM (intervention group) will follow the Diabetes Mellitus Nutrition&#xD;
      Education (DNE) program based on the curriculum of DNE modules properly and certain&#xD;
      measurements. There is a selected nutritionist at each PHC who will convey the DNE program.&#xD;
      DM nutrition education counseling will be delivered every week for 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual with T2DM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline An individual with T2DM will be asked to fill the questionnaire and follow all&#xD;
           of the measurements (Nutritional Status, Biochemical, Clinical, and Dietary Intake).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention (3 months) All of the subjects will follow the DM Nutrition Education&#xD;
           program for 3 months which will be delivered by nutritionists in PHC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow up (3 months) All of the subjects will continue the program independently in 3&#xD;
           months. Then, the subjects will do the same activity as a baseline to compare the data&#xD;
           between baselines, intervention and follow up Control The individual with T2DM in the&#xD;
           control group will still follow the conventional DM nutrition education. After the DNE&#xD;
           program finished, the material will also be distributed to the individual with T2DM in&#xD;
           the control group.&#xD;

      Phase I: Needs Assessment Research Design This is a descriptive statistics study and the aims&#xD;
      are to determine the current practice of managing diabetes mellitus among nutritionists. The&#xD;
      need for having DM nutrition education among individual with T2DM will be conducted following&#xD;
      Cross-sectional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects The need assessment will be conducted among all nutritionists at all PHC and&#xD;
      individual with T2DM at selected PHC at Padang city.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling The nutritionists will be recruited at all of PHC in Padang City and there are 50&#xD;
      nutritionists. PHC will be recruited using multiple random sampling among districts. Then,&#xD;
      individual with T2DM will be selected using simple random sampling among selected PHC. One&#xD;
      PHC will be selected at each district. Regarding sample size calculation use HbA1c Standard&#xD;
      Deviation, the subjects can be gained, are 158. Therefore, 158 subjects are divided into 11&#xD;
      Districts. There are 12 T2DM patients that will be selected each selected PHC in every&#xD;
      district using Random Block. Subjects will be selected following visiting individual with&#xD;
      T2DM at PHC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at all Public Health Center (PHC) in Padang City. An individual&#xD;
      with T2DM will be selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, multiply random&#xD;
      sampling following a city (Padang), simple random sampling in every district and PHC. One PHC&#xD;
      will be selected in every district following the highest number of T2DM patients in each&#xD;
      district.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics will be used to examine socio-demographic and&#xD;
      current management among nutritionists. The need DM nutrition education among individual with&#xD;
      T2DM data, the mean and Standard Deviation (SD) will be calculated for normally distributed&#xD;
      continuous variables and frequency (f) and percentage (%) for nominal variables. Pearson's&#xD;
      chi-square test will be used to examine independent variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection A Google form questionnaire will be developed and be done pre-test among&#xD;
      nutritionists perspective. Pre-test questionnaires will be start at PHC outside Padang.&#xD;
      Subjects will be taken 10 nutritionists at selected PHC. The items are Socio-demographic&#xD;
      characteristics, Management of diabetes at PHC, Nutritional status measurement, DM education&#xD;
      tools, current practice management T2DM, the need DM nutrition education, and DM of&#xD;
      knowledge-attitude-practice level. The questionnaire will be distributed to all nutritionists&#xD;
      using media social (what application). Data will be key in using the latest SPSS version.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A set questionnaire will be developed among individual with T2DM perspective to determine the&#xD;
      need DM nutrition education at PHC. The questionnaire will be tested (pre-test) following&#xD;
      selected subjects (10%) at a selected PHC in Padang. A selected PHC is different with 11 PHC&#xD;
      that had been selected as simple random sampling accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Development and Assessment Module&#xD;
&#xD;
      The module should be assessed following five expert panel review. Five expert panel reviews&#xD;
      will assess the module using a set questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The validity is to assess how well the idea of a theoretical construct is represented in a&#xD;
      questionnaire. A good module should be analysed regarding the reliability and validity&#xD;
      process that is a crucial part of a quantitative research inquiry. Therefore, the result can&#xD;
      be studied on construct validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Face validity refers to researchers' subjective assessments of the presentation and relevance&#xD;
      of the measuring instrument as to whether the items in the instrument appear to be relevant,&#xD;
      reasonable, unambiguous and clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Content validity refers to whether the content of the questions or items measured in the&#xD;
      instrument is representative and adequate when attempting to measure phenomena.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Construct validity is an important part of content validity which provides evidence of the&#xD;
      degree of aspects and covariance. Hence, it can be representative of the targeted construct&#xD;
      module.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The developing module will be continued with the assessment of the module. Actually, there&#xD;
      were no decisions for the number maximum of expert panel review, however, at least five&#xD;
      Experts panel will be evaluated and assessed the module. Expert panel reviews are Indonesian&#xD;
      nutritionists, dietitians, researchers who are experts in nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the content domain, the qualitative research method used a semi-structured&#xD;
      in-depth interview with five expert panel reviews. The module should have content five items;&#xD;
      module should reach population target, module content should be implemented precisely, the&#xD;
      module should be delivered at the right time, the module should enhance behavior T2DM&#xD;
      patients, and module content should alter T2DM patients self-concept in DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a validated questionnaire of Sidek Mohd and Jamaludin Ahmad in module content, the&#xD;
      experts will determine the level of content DM nutrition education module. The range of scale&#xD;
      for this assessment is from 1 (Extremely Agree) to 5 (Extremely Disagree).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A set DM nutrition education module curriculum module will be prepared to deliver the&#xD;
      materials to the patients. The DM nutrition education will be developed based on&#xD;
      Nutritionists and T2DM perspective on need assessment phase. DM nutrition education module&#xD;
      was assessed among expert panel reviews. After that, the materials DM nutrition education&#xD;
      module will be delivered by introducing DM, symptom, ethology, CHO counting and exchange,&#xD;
      food recommendation, cooking method, reading food labeling, and exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The curriculum will be conveyed in the class twice a month for 60 minutes. There will be&#xD;
      materials that patients can bring at home and be practiced as a guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into intervention and control groups. After intervention finished, the&#xD;
      material will also be distributed to T2DM patients in the control group. Furthermore, they&#xD;
      will have the same knowledge after the Nutrition Education program finished. Actually, no&#xD;
      differences module which will be delivered among groups. However, the timing to distribute&#xD;
      the module should be considered to avoid the effect of a contaminant between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The module will be prepared based on the result from a needs assessment in Phase I. Besides&#xD;
      that, materials will follow Indonesian consensus, and guidelines, books that were released&#xD;
      from the Indonesian Ministry of Health. The module should follow the management standard of&#xD;
      the Indonesian Ministry of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III : Treatment and Evaluation Research Design This is a cluster Randomized Controlled&#xD;
      Trial study. Implementation of module is to compare and determine effectiveness Nutrition&#xD;
      Education Module diabetes mellitus between intervention and control groups. Data collection&#xD;
      will be started from June 2020 to August 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling The clusters will be recruited by Puskesmas (PHC) and random by district will be&#xD;
      selected following simple random sampling. Districts are selected based on the highest number&#xD;
      of T2DM patients. Therefore, there are four clusters in each group and there are two&#xD;
      districts each groups. The districts in intervention group are Kuranji and Pauh and the&#xD;
      control group are Padang Selatan and Padang Utara. PHC (clusters) in the intervention group&#xD;
      are Kuranji, Belimbing, Ambacang, and Pauh. PHC in the control group are Seberang Padang,&#xD;
      Rawang Barat, Alai, and Air Tawar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Number of sample of each arm using 2 groups means comparison is n1 = 36, number&#xD;
      of cluster, size (m) is m=4, number of sample size per cluster is n2 = 41 and Total sample is&#xD;
      n2 = 75. Using α=0.05, power = 80%, ICC =0.05, total sample are 150 with 75 subject per arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected using questionnaire with 5 sections. They are Section A: Socioeconomic&#xD;
      and Demographic Data, Section B: Glycaemic control, Section C: Nutritional Status, Lipid&#xD;
      Profile, and Blood Pressure, Section D: Knowledge, Attitude, Practice, and Section E: Quality&#xD;
      of Life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual with T2DM (intervention group) will follow Diabetes Mellitus Nutrition Education&#xD;
      (DNE) program based on the curriculum of DNE modules properly and certain measurements. There&#xD;
      is a selected nutritionists at each PHC who will convey the DNE program. DM nutrition&#xD;
      education counselling will be delivered every week for 30 minutes. Before the DNE is started,&#xD;
      selected nutritionists will be introduced of DNE program and curriculum to avoid&#xD;
      misunderstanding during the program running.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to avoid contamination among groups, nutritionists (intervention group) will be&#xD;
      asked to fill in the inform consent and be informed to not show the DM Nutrition Education&#xD;
      Module and tool kits to subjects in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual with T2DM in control group will still follow the convention DM nutrition&#xD;
      education. After DNE program finished, the material will also be distributed to individual&#xD;
      with T2DM in the control group. Furthermore, they will have the same knowledge when the&#xD;
      program finished. Actually, there is no differences module which will be distributed among&#xD;
      groups. However, the timing to distribute the module should be considered to avoid the&#xD;
      contaminant between groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Statistical analyses will be performed using the latest version of STATA. The&#xD;
      data will be checked for normality. Missing treatment intervention data for 3 months (three)&#xD;
      and follow up 3 (three) months using an Intention-to-treat (ITT) will be implemented.&#xD;
      Baseline data are missing when a mean imputation procedure is done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be expressed as portions, mean (SD). Time trend for treatment&#xD;
      effect will be estimated from General Linear Model (GLM). GLM is to determine the&#xD;
      between-group difference at 3 months intervention and 3 months follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences between baseline, treatment 3 (three) months and 3 (three) months follow up will&#xD;
      be calculated for each outcome. Estimation within and between intervention and control groups&#xD;
      will be tested using two way-ANOVA. Sociodemographic characteristic data will be expressed as&#xD;
      proportions, mean and Standard Deviation (SD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-way repeated measured ANOVA is to test independent variable and a continuous (interval or&#xD;
      ratio) dependent variable (within groups). Then, two-way repeated measured ANOVA to test&#xD;
      independent variable and dependent variable between groups. However, if the relationship&#xD;
      between the covariate and the dependent variable is not linear, ANCOVA is inappropriate.&#xD;
