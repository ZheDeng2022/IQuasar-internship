  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to further develop and evaluate a diagnostic procedure suitable&#xD;
      for use in an inexpensive diagnostic instrument suitable for screening for Long QT Syndrome&#xD;
      (LQTS) in the primary care environment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve acquiring ECG data in a cohort of up to 1,000 newborns and infants&#xD;
      (500 controls (non-LQTS) and 500 LQTS newborns and infants) that are being seen in the Gonda&#xD;
      SL ECG Lab (or Baldwin Building)and enrolled during their appointment for a clinically&#xD;
      indicated 12-lead ECG. A second arm of Phase II of this study will include approaching 50&#xD;
      healthy subjects at the Baldwin Building to seek interest in participation which will consist&#xD;
      of (1) 30 second device recording to help further calibrate and test the device for optimal&#xD;
      enhancement. These 50 subjects will not be required to have a clinical or research 12-lead&#xD;
      ECG as the investigators will be simply testing the efficiency and accuracy of the device.&#xD;
      LQTS will be studied in order to assess the ability of the LQTS screener to accurately detect&#xD;
      a patient with established QT prolongation in the context of distinct and varied T wave&#xD;
      morphologies The advanced prototype will be placed in the same manner as the device used in&#xD;
      Phase I of the study by being lightly placed on the child as pictured below. Similarly, the&#xD;
      investigators will use ultrasound gel to obtain a better reading, if applicable. Once&#xD;
      completed, a photograph of the torso of the child will be taken from the same views as before&#xD;
      (one aerial view and one side view) with neither the head nor the face in the picture. Coded&#xD;
      ECG-tracings will be transmitted to the app and shared with Blue Ox Health Corporation and&#xD;
      Minnesota Health Solutions as done previously in phase I. Additionally, coded tracings and&#xD;
      data from the 12-lead ECG will be shared with Blue Ox Health Corporation and Minnesota Health&#xD;
      Solutions to aid in comparison to device tracings and optimization of the algorithm. The&#xD;
      12-lead ECG will be obtained from the subject's medical record and coded before being shared&#xD;
      with collaborators. Study coordinators will also review the patient's medical record to&#xD;
      determine whether the participants have been diagnosed with a genetic disease.&#xD;
