  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single, ascending-dose design with five dose-cohorts of 8 subjects. Forty healthy adults&#xD;
      aged 18 to 45, inclusive, will be recruited and admitted at one US site. Each subject will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either SAR440894 or matching placebo via 60-minute intravenous&#xD;
      infusion. In each cohort of 8 subjects, the randomization ratio will be 6 active to 2&#xD;
      placebo, and 2 sentinel subjects (one from each active and placebo group) will be dosed&#xD;
      first. Dosing of the next dose-cohort will be dependent on acceptable meeting predefined&#xD;
      safety criteria in the preceding cohort. Each subject's participation will take place over&#xD;
      approximately 150 days, not including the screening visit. There are no hypotheses for this&#xD;
      phase I study. The primary objective will be to determine the safety of single ascending&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) infusions of SAR440894 when administered in healthy adults.&#xD;

      objectives are: 1) to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of single ascending doses of&#xD;
      60-minute IV infusions SAR440894 in healthy adults and 2) to asses the immunogenicity of&#xD;
      single ascending doses of 60-minute IV infusions SAR440894 in healthy adults.&#xD;
