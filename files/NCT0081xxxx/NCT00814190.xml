  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of diabetes is an evolving challenge to health care professionals. The&#xD;
      fluctuations of glucose levels over the lifetime of patients with diabetes can lead to&#xD;
      complications such as nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy and cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
      Although diabetes is a chronic disease, it can be controlled with use of medications (pills&#xD;
      or insulin), and/or changes in life-style and diet. These interventions are aimed at keeping&#xD;
      the blood glucose levels normal or in the range of acceptable levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important aspect of diabetes care is the monitoring of blood glucose levels in order to&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness of treatment and to modify the treatment to achieve the desirable&#xD;
      glucose levels. Patients with type 2 DM treated with insulin are recommended to perform&#xD;
      testing for their blood glucose levels; however, it often requires intervention by health&#xD;
      professionals in order to prevent the immediate and serious complications of hyper or&#xD;
      hypoglycemia. The frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose and effective interventions by&#xD;
      the health professionals may eventually allow tighter control of blood glucose levels and&#xD;
      delay or prevent the complications associated with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators wish to evaluate the effect of an Internet based remote&#xD;
      monitoring system that allows for patients to upload their blood glucose readings online and&#xD;
      for the health care professional to view and provide feedback or therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
      The Internet based system has the features of presenting the blood glucose readings according&#xD;
      to the time of day and automatically calculates the daily average plus the standard&#xD;
      deviation. A visual graph of the glucose readings over a 24-hour period is also generated for&#xD;
      view. In addition, the doctor can give feedback by sending messages through the system. The&#xD;
      patient's personal information is kept secure as outlined by the privacy policy of the&#xD;
      Internet based system and only the doctor and the patient can view the uploaded glucose&#xD;
      readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose that the standardized encounters using the Internet will improve&#xD;
      the outcome of treatment for patients with type 2 DM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Purpose: To determine whether use of an Internet-based glucose monitoring system improves A1C&#xD;
      levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:We propose that the standardized encounters between the patient and the health&#xD;
      care profession using the Internet will improve the outcome of treatment for patients with&#xD;
      type 2 DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:The standard treatment will involve glucose monitoring by testing blood glucose&#xD;
      3 times daily, performing a laboratory test of blood hemoglobin every three months, and&#xD;
      visiting the doctor every three months for standard care. All of the subjects will be under&#xD;
      standard care; however, half will also use the Internet system to report glucose readings&#xD;
      which will allow the health care professional to view the results and to provide feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method: Type 2 diabetes patients who satisfy the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      recruited from St. Paul's Diabetes Teaching and Training Centre. They will be randomized into&#xD;
      2 groups (Intervention and Control). There is an equal chance, a 50/50 chance, of being&#xD;
      placed in either group. The control subject group will receive standard care and will be&#xD;
      asked to perform self-blood glucose monitoring 3 times daily for 6 months. The control&#xD;
      subject group will also make visits to the endocrinologist every 3 months with laboratory&#xD;
      test of A1c and serum creatinine measurements at 3-month intervals for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Intervention group will also receive standard care and will be asked to perform&#xD;
      self-blood glucose monitoring 3 times daily for 6 months. However, the Intervention group&#xD;
      will also be asked to report their blood glucose reading every 2 weeks through an Internet&#xD;
      based glucose monitoring system. The Intervention group will also make visits to the&#xD;
      endocrinologist every 3 months with A1c and serum creatinine measurements at 3-month&#xD;
      intervals for 6 months. The laboratory measurements of both groups will be recorded and used&#xD;
      for data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: The primary endpoint is the A1c level or the change in A1c level. The&#xD;
      secondary endpoints include severe hypoglycemia defined as requiring external aid, hospital&#xD;
      admissions for any CVD related intervention, and adverse events such as unplanned&#xD;
      hospitalizations for any cause that last more than 24 hours. Patients who do not have the&#xD;
      required number of SBGM tests performed or patients requiring new laser therapy will be asked&#xD;
      to discontinue the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each group, A1C levels before the start of study will be compared to A1C levels 3 and 6&#xD;
      months after the start of the study. Paired t-tests and random effects models (longitudinal&#xD;
      analyses) will examine differences in A1C values before and after the study duration.&#xD;
      Unpaired, independent t-tests will be done to examine the difference in A1C values between&#xD;
      the two groups before and after the interventions. The planned sample size is 50.&#xD;
