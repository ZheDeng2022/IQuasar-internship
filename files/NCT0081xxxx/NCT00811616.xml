      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the Supralimus -&#xD;
      Core™ Sirolimus Eluting Stent in de novo native vessel obstructive coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single centre, prospective study. Approximately 105 patients were enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. Patients were followed for twelve months post-procedure. All patients were to have a&#xD;
      repeat angiography at 8 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population consisted of approximately 105 patients with de novo native vessel&#xD;
      obstructive coronary artery disease with no specific criteria. Patients from the daily&#xD;
      practice were included. Patients had to meet all eligibility criteria for inclusion into the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDPOINTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary safety endpoint of the study is defined as Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) at&#xD;
      30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint is the in-stent binary restenosis rate at 8-month follow-up&#xD;
      determined by off-line Quantitative Coronary Angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following secondary efficacy endpoints were assessed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Angiographic success&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure success&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantitative Coronary Angiography derived vessel parameters in-stent and 5 mm proximal&#xD;
           and 5 mm distal from the edge of the stent: acute gain, MLD, % DS, late loss, mean&#xD;
           diameter. In-stent pre-, post and at 8-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinically justified Target Lesion Revascularization (TLR) at 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following secondary safety endpoints were assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MACE until 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Device related SAEs until 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Angiographic stent thrombosis: Subacute (after procedure until 30 days) and Late (after&#xD;
           30 days until 12 months)&#xD;
