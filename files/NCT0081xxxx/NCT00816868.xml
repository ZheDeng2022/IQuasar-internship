      Because of the effect in the treatment of NSCLC, the capecitabine and erlotinib may compose&#xD;
      to a new regimen for NSCLC. Based on the preclinical observation and the confirmed clinical&#xD;
      synergistic anti-tumor activity of combined capecitabine and erlotinib in gemzar refractory&#xD;
      advanced pancreatic cancer (APC), the investigators previously conducted a phase II study of&#xD;
      erlotinib in combination with capecitabine against NSCLC.&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 1.1 Background Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related&#xD;
      mortality in the world. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common type of lung&#xD;
      cancer, comprises about 80% of all lung cancer cases, and five-year survival across all&#xD;
      stages is about 12%. More than 60% of all NSCLC patients have advanced or metastatic disease&#xD;
      that is not suitable for curative resection at diagnosis. Platinum-based chemotherapy remains&#xD;
      the cornerstone of treatment for these patients and results in a small but statistically&#xD;
      significant improvement in survival compared with supportive care alone.But the regimen is&#xD;
      also associated with moderate to severe hematological and non-hematological toxic effects in&#xD;
      a majority of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately two-thirds of patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are 65&#xD;
      years or older, and nearly 50% are 70 years or older. And greater than 90% of elderly&#xD;
      patients experience a grade 3/4 toxicity when treated with a platinum-based&#xD;
      doublet..Moreover，a group of patients with the performance status ≥2 is intolerant&#xD;
      intravenous chemotherapy. Availability of an effective,less toxic therapy might help extend&#xD;
      potentially beneficial treatment to a greater proportion of elderly or patients whose&#xD;
      performance status ≥2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Rationale 1.2.1 Capecitabine for NSCLC Capecitabine is an oral prodrug of 5-Fu.It is&#xD;
      absorbed through the intestine and converted to 5'-deoxy-S-fluorocytidine (5'-DFCR) by&#xD;
      carboxylesterase and then to 5'-deoxy-S-fluorouridine (5'-DFUR) by cytidine deaminase, both&#xD;
      steps taking place in the liver. Finally,it is converted to the only active metabolite, FU,&#xD;
      by thymidine phosphorylase（TP）. This occurs in both tumor and normal tissues; however, the TP&#xD;
      is found at higher concentrations in some tumor tissue compared with normal healthy&#xD;
      tissue.The expression of this enzymes may influence the effect of the capecitabine. Han et al&#xD;
      examined the TP expression in tumor tissue samples from NSCLC patients who enrolled in a&#xD;
      previous phase II study of capecitabine/docetaxel chemotherapy and found that the patients&#xD;
      with high tumour cell thymidine phosphorylase expression show a better response to&#xD;
      capecitabine based chemotherapy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thymidylate synthase (TS) is an important target enzyme for antifolate drugs, such as&#xD;
      5-FU、UFT and capecitabine,because it catalyzes an essential step in DNA synthesis. The&#xD;
      predictive role of the expression of thymidylate synthase (TS) in tumors treated with&#xD;
      antifolate drugs has been extensively reported in NSCLC.In 2006, Nakano et al performed an&#xD;
      immunohistochemical study on the clinical significance of TS expression using 151 resected&#xD;
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients postoperatively treated with UFT.They found that&#xD;
      the 5-year survival rate of patients with TS-negative tumours was significantly higher than&#xD;
      that with TS-positive tumours (P=0.0133).Miyoshi et al reported that the oral administration&#xD;
      of UFT after surgery might improve the survival of NSCLC patients when TS levels in tumor&#xD;
      tissues are low,with the 5-year survival rates of patients positive and negative for TS were&#xD;
      50.0 and 89.5%(p&lt;0.001).Some research still found that TS expression was significantly higher&#xD;
      in squamous cell carcinoma compared with adenocarcinoma when both mRNA levels and protein&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently，a Phase III Study Comparing Cisplatin Plus Gemcitabine With Cisplatin Plus&#xD;
      Pemetrexed in Chemotherapy-Naïve Patients With Advanced-Stage Non-Small- Cell Lung Cancer&#xD;
      showed that Overall survival was statistically superior for cisplatin/ pemetrexed versus&#xD;
      cisplatin/gemcitabine in patients with adenocarcinoma.The result reminded us that patients&#xD;
      with adenocarcinoma were most likely to benefit from antifolate drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the preclinical study, we examined tumor specimens for TS and TP expression obtained from&#xD;
      171 Chinese NSCLC patients who were operated without any preoperative chemotherapy or&#xD;
      radiation at our institute. We categorized Grades 0 and 1 as negative, Grades 2 and 3 as&#xD;
      positive for both enzymes. As for TS staining, 14.6% (n = 25) were classified as Grade 0,&#xD;
      28.7% (n = 49) as Grade 1, 32.7% (n = 56) as Grade 2 and 24.0% (n = 41) as Grade 3. And for&#xD;
      TP staining, 12.3% (n = 21) were classified as Grade 0, 17.0% (n = 29) as Grade 1, 13.5% (n =&#xD;
      23) as Grade 2 and 57.3% (n =98) as Grade 3. Although the anti-tumor activity of capecitabine&#xD;
      has not been well evaluated in NSCLC, the relatively high expression of TP (70.8%) and low&#xD;
      expression TS (43.3%) in NSCLC provided a rationale for the use of capecitabine in patients&#xD;
      with this tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2.2 Erlotinib for NSCLC Erlotinib is a novel small molecule inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase (TK). It has been approved as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced&#xD;
      NSCLC who have progressed following first- and second-line chemotherapy.It is fairly well&#xD;
      tolerated and the salient adverse effects are mild to moderate skin rash and diarrhea. And&#xD;
      the further study showed that adenocarcinoma histology predicted the better survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently a trial of erlotinib as first-line therapy in elderly patients has been reported by&#xD;
      investigators at the Dana-Farber Cancer Center. In 76 patients over the age of 70, the vast&#xD;
      majority with adenocarcinoma histology, the response rate was 12% and a median survival was&#xD;
      11 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2.3 The synergistic interaction of erlotinib and capecitabine in NSCLC. Giovannetti et al&#xD;
      reported that erlotinib significantly reduced TS expression and activity, possibly via E2F-1&#xD;
      reduction, as detected by RT-PCR and western blot, and the combination decreased TS in situ&#xD;
      activity in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, Van SS. et al found TS inhibitor (5-FU) increases EGFR&#xD;
      phosphorylation which potentially favors EGFR-TKIs activity.Thus, erlotinib and capecitabine&#xD;
      may have a strong synergism in NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the effect in the treatment of NSCLC, the capecitabine and erlotinib may compose&#xD;
      to a new regimen for NSCLC. Based on the preclinical observation and the confirmed clinical&#xD;
      synergistic anti-tumor activity of combined capecitabine and erlotinib in gemzar refractory&#xD;
      APC, we previously conducted a phase II study of erlotinib in combination with capecitabine&#xD;
      against NSCLC.&#xD;
