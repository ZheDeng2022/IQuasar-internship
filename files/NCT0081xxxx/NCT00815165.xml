  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is an important cause of illness and occasional deaths in infants who&#xD;
      catch the virus before they are born, in newborns, and in children and adults who have weak&#xD;
      immune systems. The purpose of this study is to look at how the CMV vaccine works in the&#xD;
      blood. This study is being done along with the main CMV gB/MF59 vaccine study that looks at&#xD;
      how the overall body reacts to the vaccine. Participants will include up to 100 healthy&#xD;
      adolescent female subjects aged 12 to 17 years who were vaccinated in study 04-039 and 100&#xD;
      subjects that were screened for 04-039 to participate as controls. Study procedures will&#xD;
      include up to 6 blood draws taken over a 13 month period. Participation will be about 31&#xD;
      months (unless the patient enrolls into the shedding study).&#xD;

      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is an important cause of morbidity and occasional mortality in&#xD;
      congenitally infected infants and immuno-compromised children and adults, especially human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals and transplant recipients. Newborn infants&#xD;
      represent a particularly high-risk group. This study of cell-mediated immune responses to&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus GB/MF59 vaccine is a substudy of Division of Microbiology and Infectious&#xD;
      Diseases, NIAID, NIH, DHHS (DMID) protocol 04-039, &quot;A Randomized, Double-Blind,&#xD;
      Placebo-Controlled, Phase II Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of the Cytomegalovirus&#xD;
      gB/MF59 Vaccine in Preventing Systemic Cytomegalovirus Infection in Healthy Adolescent&#xD;
      Females.&quot; This vaccine trial is designed to test the safety and efficacy of the CMV gB/MF59&#xD;
      vaccine. Primary goals of this study are to assess whether injection with 3 doses of the CMV&#xD;
      gB/MF59 vaccine induces significant CD4+, CD8+ and/or regulatory T cell immune responses; to&#xD;
      evaluate the boosting affect of gB/MF59 on the CMV-specific T cell responses after each of 3&#xD;
      doses of vaccine; to evaluate the persistence of CMV-specific T cell responses after&#xD;
      vaccination; and to evaluate CMV-specific T cell responses in subjects that seroconvert&#xD;
      during the vaccine trial. New techniques for the enumeration and characterization of antigen&#xD;
      specific T cells are now available that will facilitate a precise analysis of the magnitude&#xD;
      and functional capacity of influenza virus-specific T cells. All subjects enrolled in the CMV&#xD;
      gB/MF59 trial at Vanderbilt and Cincinnati study sites will be eligible for enrollment in the&#xD;
      cell-mediated immune response sub-study. Blood draws for assessment of cellular immune&#xD;
      response will be obtained in 3 phases. Phase 1, N=50: at visit 1, the initial 100 consented&#xD;
      subjects to recruit approximately 50 seropositive subjects (based on a 60 percent&#xD;
      seropositive rate). Samples from this phase of the study will be used to establish the&#xD;
      optimal conditions for the assay and to compare natural infection with vaccine induced T cell&#xD;
      responses. Phase 2, N=50-100: at day 0 (before 1st dose of vaccine), day 30 (before the&#xD;
      second dose of vaccine), day 60 (1 month after the second dose of vaccine), day 210 (1 month&#xD;
      after the last dose of vaccine), and day 390 (7 months after the last dose of vaccine).&#xD;
      Samples from this phase will be used to evaluate the boosting affect of gB/MF59 after each of&#xD;
      3 doses of vaccine and to evaluate the persistence of CMV-specific T cell responses. Phase 3:&#xD;
      at each visit (S1-S8) for those subjects that seroconvert (i.e. if subject seroconverts at&#xD;
      visit 10 blood will be obtained at visits S1-S8). These samples will be used to compare&#xD;
      CMV-specific responses in subjects that either did or did not receive the vaccine and&#xD;
      seroconvert during the study. These time points are based on the vaccine study design and the&#xD;
      previous work evaluating T cell responses to vaccination 1 month and 6 months after&#xD;
      immunization. Researchers will collect 30 ml of blood per draw in this trial enrolling up to&#xD;
      100 healthy adolescent females 12-17 years of age, inclusive. Blood volumes were determined&#xD;
      to ensure sufficient numbers of cells to establish stimulation protocols and evaluate&#xD;
      cell-mediated immune responses. The study duration will be 43 months. Subject duration will&#xD;
      be 31 months, unless the subject seroconverts and enrolls into the shedding study. This study&#xD;
      is linked to DMID protocol 04-039.&#xD;
