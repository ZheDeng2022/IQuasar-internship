      Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is a rare progressive neurological disorder affecting approximately&#xD;
      1/30, 000 individuals. No treatment is presently available to counteract the&#xD;
      neurodegeneration of this extremely severe disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pioglitazone, a well known PPAR gamma (peroxysome proliferators-activated receptor gamma)&#xD;
      ligand induces the expression of many enzymes involved in the mitochondrial metabolism,&#xD;
      including the superoxide dismutases. This agent may be therapeutic by counteracting the&#xD;
      disabled recruitment of antioxidant enzymes in FA patients. This potential neuroprotective&#xD;
      agent crosses the brain blood barrier in human.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To explore the effects of Pioglitazone on neurological function in FA&#xD;
      patients. We expect neurological benefits taking into account the natural course of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Subjects for this study will be limited to patients not older than 25 years&#xD;
      Methodology: Prospective, randomized double-blind trial of Pioglitazone versus placebo in FA&#xD;

    <textblock>
      State of the art Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is a rare progressive neurological disorder&#xD;
      affecting approximately 1/30, 000 individuals. No treatment is presently available to&#xD;
      counteract the neurodegeneration of this extremely severe disease. The cardinal feature is a&#xD;
      progressive gait and limb ataxia. Other commonly associated clinical signs include:&#xD;
      dysarthria, sensory loss, distal weakness, pyramidal signs, absent reflexes, nystagmus and&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy. Pes caves, scoliosis, diabetes and decline of vision or audition are also&#xD;
      found in many patients. The disease often reveals before adulthood and leads to a progressive&#xD;
      loss of autonomy about ten years after disease onset. FA is recessively inherited with a GAA&#xD;
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in the first intron of a gene encoding frataxin a&#xD;
      mitochondrial protein. Decreased frataxin leads to a mitochondrial iron-sulfur protein&#xD;
      deficiency and hampered signalling pathways for superoxide dismutases, key enzymes of early&#xD;
      antioxidant defences of the cells. As a result, cultured patient cells are particularly&#xD;
      sensitive to oxidative insult. One aspect of the pathogenesis in vivo might be explained by&#xD;
      this phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pioglitazone, a well known PPAR gamma (peroxysome proliferators-activated receptor gamma)&#xD;
      ligand induces the expression of many enzymes involved in the mitochondrial metabolism,&#xD;
      including the superoxide dismutases. This agent may be therapeutic by counteracting the&#xD;
      disabled recruitment of antioxidant enzymes in FA patients. This potential neuroprotective&#xD;
      agent crosses the brain blood barrier in human. A clinical study has shown that a daily&#xD;
      treatment with Pioglitazone during three years induced apparent clinical improvement without&#xD;
      adverse events in multiple sclerosis patients. Pioglitazone has been shown to possibly act on&#xD;
      neurodegeneration in humans and animals models thus it appears a promising agent to be tested&#xD;
      in Friedreich ataxia. This agent also didn't show any peculiar toxicity in cultured human&#xD;
      cells with low frataxin compared with control. All these facts lead us to propose a clinical&#xD;
      trial with Pioglitazone in patients with FA. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To explore the effects of Pioglitazone on neurological function in FA&#xD;
      patients. We expect neurological benefits taking into account the natural course of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Subjects for this study will be limited to patients not older than 25 years&#xD;
      Methodology: Prospective, randomized double-blind trial of Pioglitazone versus placebo in FA&#xD;
      patients. Patients will be treated two years and will undergo clinical exams and testing&#xD;
      during three days each six months at the clinical investigation centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients number justification: 20 patients in each group will be enrolled in the study with&#xD;
      considerations to inclusion possibilities and the Bayes statistical analysis methodology.&#xD;
      Evaluation of prior distribution of success probability per arm will be based on previous&#xD;
      literature data and experts consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint : change in neurological testing as performed using the International&#xD;
      Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) settled down by the World Federation of Neurology.&#xD;
      Success will be defined as a stabilisation or improvement on ICARS designed as no more than 2&#xD;
      points maximum increment on this scale in two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include measurements of the following: Neurological score by the&#xD;
      Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS), gait record and analysis of its components, posture&#xD;
      study, kinetic study of the upper limbs, speech, oculomotor and auditory disorders,&#xD;
      functional handicap using the Disability Status Scale (DSS), quality of life by SF-36 score;&#xD;
      Cardiac involvement (electrocardiography, 24 hours holter, echocardiography with tissue&#xD;
      doppler) and drug tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits expected with this clinical trial: Expected results will be reduced symptoms or&#xD;
      stabilization of the natural evolution of this threat full progressive disease with bad&#xD;
      prognosis in patients treated with Pioglitazone. Furthermore, study results will possibly&#xD;
      contribute in the validation and standardization of new clinical evaluation tools used in the&#xD;
      follow-up of Friedreich ataxia patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific monitoring was initiated in all patients included in the study taking into account a&#xD;
      potential risk of bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients included in the protocol ACTFRIE, will be asked to participate in the study of&#xD;
      tolerance. They will receive pioglitazone at a dose of 45 mg per day, until the data on the&#xD;
      effectiveness or otherwise of this treatment, its side effects in patients with Friedreich's&#xD;
      ataxia are known by the results of ACTFRIE testing (approximately April 2014).&#xD;
