      The standard treatment approach for patients with high-grade primary brain tumors includes&#xD;
      maximum feasible surgical resection, followed by 6 weeks of concurrent cranial irradiation&#xD;
      and daily low-dose temozolomide chemotherapy, followed by 12 cycles of high-dose temozolomide&#xD;
      administered for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks [Stupp 2005]. Contrast-enhanced MRI is the&#xD;
      current standard for evaluating the success of therapy and monitoring for tumor recurrence.&#xD;
      MRI is typically obtained prior to initial surgery, within 24 hours after surgery, at the&#xD;
      conclusions of cranial irradiation, and then every 8 weeks during temozolomide chemotherapy&#xD;
      until evidence of recurrence. Despite this careful clinical and radiographic surveillance,&#xD;
      and despite decades of research into the histologic and molecular classification of primary&#xD;
      brain tumors, our ability to predict tumor behavior remains very limited. Some gliomas will&#xD;
      result in overall survival times of only months, whereas other histologically-identical&#xD;
      gliomas may yield survivals of years to decades [Carson 2007, Curran 1993, Lamborn 2004].&#xD;
      Current assessment of tumor response to therapy is also poor. Patients with complete&#xD;
      radiographic response after cranial irradiation often progress rapidly post-irradiation. In&#xD;
      contrast, some patients with enhancing masses at the end of chemoradiotherapy may respond&#xD;
      dramatically to further chemotherapy alone, or the masses may even disappear in the absence&#xD;
      of further therapy (so called &quot;tumor pseudoprogression&quot;) [Chamberlain 2007]. This confounding&#xD;
      situation demonstrates a need for better assessment of tumor response.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Positron emission tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging modality that can probe various&#xD;
      aspects of tumor function using a variety of radio-labeled imaging agents (&quot;tracers&quot;).&#xD;
      Oncologic PET imaging has seen a dramatic rise in clinical utilization over the past decade&#xD;
      for cancer detection, staging, and evaluating residual or recurrent disease following&#xD;
      therapy. These clinical scans use the tracer [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), which&#xD;
      accumulates in cells in proportion to GLUT transporter and hexokinase activity. FDG thus&#xD;
      provides a measure of tissue glucose metabolism. Concurrent with this clinical growth, a&#xD;
      number of other PET tracers have received significant attention in research for a variety of&#xD;
      imaging targets. Of special interest are the tracers 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine (FLT),&#xD;
      1-[11C]-acetate (ACE), and [15O]water (H2O). The uptake, retention/washout, and ultimate&#xD;
      biodistribution of these tracers are each related to different functional or molecular&#xD;
      processes. As such, each can be used to probe a different aspect of tumor function: FLT&#xD;
      directly assesses tumor proliferation, ACE provides a measure of tumor growth related to&#xD;
      fatty acid and membrane synthesis, and H2O quantifies tumor perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two primary objectives: a translational objective in which a new PET imaging&#xD;
      technology will be translated from experimental development (with simulations and in animals)&#xD;
      to the first use in human subjects; and an exploratory objective in which the complementary&#xD;
      value of multiple PET tracers will be investigated. Each of these objective is described&#xD;
      below, where the study design has been carefully setup to fulfill both objectives in the same&#xD;
      study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The translational objective of this study is to implement and evaluate a new imaging&#xD;
      technology for rapid, single-scan multi-tracer PET imaging of these tracers. Current PET&#xD;
      technology prohibits imaging of more than one tracer in a single scan since the imaging&#xD;
      signals from each tracer cannot be distinguished by normal techniques; as such, separate&#xD;
      scans with each tracer currently need to be acquired hours or days apart. Our group has&#xD;
      developed techniques and algorithms for recovering individual-tracer images from&#xD;
      rapidly-acquired multi-tracer PET data using dynamic imaging techniques. These methods have&#xD;
      been tested through extensive simulations and verified experimentally in a canine model with&#xD;
      spontaneously-occurring tumors. Refinement of the methods with more advanced algorithms is&#xD;
      ongoing. The patient imaging studies of this protocol will be implemented in two phases. In&#xD;
      Phase A, separate single-tracer imaging of each tracer will be performed. The data from these&#xD;
      scans will be co-registered and combined to &quot;emulate&quot; multi-tracer scans, which will then be&#xD;
      processed by the multi-tracer signal-separation algorithms. This will permit a direct&#xD;
      comparison of imaging biomarkers from multi-tracer vs. single-tracer scans for each tracer.&#xD;
      Such comparison techniques have been established by the investigators and have been accepted&#xD;
      by peer review for testing multi-tracer signal-separation algorithms. Once&#xD;
      statistically-significant evidence is obtained that multi-tracer scans can accurately provide&#xD;
      the same imaging biomarkers as separate single-tracer scans, the imaging will transition to&#xD;
      Phase B-in which actual multi-tracer scans will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this exploratory study is to preliminarily evaluate the complementary value&#xD;
      of FDG, FLT, ACE, and H2O PET in patients with primary glial neoplasms. Multi-tracer PET&#xD;
      profiles with these four tracers will be obtained in 20 patients with primary glial neoplasms&#xD;
      at up to three timepoints: (1) at &quot;baseline&quot; prior to surgery or immediately after surgery&#xD;
      providing a complete surgical resection was not possible and confirmed by a post-operative&#xD;
      contrast MRI scan where residual tumor greater than 1.0 cm in diameter was present and prior&#xD;
      to any tumor-directed therapy; (2) at the conclusions of the initial (~6-8 weeks)&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy; and (3) at the time of MRI-documented recurrence within 2 years. In&#xD;
      addition, patients with a known primary brain tumor who have previously undergone treatment&#xD;
      and have recurred based on standard clinical and imaging criteria will be eligible for the&#xD;
      study. A number of quantitative and pseudo-quantitative imaging biomarkers for each tracer&#xD;
      will be computed at each imaging timepoint, and the change in each biomarker between&#xD;
      timepoints will also be computed. These data will be compared with clinical endpoints&#xD;
      (survival, time to progression), and with tumor biologic information (histology, WHO grade,&#xD;
      vascularity, Ki-67, VEGF, EGFR, p53) in cases when tumor tissue becomes available from&#xD;
      standard care. These data will provide pilot information into the potential value of&#xD;
      concurrent multiple PET biomarkers for predicting tumor behavior prior to the start of&#xD;
      therapy, for improved prognostication, for more efficient and effective tumor surveillance,&#xD;
      and/or for more appropriate assignment of patients to conventional, aggressive, or&#xD;
      investigational therapies early in their clinical courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The driving hypothesis for the overall line of research is that multiple PET imaging&#xD;
      biomarkers obtained in conjunction can provide improved image-guided personalized care of&#xD;
      patients with primary glial neoplasms. The term &quot;personalized care&quot; is used here to broadly&#xD;
      include the prediction of tumor behavior prior to the start of therapy, tumor surveillance,&#xD;
      prognostication, and individualized assignment of patients to conventional, aggressive, or&#xD;
      investigational therapies early in their clinical courses. This pilot project will obtain&#xD;
      initial data on the value of these PET biomarkers for such image-guided personalized care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific hypotheses to be tested include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HYPOTHESIS I a: Rapid, single-scan multi-tracer PET imaging can recover PET imaging&#xD;
           biomarker information of each tracer that are not significantly different from those&#xD;
           obtained from conventional, single-tracer scans of each tracer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HYPOTHESIS II b: Multi-tracer PET biomarkers, obtained in conjunction, are better able&#xD;
           to predict tumor aggressiveness than individual-tracer biomarkers or conventional&#xD;
           radiographic imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HYPOTHESIS III b: Multi-tracer PET biomarkers, obtained in conjunction, are better able&#xD;
           to detect functional changes in tumor state that occur in response to therapy than&#xD;
           individual-tracer biomarkers or conventional radiographic imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HYPOTHESIS IV b: Characterization of multiple aspects of tumor function (glucose&#xD;
           metabolism, proliferation, membrane growth, and perfusion) provides new insight into&#xD;
           tumor status that can guide selection of the most appropriate therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      a Sufficient statistical power is expected to be obtained under this protocol to validate the&#xD;
      extensive simulations and experimental evaluations performed previously and concurrently with&#xD;
      these patient imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b Pilot data regarding these three hypotheses will be obtained in this work by studying the&#xD;
      correlation of PET imaging biomarkers with clinical outcomes and tumor biologic information.&#xD;
      Though high statistical power cannot be expected from the limited number of patients in this&#xD;
      pilot study, underlying trends in the data will be identified, permitting the formulation of&#xD;
      formal hypotheses to be tested in future rigorous trials.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Three different adult patient groups will be eligible for inclusion in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Group 1: Adult patients with compelling evidence of primary brain tumor based on&#xD;
             clinical and MRI or CT imaging characteristics that have not yet received surgery,&#xD;
             histological diagnosis, or any tumor-directed therapy. Such evidence will include: MRI&#xD;
             or CT scan-documented mass lesion within the brain, accompanied by anatomically&#xD;
             appropriate neurological signs and symptoms, in the absence of a probable competing&#xD;
             diagnosis such as brain abscess or primary intracranial hematoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Group 2: Newly diagnosed primary malignant brain tumors (WHO Grade II - IV glial-based&#xD;
             tumors) who have not had a complete surgical resection and by contrast MRI or CT have&#xD;
             residual tumor greater than 1.0 cm in diameter and will be receiving radiotherapy&#xD;
             and/or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Group 3: Patients with probable or possible recurrent primary brain tumor as&#xD;
             determined by standard clinical criteria or MRI or CT imaging. The abnormality must be&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 1.0 cm in diameter by contrast MRI or CT or show changes on&#xD;
             non-enhancing MRI sequences (T2 or FLAIR).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must be 18 years or older for inclusion in this study. There is little&#xD;
                  experience with the safety of [18F]FLT in children, and the risks associated with&#xD;
                  radiation exposure may be increased for children under 18 years old as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must document their willingness to be followed for at least 24 months&#xD;
                  after recruitment by signing informed consent documenting their agreement to have&#xD;
                  clinical endpoints and the results of histopathologic tissue analysis (when&#xD;
                  tissue becomes available from routine care) entered into a research database.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  All patients, or their legal guardians, must sign a written informed consent and&#xD;
                  HIPAA authorization in accordance with institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Determination of pregnancy status: Female patients that are not postmenopausal or&#xD;
                  surgically sterile will undergo a serum pregnancy test prior to each set of&#xD;
                  multi-tracer PET scans. A negative test will be necessary for such patients to&#xD;
                  undergo research PET imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pre-treatment laboratory tests for patients receiving [18F]FLT must be performed&#xD;
                  within 21 days prior to study entry. These must be less than 2.5 times below or&#xD;
                  above the upper or lower limit range for the respective laboratory test for entry&#xD;
                  into the study. In those instances where a baseline laboratory value is outside&#xD;
                  of this range, then such a patient will be ineligible for enrollment. For the&#xD;
                  followup scanning sessions after therapy has been instituted, laboratory testing&#xD;
                  will also be required due to the use of FLT. The patients have brain tumors and&#xD;
                  will receive various forms of therapy; therefore many routine laboratory tests&#xD;
                  may not be within the typical normal range. As such, a factor of 4.0 times above&#xD;
                  or below the upper or lower value for the normal range for any laboratory test&#xD;
                  will be used to determine the acceptable range for the 2nd and possible 3rd&#xD;
                  imaging timepoints. The baseline laboratory testing will include liver enzymes&#xD;
                  (ALT, AST, ALK, LDH), bilirubin (total), serum electrolytes, CBC with platelets&#xD;
                  and absolute neutrophil counts, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time,&#xD;
                  BUN, creatinine. Previous urinalysis abnormalities will not preclude the patient&#xD;
                  from being studied. For those patients receiving coumadin or another&#xD;
                  anticoagulant the upper limit for prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin time&#xD;
                  must not exceed 6 times the upper limit of the normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically significant signs of uncal herniation, such as acute&#xD;
             pupillary enlargement, rapidly developing motor changes (over hours), or rapidly&#xD;
             decreasing level of consciousness, are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known allergic or hypersensitivity reactions to previously administered&#xD;
             radiopharmaceuticals. Patients with significant drug or other allergies or autoimmune&#xD;
             diseases may be enrolled at the Investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating or who suspect they might be pregnant. Serum&#xD;
             pregnancy tests will be obtained prior to each set of multi-tracer PET scans in female&#xD;
             patients that are not postmenopausal or surgically sterile.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patients who require monitored anesthesia for PET scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV positive patients due to the previous toxicity noted with FLT in this patient&#xD;
             group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone surgery or receive any previous tumor-directed therapy for&#xD;
             their brain tumor.&#xD;
