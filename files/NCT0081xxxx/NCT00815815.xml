      This study will examine the effectiveness of inpatient treatment for anorexia nervosa versus&#xD;
      a sequenced treatment that transitions from higher intensity inpatient care to lower&#xD;
      intensity outpatient care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder in which a person does not eat enough to maintain a&#xD;
      healthy body weight. This disorder can lead to starvation, which may, in turn, lead to heart&#xD;
      failure or brain damage. Anorexia can also lead to a host of other health problems, including&#xD;
      mild anemia, swollen joints, and brittle bones. Treatment for anorexia begins by attempting&#xD;
      to bring the anorexic person to a healthy body weight, while also conducting therapy aimed at&#xD;
      developing habits and ways of thinking that promote maintenance of a healthy weight.&#xD;
      Traditionally, the first part of this treatment-restoring healthy body weight-has taken place&#xD;
      in inpatient hospital care. Recently, however, some patients have begun with high intensity&#xD;
      inpatient care and then shifted to lower intensity outpatient care over the course of&#xD;
      treatment. This study will compare the effectiveness of these two different methods of&#xD;
      delivering treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of participation in this study will vary, depending on the effectiveness of treatment.&#xD;
      All participants will have follow-up assessments for 18 months after study entry. Every&#xD;
      participant who passes the screening examination will be admitted to inpatient care in the&#xD;
      study hospital. On Day 3 of their stay, participants will be randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      either continued inpatient treatment or sequenced treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who receive continued inpatient treatment will stay in the hospital until they reach a&#xD;
      healthy body weight and maintain it for 10 to 14 days. The average length of inpatient&#xD;
      treatment will be 2 to 3 months. Those who receive sequenced treatment will transition to day&#xD;
      patient status once they have met the following health benchmarks: an increase in body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI) greater than 15.5 kg/m2; normal electrocardiograms, lab test results, and vital&#xD;
      signs; eating all meals for more than 3 days; no weight loss for at least 1 week or weight&#xD;
      gain for at least 1 week if the weight gain protocol has begun; and moderate improvement on a&#xD;
      clinical global impression (CGI) rating of eating disorder behavior. If participants do not&#xD;
      meet these benchmarks and are not at medical risk or suicidal, they will be automatically&#xD;
      transitioned to day patient care after 28 days. Once participants reach the day patient&#xD;
      status, they will be in the hospital Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. If&#xD;
      these participants then reach and maintain a healthy body weight for 10 to 14 days, they will&#xD;
      be transitioned to outpatient care, during which they will receive 50-minute therapy sessions&#xD;
      once or twice weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims and methods of treating anorexia will be the same for both groups. All participants&#xD;
      will be prescribed meals, a snack, and dietary supplements in order to reach a healthy&#xD;
      weight. The amount of exercise they engage in will be limited to ensure weight gain.&#xD;
      Participants will also attend individual, family, and group therapy sessions aimed at&#xD;
      supporting healthy thoughts and beliefs about eating behavior. Measurements of weight gain&#xD;
      will be made every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday morning. Every 3 months participants will&#xD;
      undergo blood tests and assessments of eating behaviors, associated psychopathology, and&#xD;
      health service utilization. Clinical interviews will be conducted twice: once at study entry&#xD;
      and once after 18 months.&#xD;
