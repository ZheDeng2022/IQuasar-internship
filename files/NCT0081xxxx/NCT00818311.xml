  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photomodulation is a process which manipulates or regulates cell activity using light sources&#xD;
      without thermal effect. Different studies have investigated the use of non-thermal low dose&#xD;
      light emitting diode (LED) array for improving the appearance of photo aging damage. The&#xD;
      photomodulation concept includes a low energy, narrow band or coherent light with specific&#xD;
      pulse sequences and durations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary investigations done by McDaniel et al. demonstrated that fibroblast activity&#xD;
      could be regulated using pulsing light at specific wavelenghts. Using a variety of LED light&#xD;
      sources, his group has demonstrated that by varying light pulses and other parameters,&#xD;
      procollagen synthesis could be upregulated in human skin fibroblast culture [McDaniel DH, et&#xD;
      al.Lasers Surg Med. 2002; 14-251]. A clinical correlation was also shown based on different&#xD;
      clinical trials data on around 1000 subjects, LED has shown up to 90% improvement in wrinkles&#xD;
      and an increase of collagen synthesis versus control with little or no side effects&#xD;
      associated [Weiss, RA et al. Lasers Surg Med 2005; 36(2): 85-91- Weiss, RA et al.: J Drugs&#xD;
      Dermatol 2004; 3(6): 605-610 - Weiss RA et al. Dermatol Surg 2005; 31(9):1999-1204 - Russel&#xD;
      BA et al. J Cosmet Laser Ther 2005; 7 (3-4):196-200 - Bhat J et al. Laser Med Sci 2005;&#xD;
      20(1):6-10]. Based on these promising clinical data, Light BioScience submitted a dossier to&#xD;
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and obtained in January 2005 the FDA approval for its&#xD;
      GentleWaves® Light Emitting Diode (LED) for the non-invasive treatment of periorbital (eye&#xD;
      area) wrinkles and rhytids. The LED technology has been considered by FDA as non significant&#xD;
      risk. In Europe, the GentleWaves® Light Emitting Diode has obtained the notified body&#xD;
      certification for the same indication. This medical claim is associated with cosmetic&#xD;
      improvement of aging and sun-damaged skin, further validation the science of LED&#xD;
      photomodulation skin rejuvenation [Investigator's Brochure. Version 1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approval has been obtained with a professional LED GentleWaves® device used under a&#xD;
      physician's responsibility. The initial regimen of 35 seconds twice per week with at least&#xD;
      two days in between treatment for a total of 4 weeks duration of treatment has demonstrated&#xD;
      efficacy for the treatment of typical signs of photo aging and no adverse effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A monocentre, randomized clinical study.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate different treatment regimens in order to be able to&#xD;
      develop new indications or to optimize the result already obtained in the treatment of&#xD;
      wrinkles around the eyes. We therefore propose to perform a safety clinical trial with male&#xD;
      and female volunteers with different schedules per day or per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 100 subjects (male and female) will be randomized in the study according to the&#xD;
      following schedule of exposure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: 20 subjects (8 males - 12 females) will be exposed to the LED twice a week for one&#xD;
      cycle (35 seconds) with an interval between treatments of at least 2 days, during a treatment&#xD;
      period of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: 20 subjects (8 males - 12 females) will be exposed to the LED twice a week for two&#xD;
      consecutive cycles (35 seconds each) with an interval between treatments of at least 2 days,&#xD;
      during a treatment period of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C: 20 subjects (8 males - 12 females) will be exposed to the LED for one cycle (35&#xD;
      seconds) twice a day (morning and evening). This treatment will be repeated twice a week with&#xD;
      an interval between treatments of at least 2 days, during a treatment period of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group D: 20 subjects (8 males - 12 females) will be exposed to the LED for one cycle (35&#xD;
      seconds) every day (from Monday to Friday) during a treatment of period of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group E: 20 subjects (8 males - 12 females) will be exposed to the LED for two consecutive&#xD;
      cycles (35 seconds each) every day (from Monday to Friday) during a treatment of period of 4&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      treatment period of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group D: 20 subjects (8 males - 12 females) will be exposed to the LED for one cycle (35&#xD;
      seconds) every day (from Monday to Friday) during a treatment of period of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group E: 20 subjects (8 males - 12 females) will be exposed to the LED for two consecutive&#xD;
      cycles (35 seconds each) every day (from Monday to Friday) during a treatment of period of 4&#xD;
