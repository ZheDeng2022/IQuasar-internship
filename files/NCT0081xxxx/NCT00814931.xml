  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of CXB722 on neuroendocrine stress&#xD;
      response and subjective reports related to mood and stress during and after experimentally&#xD;
      induced stress among healthy young males.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute stress produces a cascade of physiological and psychological effects, including&#xD;
      increased cardiovascular function, increases in circulating levels of stress hormones and&#xD;
      neurotransmitter levels, and changes in mood and subjective state. The Trier Social Stress&#xD;
      Test (TSST) is a standardized, well-validated procedure that was developed in order to&#xD;
      provide a controlled method for exposing subjects to a stressor. The TSST consists of a&#xD;
      public speaking and a mental arithmetic test performed in the context of a mock job&#xD;
      interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A drug that could safely block or mitigate the stress response would have multiple&#xD;
      applications in medicine, beyond treating anxiety, because stress is associated with many&#xD;
      disease states, including cardiovascular disease. The drug being studied, CXB722, is thought&#xD;
      to show promise in diminishing the physiologic and psychological effects of stress.&#xD;
