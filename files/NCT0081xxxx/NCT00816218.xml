    <textblock>
      This project is designed to evaluate the molecular mechanisms involved in the early&#xD;
      development of endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetic patients. The investigators intend&#xD;
      to correlate increases in insulin signaling pathway activity following pioglitazone therapy&#xD;
      with improvements in nitric oxide synthase expression in skeletal muscle. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate vascular responses and in vivo nitric oxide release during&#xD;
      administration of acetylcholine and nitroprusside in patients with type 2 diabetes. Enhanced&#xD;
      knowledge of the molecular mechanisms responsible for endothelial dysfunction, an early&#xD;
      abnormality in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, is critical before novel therapies to&#xD;
      arrest or delay the appearance of cardiovascular complications in diabetes can be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to recruit fifty type 2 diabetic patients treated with diet alone or&#xD;
      diet plus sulfonylureas or meglitinides and add Pioglitazone (45 mg), an insulin sensitizer,&#xD;
      for 6 months. In addition to assessment of clinical and metabolic parameters, insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and brachial artery and skin microcirculatory responses to acetylcholine and&#xD;
      nitroprusside in combination with simultaneous determination of nitric oxide release will be&#xD;
      documented before, 3 and 6 months after Pioglitazone therapy is initiated. Circulating levels&#xD;
      of markers of endothelial damage (VCAM, ICAM, selectins), inflammation (C-reactive protein&#xD;
      and interleukins), increased coagulability (PAI-1) as well as lipids and apolipoproteins will&#xD;
      measured during the study. Skeletal muscle biopsies will be performed during the euglycemic&#xD;
      insulin clamp before and 6 months after therapy for measurements of NO synthase activity and&#xD;
      key elements of the insulin signal transduction pathway involved in the regulation of glucose&#xD;
      metabolism (IRS-1, PI-3 kinase, PI-3 kinase associated with IRS-1 and the mitogenesis&#xD;
      MAP-kinase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 2 diabetes confers a substantial increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease. This is&#xD;
      believed to be due, in part, to endothelial dysfunction, which correlates closely with&#xD;
      impaired vascular responsiveness. Our study will clarify further the extent to which&#xD;
      resistance to insulin action and impaired nitric oxide release from endothelial cells are&#xD;
      interrelated. We also expect to demonstrate that insulin sensitizers (pioglitazone) can help&#xD;
      to restore normal endothelial function, and ultimately prevent/delay the appearance of&#xD;
      vascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the global hypothesis that increases in insulin signaling through either PI-3-kinase&#xD;
      or MAP kinase pathways correlate with improvements in NO production or NOS expression in&#xD;
      skeletal muscle following pioglitazone therapy, we will determine whether 6 months of&#xD;
      Pioglitazone therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Increases the activities of muscle NO synthase, IRS-1, PI-3 kinase, PI3-kinase associated&#xD;
      with IRS-1 and/or MAP-kinase ii. Improves brachial arterial endothelial function In addition,&#xD;
      we will determine whether 6 months of pioglitazone therapy improves abnormal cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease risk factors in type 2 diabetic patients by documenting the effects of the drug on&#xD;
      plasma lipoprotein profile and on circulating levels of markers of hypercoagulability,&#xD;
      inflammatory and endothelial damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Plan Subjects. Adult type 2 diabetic individuals ranging from 18-65 yrs, with&#xD;
      BMI between 24 and 37 kg/m2 and mean hemoglobin A1c levels equal to 6.5 and 9.0% will be&#xD;
      studied. A total of 50 subjects will be recruited. There are over 8,000 type 2 diabetic&#xD;
      patients under treatment at the TDI with a total of approximately 90,000 visits per year&#xD;
      registered in the year 2000. As the main source of diabetes care and education to a&#xD;
      population of predominantly Hispanic Americans, the TDI also is responsible for periodic&#xD;
      screening in the community. Thus, we do not anticipate any problems in recruiting 50 subjects&#xD;
      required for the present study. All patients will be normotensive, free of significant&#xD;
      medical problems other than diabetes, and either on diet alone or diet plus sulfonylurea (or&#xD;
      meglitinides) therapy. Subjects who have received or are receiving treatment with a&#xD;
      thiazolidinedione (TZD) will be excluded. We previously have shown that sulfonyureas have no&#xD;
      direct insulin sensitizing effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design. General Approach. An open-label prospective clinical trial including 50 type&#xD;
      2 diabetic patients (25 diet-treated and 25 treated with diet plus sulfonylurea) will have&#xD;
      pioglitazone, 45 mg daily; added to their therapeutic regimen. All patients will be closely&#xD;
      monitored and, in addition to periodic contacts and clinical visits, metabolic and vascular&#xD;
      parameters will be assessed at the beginning and after 3 and 6 months of therapy. Euglycemic&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemic clamp with muscle biopsies will be performed at the beginning and after 6&#xD;
      months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Recruitment. Potential volunteers will be invited for a screening visit (Visit 1)&#xD;
      during which subjects will be instructed in English (with Spanish translation when&#xD;
      appropriate) about the nature of the study, eligibility criteria and required commitments, as&#xD;
      well as the potential risks and benefits anticipated for each individual and for the&#xD;
      community in general. Written informed consent for participation in the clinical trial from&#xD;
      individuals thought to be eligible to participate will be obtained at Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 1 a complete medical history (including a list of current medications, reproductive&#xD;
      status and menstrual history for females), physical examination (including height and&#xD;
      weight), and vital signs will be obtained. Three consecutive blood pressure measurements will&#xD;
      be performed in the sitting position using an automated arm cuff and only individuals with a&#xD;
      blood pressure less than 140/90 mmHg will be considered eligible. A urinalysis will be&#xD;
      performed and blood will be drawn after an overnight fast for measurement of complete blood&#xD;
      count (hematocrit, white cells and platelets), plasma glucose, free T4 and TSH; SMA 20, lipid&#xD;
      profile; hemoglobin A1c levels (HbA1C); free fatty acids, insulin and C-peptide&#xD;
      concentrations and for a pregnancy test (females only). An EKG also will be performed. All&#xD;
      diabetic patients who are deemed healthy and meet eligibility criteria (see below) based upon&#xD;
      physical exam, medical history and screening laboratory tests will be invited to participate&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must meet all of the following criteria: 1) male or female 18-65 years of age; 2)&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes based on the American Diabetes Association criteria; 3) HbA1c = 6.5-9.0%&#xD;
      while on diet alone or diet plus sulfonylurea (or meglitinides) therapy; 4) no history of&#xD;
      thiazolidinediones, insulin, ACE inhibitor or AII-receptor blockade therapy; 5) taking no&#xD;
      medications known to affect glycemic control or endothelial function, unless the medication&#xD;
      has been stable for at least 3 months; 6) blood pressure equal or below 140/90 mmHg; 7) not&#xD;
      pregnant and willing to take appropriate contraceptive measures if capable of becoming&#xD;
      pregnant; 8) serum creatinine below 1.7 mg/dl in female and 1.8 mg/dl in males; 9) ALT or AST&#xD;
      less than 2 times the upper limit of normal for the laboratory and absence of clinical signs&#xD;
      or symptoms of liver disease; 10) hematocrit &gt; 34% in females and &gt;35% in males; 11) normal&#xD;
      thyroid function; 12) no evidence of coronary heart disease (by history or EKG) or moderate&#xD;
      to severe congestive heart failure (NY Heart Association Cardiac Class III or IV); 13) no&#xD;
      history or the presence of any clinically significant or unstable medical condition that&#xD;
      makes the subject unlikely to complete the study in the opinion of the PI; and 14) absence of&#xD;
      any condition or situations which would preclude adherence and completion of the protocol;&#xD;
      15) the ability to give voluntary informed consent. All clinical laboratory analyses for this&#xD;
      trial will be performed at the central laboratory at the University of Texas Health Science&#xD;
      Center in San Antonio. All research analytical determinations will be performed in the&#xD;
      laboratories of the Diabetes Division. Eligible subjects will return one week after Visit 1&#xD;
      for a second visit (Visit 2), a subject number will be assigned, and a nutritional assessment&#xD;
      by a dietitian will be performed. A morning urine specimen will be collected for the&#xD;
      determination of microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio. Patients also will have baseline&#xD;
      determinations of circulating plasminogen activator inhibitor PAI-1, endothelin-1, VCAM,&#xD;
      ECAM, p-selectin and e-selectin (markers of endothelial damage), C-reactive protein and&#xD;
      interleukins (markers of inflammation); PAI-1 (marker o hypercoagulable state); plasma lipids&#xD;
      (total HDL/LDL cholesterol and triglycerides), as well as LDL and HDL particle size, and&#xD;
      apolipoproteins A1, B and C-III. All personal data, anthropometric measurements (height,&#xD;
      weight, waist-to-hip ratio), dietary history, vital signs and clinical findings will be&#xD;
      recorded in a confidential master file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Euglycemic Insulin Clamp with Muscle Biopsies. The degree of insulin resistance will be&#xD;
      estimated with the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique (23) using an insulin infusion&#xD;
      rate (80 mU/m2.min), as previously described (24). Briefly, one week after completion of the&#xD;
      screening visit 2 (Visit 3), patients will report to the Clinical Research Unit at 8:00 AM&#xD;
      after a 10-12 hour overnight fast. Catheters will be inserted into a peripheral vein (for&#xD;
      infusion of all test substances) and into a retrograde hand vein (for blood sampling), which&#xD;
      will be placed in a heated box (750 C). At time t = -120 minutes, a percutaneous biopsy of&#xD;
      the vastus lateralis muscle will be performed under local anesthesia as previously described&#xD;
      (25). The subject then will be allowed to rest in bed for 60 minutes. At time t = -30 min to&#xD;
      0 min baseline blood samples will be obtained. At time = 0 min, insulin will be infused at 80&#xD;
      mU/m2.min for 180 minutes to raise the plasma insulin concentration to approximately 120&#xD;
      µU/ml to examine peripheral tissue (muscle) sensitivity to insulin. During the insulin clamp,&#xD;
      a small amount of blood (0.5 ml) is withdrawn every 5 minutes from the arterialized venous&#xD;
      blood (heated box technique) to determine plasma glucose concentration. When the plasma&#xD;
      glucose concentration declines to 100 mg/dl a variable infusion of 20% dextrose is&#xD;
      appropriately adjusted to maintain the plasma glucose concentration constant at this level&#xD;
      (±5%). The rate of exogenous glucose infusion will be averaged during the last 60 minutes to&#xD;
      provide a quantitative measure of insulin-mediated (primarily muscle) total glucose disposal.&#xD;
      Insulin infusion will be stopped and the study will be terminated at t = 180 minutes.&#xD;
      Patients will be observed for an additional 90 minutes after consuming a meal and they will&#xD;
      be allowed to leave after plasma glucose is stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular Studies. Subjects will be asked to return to the Clinical Research Unit one week&#xD;
      after the euglycemic insulin clamp for vascular studies (Visit 4). Change in forearm blood&#xD;
      flow following brachial artery infusion of acetylcholine (endothelial NO-dependent) and&#xD;
      sodium nitroprusside (endothelial-independent) will be used to assess the arterial&#xD;
      vasodilatory response to physiological stimuli. All test substances will be infused into the&#xD;
      non-dominant arm. After local skin anesthesia with lidocaine, a 20-gauge needle attached to&#xD;
      an arterial line (Arrow International, Erding, Germany) will be used to cannulate the&#xD;
      brachial artery. A pressurized 0.9% saline solution bag will be connected to the arterial&#xD;
      line, and a constant drip will be started at t = -60 min to keep the arterial line patent&#xD;
      throughout the study. Subjects will then be allowed to rest for 60 minutes. At time t = -5&#xD;
      min, five consecutive measurements of forearm blood flow will be performed using a mercury&#xD;
      strain gauge plethysmography (Hokanson Plethysmograph, Model EC4, Hokanson, Bellevue, WA),&#xD;
      combined with a rapid cuff inflator. Test substances will be infused according to a variation&#xD;
      of the original design of Bergholm et al, as follows. After completion of baseline&#xD;
      measurements, an intra-brachial infusion of sodium nitroprusside at 3 microg/min will be&#xD;
      started and continued for 12 minutes (the last 6 minutes are used to establish the local&#xD;
      vascular effect of sodium nitroprusside). At time t = 12 min, the infusion rate of sodium&#xD;
      nitroprusside is increased to 10 microg/min and the infusion continued for an additional 6&#xD;
      minutes. At time t = 18 min, the sodium nitroprusside infusion is stopped and 2 ml of blood&#xD;
      is withdrawn to clear the arterial line. Saline is then infused for 30 minutes and at time t&#xD;
      = 48 min, an intra-brachial infusion of acetylcholine at a constant rate of 15 microg/min is&#xD;
      started and continued for 8 minutes (the last 6 minutes are used to establish the local&#xD;
      vascular effect of acetylcholine). At time t = 54 min, the infusion rate of acetylcholine is&#xD;
      doubled to 30 microg/min and the infusion continued for and additional 6 minutes. Forearm&#xD;
      blood flow is measured five consecutive times during the last 3 minutes of each&#xD;
      intra-brachial infusion period, i.e., at time t = 9-12 min and t = 15-18 min, respectively&#xD;
      during the low and high nitroprusside dose, and at time t = 51-54 min and t = 57-60 min,&#xD;
      respectively during the low and high acetylcholine dose. At time t= 60 min, the acetylcholine&#xD;
      infusion is stopped and the study terminated. At the end of the experiment the arterial line&#xD;
      is removed and compression to the area applied for 10 minutes. The radial pulse is verified&#xD;
      every 5 minutes during the 30-min period after the experiment is terminated, before subjects&#xD;
      are allowed to leave. Subjects will be contacted within 24 hrs and 1week after completion of&#xD;
      the study to ascertain that there have been no complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of baseline metabolic and vascular studies patients will be started on&#xD;
      pioglitazone, 30 mg per day (Visit 6). Patients will be asked to continue with their previous&#xD;
      medical regimen and will be followed by the PI/nursing team at the Texas Diabetes Institute.&#xD;
      All participants will be contacted weekly by phone to ascertain that there are no adverse&#xD;
      events during the initiation period of 4 weeks, at which time the dose of pioglitazone will&#xD;
      be increased to 45 mg per day. All patients will be required to return for office visits at 6&#xD;
      weeks intervals during the entire 6 months of the study (Visits 7-10). All available records&#xD;
      of capillary blood glucose, adverse events and other major events will be collected and added&#xD;
      to a confidential file under the patients' assigned number. Office visits every six weeks are&#xD;
      intended to review patients' interim medical history to document adverse events, to emphasize&#xD;
      adherence to the medical regimen, to obtain blood for laboratory determinations, and record&#xD;
      vital signs, body weight, neurologic and fundoscopic findings. Blood and urine measurements&#xD;
      similar to those in Visit 2 also will be obtained. Metabolic and vascular studies similar to&#xD;
      those described above (Visits 3,4,5) before the initiation of pioglitazone therapy will be&#xD;
      performed again at 3 and 6 months (Visits 8 and 10) and insulin clamps with muscle biopsies&#xD;
      will be repeated at the end of the 6 month period (Visit 10). Patients will be discontinued&#xD;
      from the study program for any of the following reasons: 1) the principal investigator&#xD;
      decides that the subject should be withdrawn, either because of serious adverse events or&#xD;
      clinically significant laboratory abnormalities; 2) the subject requests that he/she be&#xD;
      withdrawn; 3) the subject becomes pregnant during the study; and 4) the subject is&#xD;
      non-compliant with study guidelines, recommendations, and for the treatment regimen. Early&#xD;
      termination at any time will be accompanied by collection of data as outlined in Visit 10.&#xD;
      Any patient who is withdrawn from the study will be followed for as long as necessary to&#xD;
      establish a stable therapeutic program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Tests. Measurements of fasting plasma glucose (Beckman Glucose Analyzer), HbA1c&#xD;
      (32) insulin (33) and C-peptide (34) by radioimmunoassay, and free fatty acids by HPLC (35)&#xD;
      will be performed in the principal investigator's laboratory at the Texas Diabetes Institute,&#xD;
      as previously described. Assays for VCAM and ICAM (3), p-Selectin and s-Selectin (4), PAI-1&#xD;
      and endothelin-1 (36), and plasma lipids by MRS (37) and apolipoproteins (38) will be&#xD;
      performed in the laboratories of the Diabetes Division at the University of Texas Health&#xD;
      Science Center. Measurements of IRS-1 thyrosine phosphorylation, PI-3 kinase activity and&#xD;
      association of PI-3 kinase with IRS-1 also will be performed in the Diabetes Division&#xD;
      laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Data Analysis Methods. We will perform correlation analyses to examine the&#xD;
      relationships between the increment in skin and forearm blood flow following acetylcholine&#xD;
      infusion and the improvements in plasma hemoglobin A1c levels and whole body insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity before and after pioglitazone therapy using ANOVA with repeated measures over&#xD;
      time. We anticipate that pioglitazone treatment will improve glycemic control and tissue&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity and that the improvements in hemoglobin A1c and insulin action will be&#xD;
      closely related to improvements in acetylcholine-stimulated increments in skin and forearm&#xD;
      blood flow. Changes in insulin sensitivity (insulin clamp data), insulin signaling pathways&#xD;
      activity, nitric oxide production in vivo, endothelial function, FPG and HbA1c will be&#xD;
      compared. Further, we anticipate that plasma levels of endothelial damage markers&#xD;
      (ICAM/VCAM), p-Selectin, s-Selectin and PAI-1 and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein&#xD;
      and interleukins), which are elevated in diabetic patients, will be reduced following&#xD;
      pioglitazone, and that the reduction will correlate with the improvements in skin and muscle&#xD;
      endothelial function. We also expect to observe an improvement in the plasma lipid profile,&#xD;
      especially triglycerides and free fatty acids after pioglitazone treatment. Similar&#xD;
      correlations between improved endothelial-independent blood flow (nitroprusside-stimulated)&#xD;
      following pioglitazone treatment and enhanced insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, nitric&#xD;
      oxide production and insulin signaling pathways will also be performed. We expect that&#xD;
      improved insulin sensitivity (insulin clamp) and increased NO production in vivo following&#xD;
      pioglitazone treatment will be closely related to enhanced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and&#xD;
      total IRS-1 associated PI-3 kinase activity, which we previously have shown to be markedly&#xD;
      impaired in type 2 diabetic individuals (39). In contrast, we expect that the MAP-kinase&#xD;
      (mitogenic) pathway, which regulates vascular smooth muscle cell growth/proliferation and&#xD;
      which we have shown to be normal or upregulated in type 2 diabetics, may be inhibited&#xD;
      following pioglitazone treatment. It would be of great pathogenic significance if reduction&#xD;
      in the MAP kinase activity correlated with the improved endothelial function following&#xD;
      pioglitazone therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation was based upon the changes in forearm blood flow in response to&#xD;
      acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside in normal and diabetic subjects during preliminary&#xD;
      studies and from previously published studies by Caballero et al (10). The pooled standard&#xD;
      deviation for changes from baseline to endpoint in forearm blood flow (ml/100gr per min) in&#xD;
      our laboratory is 1.20. In order to detect with 90% power a difference in forearm blood flow&#xD;
      in response to these physiologic agents before and after 6 months of pioglitazone therapy, 40&#xD;
      completed patients are required. Assuming a dropout rate of approximately 20%, 50 diabetic&#xD;
      patients must be recruited to obtain 40 completers. Based on the laser Doppler skin blood&#xD;
      flow measurements, we have an 80% chance of showing an improvement of ~50% in skin blood in&#xD;
      response to physiologic stimuli (from 65% to 100%) following pioglitazone therapy. Thus, we&#xD;
      will have more than sufficient diabetic individuals to detect statistically significant&#xD;
      changes in skin and muscle blood flow.&#xD;
