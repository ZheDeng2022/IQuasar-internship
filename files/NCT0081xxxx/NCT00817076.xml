    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness and safety of desloratadine (Aerius)&#xD;
      syrup in children with allergic skin inflammation. Patients took desloratadine syrup once a&#xD;
      day for 28 days. Once a week, the doctor measured the patient's symptoms. This measurement is&#xD;
      called SCORAD. The doctor also rated how much relief the patient got from treatment and&#xD;
      recorded any side effects.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children must be from &gt;= 6 to &lt; 12 years of age, of either sex and any race.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children's parent(s) or legal representative(s) must demonstrate their willingness to&#xD;
             participate in the study and comply with its procedures by signing an informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children must be in general good health; i.e. they must be free of any clinically&#xD;
             significant disease other than atopic dermatitis (AD) that would interfere with study&#xD;
             evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children's parent(s) or legal representative(s) must understand and be able to adhere&#xD;
             to the dosing and visit schedule, and agree to report concomitant medications and&#xD;
             adverse events to the Investigator or designee.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The diagnosis of AD will be performed according the Hanifin and Rajka criteria&#xD;
             (Hanifin JM, Rajka G. Diagnostic features of atopic dermatitis. Acta Derm Venereol&#xD;
             (Stockhr) 92 (suppl): 44-70, 1980): to be included in this study, children needed to&#xD;
             manifest at least 3 major features and 3 minor features at visit 1 (day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children must be clinically symptomatic with AD at visit 1 (day 1). Disease severity&#xD;
             will be estimated using the SCORAD Index (European task force on atopic dermatitis.&#xD;
             Severity scoring of atopic dermatitis: the SCORAD Index. Dermatology 186: 23-31,&#xD;
             1993), and child must have a SCORAD Index at least &gt;= 35.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children who have not observed the designated washout period for any of the prohibited&#xD;
             medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with bronchial asthma who require chronic use of inhaled or systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with a history of hypersensitivity to desloratadine, or any of its&#xD;
             excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children who have any current evidence of clinically significant hematopoietic,&#xD;
             metabolic, cardiovascular, immunologic, neurologic, hematologic, gastrointestinal,&#xD;
             hepatic, renal, psychiatric, or cerebrovascular, or any other disorder which, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the Investigator, may interfere with the study evaluations or affect&#xD;
             children safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A known lack or response to H1-antihistamines.&#xD;
