      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized&#xD;
      radiation therapy, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy, that delivers a high dose&#xD;
      of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal&#xD;
      tissue. It is not yet known which radiation therapy schedule is more effective in treating&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying three different radiation therapy&#xD;
      schedules to compare how well they work in treating women who have undergone breast&#xD;
      conservation surgery and systemic therapy for early breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test dose-escalated intensity-modulated radiotherapy after breast conservation&#xD;
           surgery in women with early breast cancer who are at higher than average risk for local&#xD;
           recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to center. Patients&#xD;
      are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (control): Patients undergo sequential boost dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy&#xD;
           (IMRT) 5 days a week for 4.6 weeks (23 fractions; 56 Gy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients undergo concurrent boost dose IMRT 5 days a week for 3 weeks (15&#xD;
           fractions; 48 Gy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm III: Patients undergo concurrent boost dose IMRT 5 days a week for 3 weeks (15&#xD;
           fractions; 53 Gy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality-of-life questionnaires are administered at baseline, 6 months, and at 1, 3, and 5&#xD;
      years. Photograph assessments of the breasts are taken at baseline and at 3 and 5 years.&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically thereafter. Tissue samples are also&#xD;
      collected from primary tumor, including new primary tumor in either breast, and recurrent&#xD;
      tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed annually for 10 years.&#xD;
