      Surgical removal of the gallbladder is needed in 1 million people per year in the USA. The&#xD;
      procedure is done by placing four tubes (cannula) from 5 to 10 mm through the abdominal wall.&#xD;
      Air is placed in the abdominal cavity and a lighted scope is placed through one cannula. The&#xD;
      space in the abdominal cavity can then be seen on a video screen. Thin retractors and&#xD;
      dissecting instruments are placed through the other cannula and the gallbladder is removed&#xD;
      using the video screen for vision. The gallbladder duct and the artery are usually occluded&#xD;
      with clips or stitches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we propose to do the procedure though a single 5 mm incision placed at the&#xD;
      umbilicus and a second access through the vagina using a flexible endoscope. The gallbladder&#xD;
      will be retracted using strings (sutures) attached to the gallbladder. The dissection will be&#xD;
      done using laparoscopic instruments (scissors, knives, dissectors) placed through the&#xD;
      laparoscopic port. A flexible grasper may be used in the endoscope to help with retraction.&#xD;
      An endoscopic snare or grasper will be used to grasp the gallbladder and remove it from the&#xD;
      abdomen through the vagina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates the ability to do laparoscopic cholecystectomy with one skin incision&#xD;
      and one vaginal incision. This will provide the basis for future studies evaluating decreased&#xD;
      pain and costs with transvaginal assisted cholecystectomy.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND When doing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, there are generally four ports placed&#xD;
      through four separate skin incisions. One port is used for a rigid laparoscope, two for&#xD;
      retraction, and one for dissecting. We have recently started to reduce the number of&#xD;
      incisions for laparoscopic cholecystectomy to one umbilical incision. Three ports are used&#xD;
      through one incision by suspending the gallbladder to the abdominal wall using sutures. This&#xD;
      allows the surgeon to eliminate incisions and the patients have reduced postoperative wound&#xD;
      pain and improved cosmesis. However, by using standard laparoscopic rigid instruments and&#xD;
      optic systems it is challenging to perform this operation via a single incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) has been used in females to&#xD;
      reduce the size and number of fascial incisions of the anterior abdominal wall. This vaginal&#xD;
      approach has generally been done with the aid of laparoscopy (hybrid procedure). The vaginal&#xD;
      assistance may allow small abdominal wall incisions resulting in less pain and faster&#xD;
      recovery than after the standard laparoscopic approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a phase I study of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy using a single 5 mm port and&#xD;
      transvaginal endoscopic assistance in 10 female patients. The procedure will have at least&#xD;
      one 5 mm laparoscopic port for safety and assistance. Conversions to conventional&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery will be done if difficulties are encountered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE Reduction in the number of ports required in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy requires two or more fascial port sites to&#xD;
      perform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative hypothesis: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be done with a single 5 mm&#xD;
      laparoscopic port with transvaginal assistance of flexible endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard laparoscopic procedure will be used as the control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This study will be conducted as a prospective, single site, non-randomized,&#xD;
      single-arm study among elective surgery patients. Subjects will be enrolled from a population&#xD;
      of otherwise healthy females undergoing laparoscopic surgery for cholelithiasis,&#xD;
      cholecystitis, or biliary dyskinesia. Patients enrolled in the study will have a flexible&#xD;
      transvaginal endoscopy used during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Subjects enrolled will be&#xD;
      told that the primary purpose of the study is to try to reduce the number of laparoscopic&#xD;
      ports and skin incisions that are necessary to perform their cholecystectomy. Subjects will&#xD;
      be followed for approximately 6 weeks post treatment for purposes of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURE At surgery, the patient will be placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.&#xD;
      Sterile prep and drape of the anterior abdominal wall, perineum, and vagina will be&#xD;
      obtained.. A 7-8 mm umbilical skin incision will be made. Using standard techniques, a Veress&#xD;
      insufflation needle will be placed at the umbilicus to establish pneumoperitoneum. A 5 mm&#xD;
      laparoscopic port will then be placed at the umbilicus. Pressure will be set from 6 to 15 mm&#xD;
      of mercury to obtain an adequate working space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then undergo a pelvic exam by a gynecologist followed by placement of a&#xD;
      weighted speculum into the vagina. Forceps or tenaculum will then be used to grasp the&#xD;
      posterior lip of the cervix and the cervico-vaginal junction identified. A uterine&#xD;
      manipulator will be placed into the uterus to allow manipulation of the uterus. A 10 mm&#xD;
      incision will be made though the posterior vaginal wall 1 cm from the cervix. The patient&#xD;
      will then be placed into deep Trendelenburg positioning. A 10mm trocar will be placed against&#xD;
      the posterior vaginal fornix creating a point of pressure on the pelvic peritoneum visible by&#xD;
      laparoscopy. This point will be in the midline of posterior fornix between the utero-sacral&#xD;
      ligaments. The weighted speculum will be removed and gently steady pressure will be applied&#xD;
      to the vaginal trocar until entry into the posterior cul-de-sac is directly visualized by the&#xD;
      laparoscope. Alternatively, the colpotomy will be performed without using a trocar, under&#xD;
      direct vision. One of two Olympus flexible scopes will be used. An 8.7 mm sterile Olympus&#xD;
      flexible single channel gastroscope can be placed though the vaginal port. A 2 channel scope&#xD;
      requires removal ofthe10 mm vaginal port and placement of the 2 channel scope over a wire.&#xD;
      All scope insertions will be observed under laparoscopy for safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gallbladder will then have 1-4 sutures or endoloops attached to the gallbladder and&#xD;
      placed through the anterior abdominal wall using a 1 mm suture passer (GraNee). Dissection&#xD;
      will be done around the cystic duct using commercially available laparoscopic dissectors. For&#xD;
      dissection of the gallbladder and cystic duct/artery, the flexible instruments will be used&#xD;
      via the endoscope as alternative to laparoscopic instruments where appropriate. The cystic&#xD;
      duct will be clipped with laparoscopic clips and divided. The cystic artery will be dissected&#xD;
      clipped and divided in a similar fashion. The gallbladder will then be dissected from the&#xD;
      gallbladder bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If indicated by the surgeon to facilitate or complete the procedure, laparoscopic ports will&#xD;
      be added through additional abdominal wall incision sites. Laparoscopic instruments will&#xD;
      assist in the procedure as needed by the judgment of the surgeon. The addition of&#xD;
      laparoscopic ports and/or instruments will be documented. Rarely the gallbladder cannot be&#xD;
      removed in a laparoscopic fashion and must be removed in an open manner. This same risk is&#xD;
      present for any laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the gallbladder is detached, the traction sutures will be cut. An endoscopic snare or&#xD;
      grasper will be used to grasp the gallbladder and remove it from the abdomen through the&#xD;
      vagina. Should an endocatch bag be needed to extract the gallbladder, it will be placed via&#xD;
      the vaginal port and visualized by laparoscopy. The gallbladder bed will be inspected and&#xD;
      irrigated. The skin is closed in a subcuticular manner. The laparoscopic fascial port will&#xD;
      not be closed which is standard for 5 mm ports. The posterior vagina will be closed with a&#xD;
      running absorbable suture. The pelvic peritoneum will not be closed which is standard in many&#xD;
      pelvic operations. Post operative care with be identical to laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;
