  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral supplementation with enzymes that can cut gluten has been suggested as a potential&#xD;
      treatment modality for coeliac disease. In the present study the investigators wish to&#xD;
      determine if co-administration of such an enzyme, a prolyl endoprotease derived from the food&#xD;
      grade organism Aspergillis niger (AN-PEP), is capable of detoxifying 8 grams of gluten in a&#xD;
      commercial food product.&#xD;

      The objective of the study is to determine whether AN-PEP enzyme is effective in mitigating&#xD;
      the effects of 8 g wheat protein ingestion in patients with celiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourteen patients with coeliac disease, 18-70 years old are recruited. During the first&#xD;
      period, patients consume once daily a gluten-containing food product with the AN-PEP enzyme&#xD;
      for 2 weeks. After a 2-week washout period (second period), patients enter the third period&#xD;
      of this study, and are randomized to one of two groups and consume the same gluten-containing&#xD;
      food product with AN-PEP or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 1: Patients are given a food product containing 8 g of wheat protein, to which AN-PEP&#xD;
      is added, once daily for 14 d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 2: Wash-out period of 14 d. During this period, patients will consume a gluten-free&#xD;
      diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 3: Patients who are negative for coeliac disease symptoms during the 1st period will&#xD;
      be randomized across two groups. Both groups receive a food product containing 8 g of wheat&#xD;
      protein once daily for 14 d. One group receives additional AN-PEP with the gluten meal&#xD;
      whereas the other group receives the placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will visit the outpatient clinic five times; one visit before the start of the&#xD;
      study, a visit during and at the end of the first period, and a visit during and at the end&#xD;
      of the third period. During three of the visits, spike-biopsies are taken from the duodenum&#xD;
      by oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy. Blood samples are taken during all of the five visits.&#xD;
      Patients will also fill in a quality of life questionnaire at the start and the end of the&#xD;
      first and third period.&#xD;
