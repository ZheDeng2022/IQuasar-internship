    <textblock>
      Hypothesis : Early active range of motion protocol after open reduction and internal fixation&#xD;
      of a distal radius fracture with a volar fixed angle locking plate results in earlier return&#xD;
      of functional motion, earlier return to work and improved functional outcomes compared&#xD;
      delayed mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare early range of motion versus delayed motion protocol in distal radius fractures&#xD;
      treated with open reduction and internal fixation with a volar fixed angle locking plate with&#xD;
      respect to time to fracture union, range of motion, functional outcome measures, return to&#xD;
      work and complications.&#xD;

      You are scheduled for surgery of your broken wrist. Treatment of broken bones of the wrist,&#xD;
      such as distal radius fractures, may require different types of treatment. For this study&#xD;
      this type of fracture will be treated by surgery to place a plate with screws to the broken&#xD;
      bone and then a plaster splint will be applied. After surgery, physical therapy will be&#xD;
      started. Following surgery you will be assigned to one of four groups by the type of wrist&#xD;
      fracture (broken bone) you have. Each person will by chance (the flip of a coin) be put in&#xD;
      either the Early or Delayed Range of Motion groups. Those in the Early Range of Motion groups&#xD;
      will begin exercises for motion starting 7 days after surgery. Those in the Delayed Range of&#xD;
      Motion, will begin exercises for motion starting about five weeks after surgery. Once you&#xD;
      begin the exercises to help you get back normal use of your wrist, you will have measurements&#xD;
      of how much motion and strength you have in the wrist and hand that was fractured. The&#xD;
      measurements will take about five minutes to complete. All participants will have an x-ray of&#xD;
      the wrist at 2, &amp; 6 weeks following surgery and if needed at other appointments. At each&#xD;
      appointment you will be asked to fill out four questionnaires, asking about pain and how you&#xD;
      are getting along with the broken bone in your wrist. The questionnaires will take about 20&#xD;
      minutes of your time to complete. At Week 26 you will be asked to record the amount of motion&#xD;
      you have in both of your wrists on paper drawings as well as the measurements that we will&#xD;
      make. Working with the drawings will take approximately five minutes. At Week 52 you will be&#xD;
      asked two questions about how satisfied you are with the results of your surgery. Surgery,&#xD;
      x-ray of your wrist, and exercise to help you get back motion of your broken wrist are all&#xD;
      standard orthopedic practice for treating a broken wrist bone.&#xD;
