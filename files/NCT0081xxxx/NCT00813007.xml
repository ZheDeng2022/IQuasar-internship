      Before Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, before you have the abdominal radical trachelectomy&#xD;
      surgery, the following information will be recorded during one of your regular clinic visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your race and date of birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your complete medical and surgical history, including the date of your diagnosis and&#xD;
           your diagnosis before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your weight, height, and body mass index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During and After Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During and after surgery, the following information will be gathered from your medical record&#xD;
      or you will be asked:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there was any blood loss during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How long the surgery lasted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there were any complications during the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you needed any blood transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What type of instrument was used for preventing or sealing blood loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How long you stayed in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you experienced any infections within 1 month after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you experienced any complications within 1 month or later than 1 month after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The length of time it took to recover your bowel and urinary function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you received any treatments for cancer after surgery, such as radiation therapy,&#xD;
           chemotherapy, or hormonal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a year for up to 5 years, if you return for an annual routine follow up visit, the&#xD;
      results of any pap smears you have had will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a year for up to 5 years, you will also be asked the following questions about your&#xD;
      health and fertility, either by mail or during a regular clinic visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the status of the disease?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Did you want to get pregnant in the last year?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Did you attempt to get pregnant?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Did you become pregnant? If so, how you became pregnant and the outcome of the&#xD;
           pregnancy? If not how long did you try to become pregnant and did you try any form of&#xD;
           assisted reproduction?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will complete 4-5 questionnaires at each of the following times:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within 2 weeks before your surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 4-6 weeks after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 6 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 1 year after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once a year for the next 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These questionnaires will ask about your physical health, mental and emotional health, pain,&#xD;
      vitality, social functioning, general health, quality of life, and sexual functioning. It&#xD;
      will take about 15 minutes to complete 5 questionnaires. If you do not receive your follow-up&#xD;
      care at MD Anderson, the questionnaires will be mailed to you at the above time-points with a&#xD;
      prepaid return envelope. Mailed questionnaires will be returned to the study chair in an&#xD;
      envelope marked CONFIDENTIAL with NO RETURN ADDRESS on the return envelope. Your name will&#xD;
      not appear on the questionnaires or return envelope. Instead, a code will be used (on the&#xD;
      questionnaires only) that will connect the questionnaires with your medical record. Only the&#xD;
      study chair or study coordinator will have access to the code document. The document is kept&#xD;
      in a locked filing cabinet and/or password protected computer. All responses will be stored&#xD;
      in a locked office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be on study for up to 5 years. If the disease returns, you will be taken off study.&#xD;
