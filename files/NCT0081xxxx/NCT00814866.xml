      Osteoclastic bone resorption depends on both the capacity to generate osteoclasts&#xD;
      (osteoclastogenesis) and on individual osteoclast activity. The investigators objective is to&#xD;
      study the effect of anti-TNF therapy on the number of osteoclast precursors in the peripheral&#xD;
      blood of patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, on in vitro osteoclastogenesis and on osteoclast&#xD;
      activity before and during the treatment of patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis with&#xD;
      Adalimumab.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Osteoclasts (OCs) are cells specialized in bone degradation that participate in bone and&#xD;
      joint destruction in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Experimental models have clearly demonstrated&#xD;
      that OCs are essential for local bone resorption in arthritis. In RANKL knockout mice(1; 2),&#xD;
      in rats receiving OPG(3-6) or in c-fos(-/-) hTNF transgenic mice(7) induction of arthritis&#xD;
      leads to inflammation but not to bone erosion. Systemic osteoporosis is an important&#xD;
      comorbidity in RA(8; 9). Increased systemic bone resorption due to OC activation occurs even&#xD;
      in early (&lt; 2 years) RA and correlates with disease activity(10). Bisphosphonates are&#xD;
      effective in preventing systemic bone loss in inflammatory diseases, but for unknown reasons&#xD;
      do not seem to influence periarticular bone erosion and joint destruction. Finally, a&#xD;
      systemic factor affecting osteoclastogenesis seems to be present in RA, as shown by an&#xD;
      increased formation of OCs from bone marrow of patients with severe arthritis when compared&#xD;
      to controls(11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TNF-alpha is a major pathologic mediator in RA. It may induce bone resorption either&#xD;
      directly, stimulating osteoclastogenesis(12; 13) or indirectly, by influencing RANKL, OPG and&#xD;
      prostaglandin production by osteoblasts(14; 15). These pathways may be important for the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of several diseases such as periodontitis, Rheumatoid arthritis and&#xD;
      osteoporosis(16; 17). In mice, TNF-alpha increases the number of osteoclast precursors in&#xD;
      vivo but its role may, however, be more complex and implicate also&#xD;
      osteoclastogenesis-inhibiting mechanisms(18; 19); in fact, in certain conditions, TNF-alpha&#xD;
      may decrease osteoclastogenesis(20), so the in vivo effect of blocking TNF may be difficult&#xD;
      to predict from these models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-TNF agents reduce bone destruction in RA but it is not clear how this effect is achieved&#xD;
      since, as described in the preceding paragraph, TNF has been shown to have antagonistic&#xD;
      effects in osteoclast formation and activity. Moreover, little is known of the effect of&#xD;
      anti-TNF therapy on osteoclast biology in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is based on two different but closely related hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment with anti-TNF agents (Adalimumab in this case) may reduce the number of&#xD;
           circulating osteoclast precursors, in vitro osteoclastogenesis and in vitro bone&#xD;
           resorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Addition of Adalimumab to the culture medium used to differentiate osteoclasts in vitro&#xD;
           may inhibit osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoclastic bone resorption depends on both the capacity to generate osteoclasts&#xD;
      (osteoclastogenesis) and on individual osteoclast activity. Our objective is to study the&#xD;
      effect of anti-TNF therapy on the number of osteoclast precursors in the peripheral blood of&#xD;
      patients with RA, on in vitro osteoclastogenesis and on osteoclast activity before and during&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with RA with Adalimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design : As a clinical trail aimed at studying the impact of anti-TNF treatment on&#xD;
      osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activity we will study one cohort of patients with RA&#xD;
      before and at two points after beginning of the therapy, 3 and 6 months, so that each patient&#xD;
      will be his/her own control (before/after study). The two time points after introduction of&#xD;
      the therapy are needed for two reasons : 1) The time when an eventual effect on the&#xD;
      parameters studied may reach its peak is not known and 2) To assure that the parameters&#xD;
      measured are stable over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes will be the difference in the following parameters before and after&#xD;
      treatment with Adalimumab (3 and 6 months):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the number of osteoclast precursor (CD14+) cells in the peripheral blood&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the number of osteoclasts generated in vitro&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the amount of bone resorption in vitro&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Parallel in vitro differentiation assays (number of osteoclasts generated and amount of&#xD;
           bone resorption) in the presence of exogenous Adalimumab in the concentration range&#xD;
           found in the plasma of treated patients to detect a direct effect of the medication in&#xD;
           vitro in osteoclastogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. disease activity defined as a DAS28 score (21; 22)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Change in functional status by the M-HAQ (23)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Patients satisfying the ACR Criteria for RA(24) and having received a&#xD;
      prescription of Adalimumab from a rheumatologist at the Centre hospitalier universitaire de&#xD;
      Sherbrooke. Patients having received other anti-TNF therapies are eligible only after 5&#xD;
      half-lives of the previous medication. Patients must be willing to sign an informed consent.&#xD;
      Concomitant medication other than anti-TNFs and other biologicals is allowed and the treating&#xD;
      rheumatologist can adjust it on the best interest of the patients. This study has, thus, no&#xD;
      impact on the routine treatment of the patients. Concomitant medication will be recorded and&#xD;
      considered in the final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria : Patients under age 18 or not capable or willing to provide informed&#xD;
      consent, patients starting Adalimumab less than five half lives after the interruption of a&#xD;
      previous anti-TNF therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and statistics: The sample size was calculated based on the distribution and&#xD;
      variance of the primary outcome, i.e. the number of osteoclasts generated in vitro. From a&#xD;
      population of 51 normal donors in our laboratory the number of osteoclasts generated was&#xD;
      601.1 ± 156.8 osteoclasts/well (data presented at the 2007 annual meeting of the Canadian&#xD;
      Rheumatology Association, in press at the Journal of Rheumatology). We considered a test&#xD;
      significance level of 5% (α = 0.05) and the power of 80% to detect a difference of at least&#xD;
      100 osteoclasts/well between the groups (paired two-tailed t-test), which led to a total of&#xD;
      22 patients. Considering a 10% loss due to technical reasons the sample size was established&#xD;
      at 25 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples: 50 ml of blood in heparin will be collected from each patient no more than 2&#xD;
      months before the beginning of treatment with Adalimumab and 3 and six months after the first&#xD;
      administration of the drug (± 2 weeks). DAS-28, HAQ scores, comorbidities and concomitant&#xD;
      medication will be determined and recorded at the same times and the coded data stored in a&#xD;
      secure database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoclast Studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoclastogenesis: PBMCs will be isolated from 50 ml of blood by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient and&#xD;
      the number of CD14+ OC precursors will be determined by FACS. The whole population of PBMCs&#xD;
      will be plated in 48-well tissue culture plates containing a bone slice or a glass slide, and&#xD;
      the cells will be allowed to differentiate for 21 days in the presence of recombinant RANKL&#xD;
      (75 ng/ml) and M-CSF (10 ng/ml). The cells are then fixed and stained for TRAP activity and&#xD;
      with hematoxylin. The number of TRAP+ cells containing three or more nuclei will be counted&#xD;
      in each well. Triplicates will be used for each patient. In parallel wells the cells will be&#xD;
      incubated in the same conditions but in the presence of Adalimumab in concentration&#xD;
      comparable to that found in vivo after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OC resorptive activity: For bone resorption assays, cells differentiated for 21 days on bone&#xD;
      slices will be stained for TRAP and 0.2 % toluidine blue. Resorption surface area will be&#xD;
      quantified using the image analysis program, Simple PCI. Parellel assays will be done in the&#xD;
      presence of Adalimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The groups before and after intervention will be compared using parametric paired two-tailed&#xD;
      tests for the variables with a normal distribution and with non parametric tests whenever&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated results&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies will allow us to determine if treatment with Adalimumab has an effect on the&#xD;
      number of circulating osteoclast precursors, on the generation of osteoclasts and on the&#xD;
      bone-resorbing activity of these cells. It will also allow to determine if Adalimumab, in&#xD;
      concentrations found in vivo, may have a direct impact on human osteoclastogenesis and bone&#xD;
      resorption. Perhaps more importantly, correlation of the osteoclast results with the clinical&#xD;
      parameters studied may allow us an insight on whether an eventual effect on osteoclasts may&#xD;
      correlate with the clinical response to the medication, indicating a possible additional&#xD;
      mechanism of action of Adalimumab in Rheumatoid Arthritis.&#xD;
