    <textblock>
      Chorioamnionitis occurs in 1% to 5% of term pregnancies and may complicate up to 25% of cases&#xD;
      of preterm labor. The traditional regimen used to treat intra-amniotic infection is&#xD;
      intravenous ampicillin 2g every 6 hours and intravenous gentamicin 1.5 mg/kg every 8 hrs&#xD;
      until delivery . In the past the recommendation has been that the antibiotics be continued&#xD;
      postpartum until 24-48 hours afebrile. More recent studies have looked at using a one time&#xD;
      dose of antibiotics after delivery vs treating until 24-48 hours afebrile. There have been no&#xD;
      studies comparing treatment of chorioamnionitis with antibiotics vs no treatment with&#xD;
      antibiotics postpartum. The aim of this study is to compare no treatment vs treatment with&#xD;
      one dose after a vaginal delivery and one dose of antibiotics vs a full course until 24 hours&#xD;
      afebrile after a cesarean delivery complicated by chorioamnionitis. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      there will be no difference in outcome between the two groups in each arm. This is a&#xD;
      randomized study. Once the patient delivers she will be randomized to one of two groups in&#xD;
      each arm. First arm (vaginal delivery) A: no treatment, B: treatment with a one time dose of&#xD;
      ampicillin/gentamicin; Second arm (c/s) A: one dose of ampicillin/gentamicin/clindamycin, B:&#xD;
      treatment with ampicillin/gentamicin and clindamycin until 24 hours afebrile. The goal of the&#xD;
      study is to determine the optimal postpartum management of chorioamnionitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chorioamnionitis refers to infection of the amniotic fluid, membranes, placenta and/or&#xD;
      uterus. Clinical chorioamnionitis is defined by a temperature of 380 C or more and one or&#xD;
      more of the following findings: maternal heart rate &gt; 100 BPM, baseline fetal heart rate &gt;&#xD;
      160 BPM, uterine tenderness, or foul smelling amniotic fluid. It complicates 0.5 to 10.5&#xD;
      percent of deliveries and accounts for 10 to 40 percent of cases of maternal febrile&#xD;
      morbidity in the peripartum period and 50 percent of preterm deliveries before 30 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation. Chorioamnionitis is also associated with 20 to 40 percent of cases of early&#xD;
      neonatal sepsis and pneumonia. (Hagberg et al). The most extensively tested antibiotic&#xD;
      regimen is ampicillin 2 g IV every 6 hours and gentamicin 1.5mg/kg every 8 hours. After&#xD;
      delivery clindamycin 900 mg IV q 8 hours can be used for further coverage in those women&#xD;
      delivering by cesarean section. The treatment is usually continued until the patient is&#xD;
      asymptomatic for 24 - 48 hours although that treatment is primarily based on expert opinion.&#xD;
      (Edwards et al). Potential benefits of not needing to treat with antibiotics after a delivery&#xD;
      complicated by intramniotic infection is shortened hospital stay and reduced cost. No studies&#xD;
      up until now have compared treatment verses no treatment head to head for vaginal delivery&#xD;
      and one postpartum dose vs. continued treatment for 24 hours in the women undergoing a&#xD;
      cesarean delivery. Unfortunately the Duff study combined patients analyzing both vaginal&#xD;
      deliveries and cesarean deliveries together. They were both treated with either the single&#xD;
      dose of antibiotics or continual treatment with antibiotics until afebrile and asymptomatic&#xD;
      for 24 hours. He found no statistical significant difference in treatment failure in the one&#xD;
      dose vs. multiple dose groups. This finding was the primary outcome of the study.Our study&#xD;
      will be a double blind placebo controlled randomized study. There will be two arms: vaginal&#xD;
      delivery and cesarean delivery. The first arm consists of patients who have had a vaginal&#xD;
      delivery complicated by chorioamnionitis. They will be randomized into one of two groups: 1)&#xD;
      no further antibiotics after delivery ( they will receive a saline infusion instead of&#xD;
      antibiotics but this will be labeled in the pharmacy and neither the patient nor the&#xD;
      physician will know whether the patient is receiving antibiotics or saline) or 2) one&#xD;
      additional dose of antibiotics (ampicillin 2 grams IV, gentamicin 1.5 mg/kg IV) following&#xD;
      their vaginal delivery. The second arm of this study consists of patients who have had a&#xD;
      cesarean delivery complicated by chorioamnionitis. They will also be randomized into one of&#xD;
      two groups: 1) one dose of ampicillin 2 grams IV, gentamicin 1.5 mg/kg IV, clindamycin 900 mg&#xD;
      IV and then saline infusions instead of antibiotics until they are afebrile for 24 hours (&#xD;
      they will receive saline infusions instead of antibiotics but this will be labeled in the&#xD;
      pharmacy and neither the patient or the physician will know whether the patient is receiving&#xD;
      antibiotics or saline) or 2) ampicillin 2 g IV every 6 hours, gentamicin 1.5mg/kg every 8&#xD;
      hours, and clindamycin 900 mg IV every 8 hours until the patient has been afebrile for 24&#xD;
      hours. For the patients in both arms of the study the primary outcome will be treatment&#xD;
      failure defined as either a single temperature of 39 C or two or more temperatures of 38.4 C&#xD;
      or more at least 4 hours apart after delivery in the vaginal group or after the first&#xD;
      antibiotic dose in the cesarean group. All treatment failures will be treated with ampicillin&#xD;
      2 grams IV every 6 hours, gentamicin 1.5 mg/kg every 8 hours and clindamycin 900 mg every 8&#xD;
      hours until the patient has been afebrile and asymptomatic for 24 hours. Timing of&#xD;
      temperature spikes or other symptoms associated with uterine infection will be noted as well&#xD;
      as number of doses of antibiotics and infection related complications such as wound&#xD;
      infection, pelvic abscess and septic pelvic thrombophlebitis. Patients will be recruited from&#xD;
      the Labor and Delivery unit here at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth. All patients that&#xD;
      develop chorioamnionitis will be offered participation in the study. All women greater than&#xD;
      18 years old will be eligible to participate. Patients will be consented by the residents and&#xD;
      staff working on labor and delivery. Exclusion criteria will include those who do not wish to&#xD;
      participate, patients who are allergic to the study antibiotics, women who are&#xD;
      immunocompromised or women receiving antibiotics for other reasons such as prophylaxis for&#xD;
      bacterial endocarditis.&#xD;
