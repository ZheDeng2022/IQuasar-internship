    <textblock>
      Background: Patients that suffer from respiratory failure and need mechanical ventilation are&#xD;
      at risk of further deterioration due to complications induced by progression of lung disease&#xD;
      or the mechanical ventilation. The complications usually develop in a progressive manner, but&#xD;
      are currently detected relatively late, when there is already severe and life threatening&#xD;
      deterioration in patient oxygenation and sometimes irreversible damages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:To measure chest wall dynamics, derived from sensors placed on the chest and&#xD;
      abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The system comprises of patches attached to the chest wall and upper abdomen that&#xD;
      include mechanical sensors that measure the mechanics of lung inflation and deflation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients that suffer from respiratory failure and need mechanical ventilation are at risk of&#xD;
      further life threatening deterioration following the development of mechanical problems&#xD;
      related to airway management, development of lung barotrauma or displacement of the&#xD;
      endotracheal tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonates especially need tight and sensitive monitoring of lung ventilation, because of the&#xD;
      high prevalence of lung disease and need for ventilatory support in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The system comprises of patches attached to the chest wall and to the epigastrium. The&#xD;
      patches include sensors that measure the mechanics of the lung inflation and deflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following parental informed consent, three patches will be placed on both sides of the&#xD;
           chest and over the epigastric area in infants that require tight respiratory monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patches will be placed just beside the ECG patches.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The placement of the patches will be performed by a physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The monitoring can be preformed as long as the baby needs a tight respiratory&#xD;
           monitoring. The patches will be replaced according to routine replacement policy of&#xD;
           patches in the neonatal intensive care units, and at the regular time defined by the&#xD;
           attending staff, and no longer than 24 hours. At the end of the data acquisition, the&#xD;
           patches will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No additional intervention is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will be inspected by the supervising physician involve in the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It will not provide any data that may alter the treatment and will not interfere or&#xD;
           influence the other monitoring devices that are used to evaluate the clinical status of&#xD;
           the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The other parameters that are regularly monitored, that are displayed on the bedside&#xD;
           monitor and respirator will be recorded by the research assistant. The ventilated baby&#xD;
           will be identified by a study number. There will be a separate database for the&#xD;
           measurements and the demographic and clinical data. There will be no disclosure of the&#xD;
           patient's identity along with the data analysis and publication of the results or&#xD;
           communication to authorities or other medical practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipment safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The system is safe for the use in human subjects. The whole system is approved for safety&#xD;
      according to the acquired standard ICE-60601&#xD;
