      Phase 1 - Optimization Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: The primary objective of Phase 1 of this study is to determine the time&#xD;
      point at which maximal Circulating Tumor Cell Burden (CTCB) occurs following standard&#xD;
      vertebroplasty and Kyphoplasty procedures relative to baseline CTCB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 - Comparison Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: The primary objective of Phase 2 of this study is to determine the change&#xD;
      in CTCB from baseline to post-treatment as measured using the CellSearch™ Assay and to&#xD;
      compare the average change between treatment groups with and without the use of the Cavity&#xD;
      SpineWand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the change in self-reported pain level from baseline to post-treatment as&#xD;
           measured using the visual analogue scale (VAS) for spine pain and to compare the average&#xD;
           change in pain level between treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the change in pain status from baseline to post-treatment as measured using&#xD;
           the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and to compare the average change in pain status between&#xD;
           treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the change from baseline to post-treatment in the M.D. Anderson Cancer&#xD;
           Center Symptom Inventory (MDASI) and to compare the average change between treatment&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the change from baseline to post-treatment in time to walk a 50-foot&#xD;
           distance and to compare the average change between treatment groups.&#xD;

      Kyphoplasty and Vertebroplasty:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are types of surgery that are used to treat broken bones in&#xD;
      the back, which may have been caused by cancer. Both procedures involve injecting a mixture&#xD;
      of medical cement into the broken bone(s) in the back. The cement is designed to harden and&#xD;
      become a permanent part of the bone, supporting the bone like an &quot;internal cast&quot; that brings&#xD;
      it back to its original shape. The amount of cement will vary from person to person, but it&#xD;
      could be, for example, anywhere from a fraction of a teaspoon to a full teaspoon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main difference between the 2 procedures is that kyphoplasty involves the use of a small&#xD;
      medical type of balloon, and vertebroplasty does not use balloons. Vertebroplasty also uses a&#xD;
      slightly smaller needle to inject the cement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Device:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cavity SpineWand is a rod-shaped surgical tool that is designed to use a type of energy&#xD;
      called plasma in order to destroy tissue at lower temperatures than other surgical methods.&#xD;
      This may help to lessen damage to other nearby tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the Cavity SpineWand will be used to remove tissue (soft tissue, bone tissue,&#xD;
      or both, but this will vary from person to person), including all or part of the cancerous&#xD;
      tumors in the area of the broken bone(s). This is designed to make extra room for the cement&#xD;
      to be injected, either during the vertebroplasty procedure or the kyphoplasty procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can receive treatment in this study, you will have &quot;screening tests&quot; to help the&#xD;
      doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. If you have had some of these&#xD;
      tests done recently, they may not need to be repeated. This will be up to your study doctor.&#xD;
      The following tests may be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and a computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
           scan. These scans will show pictures of your broken back bone(s) and the tumor. Your&#xD;
           doctor will use these pictures to plan your surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are able to have children must have a negative urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doctors currently do not fully understand whether kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty is better for&#xD;
      treating broken bones in the back. For this reason, and because this study involves randomly&#xD;
      assigning participants to receive one or the other of these procedures, all participants must&#xD;
      be eligible for both procedures in order to take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in the study, you will be assigned to a&#xD;
      treatment group. In each phase of the study, there is an equal chance of being assigned to&#xD;
      any of the treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are one of the first 20 patients enrolled in the study, you will be enrolled in Phase&#xD;
      1. You will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. Phase 1 Group 1&#xD;
      will receive vertebroplasty, and Phase 1 Group 2 will receive kyphoplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are one of the next 60 patients to be enrolled, you will be enrolled in Phase 2. You&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of dice) to 1 of 4 groups. Phase 2 Group 1 will&#xD;
      receive vertebroplasty, and Phase 2 Group 2 will receive vertebroplasty with the Cavity&#xD;
      SpineWand. Phase 2 Group 3 will receive kyphoplasty, and Phase 2 Group 4 will receive&#xD;
      kyphoplasty with the Cavity SpineWand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Tests/Procedures Before Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within about 2-4 weeks before surgery, you will have tests and procedures performed. If you&#xD;
      had some of these tests done recently, they may not need to be repeated. The following&#xD;
      procedures may be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs (blood pressure,&#xD;
           heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete questionnaires that ask about the back pain and any drugs you are&#xD;
           taking. In total, the questionnaires should take about 10-20 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked to walk 50 feet at your own pace while being timed to see how long it&#xD;
           takes you. This is a routine test for comparing your walking function before and after&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will sign a separate consent form for surgery and the drugs used during surgery. These&#xD;
      drugs include antibiotics to help lower the risk of infection, drugs to control pain, local&#xD;
      anesthesia to make the area of your back where you are having surgery feel numb, and a&#xD;
      sedative to make you feel relaxed and sleepy. The risks of these drugs will be explained to&#xD;
      you in detail at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Test on the Day of Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of surgery, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn. This blood will be compared&#xD;
      with the blood that is drawn after surgery, to see when after surgery the most tumor cells&#xD;
      are found in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Procedures Before Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As is standard for these types of surgery, special &quot;bone&quot; needles will be placed into the&#xD;
      broken bone(s) in your back. X-rays will be used to guide the needles into a safe position. A&#xD;
      biopsy of the tumor in your back bone will be collected to check the diagnosis of cancer. To&#xD;
      collect a biopsy, a small amount of tumor tissue is withdrawn through the bone needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Phase 2 Group 2 or Phase 2 Group 4, the Cavity SpineWand will be used to remove&#xD;
      a small amount of tissue immediately before the kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Phase 1 Group 2, Phase 2 Group 3, or Phase 2 Group 4, the kyphoplasty procedure&#xD;
      will be done next. A small balloon will be placed into the area in your back where the tumor&#xD;
      is located. Fluid will then be pumped through the tube in order to fill the balloon, which&#xD;
      will create a hole in the back bone. After the balloon is deflated (closed) and removed, this&#xD;
      hole will then be filled with cement. X-rays will be used to help place the cement safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Phase 1 Group 1, Phase 2 Group 1, or Phase 2 Group 2, the vertebroplasty&#xD;
      procedure will be done next (instead of the kyphoplasty). Cement will be injected into the&#xD;
      back bone. X-rays will be used to help place the cement safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No matter which treatment group you are in, if you have more than 1 broken back bone that&#xD;
      needs treatment, the procedures described above will be repeated for a second broken bone,&#xD;
      right after your first procedure. In other words, if you had vertebroplasty performed without&#xD;
      the Cavity Spine Wand, that same procedure would be performed for the second bone. The&#xD;
      procedure would only be repeated this 1 additional time, and not a third time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No matter which treatment you receive, the entire procedure should take about 2-3 hours. If&#xD;
      you need to have the procedure repeated on a second broken bone, this additional procedure&#xD;
      should add about 45 minutes to the 2-3 hours that the first procedure alone would have taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Testing for Phase 1 Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 participants will have blood (about 1 tablespoon each time) drawn at 8 different&#xD;
      times points in order to measure the number of tumor cells. This blood will be drawn at 10,&#xD;
      30, and 60 minutes, and then at 2 hours, and between 6-8 hours, 10-18 hours, 20-28 hours, and&#xD;
      7 days after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Testing for Phase 2 Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 participants will have blood (about 1 tablespoon each time) drawn at 4 different time&#xD;
      points after surgery. The first and second blood draw will occur before 36 hours has passed.&#xD;
      The third blood draw will be about 36 hours after the surgery, and the fourth blood draw will&#xD;
      be about 7 days after the surgery. This blood will be tested to measure the number of tumor&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to return for follow-up visits at 7 days after your surgery and again at 4&#xD;
      weeks after your surgery. At these visits, the following tests and procedures will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the questionnaires that ask about the back pain and any drugs you are&#xD;
           taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked to walk a 50-foot distance, and your walk will be timed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the Day 7 visit only, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to measure the number&#xD;
           of tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the Week 4 visit only, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire that asks you to&#xD;
           rate how satisfied you feel with the surgery. It should take about 10 minutes to&#xD;
           complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3 months after your surgery, the study staff will call you at home to ask about the back&#xD;
      pain and any drugs you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the Month 3 follow-up phone call, your active participation in this study will be over.&#xD;
      If it is determined after your surgery that the tumor in your back was not cancerous, you&#xD;
      would still return for the follow-up visits as is standard, but you would not need to have&#xD;
      the Day 7 blood test to measure the number of tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty procedures are&#xD;
      commercially available and FDA approved for the way they are being used in this study. The&#xD;
      Cavity SpineWand is also commercially available and FDA approved for the way it is being used&#xD;
      in this study. The research-specific part of this study is the blood testing to measure any&#xD;
      increases in the number of cancer cells in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 100 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
