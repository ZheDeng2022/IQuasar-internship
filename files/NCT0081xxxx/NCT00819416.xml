      Severe infection in the intensive care unit is common accounting for about 10% of admissions&#xD;
      and has a death rate of approximately 40-50%. It is almost always associated with significant&#xD;
      reductions in blood pressure. Administration of fluid often in large volumes is essential to&#xD;
      normalize blood pressure and prevent failure of organs and death. Two common classes of fluid&#xD;
      solutions are crystalloid fluids (salt based, normal saline) and colloid fluids (protein&#xD;
      based, albumin). Due to its properties, the albumin fluid may remain in the vascular space&#xD;
      better than the normal saline solution. Hence, there may be faster attainment of normal blood&#xD;
      pressure as well as a reduction in failed organs and death. Preliminary clinical trial data&#xD;
      suggests a potential for benefit with albumin in this setting but these findings require&#xD;
      confirmation in a large clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are few data to explain how albumin may exert its protective effects and lead to better&#xD;
      outcomes for patients with severe infections. We will conduct a clinical study that will&#xD;
      examine potential biological mechanisms for albumin's protective effects in 50 patients&#xD;
      across 6 Canadian academic hospitals. We will also examine our ability to successfully&#xD;
      recruit patients into this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide information that will help to understand the biological mechanisms of&#xD;
      albumin in severe infection. The information gained will guide the investigative team for&#xD;
      future fluid related mechanistic questions. The study will also provide essential information&#xD;
      that will aid in the design and conduct of the future large clinical trial that will examine&#xD;
      death as its primary outcome.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Severe sepsis and septic shock are the most common causes of mortality among&#xD;
      critically ill patients and account for approximately 10% of admissions to the intensive care&#xD;
      unit (ICU) and 3% of all admissions to hospital. Despite decades of therapeutic&#xD;
      investigation, mortality of septic shock has remained at approximately 40-50%. Fluid&#xD;
      resuscitation is an integral component of early treatment, as several liters of fluid may be&#xD;
      administered in the first hours of septic shock in an attempt to re-establish hemodynamic&#xD;
      stability. The two main classes of fluid expand the plasma volume include crystalloids and&#xD;
      colloids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Canada, the main crystalloid fluids used for resuscitation are normal saline and ringers&#xD;
      lactate; the main colloid fluids used for resuscitation are hydroxyethyl starches (HES) and&#xD;
      albumin. Until recently, no randomized controlled (RCT) or systematic review had confirmed&#xD;
      benefit or harm with either colloidal or crystalloid fluids in this patient population. An&#xD;
      RCT published in 2008 demonstrated that 10% pentastarch (HES fluid) causes acute renal&#xD;
      failure defined by the requirement for renal replacement therapy. In contrast, a subgroup&#xD;
      analysis from a RCT of severe sepsis suggests that 4% albumin fluid may reduce death.&#xD;
      However, these hypothesis-generating findings require confirmation in the context of a large&#xD;
      RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are limited observational mechanistic studies designed to understand the potential&#xD;
      biological mechanisms for albumin's potential protective effects in sepsis. Moreover,&#xD;
      mechanistic data in the clinical trial setting are lacking. The PRECISE pilot RCT (Five&#xD;
      Percent Albumin versus Normal Saline as Fluid Resuscitation Strategies for the Management of&#xD;
      Early Suspected Septic Shock) will help to understand the biological mechanisms of albumin in&#xD;
      early septic shock and explore feasibility issues in preparation for a large RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypotheses: We hypothesize that resuscitation with 5% albumin as compared to normal&#xD;
      saline in early septic shock may exert some of its protective effects through the following&#xD;
      biological mechanisms: 1) Limiting thrombin generation, 2) Supporting endogenous protein C&#xD;
      and activated protein C (APC) generation, 3) Limiting the production of systemic&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and supporting the production of cytokines and&#xD;
      chemokines with anti-inflammatory potential, and 4) Reducing the ability of septic plasma to&#xD;
      generate Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design/Setting: A multi-centre randomized controlled trial conducted in 6 Canadian&#xD;
      academic centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: The study will enroll 50 adult patients who are identified with early suspected&#xD;
      septic shock from the emergency department (ED) and the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients&#xD;
      need to be hypotensive or require vasopressor agents, have at least 2 systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      response syndrome criteria, and have no other form of shock (e.g., cardiogenic, obstructive,&#xD;
      or hemorrhagic shock) and no previous ICU admission for severe sepsis or septic shock after&#xD;
      receiving at least 1 litre of crystalloid and not more than 250 mls of colloid fluid within 8&#xD;
      hours of the first hypotensive event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 arms. Patients, families,&#xD;
      clinicians, and research personnel will be blinded to the fluid administered (5% albumin or&#xD;
      0.9% normal saline). Fluid resuscitation will begin immediately after randomization and&#xD;
      continue for the first 7 days or until discharge from the ICU or ED if this occurs sooner.&#xD;
      Blood and urine will be collected at randomization and then at 6, 12, 24, 72 hrs and 7 days&#xD;
      later. Study fluid will be administered as rapidly as possible as 500 ml fluid challenges.&#xD;
      All other co-interventions of care will not be protocolized or mandated during the study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is a comparison of thrombin generation at 72&#xD;
      hours, and protein C and APC levels at 7 days. Secondary outcomes include a comparison of&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels in the blood and urine. Other clinical outcomes&#xD;
      will include mortality in ICU, hospital, and at 30 days, length of stay in ICU and hospital,&#xD;
      development of organ failure, and need for organ support (defined by the number of days&#xD;
      requiring mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy) and feasibility measured in&#xD;
      terms of patient recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Team: The trial will be led by 3 primary investigators (Lauralyn McIntyre, Alison&#xD;
      Fox-Robichaud, and Alan Tinmouth), who will have responsibility for all aspects of the trial.&#xD;
      They have expertise in hematology, transfusion medicine, basic science and clinical trials in&#xD;
      critical care. Our team includes co-investigators from the ICU (Drs. Lauralyn McIntyre, Joe&#xD;
      Pagliarello, Anand Kumar, Sean Bagshaw, Alison Fox-Robichaud, Alexis Turgeon), ED (Drs. Ian&#xD;
      Stiell, Brian Rowe, Andrew Worster, Marcel Emond), and ICU/ED (Drs. Robert Green, David&#xD;
      Easton) who will act as clinical champions at each participating site. Many co-investigators&#xD;
      have extensive experience in the conduct of multi-centre RCTs (Drs. Paul Hebert, Deborah&#xD;
      Cook, Dean Fergusson, John Marshall, Ian Stiell, Brian Rowe, Simon Finfer, Alan Tinmouth,&#xD;
      Lauralyn McIntyre). The translational co-investigative team includes critical care physicians&#xD;
      with expertise in sepsis pathophysiology (Drs. Alison Fox Robichaud, Paul Kubes, Patricia&#xD;
      Liaw, Anand Kumar, John Marshall, Tao Rui, and Claudio Martin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of findings: Results from our PRECISE pilot RCT may provide a biologic rationale&#xD;
      for a beneficial effect of 5% albumin in early septic shock resuscitation. If a biologic&#xD;
      rationale is confirmed, the study will also provide essential information to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility and aid the design of a definitive phase III trial of albumin in resuscitation of&#xD;
      septic shock.&#xD;
