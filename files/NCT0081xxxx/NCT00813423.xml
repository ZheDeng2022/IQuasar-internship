      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of sunitinib malate when given&#xD;
      together with hydroxychloroquine in treating patients with advanced solid tumors that have&#xD;
      not responded to chemotherapy. Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine may help sunitinib malate work better in treating solid tumors. Giving&#xD;
      sunitinib malate together with hydroxychloroquine may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of sunitinib (sunitinib&#xD;
      malate) (Sutent), an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic activity that&#xD;
      inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), stem cell factor receptor&#xD;
      (c-kit) and platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), in combination with&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an inhibitor of autophagy, in patients with advanced solid tumors&#xD;
      that are refractory to standard chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluating blocks of tissue from pre-treatment diagnostic biopsies and tissue from&#xD;
      biopsies taken during therapy, when available from enrolled patients, for expression of&#xD;
      markers beclin1, light chain 3 (LC3), sequestosome 1 (p62) and hypoxia up-regulated 1&#xD;
      (GRp170) as indicators of autophagy potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluating pre- and post- treatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and tumor&#xD;
      tissue, when available, for the presence of autophagosomes by electron microscopy (EM) as&#xD;
      indication of flux through the autophagy pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluating pre- and post- treatment PBMC for changes in the expression of LC3, p62 and&#xD;
      GRp170 with the use of single agent sunitinib and the use of the combination of sunitinib&#xD;
      with hydroxychloroquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Evaluating circulating tumor cells (CTCs) pre- and post- treatment with single agent&#xD;
      sunitinib and sunitinib + HCQ, and characterize these for markers of autophagy. (exploratory)&#xD;
      V. To determine whether the steady-state plasma concentration of HCQ correlates with&#xD;
      inhibition of autophagy and whether a pharmacokinetic interaction exists between sunitinib&#xD;
      and HCQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To examine, when available, post treatment tumor biopsies for vascular markers to detect&#xD;
      decreased vascular proliferation by staining cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31), vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thrombospondin-1, and cluster of differentiation 105&#xD;
      (CD105) staining to monitor micro vessel density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of hydroxychloroquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine PO once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) on days 1-42 (beginning day 4 of&#xD;
      course 1). Treatment repeats every 42 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.&#xD;
