      Patients with diabetes have worse outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)&#xD;
      procedures, compared to those patients without diabetes. They are at increased risk of death,&#xD;
      heart attack, or needing further procedures due to renarrowing of their coronary narrowings&#xD;
      after implantation of a coronary stent. Studies have suggested that poor control of diabetes&#xD;
      may be partly responsible for these poor outcomes. Thiazolidinedione drugs, such as&#xD;
      pioglitazone, can improve the diabetes control and make the patient more sensitive to the&#xD;
      effects of insulin. Preliminary studies suggest that pioglitazone may also help prevent&#xD;
      renarrowing after PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was a pilot study designed to determine whether more aggressive treatment of the&#xD;
      diabetes with the routine use of the drug pioglitazone (30mg/day for 6 months), in addition&#xD;
      to the patient's usual diabetic medications adjusted to optimize their diabetic control (get&#xD;
      glycated hemoglobin &lt; 7%), could reduce the amount of tissue buildup within the stent after 6&#xD;
      months, compared to a group less aggressively treated without pioglitazone and their usual&#xD;
      medications for diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intravascular ultrasound probe was used to assess the extent of tissue buildup within the&#xD;
      stent and this was performed immediately after the PCI as a baseline and repeated after 6&#xD;
      months of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the more aggressive diabetic treatment with pioglitazone&#xD;
      would reduce the extent of tissue growth within the stent after 6 months of therapy.&#xD;

      Background: Despite drug-eluting stents (DES), diabetic patients remain at high risk of&#xD;
      restenosis and poor clinical outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Studies&#xD;
      have suggested poor glycemic control and insulin resistance may be predictors of poor&#xD;
      outcomes after PCI. There are conflicting studies as to whether strategies to improve&#xD;
      glycemic control can improve outcomes after PCI. Thiazolidinediones, such as pioglitazone&#xD;
      (PIO), may have anti-restenotic benefits, independent of glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This study was a single centre prospective, randomized, open-label,&#xD;
      blinded-endpoint (PROBE) parallel design trial. Type 2 diabetic patients, treated with diet&#xD;
      or oral antidiabetic medication (sulfonylurea vs. metformin or combination; but no&#xD;
      thiazolidinedione or insulin), who are undergoing elective or urgent PCI with stenting were&#xD;
      eligible. Fifty type 2 diabetic patients were randomly assigned to either: intensive glycemic&#xD;
      control: pioglitazone (PIO; 30 mg/d x 6 months) in addition to titration of oral hypoglycemic&#xD;
      agents (OHA) to get HbA1c&lt;6% (PIO: n=25) vs. conservative glycemic control: titration of OHA&#xD;
      to get HbA1c&lt;7% (CONTROL: n=25). Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) was performed immediately&#xD;
      after PCI and repeated at 6 months to determine the effect on instent neointimal plaque&#xD;
      volume and area. Coronary stenting was carried out in a standard fashion, with routine use of&#xD;
      a glycoprotein 2b/3a inhibitor during the procedure. From August 2002 until June 2005, DES&#xD;
      were not permitted in the protocol. After June 2005, we amended the protocol to allow DES, as&#xD;
      they had become routinely used in diabetic patients in our institution, especially for vessel&#xD;
      size &lt;3mm and/or lesion length&gt;15mm. DES were used in 7 PIO and 11 CONTROL subjects, and bare&#xD;
      metal stents (BMS) in the rest. Patients were then followed with clinic visits at 1, 3 and 6&#xD;
      months. OHA, other than pioglitazone, were adjusted in a stepwise manner in order to attain&#xD;
      the HbA1c targets. Other concomitant medications, including anti-anginals, lipid-lowering&#xD;
      therapy, and antihypertensive medication were adjusted according to their clinical need and&#xD;
      current Canadian guidelines. After 6 months treatment, or before if clinically indicated, all&#xD;
      subjects were to return for repeat cardiac catheterization, including repeat coronary&#xD;
      angiography and IVUS of the intervened vessel to assess the serial change in luminal&#xD;
      dimensions. Fasting blood was collected for plasma glucose, HbA1c, insulin, lipid profile,&#xD;
      hs-CRP, adiponectin, leptin, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and interleukin-6 at the time of PCI&#xD;
      and at the follow-up IVUS. If the patient developed recurrent ischemic symptoms before 6&#xD;
      months, the final IVUS could be performed earlier, if they were found to have&#xD;
      clinically-significant restenosis (diameter stenosis &gt; 50%). Otherwise, patients were still&#xD;
      encouraged to have their protocol 6 month IVUS follow-up. 41 patients (n=20 PIO, n=21&#xD;
      CONTROL) had analyzable pairs of IVUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: We hypothesized that there would be significantly less instent neointimal&#xD;
      proliferation on IVUS at 6 months in the group receiving aggressive glycemic control plus the&#xD;
      thiazolidinedione pioglitazone. We also hypothesized that the reduction in neointimal&#xD;
      hyperplasia will likely relate to improvements in glycemic control (HbA1c) and insulin&#xD;
      resistance. Additionally, we wanted to explore the biochemical predictors (glucose&#xD;
      parameters, lipids, inflammatory markers, adipokines) for neointimal proliferation.&#xD;
