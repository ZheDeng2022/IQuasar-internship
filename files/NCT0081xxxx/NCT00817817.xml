    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, comparative, randomized, parallel, multicenter study in asthmatics to&#xD;
      determine whether the administration of dry powder inhaled mometasone furoate (MF) 400 μg in&#xD;
      a monodose capsule device would be comparable to administration of powder inhaled MF 400 μg&#xD;
      in a multidose device.&#xD;

          -  Must be &gt;=18 years of age, of either gender &amp; of any race.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have had a diagnosis of asthma for at least 6 months, characterized by recurrent&#xD;
             episode of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness &amp; coughing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline FEV1 must be &gt;=55% and &lt;=85% of predicted at the Screening Visit, when all&#xD;
             restricted medications have been withheld for the specified intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must demonstrate evidence of an increase in absolute FEV1 of &gt;=12%, with an absolute&#xD;
             volume increase of at least 200 mL, after reversibility testing at the Screening Visit&#xD;
             or documented in the patients chart reversibility up to 1 year previous to inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be free of any clinically significant disease (other than asthma), that would&#xD;
             interfere with study evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be willing to give written informed consent and be able to adhere to dose &amp; visit&#xD;
             schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must agree to inform their own usual treating physician about their participation in&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-pregnant women of childbearing potential must be using a medically acceptable,&#xD;
             adequate form of birth control. This includes: 1) hormonal contraceptive as prescribed&#xD;

             prescribed IUD; 3) condom in combination with a spermicide; 4) Monogamous relationship&#xD;
             with a male partner who has had a vasectomy or is using a condom plus spermicide&#xD;
