        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female, ages 18-65 years, inclusive, at Screening. Eligible female subjects of&#xD;
             childbearing potential with a nonsterilized male sexual partner must agree to use a&#xD;
             hormonal contraceptive, barrier contraceptive with additional spermicide, or an&#xD;
             intrauterine device beginning &gt;30 days prior to study drug administration and&#xD;
             continuing until &gt;7 days after the end of the study. Female subjects who are&#xD;
             postmenopausal must have been postmenopausal for &gt;1 year if they wish not to use&#xD;
             contraceptives. If postmenopausal status is questionable, the subject's follicle&#xD;
             stimulating hormone (FSH) level must be checked and must be elevated and consistent&#xD;
             with postmenopausal levels (i.e., &gt;40 IU/L); otherwise these subjects must agree to&#xD;
             use contraceptives listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to comply with all study visits and procedures, including returning&#xD;
             as scheduled for post-treatment visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to speak, read, and understand the language of the informed consent, and any&#xD;
             other instruments used for collecting subject-reported outcomes, in order to enable&#xD;
             accurate and appropriate responses to study assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and capable of providing written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with Hepatic Impairment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a positive diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (hepatic fibrosis with&#xD;
             evidence of either micro- or macro-nodular regeneration) that has been stable for two&#xD;
             months and is confirmed by imaging techniques, biopsy, or physical signs consistent&#xD;
             with a clinical diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (e.g., liver firmness to palpation,&#xD;
             splenic enlargement, spider angiomata, palmar erythema, parotid hypertrophy,&#xD;
             testicular atrophy, gynecomastia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have an impaired but stable hepatic function evidenced by Child-Pugh&#xD;
             Clinical Assessment Score between 7 and 9 at both screening and baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Control Subjects with Normal Hepatic Function:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be in general good health as determined by past medical history,&#xD;
             physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, Chest X-Ray (CXR), and&#xD;
             laboratory tests at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects should be matched to a hepatically impaired subject in gender, age (±15%) and&#xD;
             weight (±20%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of hypersensitivity to amide type local anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy, nursing, or planning to become pregnant during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight less than 60 kg (~132 lbs) or more than 120 kg (~264 lbs).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI of less than 18 or more than 35 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant acute, new onset illness (e.g., flu, gastroenteritis) within two weeks&#xD;
             prior to study treatment administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant haematological, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal,&#xD;
             cardiovascular, neurological, or psychiatric disease that may pose a significant&#xD;
             safety risk or diminish subject's ability to undergo all study procedures and&#xD;
             assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of immunocompromised status, including a positive HIV (ELISA and Western blot)&#xD;
             test result.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of active alcohol or drug abuse as indicated by the tests conducted during&#xD;
             the screening or baseline evaluations; subject must state they are willing to remain&#xD;
             alcohol and drug free for three weeks after study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of ASA within 10 days prior to study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of Lidocaine, mepivacaine, etidocaine, ropivacaine, and any amide-type anesthetics&#xD;
             in any form within 5 elimination half-lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any local anesthetic within 3 days prior to study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 elimination half-lives&#xD;
             of such investigational drug, whichever is longer, prior to study drug administration,&#xD;
             or planned administration of another investigational product or procedure during the&#xD;
             subject's participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, renders a subject unsuitable&#xD;
             for participation in the study. NOTE: A specific rationale must be provided and&#xD;
             documented for excluding all prospective subjects deemed unsuitable for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with Hepatic Impairment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormal findings other than hepatic impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical evidence of severe ascites, as judged by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of surgical portosystemic shunt.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fluctuating or rapidly deteriorating hepatic function as indicated by recent history&#xD;
             or by widely varying or worsening of clinical and/or laboratory signs of hepatic&#xD;
             impairment within the screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On active Hepatitis treatment with Interferon or other excluded medications (see&#xD;
             Appendix 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Control Subjects with Normal Hepatic Function:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prohibited prescription medications within 14 days prior to dosing; see Appendix 4 for&#xD;
             specific medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or presence of liver disease or liver injury as indicated by an abnormal liver&#xD;
             function profile such as SGOT, SGPT, GGT, alkaline phosphatase, or serum bilirubin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatitis B as indicated by positive HBs Ag, or Hepatitis C as indicated by positive&#xD;
             anti-HCV result.&#xD;
