    <textblock>
      The study is designed to assess and compare the effect of Vecam 40/300, Vecam 20/300 and&#xD;
      Omeprazole 20 mg (a standard FDA approved GERD treatment) on the control of gastric pH.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Eligible H. pylori negative, normal gastric acid secreting, healthy volunteers will be&#xD;
      treated by the study medications in a randomized, open-label, cross-over study.Up to 60&#xD;
      volunteers may be enrolled to ensure that at least 30 subjects will complete all the study&#xD;
      treatments. Omeprazole 20 mg will be administered before breakfast. Vecam 40/300 and Vecam&#xD;
      20/300 will be administered at bedtime w/o food. 24-hour gastric pH will be measured after&#xD;
      the fifth dose (day 5).Following screening procedures, subjects will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive the different treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All pH measurements will be done in the study center under supervised conditions. All drug&#xD;
      administrations will be supervised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is part of the Vecam clinical development plan.&#xD;
