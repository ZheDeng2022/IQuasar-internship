  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive immunizations every other week for 8 immunizations prior to clinical&#xD;
      and immunological evaluations. Patients will then receive immunizations every month up to one&#xD;
      year. Cyclophosphamide will be administered intravenously 3 days prior to the first&#xD;
      immunization, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and subsequent monthly immunizations. Women and men &gt;= 18&#xD;
      years of age with refractory metastatic malignancies that express NY-ESO-1 by RT-PCR or&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry. Alternatively, patients may be elected on the basis of serum&#xD;
      anti-NY-ESO-!-antibodies as detected by ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To evaluate the toxicity profile of the regimens described in Section 1.6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To detect and quantitate immune responses induced by the proposed&#xD;
      peptide vaccine or protein vaccine in association with CpG 7909 and cyclophosphamide. This&#xD;
      endpoint will be assessed by an IFN-y ELISPOT assay of NY-ESO-1-specific tumor-reactive CD8 +&#xD;
      T cells. We also will look for NY-ESO-1 tetramer CD8+ T cells, Delayed-type Hypersensitivity&#xD;
      (DTH), and NY-ESO-1-specific CD4+ T cell responses with ELISPOT assays and&#xD;
      cytokine-release-assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary Objectives: To evaluate tumor response in terms of clinical tumor regression and&#xD;
      progression-free interval. To evaluate the survival of patients treated with the regimens&#xD;
      described in Section 1.6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 3 patients will be assigned treatment A. All three patients will be treated and&#xD;
      observed for one month. If no DLTs are observed in the first 3 patients, accrual to arm A&#xD;
      will be put on hold and accrual will continue with Arm B. However, if 1 DLT is observed in&#xD;
      Arm A, up to 3 additional patients will be treated on Arm A, until either 2 DLTs have been&#xD;
      observed, or 6 patients have been treated with just 1 DLT among them. If 2 DLTs are observed&#xD;
      in Arm A, the study will terminate and all treatments will be deemed intolerable. The same&#xD;
      principles apply to the cohorts treated on B-E: if the number of DLTs (after one month of&#xD;
      treatment) is zero, accrual proceeds to the next treatment group; if it is 1, accrual&#xD;
      continues with the same treatment for up to 3 additional patients; if it is 2, no patients&#xD;
      will be treated on the remaining treatment arms.&#xD;

&#xD;
         18. Subjects must have fully recovered from surgery, and must not have received any&#xD;
             chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, or biological therapy within the&#xD;
             preceding 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Life expectancy of at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. WHO Performance Status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Normal titers for ANA (&lt;= 1/80) and anti-ds DNA (&lt;= 1/10). Patients with elevated&#xD;
             titers of ANAs (&gt; 1/80) or anti-ds DNA (&gt;1/10) will be excluded from protocol only if&#xD;
             they have symptoms of active auto-immune disease as assessed by specialized&#xD;
             consultation (rheumatologist).&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Subjects need to have recovered from any effects of previous treatments (recovery must&#xD;
             have been documented for at least 1 week prior to treatment on this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Subjects must be free of brain metastasis by contrast-enhanced CT/MRI scans or have&#xD;
             brain metastasis and: the total number of brain metastasis is &lt;=3; each brain&#xD;
             metastasis must have been either completely removed by surgery of treated with&#xD;
             stereotactic radiosurgery (gamma knife); the subject must be asymptomatic for more&#xD;
             than 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Female subjects of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test, and&#xD;
             must not be breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Subjects must agree to use effective contraception (both males and females). We have&#xD;
             decided to include patients with NY-ESO-1-expressing tumors of different histological&#xD;
             types and not only melanoma as we have previously done in the ongoing trial UPCI&#xD;
             00-079. The reasons are several-fold. First, we do not expect that the type of disease&#xD;
             will have an impact on the main objectives (i.e. safety, toxicity and immunological).&#xD;
             Second, we feel it is important to be able to include all eligible cancer patients&#xD;
             with no available therapeutic option and who are willing to be included in a novel&#xD;
             investigative trial. Finally, our experience with the ongoing trial UPCI 00-079 leads&#xD;
             us to think that the large majority of patients will be melanoma patients (17 patients&#xD;
             included to date, including 16 melanoma patients and one sarcoma patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with prostate cancer who demonstrate an anti-androgen withdrawal response,&#xD;
             defined as a &gt;= 25% drop in PSA within 4 weeks (flutamide) or six week (nilutamide,&#xD;
             bicalutamide) of stopping a non-steroidal anti-androgen are not eligible until the PSA&#xD;
             rises above the nadir observed after anti-androgen withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Serious illnesses, such as: cardiovascular disease (uncontrolled congestive heart&#xD;
             failure, hypertension, cardiac ischemia, myocardial infarction, severe cardia&#xD;
             arrhythmia), bleeding disorders, autoimmune diseases, severe obstructive or&#xD;
             restrictive pulmonary diseases, active systemic infections, inflammatory bowel&#xD;
             disorders, severe renal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any significant psychiatric disease, medical intervention, or other condition, which&#xD;
             in the opinion of the principal investigator, could prevent adequate informed consent&#xD;
             or compromise participation in the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Active infection or antibiotics within one-week prior to study, including unexplained&#xD;
             fever (temp &gt; 38.1 degree C).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Treatment with nitrosources within 6 weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Systemic steroid or other immunosuppressive therapy &gt; 10 days within 4 weeks of&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. A requirement for systemic immunosuppressive therapy &gt; 5 days developing during the&#xD;
             trial will result in the subject being removed from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Treatment with any investigational immunization with CpG 7909 and NY-ESO-1 peptides of&#xD;
             NY-ESO-1 protein within two years of registration or treatment with any other&#xD;
             investigational product within 28 days of registration.&#xD;
