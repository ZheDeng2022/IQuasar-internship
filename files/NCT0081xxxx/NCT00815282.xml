    <textblock>
      In the Netherlands, the human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination will be added to the National&#xD;
      Vaccination Program for girls to protect against the development of cervical cancer. The&#xD;
      vaccine protects against HPV type 16 &amp; 18, which cause about 75% of cervical cancer. Studies&#xD;
      have shown that the vaccine is effective in healthy subjects in preventing infection by HPV&#xD;
      16 &amp; 18. However, no evidence exists on the immunogenicity and safety of HPV vaccination in&#xD;
      patients with an immune system disorder, such as primary humoral immunodeficiency (i.e.&#xD;
      hypogammaglobulinemia) or autoimmune diseases. Concerns exist that vaccination may cause an&#xD;
      aggravation of the underlying disease. In addition, the immune response to vaccination may be&#xD;
      diminished due to immunosuppressive therapy or the underlying disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary goal of the current study is to study the immunogenicity of HPV&#xD;
      vaccination in patients with an autoimmune disease and a primary humoral immunodeficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on retrospective analysis with other vaccines we hypothesize that patients with&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases who are under immunosuppressive medication and patients with a immune&#xD;
      system disorder have a decreased serological response to HPV vaccination, and that the&#xD;
      produced HPV antibodies titers decrease more rapidly than in healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to explore safety of HPV vaccination and immune regulatory&#xD;
      mechanisms induced by vaccination in a subset of patients. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      HPV vaccination is safe and that HPV-induced regulatory T cells are able to prevent an&#xD;
      increase in the activity of an autoimmune disease.&#xD;

      Study design: prospective observational cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Females aged 12 - 18 years with one of the autoimmune diseases Juvenile&#xD;
      Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Juvenile Dermatomyositis&#xD;
      (JDM) are included. Included females are treated at the rheumatology unit from the University&#xD;
      Medical Center Utrecht. A small control group of healthy girls aged 13 -17 years will also be&#xD;
      included to compare the kinetics of HPV serology with healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Starting from September 2009 all girls aged 12 years will be offered a HPV&#xD;
      vaccination via the National Vaccination Program. Prior to this, a national campaign will be&#xD;
      started in March 2009 to vaccinate all girls aged 13-17 years at once.We will use this&#xD;
      national vaccination campaign as an opportunity to analyze the serological response and&#xD;
      safety of this vaccine in a large group of with an immune system disorder. The vaccines are&#xD;
      administered by our national health organisation. The effects are monitored in our clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary outcome immunogenicity is measured by antibody levels against HPV serotype 16 &amp;&#xD;
           18 over time. We consider HPV vaccination to be immunogenic at antibody titers above the&#xD;
           cutoffs 20 and 24 mMU/ml for HPV 16 and 18, respectively; or at a â‰¥2 fold increase in&#xD;
           antibody levels against both serotypes. The antibody levels will be measured prior to&#xD;
           vaccination, and after 3,7 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secondary outcome is safety of vaccination, measured as activity of the underlying&#xD;
           autoimmune disease. In addition, frequency of common adverse effects, and immunological&#xD;
           changes induced by HPV vaccination, such as number and function of cytotoxic T cells and&#xD;
           Tregs will be described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burden: included patients will be asked to visit the hospital 4 times in a period of 12&#xD;
      months. During these visits, physical examination will be performed and blood will be&#xD;
      obtained for serological and immunological analysis. Most of these visits are combined with&#xD;
      routine follow-up and venous punctures of the patients. However, one extra visit to the&#xD;
      hospital and vena puncture is expected. 5 ml (extra) blood is obtained four times from all&#xD;
      patients for serological analysis. Included healthy controls will be asked to visit one&#xD;
      plenary information meeting in the evening. Controls will have a venous punctures four times&#xD;
      during the study, during which 5 ml of blood is obtained. These samples will be obtained at&#xD;
      the hospital during evening clinics or at school. In a subset of patients (n=50) and healthy&#xD;
      controls (n=10), an additional 15 ml is obtained for immunological analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks: participants may experience adverse events of the HPV vaccination. Benefits:&#xD;
      Protection against human Papillomavirus infection and therefore reduced risk of cervix&#xD;
      carcinoma, certainty about protection against HPV 16 &amp; 18 and about safety of HPV&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group relatedness: This study can only be done in patients who need this vaccination (i.e.&#xD;
      females in the age group 12-24 years) and have an immune system disorder, such as JIA, SLE or&#xD;
      JDM. Appropriate comparison with healthy controls must be performed in age-matched healthy&#xD;
      females who are also recruited for the National HPV vaccination campaign, in this case girls&#xD;
      in the age group 13-17 years.&#xD;
