  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with underlying heart diseases like hypertensive heart disease, coronary heart&#xD;
      disease or dilative cardiomyopathy obstructive sleep-apnea, central sleep-apnea and&#xD;
      Cheyne-Stokes-respiration are common finding in polysomnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a lot of these patients it is neither a purely obstructive sleep-apnea syndrome nor a&#xD;
      complete Cheyne-Stokes-respiration but a combination of both sleep related respiratory&#xD;
      disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies showed an improvement of the central respiratory disorder, for example&#xD;
      Cheyne-Stokes-respiration, under continuous positive pressure breathing (CPAP) and an&#xD;
      improvement of the left ventricular pump function. (Naughton 1995, Tkacova 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the recently published CanPAP study could not prove any improvement in the mortality&#xD;
      among CPAP therapy patients in comparison to the optimal medical treatment, although under&#xD;
      this therapy, the number of breathing disturbances, the oxygen saturation at night and the&#xD;
      ejection fraction of the left ventricle showed a significant improvement.(Bradley 2005)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earlier studies proved the adaptive servo ventilation to be an effective therapy for patients&#xD;
      with central sleep-apnea and Cheyne-Stokes-respiration respectively. (Teschler 2001)&#xD;
      Teschler's study showed that the adaptive servo ventilation therapy with a reduction of&#xD;
      central sleep apnea down to 10/hours succeeded. With the SOMNOvent CR a new therapy-algorithm&#xD;
      has been developed for the adaptive servo ventilation in patients with obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea and Cheyne-Stokes-respiration with underlying heart disease. In the first validation&#xD;
      study this therapy was very effective and presented only few adverse effects in the patients.&#xD;
      (Galetke 2007)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study was to compare this new therapeutic option (SOMNOvent CR) with the&#xD;
      established method of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in patients with combination&#xD;
      of obstructive sleep-apnea syndrome and Cheyne-Stokes-respiration with underlying heart&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients who meet all the above mentioned criteria and who were diagnosed as sleep-apnoea&#xD;
      syndrome patients in our hospital were asked to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We divided the patients in two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: started with CPAP and continued with SOMNOvent CR Group 2: began with SOMNOvent CR&#xD;
      and ended with CPAP&#xD;
&#xD;
      First of all a CPAP-titration was applied to both fixed groups during the second night.&#xD;
      During the third night they received either the CPAP- pressure (first group) or the adaptive&#xD;
      servo ventilation (second group. The patients were discharged from the hospital continuing&#xD;
      with the procedure of the third night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After four weeks a new admission for the sleep laboratory was necessary and, during the first&#xD;
      night, a control investigation with the procedure of the last four weeks. The procedure&#xD;
      changed during the next night, so that the patients of the first group now slept with the&#xD;
      SOMNOventCR-device and the patients of the second group with the CPAP-device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a wash-out-period of a week and a four-week treatment with the last procedure a final&#xD;
      in-hospital polysomnography was performed in which adaptive servo ventilation was applied to&#xD;
      the first group and fixed CPAP to the second group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the study ended, the patients received the therapy procedure which was the most&#xD;
      effective and which was better tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following analyses were carried out in addition to the polysomnographic measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Admission 1: Berlin questionnaire, European sleep questionnaire, echocardiography, 6 minute&#xD;
      walking test, patients questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Admission 2: ESS, Berlin questionnaire, echocardiography, 6 minute walking test, patients´&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the wash-out-period: ESS, Berlin questionnaire, patients questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Admission 4: ESS, Berlin questionnaire, echocardiography, 6 minute walking test, patients&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
