    <textblock>
      Gemcitabine and cisplatin represent the standard first-line chemotherapy in metastatic&#xD;
      bladder carcinoma. This regimen has replaced in most centers the MVAC combination showing a&#xD;
      similar efficacy but less toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Almost all responding patients relapse within the first year, with a median survival of 12&#xD;
      months. Prognosis is very poor in patients who display progressive disease after receiving&#xD;
      combination cisplatin-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No standard has yet been established for second-line treatment and well designed trials of&#xD;
      second-line chemotherapy for metastatic transitional carcinoma of the urothelium should be&#xD;
      given high priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several drugs have been used in second line for metastatic disease with poor results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have planned a Phase II study, open-label, single arm design to evaluate&#xD;
      the activity and safety of sunitinib in metastatic urothelial carcinoma, pretreated with&#xD;
      standard regimen (cisplatin-gemcitabine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No previous studies have been published with sunitinib in metastatic bladder cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PRIMARY To determine the antitumor efficacy ( response rate) of sunitinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SECONDARY To determine: safety, duration of response, Quality of life (QoL), progression&#xD;
           free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLAN OF TREATMENT Patients received sunitinib at a starting dose of 50 mg per day in repeated&#xD;
      6-week cycles for 4 consecutive weeks followed by 2 weeks off treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sunitinib was self-administered orally once daily without regard to meals. Dose reduction for&#xD;
      toxicity was allowed to 37.5 until 25 mg/day depending on the type and severity of toxicity&#xD;
      encountered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sunitinib treatment was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EVALUATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline evaluations included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical examination;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tumor assessment (total body TC and bone scan )&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assessment of ECOG PS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QoL assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction by echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory measurements. Assessment of efficacy and safety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation according RECIST criteria every 2 cycles (12 weeks) with TC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety according NCI version 3 every cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QoL every cycle EORTC-QOL-C30.â€¢ RESOURCE UTILIZATION ASSESSMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, developed by the EORTC for the measurement of quality of life in&#xD;
      cancer patients in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the analysis, the raw scores of the questionnaire are transformed into a 100-point scale.&#xD;
      For the functional scales, the computed scores range from 0 to 100, with the higher scores&#xD;
      representing a higher level of functioning. For the item scales relative to physical symptoms&#xD;
      and financial impact, higher scores represent a higher level of symptoms or problems .&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefit anticipated (%): &gt;30% of response rate. Test size: 5%. Power 80%. Sample size: 25&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
