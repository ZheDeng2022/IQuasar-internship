  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetes have high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) because pancreatic&#xD;
      beta-cells no longer produce sufficient insulin. Insufficient beta-cell function can be&#xD;
      caused by an autoimmune killing of the beta-cells in type 1 diabetes (T1D), or by poorly&#xD;
      understood mechanisms in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) improves&#xD;
      function of the insulin-producing beta cells, but GLP-1 has a very short circulating&#xD;
      half-life because it is cleaved by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4). One current&#xD;
      treatment being used to improve glycemia control in patients with T2D is sitagliptin, an&#xD;
      inhibitor of DPP-4. By inhibiting DPP-4, sitagliptin increases GLP-1 levels, resulting in&#xD;
      improved beta cell function. Sitagliptin is now being tested in individuals with new-onset&#xD;
      T1D to determine whether it may help to preserve beta cell function. Because T1D is a disease&#xD;
      in which the immune system destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, we wish&#xD;
      to determine if and how sitagliptin alters immune function. Sitagliptin has been shown by&#xD;
      Merck to be safe and effective with no overt immuno-toxicities. However, several lines of&#xD;
      evidence suggest that DPP-4 inhibitors such as sitagliptin could be immunomodulatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized clinical trial will study immune function in healthy volunteers given&#xD;
      short-term (4 week) treatment with either sitagliptin or placebo. During the study, we will&#xD;
      take blood samples at various time intervals before, during and after treatment. We will&#xD;
      compare the immune response with and without sitagliptin treatment using blood samples from&#xD;
      healthy individuals. We will measure changes in the magnitude and type of immune responses.&#xD;
      The study period is nine weeks. The study s primary outcome will be changes in blood plasma&#xD;
      levels of a protein marker associated with decreased inflammation: Transforming Growth Factor&#xD;
      Beta 1 (TGF beta 1). In addition, we plan to use these blood samples to measure sitagliptin s&#xD;
      effect on expression levels of several cytokines (immune proteins). We will also measure the&#xD;
      level of proliferation in stimulated PBMCs (blood immune cells) and gene expression in whole&#xD;
      blood after sitagliptin treatment.&#xD;

      Patients with diabetes have high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) because pancreatic&#xD;
      b-cells no longer produce sufficient insulin. Insufficient b-cell function can be caused by&#xD;
      an autoimmune killing of the b-cells in type 1 diabetes (T1D), or by poorly understood&#xD;
      mechanisms in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Glucagon-like peptide -1 (GLP-1) improves function of&#xD;
      the insulin-producing beta cells, but GLP-1 has a very short circulating half-life because it&#xD;
      is cleaved by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4). One current treatment being used to&#xD;
