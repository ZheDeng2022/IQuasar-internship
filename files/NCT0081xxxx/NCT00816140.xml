      Clarithromycin-based triple therapy containing a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) twice daily,&#xD;
      amoxicillin 1g twice daily, and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for 7 days is one of the&#xD;
      standard firs-line therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication. However, because of&#xD;
      unsatisfactory eradication rate (80-85%), the Maastricht III guideline recommended extending&#xD;
      the treatment duration to increase the eradication rate. Recently, levofloxacin (500 mg&#xD;
      qd)-based triple therapy has been shown to achieve an eradication rate of 90% for both the&#xD;
      first- and second-line treatment for H. pylori eradication. Several studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that high dose (750mg) and short-course (5 days) levofloxacin is as effective and well&#xD;
      tolerated as traditional dose (500mg) and course (10 days) for treatment of mild-to-severe&#xD;
      community acquired pneumonia. The high dose and short-course therapy has the potential to&#xD;
      increase patient compliance and reduce bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones. However,&#xD;
      whether increasing the dosage of levofloxacin from 500mg to 750 mg qd can augment the&#xD;
      efficacy of triple therapy in eradication of H. pylori and shorten the duration of therapy&#xD;
      remains unknown. Although levofloxacin-based regimen was presumed to be more effective,&#xD;
      previous reports pointed the concern that resistance to fluoroquinolone and other antibiotics&#xD;
      which susceptible to the pumping efflux of bacteriae would increase among the gut flora.&#xD;

      Determination of H. pylori status Prior to enrollment, the status of H. pylori infection will&#xD;
      be determined by (1) rapid urease test (CLO test, Kimberly-Clark, USA) from antrum biopsy,&#xD;
      (2) histological examination (Giemsa stain) of antral and body samples (two from the antral&#xD;
      mucosa and two from the corpus mucosa), and (3) culture. Positive in any two of the three&#xD;
      tests will be defined as positive for H. pylori infection. After-treatment H. pylori status&#xD;
      will be determined by 13C-Urea Breath Test (13C-UBT) at 6 weeks after the completion of&#xD;
      treatment. Successful eradication of H. pylori is defined as a negative 13C-UBT result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eradication Therapy Using a computer-generated number sequence, patients who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and do not have any one of the exclusion criteria will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive one of the following regimens: (1) CALa regimen: clarithromycin 500mg twice daily,&#xD;
      amoxicillin 1000mg twice daily, and lansoprazole 30mg twice daily for 7 days, or (2) LALa&#xD;
      regimen: levofloxacin 750mg (levofloxacin500 1.5 tablets) once daily, amoxicillin 1000mg&#xD;
      twice daily, lansoprazole 30mg twice daily for 7 days (Figure 1). Adverse events will be&#xD;
      recorded throughout the trial and during the follow-up period. Patients who do not return for&#xD;
      13C-UBT at 6 weeks after completion of treatment will be considered lost-to-follow-up and&#xD;
      will be excluded from the per protocol (PP) analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue regimen for treatment failure after first-line regimen Patients who remained positive&#xD;
      for H. pylori after the initial treatment as determined by the 13C-UBT will be followed by&#xD;
      endoscopy. Biopsy will be done for H. pylori culture and antibiotic susceptibility test. All&#xD;
      of them will then be treated with rescue regimen. The rescue regimens will be given in a&#xD;
      cross-over manner (Figure 1). Patients who are treated with CALa regimen for 7 days as&#xD;
      initial treatment will be treated with LALa regimen for 10 days as rescue treatment. Patients&#xD;
      who are treated with LALa regimen for 7 days as initial treatment will be treated with CALa&#xD;
      regimen for 10 days as rescue treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance and Adverse Effect Patients' compliance will be assessed by standardized interview&#xD;
      at the end of treatment as well as by pill count in the medication boxes returned at the&#xD;
      interview. Compliance is considered low when more than 20% of pills is found in the box. At&#xD;
      enrollment, the patients will be informed of the common side effects from the studied&#xD;
      antibiotics, including diarrhea, taste disturbance, nausea, bloating, loss of appetite,&#xD;
      vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, headache, and skin rash.&#xD;
