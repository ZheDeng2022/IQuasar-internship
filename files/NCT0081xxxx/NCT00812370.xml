  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thrombosis is a significant medical complication in children with chronic diseases. The&#xD;
      currently utilized treatments have many drawbacks which can lead to poor outcomes. More&#xD;
      modern therapies are available but have not been systematically tested in children. This&#xD;
      study will determine whether one such medication, bivalirudin is a safer and more effective&#xD;
      alterative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will monitor what effects the drug has upon the child's body and how the body&#xD;
      processes the study drug (absorption, metabolism and elimination). The study will also&#xD;
      evaluate the drug's effectiveness by following how long it takes to dissolve the clot. The&#xD;
      safety issues being monitored relate to any observations of major or minor bleeding episodes&#xD;
      after taking the drug, and/or any other side effects.&#xD;

      This will be an open-label, single-arm, dose-finding, pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy&#xD;
      study of bivalirudin in children 6 months to 18 years of age with deep vein thrombosis. The&#xD;
      specific aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pharmacodynamic analysis based on the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) will&#xD;
           be performed and the best bolus dose and initial infusion dose of bivalirudin will be&#xD;
           determined for 3 age cohorts of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pharmacokinetic analysis of bivalirudin will be determined based on bivalirudin plasma&#xD;
           levels in the same 3 age cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Comparison of pharmacokinetics with pharmacodynamics will be performed to determine&#xD;
           whether the aPTT is an adequate surrogate for plasma bivalirudin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The rate of clot resolution within 48-72 hours will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The safety of bivalirudin will be determined by assessing for major and minor bleeding&#xD;
           and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 30 patients will be enrolled in this study. They will be divided into 3 groups&#xD;
      according to their age range (6 months-age to &gt; 5, 5 to &gt; 12 years and 12 to &gt;18 years). The&#xD;
      patient must have a deep vein thrombosis (clot in an artery or vein) that has been seen on an&#xD;
      imaging test. After receiving the study drug, the subjects will then have blood tests at&#xD;
      specific timepoints to measure how the drug is effecting the body and how the drug is acting&#xD;
      once it is in the body. Based upon the levels of the blood tests, the dose of the study drug&#xD;
      may be adjusted or stopped. The subject will continue on the drug until the clot is&#xD;
      dissolved, the subject is prescribed a different anticoagulant or the physician or parents&#xD;
      decide to remove the child off of the study. The drug will also be discontinued if any&#xD;
      excessive bleeding or severe side effects related to the drug are observed. A follow up&#xD;
      imaging study will be performed on all patients 48-72 hours after the drug was started. If&#xD;
      the clot is still present at this time, another imaging study will be done at 30 days after&#xD;
      the drug was given. The subjects will continue to have lab tests twice weekly for about 3&#xD;
      weeks to monitor for the effects of the drug. After completion of the study, the patient will&#xD;
      undergo a study exit physical exam between 20-40 days after the drug was stopped.&#xD;
