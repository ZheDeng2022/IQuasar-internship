      diabetes and chronic kidney disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bardoxolone methyl (RTA 402) is an Antioxidant Inflammation Modulator (AIM) that is&#xD;
      undergoing clinical testing in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cancer. Bardoxolone methyl&#xD;
      and other AIMs inhibit immune-mediated inflammation by restoring redox homeostasis in&#xD;
      inflamed tissues by inducing the cytoprotective transcription factor Nrf2. In the diabetic&#xD;
      population, adipocytes produce cytokines and mobilize free fatty acids which induce insulin&#xD;
      resistance. Resultant hyperglycemia and increased cytokine production induces reactive oxygen&#xD;
      and nitrogen species which in turn induce vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;
      This process causes further activation of NF-kB, creating a vicious cycle of inflammation,&#xD;
      vasoconstriction, and ischemia, the end result of which is sclerosis in the kidney and&#xD;
      coronary arteries. By inducing Nrf2 and suppressing redox-driven inflammation, we hypothesize&#xD;
      that this cycle of inflammation and sclerosis can be abrogated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on Phase IIa data, we hypothesize that bardoxolone methyl will improve renal function&#xD;
      through suppression of renal oxidative stress, inflammation and improvement of glomerular&#xD;
      filtration.&#xD;
