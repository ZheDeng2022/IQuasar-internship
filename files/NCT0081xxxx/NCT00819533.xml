      This study is designed to evaluate preliminary safety and accuracy of the ActiSight™ Needle&#xD;
      Guidance System in patients undergoing CT-guided lung aspiration or biopsy. This image&#xD;
      guidance system uses a combination of CT scans and camera images to help guide a biopsy&#xD;
      needle to a lung lesion. The system displays a simulated image of a biopsy needle and its&#xD;
      estimated path for the biopsy.&#xD;

      Why is this study conducted to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the ActiSight&#xD;
      Needle Guidance System in assisting trained physicians perform CT guided percutaneous needle&#xD;
      biopsy (PNB) and fine needle aspiration (FNA) procedures in the chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects, who are scheduled for medically indicated chest PNB or FNA procedures and meet all&#xD;
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be asked to participate in the study. The aim is&#xD;
      to enroll 40 subjects that will complete the whole study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruited subjects will go through screening tests and if eligible, will undergo, within 18&#xD;
      days of screening, CT Guided chest PNB or FNA utilizing the ActiSight Needle Guidance system.&#xD;
      Subjects will be observed and tested for at least an hour after the procedure to detect any&#xD;
      serious complications. A follow-up will be conducted within 7-10 days after the procedure day&#xD;
      for safety evaluations. Safety and accuracy data from all stages of the study will be&#xD;
      collected and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of the guidance system will be measured primarily by the frequency of&#xD;
      reaching the intended targets, as determined by a final CT scan. Other measures will include&#xD;
      the number of needle punctures and the number of intermediate CT scans needed to complete the&#xD;
      procedure. The safety of the system will be measured by the frequency and severity of adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, a single-use, disposable pad (ActiSticker) is attached to the patient's skin over the&#xD;
      point of needle insertion as selected by the interventionist. The pad incorporates reference&#xD;
      objects that are easily detectable both on CT images and visually. A volume CT scan, covering&#xD;
      at least the pad, the target lesion and adjacent structures is then performed. Next, the CT&#xD;
      images from the volume scan are transferred to the ActiSight computer where the operator&#xD;
      marks the target of the procedure, as well as all the reference points on the ActiSticker.&#xD;
      Next, an optical sensor, also single-use and disposable, is attached to the top of the&#xD;
      needle. By optically detecting all the reference points and relating them to their known&#xD;
      positions on the CT images, the system can calculate the position of the top and the tip of&#xD;
      the needle with relation to the target lesion. During the procedure, the system shows the&#xD;
      user, on a graphic computer display, whether the needle is aimed directly at the target and&#xD;
      how far the tip of the needle is from the intended target to help the user aim the insertion&#xD;
      and guidance of the needle to the target.&#xD;
