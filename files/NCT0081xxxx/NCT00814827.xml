  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opportunistic infections are caused by bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi or viruses that do not&#xD;
      normally cause infections in people with healthy immune systems. Some of these infections can&#xD;
      cause public health concerns, especially in areas with limited access to treatment. People&#xD;
      who acquire opportunistic infections usually have diseases that affect their immune systems,&#xD;
      such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or do not have enough white blood cells to fight&#xD;
      the infection. However, some people acquire opportunistic infections even though they have&#xD;
      normal amounts of white blood cells and are free from known diseases that harm their immune&#xD;
      systems. This study will investigate some of the reasons that otherwise healthy people get&#xD;
      opportunistic infections to learn more about why some people are more likely to have them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include up to 210 HIV-negative males and females older than 18 years of age&#xD;
      who have opportunistic infections. The patients will be drawn from multiple sites in Thailand&#xD;
      and Taiwan including Khon Kaen University Hospital, Siriraj Hospital, Ramathibodi Hospital,&#xD;
      National Taiwan University Hospital, National Cheng-Kung University Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo an initial evaluation that will include a physical examination, medical&#xD;
      history, and blood and urine testing. Additional tests will be conducted if the researchers&#xD;
      consider that the tests are medically necessary to treat the opportunistic infection; the&#xD;
      results of the tests will be reviewed and saved for study purposes. Depending on the severity&#xD;
      of the infection, the initial evaluation may take more than 1 day to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the evaluation, patients will be given standard and appropriate medicines to treat the&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return for follow-up visits to allow researchers to monitor their condition and&#xD;
      to assess how well the patient is responding to the treatment. Patients will be evaluated by&#xD;
      the study researchers at least once a year for 2 years following the initial treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The acquisition of opportunistic infections has been causally linked to innate and acquired&#xD;
      immunodeficiencies. We have recently identified a population of Asian women with&#xD;
      autoantibodies to interferon gamma (IFN?), all of whom were diagnosed by virtue of&#xD;
      nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. Similar patient populations have been reported from&#xD;
      Thailand, and we have found similar autoantibodies in anonymous serum samples from there. In&#xD;
      addition, many of the Thai patients who have disseminated or lymphatic nontuberculous&#xD;
      infections have had other opportunistic infections (OI), such as salmonella, penicilliosis,&#xD;
      and histoplasmosis. However, they have normal lymphocyte counts and are human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative. Therefore, the identification of autoantibodies to a&#xD;
      critical cytokine, the occurrence of opportunistic infections, and the lack of other common&#xD;
      explanations suggests that this is an important population to study. We propose to enroll&#xD;
      patients in a natural history study of non-HIV opportunistic infections to explore the&#xD;
      presence of autoantibodies to cytokines, and to examine potential immunogenetic factors&#xD;
      influencing the development of this disease. Plasma, cells, and DNA samples will be obtained&#xD;
      and stored for use in this study. This study will accrue up to 265 patients over 5 years as&#xD;
      per the protocol with follow up for 15 years on each patient, sample size justification and&#xD;
      the groups described in the protocol.&#xD;
