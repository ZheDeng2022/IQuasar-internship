  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how safe, tolerable and effective the new&#xD;
      standardised dosage regimen of FERINJECT® infusions is, compared with a well established&#xD;
      intravenous iron treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anaemia in inflammatory bowel disease is mainly attributed to iron deficiency. The main cause&#xD;
      of anaemia in IBD patients is chronic blood loss. This means that the iron storage depot in&#xD;
      IBD patients is always low and should be replenished. Oral iron therapy is the first choice&#xD;
      in many cases because of its safety and economy. However, in patients with gastrointestinal&#xD;
      bleeding, the effectiveness of oral therapy is reduced. Additionally, oral iron preparations&#xD;
      are frequently associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to European Guidelines, the preferred route of iron supplementation in IBD is&#xD;
      intravenous. Absolute indications for intravenous iron include severe anaemia (Hb &lt;10 g/dL).&#xD;
      The current study is a part of a programme investigating the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      FERINJECT®, a new formulation of parenteral iron (5% weight per volume iron containing ferric&#xD;
      carboxymaltose in a solution of water for injection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and safety of FERINJECT® were investigated in a prospective, randomised,&#xD;
      controlled study conducted in IBD patients. According to the results of this study,&#xD;
      FERINJECT® provides a faster Hb response, a higher increase in iron storage and a better&#xD;
      patient tolerance compared to oral preparations. In this study, the iron amount required was&#xD;
      calculated according to the Ganzoni formula, where 500 mg is the amount of storage iron. To&#xD;
      simplify the treatment and to make the treatment more effective, a new standardised dosage&#xD;
      regimen was created. The current study is designed to assess whether this new standardised&#xD;
      dosage regimen of i.v. FERINJECT® is as safe and effective as the currently used individually&#xD;
      calculated dosage regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and safety of the new standardised dosage regimen of FERINJECT® will be compared&#xD;
      with an already established, well-known treatment of IDA with iron sucrose (VENOFER®). Iron&#xD;
      sucrose (VENOFER®) is assessed to be effective and well-tolerated in the treatment of IDA in&#xD;
      IBD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a phase IIIb, multi-centre, randomised, prospective, open-label, controlled&#xD;
      study performed at 83 study centres in 14 European countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the non-inferiority in efficacy of a&#xD;
      standardised dosage regimen of FERINJECT® compared to individually calculated dosage regimens&#xD;
      of VENOFER® in the correction of IDA in patients with IBD in remission. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a standardised correction dose&#xD;
      regimen of FERINJECT®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 420 patients will be randomised (1:1 randomisation) to receive treatment with&#xD;
      either a standardised correction dosage regimen of FERINJECT® or individually calculated&#xD;
      dosage regimens of VENOFER®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening will start between 14 and 7 days before the first infusion is administered.&#xD;
      Baseline assessments will be performed on Day 1 before the first infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening period, patients will be selected based on eligibility criteria.&#xD;
      Patients who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      undergo baseline assessments at Baseline (Day 1) prior to the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomised to the FERINJECT® group will receive between 500 mg and 2000 mg of&#xD;
      FERINJECT®, according to their Hb and body weight, in up to 3 infusions. The maximum infused&#xD;
      weekly dose of will be 1000 mg. For patients in the VENOFER® group, the individual iron&#xD;
      deficit will be calculated per individual using the modified formula of Ganzoni. Patients&#xD;
      will receive one infusion of 200 mg of VENOFER® twice a week, up to 11 infusions, depending&#xD;
      on their calculated iron deficit. Due to the relatively large doses of iron being&#xD;
      administered, patients will be monitored carefully throughout the study for symptoms of iron&#xD;
      overload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will return for assessment of efficacy and safety at Weeks 4, 8, and 12. The&#xD;
      maximum study duration for a patient is 14 weeks. Patients who are not anaemic at Week 12&#xD;
      will be invited to continue to participate in a maintenance study (FER-IBD-07-MAIN), i.e. a&#xD;
      study of FERINJECT® versus placebo to determine if the treatment of iron deficiency can&#xD;
      prevent the recurrence of anaemia.&#xD;

    <description>VENOFER® will be administered via i.v. drip infusion, diluted only in sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution as follows:&#xD;
• 10 mL Venofer® (200 mg iron) in maximum 200 mL sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution in at least 30 minutes.&#xD;
The first 25 mL of solution should be infused as a test dose over a period of 15 minutes. If no adverse reactions occur, use infusion rate no more than 50 mL in 15 minutes.&#xD;
The individual iron deficit will be calculated using the modified formula of Ganzoni.&#xD;
If the patient's body mass index is &gt;25, a normalised weight will be used for the calculation of iron deficit. Normalised weight = 25 x height [m] x height [m].&#xD;
The calculated cumulative VENOFER® dose is to be rounded up or down to the nearest 200 mg.&#xD;
Patients will receive one 200 mg VENOFER® infusion, twice a week, up to 11 times (max dosage 2200 mg), depending on their calculated iron deficit.</description>
