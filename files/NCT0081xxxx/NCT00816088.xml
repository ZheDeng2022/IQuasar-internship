  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fungal infections caused by Aspergillus fumigatus are now identified in up to 45% of patients&#xD;
      dying from haematological malignancy. There has been a significant increase in deaths from IA&#xD;
      over the last 20 years. Our current diagnostic approach is neither sensitive nor specific.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively assess the value of current diagnostic tools,&#xD;
      as well as test other new diagnostic methods for the diagnosis of IA among haemato-oncology&#xD;
      patients undergoing chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The basis of the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis is usually based on radiological&#xD;
      appearances, which are neither sensitive nor specific. The burden of this problem is also not&#xD;
      properly documented and there is paucity of prospective data in the literature. Therefore, we&#xD;
      want to prospectively collect complete epidemiological data on all our patients. In addition&#xD;
      we want to collaborate with radiological, respiratory, and microbiological colleagues to&#xD;
      develop a unified approach to diagnosis. In the initial 12-18 months of the study all adult&#xD;
      haemato-oncology patients likely to be rendered neutropenic during their treatment will be&#xD;
      enrolled. All clinical data will be collected including dose, duration, and side-effects of&#xD;
      anti-fungals administered. We will evaluate accepted diagnostic modalities for IA including&#xD;
      the determination of optimum cut-offs for galactomannan and B-D-glucan in serum and urine in&#xD;
      this cohort. In addition we would investigate the utility of other approaches for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of IA such as markers for tissue injury and cytokine profiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would test the urine in parallel with blood for galactomannan and B-D glucan to assess its&#xD;
      usefulness with respect to blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT scanning forms an important cornerstone of our diagnostic workup currently. However, there&#xD;
      is paucity of data on the natural history and spectrum of CT changes in neutropenic patients&#xD;
      with IA. Thus, our aim is to carefully document such changes in our cohort. We aim to&#xD;
      rationalise CT imaging in the following way:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline CT:&#xD;
&#xD;
           We aim to perform an initial non-contrast enhanced thin-section continuous volume&#xD;
           acquisition thoracic CT study on all the study patients. This will allow us to establish&#xD;
           a &quot;baseline&quot; of normality in addition to potentially identifying those patients with&#xD;
           pre-existing but indeterminate pulmonary lesions prior to chemotherapy or stem-cell&#xD;
           transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Diagnostic CT:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Neutropaenic patients with febrile episodes that are unresponsive to standard&#xD;
           second-line broad-spectrum antibiotics combination (currently meropenem and vancomycin)&#xD;
           will be referred for a contrast-enhanced thin section continuous volume CT scan. The&#xD;
           purpose of this CT study is primarily to support the clinical suspicion of a diagnosis&#xD;
           of IA and to determine its morphological extent. The purpose of the contrast injection&#xD;
           is to test the hypothesis that in patients with IA, regions of necrotic lung (in&#xD;
           contrast to other &quot;inflammatory&quot; or infective lesions) should not demonstrate any&#xD;
           contrast enhancement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow-up CTs (x2):&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with CT features of IA on the Diagnostic CT (see No. 2 above) and who have been&#xD;
      commenced on antifungal chemotherapy, two follow-up, low-dose CTs (without iv contrast) will&#xD;
      be performed at 10 days and 4 weeks after the diagnostic CT. These CT studies will not only&#xD;
      allow us to evaluate the serial changes on CT but also determine the potential relationships&#xD;
      between the initial CT features, haematological factors and outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To increase the diagnostic yield, patients who are referred for lung biopsy, will undergo the&#xD;
      technique of preoperative &quot;labeling&quot;: small indeterminate lung nodules are frequently&#xD;
      invisible and impalpable. There is an encouraging literature which indicates that&#xD;
      preoperative labeling of lung lesions with a small (0.3-0.5ml) volume of methylene blue which&#xD;
      acts a guidance track for the surgeon, may significantly improve the diagnostic yield from&#xD;
      surgical (open or video-assisted thoracoscopic) biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplant patients typically would have 2-4 cycles of chemotherapy prior to admission for&#xD;
      transplant. As such they have more chance of developing neutropenic infection and IA.&#xD;
      Therefore we would perform a baseline bronchoscopy and washing (BAL) to assess the cytokine&#xD;
      profile at admission and ensure that no infection is apparent before the initiation of&#xD;
      transplant conditioning. A small amount of the BAL sample would be frozen and stored for&#xD;
      future studies. Additional bronchoscopy may be done later during admission for both&#xD;
      transplant and non-transplant patients if the clinical situation warrants it according to our&#xD;
      current clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management strategies would also be assessed prospectively to evaluate the role of both&#xD;
      prophylaxis and treatment. We are currently using itraconazole as our prophylactic agent of&#xD;
      choice. Serum itraconazole levels will be measured on a weekly basis in all patients to&#xD;
      ensure therapeutic levels are achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will be conducting costing analysis.&#xD;
