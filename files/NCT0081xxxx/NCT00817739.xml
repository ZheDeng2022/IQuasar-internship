    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at evaluating the effects of intermittent hormonal treatment with&#xD;
      complete androgen suppression (Leuprorelin 3.75 milligram [mg] sustained release [SR] and&#xD;
      Flutamide) in patients presenting with stage D2 or Tx Nx M1 ≠ M1a metastatic prostrate&#xD;
      cancer, with a prostate specific antigen (PSA) level 5-fold higher than normal (PSA greater&#xD;
      than or equal to [≥] 20 nanogram per milliliter [ng/mL], as quantitated by the Hybritech&#xD;
      radioimmunoassay) and with a subsequent decline to normal (PSA less than [&lt;] 4 ng/mL) during&#xD;
      the initial 6 months of induction treatment. The results will be compared with those obtained&#xD;
      after continuous hormonal therapy with complete androgen suppression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, comparative, randomized (1:1), multicenter, European (France, Germany, Czech&#xD;
      Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria), Phase 2B study on parallel groups of patients presenting&#xD;
      with metastatic prostate cancer (stage D2 or Tx Nx M1 ≠ M1a), with a PSA level ≥ 5-fold&#xD;
      higher than normal (that is PSA ≥ 20 ng/mL, as quantitated by the Hybritech radioimmunoassay)&#xD;
      which return to normal within 6 months after the initiation of total androgen blockade&#xD;
      therapy with leuprorelin 3.75 mg SR and flutamide. It will involve 314 preselected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 180 eligible patients are required for this study. Selected patients will be&#xD;
      randomized centrally in two parallel groups at study entry. This phase 2B study will enable&#xD;
      evaluation of a high number of patients by direct comparison with conventional&#xD;
      administration. The study comprises of two therapeutic phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 6 month induction phase with complete androgen suppression by leuprorelin 3.75 mg SR&#xD;
           and flutamide. This phase involves patients meeting the preselection criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A data processing run per complete androgen suppression according to two methods,&#xD;
           continuous or intermittent, for the patients satisfying the criteria of selection of the&#xD;
           study and which will thus be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selected patients will be randomized in two parallel groups at the time of inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A patients will receive a continuous complete androgen suppression therapy by&#xD;
           leuprorelin 3.75mg SR and flutamide, until the appearance of signs of disease&#xD;
           progression or study end.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B patients will receive an intermittent complete androgen suppression therapy by&#xD;
           leuprorelin 3.75 mg SR and flutamide, until the study end or the appearance of signs of&#xD;
           disease progression under treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A patients will be routinely followed-up on a 3-month basis until there are signs of&#xD;
      disease progression. Group B patients (intermittent therapy) will be monitored every 3 months&#xD;
      during on-treatment periods under the same conditions as described for group A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3-month clinical follow-up will be same during off-treatment periods, but if PSA&#xD;
      increases to ≥10 ng/mL the patient must be contacted to schedule a prompt special visit in&#xD;
      order to reinstitute hormonal therapy. Subsequent visits will be scheduled on a 3-month basis&#xD;
      from the time of the special visit. Special visits will be the same as routine consultations,&#xD;
      except that the laboratory tests will not be redone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When on-therapy tumor progression will be documented, every 6 months the investigators will&#xD;
      note all treatments administered to patients until death (while specifying the cause of&#xD;
      death).&#xD;

    <measure>Median Progression-Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization (Month 6) up to Week 396 after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Median Progression Free Survival=time from date of inclusion to date of first documentation of progressive disease (death, biological progression, clinical progression). Biological progression: date of the first PSA increase after the nadir and greater than or equal to (≥) 4 ng/mL under treatment. Clinical progression: date of appearance of the clinical sign of progression under treatment. Clinical signs of progression are: 1. Appearance of marked increase of bone pain or appearance of symptoms related to disease progression (example: liver, lungs, kidneys); 2. Alteration of general health conditions related to disease progression (decrease of at least 2 degrees in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (ECOG) performance status, weight loss of more than 10% since the last visit); 3. Anemia - drop in hemoglobin level of more than 2 gram per deciliter (g/dL) since the last visit (only if disease related).</description>

    <time_frame>Randomization (Month 6) up to Week 396 after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30: includes functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), global health status, symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting) and single items (dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation/diarrhea and financial difficulties). Most questions uses 4 point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'; 2 questions uses 7-point scale (1 'very poor' to 7 'Excellent'). Scores are averaged and transformed to 0-100 scale; for the 5 functional scales and the global quality-of-life scale, a higher score represents a better level of functioning. For the symptom-oriented scales and items, a higher score corresponds to a higher level of symptoms.</description>
