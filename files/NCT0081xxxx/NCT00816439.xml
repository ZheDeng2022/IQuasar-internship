    <textblock>
      The cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor is a protein found in the brain that is involved with&#xD;
      the effects of marijuana; it may also play a role in the effects of alcohol dependence and&#xD;
      withdrawal. Earlier animal studies have shown that although long-term alcohol use decreases&#xD;
      the number of CB1 receptors in the brain, the number returns to normal after alcohol use&#xD;
      stops. This study will use positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) scans to trace a radioactive chemical called [11C]MePPEP, which can locate and measure&#xD;
      the number of CB1 receptors in the brain. Researchers will study the CB1 receptors in the&#xD;
      brains of people with alcohol dependence, and compare the results to the CB1 receptors in the&#xD;
      brains of people without alcohol dependence. The results of this study will be used to&#xD;
      further research into appropriate treatment procedures for alcohol dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 30 men with alcohol dependence and 50 men without alcohol dependence.&#xD;
      All of the men must be between 18 and 65 years of age. Participants in both groups must not&#xD;
      have any medical conditions that will prevent them from undergoing PET or MRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the PET scan, participants will be injected with a small amount of [11C]MePPEP and will&#xD;
      then be brought to the PET scanner. The scan will take between 3 and 4 hours, but&#xD;
      participants will be allowed to take breaks over the course of the scan. The MRI scan will&#xD;
      not require any injections and will take approximately 1 hour to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants without alcohol dependence will make three visits to the National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health Clinical Center. Blood and urine samples will be taken during one visit, and&#xD;
      participants will arrange to have an MRI scan on one visit and a PET scan on the other visit,&#xD;
      in whichever order they prefer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with alcohol dependence will undergo two PET scans: the first will be performed&#xD;
      between 3 and 7 days after the participant last consumed alcohol, and the second will be&#xD;
      performed approximately 2 to 4 weeks after the first scan (with no alcohol consumption&#xD;
      permitted in the interval). Participants will alcohol dependence will also undergo an MRI&#xD;
      scan and will provide blood and urine samples.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Alcohol dependence (alcoholism) is a chronic medical illness with a relapsing course and a&#xD;
      major public health problem. Alcoholism is clinically characterized by periods of&#xD;
      uncontrolled alcohol consumption and withdrawal, during which counter-adaptive mechanisms&#xD;
      such as stress and dysphoria are recruited. Neurobiological research into the pathophysiology&#xD;
      of the illness suggest that both the primary rewarding effects of ethanol as well as&#xD;
      neuroadaptive changes that occur during chronic alcohol exposure involve persistent changes&#xD;
      in various brain neurotransmission systems, such as the dopamine, glutamate, and gamma-amino&#xD;
      butyric acid (GABA) systems. Recent views of the illness also emphasize the long-lasting&#xD;
      recruitment of the brain stress system. Unfortunately, despite this progress, available&#xD;
      pharmacological agents for the treatment of alcoholism are too few and not sufficiently&#xD;
      efficacious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brain endocannabinoid (EC) system is a recently discovered brain neurotransmission&#xD;
      system, which involves endogenous cannabinoid agents (ECs) that act upon specific receptors&#xD;
      (CB1 and CB2). CB1 receptor is abundant in the human brain and acts as an inhibitory&#xD;
      modulator of classical neurotransmitters. ECs and CB1 receptors appear to modulate the brain&#xD;
      reward system, and animal studies have demonstrated an important role of CB1 receptor&#xD;
      stimulation in alcohol- and drug-related behaviors. During chronic alcohol exposure, EC&#xD;
      levels in the brain are elevated and CB1 receptor levels are consequently reduced; this&#xD;
      appears to be reversible following withdrawal. Animal studies suggest that CB1 receptor&#xD;
      blockade in the abstinent phase may reduce alcohol craving and relapse. To what extent ECs&#xD;
      and CB1 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of alcohol dependence in humans is&#xD;
      currently unknown. The lack of suitable methods to reliably quantify CB1 receptors in the&#xD;
      living human brain has to date hindered the progress in this field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, we outline studies aiming at elucidating the role of CB1 receptors in&#xD;
      alcohol and cannabis dependence by using positron emission tomography (PET) and the recently&#xD;
      developed radiotracer for CB1 receptors, [(18)F]FMPEP-d2. The aim of this project is to&#xD;
      explore CB1 receptor abnormalities at various stages of alcohol and cannabis dependence in&#xD;
      humans. For the studies in alcohol dependence, the primary hypothesis is that CB1 receptors&#xD;
      are downregulated during chronic alcohol exposure and upregulated during extended abstinence.&#xD;
      For the studies in cannabis users, our primary hypothesis is that CB1 receptors are&#xD;
      downregulated during chronic cannabis use and upregulated during extended abstinence. Insight&#xD;
      into the role of CB1 receptor function in human alcoholism and in chronic cannabis use may&#xD;
      help guide future development of pharmacotherapies.&#xD;
