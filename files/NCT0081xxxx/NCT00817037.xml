  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have higher blood pressures than the general&#xD;
      population. They also tend to have protein leaking into the urine (proteinuria). CKD, high&#xD;
      blood pressure and proteinuria independently and together increase the risk of developing&#xD;
      atherosclerosis (hardening) of the arteries that leads to diseases such as heart attack and&#xD;
      stroke. Although there are a number of drugs available that lower blood pressure, these are&#xD;
      not always fully effective. Furthermore, there are even fewer drugs that simultaneously lower&#xD;
      blood pressure, reduce proteinuria, and slow down kidney damage in CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent research has shown that drugs like sitaxsentan not only lower blood pressure but also&#xD;
      reduce proteinuria and potentially slow down the progression of CKD [1,2]. Before sitaxsentan&#xD;
      can become freely available to individuals with CKD it is important to look at the effects&#xD;
      this drug could have on proteinuria and blood pressure.&#xD;
