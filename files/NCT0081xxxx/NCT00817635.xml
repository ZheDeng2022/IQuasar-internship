    <measure>Change From Baseline in MSSBP at Week 8 Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Arterial blood pressure (BP) determinations were made after the participant was in the sitting position for 5 minutes according to the American Heart Association guidelines using a calibrated standard aneroid or mercury sphygmomanometer or a calibrated standard sphygmomanometer. The change in the MSSBP was calculated comparing the Week 8 readings to the readings taken at Baseline. The change from Baseline in MSSBP was analyzed using an analysis of covariance model (ANCOVA) with treatment and country as factors and Baseline MSSBP as a covariate.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>An ABPM measured a participant's blood pressure over a 24-hour period including daytime and nighttime readings, using an automated validated monitoring device from Baseline to Week 8.

SAEs were AEs leading to death, are life-threatening, require hospitalizations or prolongation of hospitalizations, represent an innate malformation or a congenital abnormality. Hyperkalemia was defined as potassium level &gt;5.5 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). It is the medical term that describes a potassium level that's higher than normal. Hyponatremia was defined as sodium level &lt;135 mmol/L. It is the medical term that describes a sodium level that's lesser than normal.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in MSSBP at Week 8 Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)</title>
        <description>Arterial blood pressure (BP) determinations were made after the participant was in the sitting position for 5 minutes according to the American Heart Association guidelines using a calibrated standard aneroid or mercury sphygmomanometer or a calibrated standard sphygmomanometer. The change in the MSSBP was calculated comparing the Week 8 readings to the readings taken at Baseline. The change from Baseline in MSSBP was analyzed using an analysis of covariance model (ANCOVA) with treatment and country as factors and Baseline MSSBP as a covariate.</description>

        <description>An ABPM measured a participant's blood pressure over a 24-hour period including daytime and nighttime readings, using an automated validated monitoring device from Baseline to Week 8. The 24-hour DBP was calculated by taking the mean of all ambulatory diastolic blood pressure readings for the 24-hour period. The change from Baseline in DBP was analyzed using an ANCOVA with treatment and country as factors and Baseline MSDBP as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Event (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Hyperkalemia, and Hyponatremia</title>
        <description>An AE was an adverse medical event which occurs in a participant of the study and which is not necessarily in a causal relationship with the treatment the participant receives. SAEs were AEs leading to death, are life-threatening, require hospitalizations or prolongation of hospitalizations, represent an innate malformation or a congenital abnormality. Hyperkalemia was defined as potassium level &gt;5.5 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). It is the medical term that describes a potassium level that's higher than normal. Hyponatremia was defined as sodium level &lt;135 mmol/L. It is the medical term that describes a sodium level that's lesser than normal.</description>
        <time_frame>AEs, Hyperkalemia, and Hyponatremia: From start of the study drug treatment up to 10 weeks; SAE: From signing of the informed consent up to 10 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>Safety set population included all participants who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study drug. Here, Number Analyzed represents the number of participants who were evaluable for that specific category.</population>
