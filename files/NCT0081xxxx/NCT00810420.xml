      The aim of this study is based on recent pilot studies carried out at Odense University&#xD;
      Hospital showing that the acute changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) signals (i.e.&#xD;
      electrical activity inthe brain) elicited by insulin-induced hypoglycemia in patients with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes can be reliable detected by real-time processing of these EEG signals using&#xD;
      mathematical algorithms and state of the art noise and artifact reduction. These preliminary&#xD;
      results also showed that the hypoglycemia-induced EEG changes are detectable 15-30 min before&#xD;
      deterioration in cognitive function impedes an adequate response to warning. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that these observations apply to the majority of patients with type 1 diabetes, and&#xD;
      therefore, that it is possible to develop an automated device to detect hypoglycemic episodes&#xD;
      by continuous real-time monitoring and processing of EEG signals. To test our hypothesis, the&#xD;
      specific aims of the present proposal are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Detection of hypoglycemia-induced EEG changes using subcutaneous electrodes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ambulatory EEG monitoring using subcutaneous electrodes&#xD;

      The near-normalization of glycemic control has become an established treatment goal in&#xD;
      diabetes in order to reduce late complications such as nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy&#xD;
      and cardiovascular disease (1,2). However, the frequency of insulin-induced hypoglycemia&#xD;
      increases several-fold during intensified insulin therapy (2,3). Thus, hypoglycemia is the&#xD;
      most common acute complication in the treatment of diabetes with insulin. During hypoglycemia&#xD;
      the cognitive function is disturbed, and may progress to unconsciousness and seizures. This&#xD;
      can lead to high-risk situations, e.g. while driving or operating a machine. Estimates of&#xD;
      deaths in patients with type 1 diabetes attributed to hypoglycemia vary between 2% and 6%&#xD;
      (4,5). Moreover, the risk of hypoglycemia limits everyday activities of diabetic patients&#xD;
      decreasing their quality of life. It is therefore not surprising that hypoglycemia is the&#xD;
      most feared acute complication of insulin therapy in diabetic patients. This fear of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia discourages diabetic subjects from attempting to maintain tight glycemic&#xD;
      control, which in turn leads to a higher incidence of late complications and consequently&#xD;
      increased mortality rate (1,6,7) In the first years of type 1 diabetes, most patients are&#xD;
      able to sense the characteristic symptoms of hypoglycemia, which can then be relieved by&#xD;
      consuming appropriate food. The symptoms of hypoglycemia can roughly be classified as&#xD;
      autonomic (warning) symptoms caused by the release of catecholamines, and neuroglycopenic&#xD;
      symptoms caused by the lack of glucose in the brain. In many patients symptoms are often&#xD;
      compromised at night (nocturnal asymptomatic hypoglycemia) due to impaired glucose&#xD;
      counterregulatory response by adrenaline and glucagon. The chronic form of hypoglycemia&#xD;
      unawareness is very common. A quarter of all insulin-treated diabetic patients have some&#xD;
      degree of diminished symptomatic awareness, but this proportion increases to almost 50% in&#xD;
      patients who have had diabetes for more than 20 years (8). Strict control of diabetes by&#xD;
      intensive insulin therapy is associated with increased risk of the hypoglycemia unawareness&#xD;
      syndrome with loss of autonomic warning symptoms (2,6,9). This seems to involve diminished&#xD;
      hormonal glucose counterregulation due to recurrent hypoglycemic episodes (6,9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, a number of studies have been carried out with the aim of developing&#xD;
      automatic detection systems, which can warn the diabetic patients before blood glucose levels&#xD;
      are reduced to the level at which severe neuroglycopenia develops, typically about 2.0-2.5&#xD;
      mmol/l. Most studies have evaluated the potential of continuous glucose monitoring (CMG) to&#xD;
      decrease the frequency of hypoglycemia. Although, smaller studies have reported a lower risk&#xD;
      of hypoglycemia using CMG compared with conventional glucose measurements (10,11), larger&#xD;
      multi-center studies have failed to reproduce these findings (11-14). This could be explained&#xD;
      by a low accuracy in the low range of glucose values and delay in detection time during rapid&#xD;
      changes using CMG (11,13,14). In fact, CMG only recognizes less than 50% of hypoglycemic&#xD;
      events (15). Thus, even with a marginal improvement compared with conventional glucose&#xD;
      measurements, CMG is far from the goal of completely avoiding severe hypoglycemic episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EEG signal reflects the functional state and metabolism of the brain. The brain is almost&#xD;
      totally dependent on a continuous supply of glucose, and when this is lower than the&#xD;
      metabolic requirements of the brain, its function deteriorates. Indeed, neuroglycopenic&#xD;
      hypoglycemia in insulin-treated diabetic patients is associated with characteristic changes&#xD;
      in EEG with a decrease in alpha activity, an increase in delta activity, and in particular an&#xD;
      increase in theta activity (16-19). These changes are clearly seen at ~2.0 mmol/l (16,17),&#xD;
      but may be present already at higher glucose levels (~3.0 mmol/l), in particular in type 1&#xD;
      diabetic patients with hypoglycemic unawareness (19,20). It has been shown that the most&#xD;
      characteristic changes, the increase in theta activity, appears 19 min before severe&#xD;
      cognitive impairment (20). This suggests a &quot;window&quot; between hypoglycemia-induced EEG changes&#xD;
      and severe neuroglycepenia, which is an important prerequisite in developing an automatic&#xD;
      detection system capable of warning the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of studies have characterized the changes in the EEG that results from hypoglycemia&#xD;
      (16-20), but none have proposed a method of processing and testing in real-time. With a&#xD;
      device, which can perform real-time monitoring and processing of EEG signals and&#xD;
      automatically detect and warn the patient of hypoglycemia-induced EEG changes, it would be&#xD;
      possible for the patient to avoid severe neuroglypenic symptoms e.g. by ingestion of&#xD;
      carbohydrates. The construction of an EEG-based hypoglycemia alarm system must fulfill the&#xD;
      following criteria. First, the device should be able to distinguish hypoglycemia-induced EEG&#xD;
      changes from normal changes in EEG, noise and artifacts with high sensitivity and specificity&#xD;
      using a mathematical algorithm that classifies the EEG in real-time. Second, these EEG&#xD;
      changes should be observed in the majority of insulin-treated diabetic patients during&#xD;
      hypoglycemia. Third, there should be a &quot;window&quot; between hypoglycemia-induced EEG changes and&#xD;
      severe cognitive impairment. Moreover, the device should be fully compatible with normal&#xD;
      everyday activities. Thus, the electrodes should be thin and implanted subcutaneously, and&#xD;
      the monitoring and processing unit should be small, have sufficient battery power, and&#xD;
      capable of communicating with a PDA or cell phone.&#xD;
