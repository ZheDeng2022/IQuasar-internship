      The purpose of this study is to see whether we can predict which patients with depression&#xD;
      will get better when we treat them with psychodynamic psychotherapy. We will use neuroimaging&#xD;
      (a method of looking at brain activity) in this study. We want to see whether there are&#xD;
      changes in the brains of patients receiving this type of therapy. We hypothesize that these&#xD;
      changes may predict how well certain parts of the psychotherapy treatment process works.&#xD;

      In this study, we will treat patients with brief psychodynamic psychotherapy. Psychodynamic&#xD;
      psychotherapy is a type of treatment that may be as helpful as medications in treating&#xD;
      depression. It focuses on thoughts, feelings, and behaviors as well as both current and past&#xD;
      relationships. Psychotherapy explores better ways of coping with feelings, expressing needs,&#xD;
      and interacting with others in order to cope with depression and other life problems.&#xD;
      Subjects will go to 16 weekly, 45-minute, individual sessions of psychodynamic psychotherapy&#xD;
      over the course of the study. At five times throughout the study, subjects will come in for&#xD;
      extra visits, which last approximately 1.5 hours and which include: speaking with a study&#xD;
      doctor about depressive symptoms, filling out extra questionnaires, and performing positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET)and a Quantitative Electroencephalogram (QEEG). The QEEG is a&#xD;
      machine that measures the electrical activity of the brain. This task will take approximately&#xD;
      15 minutes.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Treated with an SSRI, SNRI, or bupropion at adequate doses (defined as 20 mg/day or&#xD;
             more of fluoxetine, citalopram, or paroxetine; 10 mg/day or more of escitalopram; 50&#xD;
             mg/day or more of sertraline; 75 mg/day or more of venlafaxine; 15 mg/day of&#xD;
             mirtazapine; or 40 mg/day of duloxetine; or 100mg/day of bupropion(wellbutrin)) during&#xD;
             the current episode for at least 8 weeks; and,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the time of screen visit, patients must be on a stable dose of SSRI, SNRI, or&#xD;
             bupropion for the past 4 weeks.&#xD;

             undergo a pregnancy test (beta-HCG) prior to initiating treatment; an additional blood&#xD;
             pregnancy test (beta HCG) will be completed if subject wants to do PET scan&#xD;
