&#xD;
          -  Demonstration of a positive wheal and flare reaction (&gt;= 3 mm relative to negative&#xD;
             control) to at least one allergen from a battery of allergens (including house dust&#xD;
             mite, grass pollen and cat hair) on skin prick testing at screening, or within 12&#xD;
             months of study start.&#xD;

             asthmatic response. The early asthmatic response must include a fall in FEV1 of &gt;= 20%&#xD;
             from the post saline value, on at least one occasion, between 5 and 30 minutes after&#xD;
