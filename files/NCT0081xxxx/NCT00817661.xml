      Influenza viral infection can cause serious illness among young infants 0-6 months of age.&#xD;
      However, inactivated influenza vaccine is not recommended for this age group but pregnant&#xD;
      women can be vaccinated during 2nd - 3rd trimester to induce passive immunization of their&#xD;
      infants. Nevertheless vitamin A deficiency is highly prevalent among pregnant women in&#xD;
      Bangladesh, &gt;50% pregnant women consume less vitamin A than the recommended level. Given the&#xD;
      fact that both clinical and sub-clinical vitamin A deficiency impair vaccine specific&#xD;
      immunity, in this proposed study, we aim to investigate whether maternal vitamin A&#xD;
      supplementation improve influenza vaccine specific immune responses among pregnant women and&#xD;
      the passive protection of their infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a placebo controlled clinical trial, sixty six mothers will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive either 10,000 IU vitamin A or placebo capsules weekly from second trimester to 6&#xD;
      month postnatal period. At 26-28 weeks of gestation, all mothers will be vaccinated with&#xD;
      inactivated, trivalent influenza virus vaccine. Maternal and cord blood will be collected for&#xD;
      vitamin A and influenza virus specific IgG assessment. Colostrum and breast milk at 6-month&#xD;
      will be collected for vitamin A and influenza virus specific secretory IgA assessment. Venous&#xD;
      blood (2-3 ml) will be obtained from all infants at the age of 6 months for vitamin A and&#xD;
      influenza virus specific IgG assessment as well as infants' nasal swab for influenza virus&#xD;
      specific secretory IgA.&#xD;

      Influenza morbidity affects the entire population and has an enormous impact upon the&#xD;
      economic burden and the health care system, particularly causing serious illness among young&#xD;
      infants 0-6 months of age. Recent studies show high rates of influenza illness and&#xD;
      hospitalization among infants at this age group in industrialized countries (Chiu et al.,&#xD;
      2002; Poehling et al., 2006) and influenza related childhood mortality is highest in young&#xD;
      infants before 6 months of age (Bhat et al., 2005). Unfortunately, inactivated influenza&#xD;
      vaccine is not recommended for this age group, but pregnant women can be vaccinated during&#xD;
      2nd - 3rd trimester. Thus the strategy of passive immunization (from mother) of infants is&#xD;
      the effective way to combat this infection among young infants. This approach adopted in US&#xD;
      since 1997 and recommended by WHO since 2005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper respiratory tract is the portal of virus entry and primary site of replication (Gluck&#xD;
      et al., 1994; Muszkat et al., 2000). Thus the importance of the presence of effective mucosal&#xD;
      antibodies at the entry site of virus is essential to neutralize the virus and prevent&#xD;
      infection (Meitin et al., 1994). Secretory IgA (sIgA) is the primary mucosal antibody,&#xD;
      accounting for ~70% of the body's total antibody production (Brandtzaeg, 1994). sIgA has been&#xD;
      shown to mediate nasal anti-influenza mucosal immunity (Renegar &amp; Small, 1991) and therefore&#xD;
      indicates the importance of vaccination strategies that trigger specific antibody production&#xD;
      at mucosal surfaces as well as the importance of dietary nutrients to trigger the release of&#xD;
      mucosal neuropeptides necessary for maintenance of the mucosal immune system (Renegar et al.,&#xD;
      2001). A number of clinical trials examined the effect of vitamin A supplementation in humans&#xD;
      on indicators of mucosal immunity. Supplementation to human immunodeficiency virus infected&#xD;
      pregnant women is associated with improved gut permeability in their infants at 14 weeks as&#xD;
      measured by lactulose/mannitol (L/M) urinary excretion test (Filteau et al., 1999). While&#xD;
      vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy (Semba et al., 1999) or the early postpartum&#xD;
      period (Filteau et al., 2001) show no effect on total sIgA in breast milk, rather vitamin A&#xD;
      in milk has been shown to inhibit the growth of both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses&#xD;
      (Clarke &amp; May, 2000). However, total sIgA level of vitamin A-sufficient children has been&#xD;
      detected significantly higher than that of vitamin A-deficient children (Lin et al., 2007).&#xD;
      In animal model, vitamin A supplementation increases both total and antigen specific&#xD;
      sIgA-containing cells in the mucosa, which in turn improves the survival rate (Nikawa et al.,&#xD;
      2001) During early infancy breast milk is the predominant source of vitamin A and to date no&#xD;
      study investigates the effect of prenatal vitamin A supplementation and vaccination on the&#xD;
      vaccine specific mucosal sIgA responses in offspring. Although maternal IgA is not&#xD;
      transplacentally transferred to the infants, but increased vitamin A and vaccine specific&#xD;
      sIgA in breast milk as a result of maternal vitamin A supplementation may enhance infant's&#xD;
      nasal sIgA responses that in turn may provide improved passive protection among young&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our recent study (Mother'SGift Project, funded by Thrasher Research Fund), we have&#xD;
      detected that maternal influenza vaccination can reduce influenza illness substantially in&#xD;
      young infants up to 6 months of age in Bangladesh (Zaman et al., 2008). On the other hand the&#xD;
      prevalence of vitamin A deficiency among pregnant women in Bangladesh as well as in other&#xD;
      developing countries is very high. More than half of the pregnant women in Bangladesh consume&#xD;
      less vitamin A than the recommended dietary allowance and have low vitamin A status (serum&#xD;
      retinol &lt;1•05 μmol/L) with approximately one-fifth of them classified as deficient (serum&#xD;
      retinol &lt;0•70 μmol/L) (Ahmed et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2008). Nonetheless, there is&#xD;
      conclusive scientific evidence suggesting several aspects of both innate and adaptive&#xD;
      immunity are compromised by clinical and subclinical vitamin A deficiency (Stephensen, 2001).&#xD;
      In another study, we observed a significant positive association between primary yellow fever&#xD;
      viral vaccine specific lymphocyte blastogenesis / antibody responses and body vitamin A store&#xD;
      (Ahmad et al., 2008). Thus in view of the potential immune regulatory roles of vitamin A, it&#xD;
      is of interest to investigate whether maternal vitamin A supplementation along with influenza&#xD;
      vaccination could be used as public health intervention strategy to combat both influenza&#xD;
      infection and vitamin A deficiency simultaneously among mothers and young infants in&#xD;
      developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Site: This study will be carried out at ICDDR,B; Dhaka, Bangladesh. Three urban&#xD;
      maternity clinics located at Mirpur area of Dhaka city will be selected for approaching&#xD;
      mothers who visit the clinic in the first trimester and who are the residence of the nearby&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Subject: The inclusion criterion is to enroll mothers at the beginning of second&#xD;
      trimester (i.e. approximately 12 weeks of gestation), willing to stay in Dhaka during&#xD;
      pregnancy and willing to admit in the clinic at delivery. The gestational age will be&#xD;
      determined by self-reported LMP, which is likely be underestimated in most cases. A two-week&#xD;
      variation will be acceptable in this proposed study. The exclusion criteria are: history of&#xD;
      systemic disease, previous complicated pregnancies or of pre-term delivery, abortion,&#xD;
      congenital anomaly, and hypersensitivity to influenza vaccine or receipt of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of Experimental Design: This is a placebo-controlled, double-masked and randomized&#xD;
      trial. The overall study design is outlined in Figure 1, timeline and hypothetical duration&#xD;
      of the proposed protocol related activities are illustrated in Table 1. To allow scheduling&#xD;
      of the sample collection, storage and assay with the number of hired field attendants and lab&#xD;
      facilities that will be available, we plan to enter approximately five pregnant mothers per&#xD;
      week into this study in the first three-month period of the study (Table 1). Informed written&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from the mothers. Sixty-six pregnant women will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either weekly 10,000 IU vitamin A or placebo (corn oil) capsules and blood will be&#xD;
      collected for serum vitamin A assessment. Randomization will be stratified by three clinics&#xD;
      using balanced block design. This weekly supplementation will continue until 6 months&#xD;
      postpartum. The supplementing vitamin A dose to be used in this study is similar to the doses&#xD;
      used weekly among pregnant women in other studies (Semba et al., 1999; Cox et al., 2006) and&#xD;
      shown to be safe. Field workers will deliver the supplements to mothers, in person and will&#xD;
      directly observe their consumption. At 26-28 weeks of gestation, all mothers will receive&#xD;
      inactivated, trivalent influenza virus vaccine (GlaxoSmithKline; Dresden, Germany). Standard&#xD;
      inactivated trivalent influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1, and B strains as recommended by WHO for the&#xD;
      Northern Hemisphere will be obtained from commercial sources for this project. Study&#xD;
      physician will administer the vaccine intramuscularly. At delivery, cord blood and colostrum&#xD;
      will be collected for Influenza specific IgG and sIgA assessment respectively as well as&#xD;
      vitamin A concentration. Birth weight and length of the newborn babies will also be recorded.&#xD;
      At 6-month, breast milk will be collected for vitamin A and influenza virus specific sIgA&#xD;
      assessment and venous blood (2-3 ml) from infants (6 mo of age) will be obtained for vitamin&#xD;
      A and influenza virus specific IgG assessment as well as infants' nasal washings for&#xD;
      influenza virus specific sIgA assessment. Our proposed study will not hamper the existing&#xD;
      prenatal care for the mothers such as folate/iron supplementation or existing infant&#xD;
      vaccination program in Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Each mother will be given a unique randomly generated identification number,&#xD;
      which will indicate the study group she is assigned to. The same ID will be labeled on the&#xD;
      bottle containing 60 capsules. Field attendants will use these capsules for weekly&#xD;
      supplementation ensuring the ID no of the mother and bottle ID are same. A third party (ACME&#xD;
      laboratories, Dhaka Bangladesh) will prepare and supply vitamin A or placebo capsule in&#xD;
      bottles, labeled with ID numbers from a list of numbers. The responsible personnel will keep&#xD;
      it confidential until the end of study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection: Peripheral blood from mother, cord blood, colostrum, breast milk,&#xD;
      peripheral blood and nasal washings from infants will be collected as described in Figure 1.&#xD;
      Nasal secretions will be obtained by introducing wicks (cotton applicators) into the nostril&#xD;
      and gently rotating for 90s as described previously (Wright et al., 1996). The wicks will be&#xD;
      extracted into 1mL PBS, centrifuged, and the supernatants will be collected. All samples will&#xD;
      be frozen until tested simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serological evaluation: We have chosen to investigate the humoral immune responses only to&#xD;
      one influenza antigen because the purpose of this proposed study is to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      maternal vitamin A supplementation on the infants' passive antibody levels, thus it is&#xD;
      prudent to investigate immune responses to one antigen. The following parameters of vitamin A&#xD;
      and Influenza A specific humoral immunity will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin A assessment: Vitamin A content in plasma, serum, colostrum and breast milk will be&#xD;
      measured by standard HPLC method in place in the Nutritional Biochemistry Lab of LSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemagglutination inhibition test [HAI]: HAI antibody titers will be measured by standard&#xD;
      microtiter assay (Admon et al., 1997). 12 HA units of the selected Influenza A vaccine strain&#xD;
      will be added to diluted pre-treated sera with receptor destroying enzyme (RDE, Sigma MO) and&#xD;
      heat inactivation. Following incubation, washed chicken erythrocytes will be added until&#xD;
      sedimentation ensues in the control wells. HAI titer is the inverse of highest dilution of&#xD;
      serum exhibiting complete HAI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza-specific IgG and sIgA ELISA: Influenza virus A specific IgG in serum/plasma and&#xD;
      sIgA in colostrum, breast milk and infant nasal swab will be analyzed by ELISA as described&#xD;
      previously with minor modification (Bruhl et al., 2000; Greenbaum et al., 2004). Briefly&#xD;
      immunoplates will be coated with purified influenza antigen obtained from NIBSC at 2 ug/mL&#xD;
      for overnight at 40C. and then diluted samples will be added for another overnight&#xD;
      incubation. HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG (BD-Pharmingen, CA) or mouse anti-sIgA,&#xD;
      peroxidase-labeled (Alpco Diagnostics, NH) will be used as conjugates. To construct standard&#xD;
      curve, a serial dilution of pooled samples assigned with an arbitrary value will be&#xD;
      introduced in each ELISA plate. Total sIgA in colostrum, breast milk and infant nasal swab&#xD;
      will also be determined by EIA kit (Alpco Diagnostics) to adjust influenza A specific sIgA&#xD;
      response with respect to overall sIgA secretion.&#xD;
