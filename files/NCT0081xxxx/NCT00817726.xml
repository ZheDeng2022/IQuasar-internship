      -  Purpose - to validate a combination of biological and clinical markers in the&#xD;
           rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) population as indicative of the&#xD;
           pre-symptomatic stage of Parkinson's disease (PD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedures - All subjects (RBD diagnosis and controls) will have 1) a medical and neuro&#xD;
           history and physical including videotape of movements, 2) neuropsychological testing, 3)&#xD;
           a sleep study, 4) olfactory testing, 5) blood draw for serum testing , 6) functional&#xD;
           MRI. All of these procedures are often performed clinically in the diagnosis of PD.&#xD;
           Enrollment of subjects with PD is complete. Any testing performed prior to enrollment as&#xD;
           part of the clinical evaluation may be used in place of repeating the procedure for the&#xD;
           study. Subjects will be followed for 5 years. It is hypothesized that a 5 year follow up&#xD;
           may capture a significant number of pre-Parkinson's subjects who will be diagnosed.&#xD;
           Subjects may be offered a repeat enrollment after 5 years.&#xD;
