      Until today, the 5-FU/cisplatin combination is the reference regimen with 30-45% response&#xD;
      rates, which is most commonly used to treat patients with metastatic, recurrent or locally&#xD;
      advanced, unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Because the classical dose&#xD;
      schedule of this two-drug combination is cisplatin 100 mg/m2 day 1 and 5-FU 1000 mg/m2/day&#xD;
      continuous infusion for 96-120 hr, prolonged administration time and mucosal toxicity are&#xD;
      inconvenient to the patients with the aim of palliation. Capecitabine, which is oral prodrug&#xD;
      of 5-FU and mimic continuously-infused 5-FU, is being investigated in phase I, II and III&#xD;
      trials for the treatment of gastric, gastroesophageal, and esophageal cancers, primarily in&#xD;
      the first-line metastatic setting. In our experience, capecitabine plus cisplatin combination&#xD;
      (XP) as a first-line treatment for 45 patients with advanced or recurrent esophageal squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma demonstrated a promising anti-tumor activity with 57% of response rate and&#xD;
      showed tolerable toxicity with convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel has been also investigated as monotherapy and in combination with cisplatin in&#xD;
      patients with advanced esophageal cancer. A Dutch phase II study demonstrated that paclitaxel&#xD;
      combination with carboplatin had shown an encouraging confirmed response rate of 59% with 51&#xD;
      patients with resectable esophageal cancer in neoadjuvant setting. Another Dutch phase II&#xD;
      study showed 43% of response rate including 4% of CR with 8 months of response duration when&#xD;
      paclitaxel plus cisplatin administration was given for patients with metastatic esophageal&#xD;
      cancer. Although recently first-line palliative chemotherapy regimen in esophageal cancer has&#xD;
      been investigated, many trials have failed to show superiority to 5-FU/cisplatin combination.&#xD;
      Since we considered that XP or XT is more effective and convenient chemotherapy regimen than&#xD;
      5-FU/cisplatin, this randomized phase II study was planned to compare XP with XT in terms of&#xD;
      efficacy and tolerability.&#xD;

      1. Introduction and Study Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma Esophageal cancer is the seventh most common&#xD;
           cancer in Korea, with almost 400,000 new patients diagnosed annually worldwide. There&#xD;
           are large variations in the predominant histological type throughout the world but the&#xD;
           majority of worldwide esophageal cancers are squamous cell carcinoma arising from the&#xD;
           upper and middle thirds of the esophagus. Esophageal cancer is a highly virulent disease&#xD;
           with a five-year survival rate of 10-15% . Metastatic esophageal carcinoma is an&#xD;
           incurable disease with median survival duration of 6 to 8 months .&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 5-FU plus Cisplatin (FP) combination chemotherapy Cytotoxic chemotherapy has been&#xD;
           used to control tumor growth, improve quality of life and prolong survival although a&#xD;
           survival advantage for chemotherapy over best supportive care alone in patients with&#xD;
           metastatic cancer of the esophagus has not been proven in randomized trials. Although&#xD;
           there is no standard chemotherapy regimen for metastatic esophageal cancer, various&#xD;
           kinds of chemotherapy regimens have been used to alleviate symptoms caused by cancer and&#xD;
           prolong survival and improve quality of life. Various phase-II trials have been&#xD;
           performed to evaluate the effect of such chemotherapy. The activity of conventional&#xD;
           single agent chemotherapy has been studied for cisplatin, 5-FU and mitomycin, which&#xD;
           induced response rates of 15-30% . In most of these studies, the chemotherapy regimen&#xD;
           consisted of a combination of cisplatin with another agent such as 5-FU or etoposide for&#xD;
           both squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. The most commonly used chemotherapy&#xD;
           regimen for patients with advanced esophageal cancer is a combination of 5-FU and&#xD;
           cisplatin, with response rates ranging from 15% to 45%, however, the effect on survival&#xD;
           remained undetermined.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Capecitabine for esophageal cancer Capecitabine is a novel, orally administered&#xD;
           fluoropyrimidine carbamate that is absorbed readily by the gastrointestinal tract and is&#xD;
           metabolized by the liver, where it is converted initially to 5 -deoxy-5-fluorocytidine&#xD;
           (5 -DFCR) and subsequently, to 5 -deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5 -DFUR). Designed to mimic&#xD;
           continuous intravenous (CIV) 5-FU, oral capecitabine predominantly concentrates in tumor&#xD;
           tissue . Capecitabine currently is approved as a single agent for the adjuvant treatment&#xD;
           of stage III colon cancer, as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer, and&#xD;
           for metastatic breast cancer both as a single agent for patients and in combination with&#xD;
           docetaxel. Whether oral fluoropyrimidines may be appropriately substituted, therefore&#xD;
           making the therapy less burdensome to the patient and reducing the need for infusion&#xD;
           catheters, is not fully investigated In patients with advanced esophagogastric cancer,&#xD;
           capecitabine combinations have generally shown good antitumor activity and highlight the&#xD;
           potential of capecitabine as a replacement of infusional 5-FU . Capecitabine has been&#xD;
           investigated in combination with cisplatin and docetaxel in phase II trials in patients&#xD;
           with advanced esophageal cancer with observed response rates of 47.1% and 46%,&#xD;
           respectively . In a recent phase III trial comparing the efficacy of&#xD;
           capecitabine/cisplatin (XP) versus FP in advanced gastric cancer, XP was not inferior to&#xD;
           FP, in terms of progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and response&#xD;
           rate (RR) . In our experience, the combination of capecitabine and cisplatin for&#xD;
           esophageal cancer showed encouraging response rate (59%) with tolerable toxicities and&#xD;
           convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 Paclitaxel for esophageal cancer Paclitaxel in combination with cisplatin has shown&#xD;
           favorable results for advanced esophageal carcinoma . A recent phase II study of&#xD;
           bi-weekly administration of paclitaxel and cisplatin in 51 patients resulted in complete&#xD;
           response in 4%, partial response in 39%, stable disease in 43% and progressive disease&#xD;
           in 14% of patients, and a one-year survival of 43% . Several phase II trials have&#xD;
           assessed combinations of taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) and cisplatin and other&#xD;
           agents, with response rates of 40-56% .&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4 Capecitabine plus Paclitaxel combination for esophageal cancer Capecitabine in&#xD;
           combination with docetaxel has greater efficacy than single-agent docetaxel; the&#xD;
           combination increased survival significantly compared with single-agent docetaxel (14.5&#xD;
           v 11.5 months) in patients with metastatic breast cancer who experienced disease&#xD;
           progression after anthracycline therapy . The most common treatment-related adverse&#xD;
           events (TRAEs), with capecitabine 1,250 mg/m2 bid and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 were alopecia,&#xD;
           hand-foot skin reaction (HFS), nausea, and fatigue. Neutropenia (15%) and HFS (11%) were&#xD;
           the only grade 3 or 4 TRAEs that occurred in more than 10% of patients. In this trial&#xD;
           the tolerable delivered dose of capecitabine for most patients was 950 mg/m2 bid for 14&#xD;
           days. Lorenzen et al. treated 24 patients with capecitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2&#xD;
           twice daily on Days 1 through 14 and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 on Day 1 of 3-week cycles. The&#xD;
           RR was 46% and median survival was 15.8 months. However, the toxicity profile was high&#xD;
           with two 2 treatment-related deaths, a high incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (42%),&#xD;
           and a high incidence of Grade 3 HFS (29%).&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is a theoretical advantage to using paclitaxel on a weekly schedule in conjunction&#xD;
           with capecitabine based on the duration of the upregulation of thymidine phosphorylase&#xD;
           (dThPase) by paclitaxel in model systems. The metabolism of capecitabine to the active&#xD;
           agent, FU, provides insight into the rationale for combining capecitabine with taxanes&#xD;
           in this phase II study . The rationale for combining paclitaxel with capecitabine is&#xD;
           based on the upregulation of dTHPase, which has been demonstrated in a model of athymic&#xD;
           mice bearing capecitabine-resistant human colon cancer xenografts. Treatment with&#xD;
           paclitaxel led to a 7.9-fold increase in intratumoral dThPase. An increase in dThPase&#xD;
           activity occurred 4 days after treatment with paclitaxel and persisted for 10 days .&#xD;
           These data led to the current concept for this clinical trial, using paclitaxel on days&#xD;
           1 and 8 during a 14-day exposure to capecitabine in patients with MBC. Moreover, these&#xD;
           agents have nonoverlapping toxicities and therefore can be combined with reasonable&#xD;
           tolerability. It was anticipated that by allowing a week off from weekly paclitaxel&#xD;
           therapy, the frequency of sensory neuropathy could be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Given the high degree of efficacy of the docetaxel/capecitabine combination, but the&#xD;
           significant toxicity observed with 1,250 mg/m2 bid capecitabine schedule, as well as the&#xD;
           promising efficacy and safety observed with weekly paclitaxel/capecitabine in the phase&#xD;
           I study by Uhlmann et al [27], we choose weekly paclitaxel for combination regimen with&#xD;
           capecitabine. Practically, our study regimen is capecitabine plus paclitaxel(XT)&#xD;
           combination chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.5 XP vs XT for esophageal cancer Based on the rationale and our experience, we are&#xD;
           going to conduct randomized phase II trial for metastatic esophageal cancer to evaluate&#xD;
           the efficacy and feasibility comparing XP with XT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
