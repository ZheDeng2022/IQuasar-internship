  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term autoimmune disease that is characterized by pain,&#xD;
      stiffness, inflammation, swelling, and sometimes destruction of joints. RA usually requires&#xD;
      lifelong treatment, including medications, physical therapy, exercise, education, and&#xD;
      possibly surgery, but the course and severity of the disease can differ significantly from&#xD;
      person to person. The purpose of this study is to identify genetic and other factors that&#xD;
      determine the severity of RA in African Americans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RA is a chronic condition that causes inflammation of the joints and surrounding tissues.&#xD;
      Symptoms may include pain, stiffness, swelling, and sometimes destruction of joints. RA can&#xD;
      affect any joint, but it is most common in the wrist and fingers. More women than men get RA,&#xD;
      and it often starts between the ages of 25 and 55. The course and severity of the disease can&#xD;
      differ significantly from person to person. Some people with RA may have the disease for only&#xD;
      a short time, or their symptoms might come and go, but the severe form of RA can last a&#xD;
      lifetime. The purpose of this study is to identify genetic and other factors that determine&#xD;
      the severity of RA in African Americans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will include African Americans with RA and healthy African&#xD;
      Americans with RA. There are two arms: (1) longitudinal; and (2) cross-sectional. The&#xD;
      longitudinal arm has completed enrollment and is still in the follow-up phase. This consists&#xD;
      of visits at baseline (less than 2 years disease duration; 3 years disease duration; and 5&#xD;
      years disease duration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the cross-sectional arm, there will be one study visit for all participants, which will&#xD;
      last approximately 1 to 2 hours for participants without RA (controls) and 2 to 3 hours for&#xD;
      participants with RA. For all participants, this visit will include a medical history review;&#xD;
      questionnaires regarding health, functional ability, family, education, and work history; and&#xD;
      blood and urine collection. For participants with RA, this visit will also include&#xD;
      examination of the joints for pain and swelling, X-rays of the hands and feet, and a physical&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The urine samples will be stored for future analyses of protein and chemical markers. The&#xD;
      blood samples will be used in three different ways: (1) isolation of DNA; (2) isolation of&#xD;
      serum and plasma; and (3) isolation of RNA. Part of the blood samples will be used by the&#xD;
      investigators to identify genes or proteins that may predispose people to develop RA or that&#xD;
      may influence disease outcome or treatment response. If participants agree, their blood cells&#xD;
      will be put through a procedure called immortalization, which will provide researchers with&#xD;
      sufficient DNA for all future studies associated with this study and for other related&#xD;
      projects. If the immortalization process fails, participants may be asked for an additional&#xD;
      blood sample with which to repeat the procedure. However, participants will not be provided&#xD;
      with any information on their genes.&#xD;
