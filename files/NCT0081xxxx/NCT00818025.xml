  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to test the efficacy of a novel&#xD;
      intervention, Pocket PATH (Personal Assistant for Tracking Health) for promoting self-care&#xD;
      agency, self-care behaviors, and transplant-related health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung transplant recipients (LTR) experience more transplant-related complications, higher&#xD;
      health resource utilization, and higher mortality than recipients of other solid organs.&#xD;
      Prevention and detection of early complications is known to reduce the likelihood of future&#xD;
      impairments in lung function and, therefore, morbidity and mortality. Despite the scarce&#xD;
      donor organs and financial resources expended to support individuals throughout the lung&#xD;
      transplant experience, no randomized controlled trials (RCT) have tested interventions&#xD;
      designed to promote self-care behaviors with the aim of improving transplant-related health&#xD;
      after lung transplant. The purpose of this RCT is to compare the efficacy of a novel&#xD;
      behavioral intervention, Pocket PATH (Personal Assistant for Tracking Health) for promoting&#xD;
      self-care and improving health outcomes relative to standard care after lung transplantation.&#xD;
      Pocket PATH provides LTR a hand-held device with customized data recording, trending, and&#xD;
      decision-support programs to promote their self-care behaviors. Based on the promising&#xD;
      results from our early trials, a full-scale RCT has been designed to rigorously test the&#xD;
      efficacy of Pocket PATH in promoting self-care agency, self-care behaviors, and hence&#xD;
      improving transplant-related health. A sample of 214 LTR who survive the immediate intensive&#xD;
      care unit recovery period will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group, who&#xD;
      will be instructed to use the Pocket Path device and its programs designed for&#xD;
      self-monitoring, adhering to the regimen, and communicating condition changes to the&#xD;
      transplant team, or the control group who will receive standard instructions regarding the&#xD;
      post-transplant regimen (including health monitoring). Information will be collected from&#xD;
      participants at baseline and 1 week, 2, 6, and 12 months after discharge from the hospital&#xD;
      following lung transplantation. Longitudinal, repeated-measures models with planned&#xD;
      comparisons will be used to test the hypotheses for the primary aims. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      subjects in the Pocket PATH group will develop higher levels of self-care agency and perform&#xD;
      self-care behaviors more often than subjects in the control group and, therefore, will&#xD;
      experience fewer transplant-related complications, re-hospitalizations, and better health&#xD;
      related quality of life.&#xD;
