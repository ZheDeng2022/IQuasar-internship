      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the association of the probability of increase in phosphorylation of&#xD;
           platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) of &gt; 0.5 in peripheral blood leucocytes&#xD;
           following pre-operative docetaxel chemotherapy, with progression-free survival in&#xD;
           localized castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the association of the probability of increase in phosphorylated&#xD;
           platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) expression in peripheral blood&#xD;
           leucocytes &gt; 0.5 with indices of tumor regression including PSA-decline by 50% and&#xD;
           measures of objective regression of tumor by transrectal MRI following pre-operative&#xD;
           docetaxel therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore associations of probability of increase in phosphorylated PDGFR in peripheral&#xD;
           blood leucocytes following pre-operative docetaxel therapy with plasma PDGF kinetics and&#xD;
           spatial and quantitative PDGF and phosphorylated PDGFR expression in tumor and stromal&#xD;
           compartments in resected specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the association of probability of increase in phosphorylated PDGFR expression&#xD;
           in peripheral blood leucocytes following pre-operative docetaxel chemotherapy with&#xD;
           overall survival outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess global quality of life measures at baseline and 6 and 12 months post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Create a tissue archive comprising tumor and peripheral blood specimens as a suitable&#xD;
           resource for future genomic and proteomic studies.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Docetaxel is designed to stop the growth of cancer cells, which may cause the cells to die.&#xD;
      It is believed to be weakly effective at killing blood vessels in cancer cells as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prednisone and docetaxel are commonly used to treat prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, on Day 1 of every 21-day study&#xD;
      &quot;cycle&quot;, you will receive docetaxel through a needle in your vein over 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everyday, you will take prednisone by mouth 2 times a day (in the morning and evening). You&#xD;
      should take prednisone with meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take dexamethasone by mouth at 12 hours and 6 hours before you receive docetaxel.&#xD;
      This is to help reduce the risk of any allergic reaction and fluid retention. It is important&#xD;
      that you take this drug on schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each cycle, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs or treatments you may be receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you have experienced since your last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to test for PSA and&#xD;
      testosterone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 3, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to test for PDGFR and PDGF&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you complete 2 cycles or more, you will be eligible to have surgery as part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are eligible, no more than 21 days after your last dose of docetaxel, you will have&#xD;
      surgery to remove your prostate gland. You will sign a separate consent for this surgery,&#xD;
      which will describe the procedure and its risks in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before surgery, probably at your pre-surgical visit, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn&#xD;
      to test for PDGFR and PDGF levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take the study drug for up to 4 cycles before having surgery. You will be off study&#xD;
      treatment after you have surgery. You will be taken off study early if you experience&#xD;
      intolerable side effects or the disease gets worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Docetaxel given with prednisone is commercially available&#xD;
      and FDA approved for the treatment of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 28 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
