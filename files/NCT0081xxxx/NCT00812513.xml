  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) is a potent mitogen for a wide range of cell types&#xD;
      including fibroblasts, smooth muscle and connective tissue. Recombinant human platelet&#xD;
      derived growth factor (R-Pdf/Gbb) has biologic activity similar to endogenous platelet&#xD;
      derived growth factor (PDGF). Biologic activity of PDGF includes encouraging chemotaxis and&#xD;
      proliferation of cells responsible for wound repair and it augments production of granulation&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The growth factor rhPDGF is found effective in patients having diabetic foot ulcer grade III&#xD;
      and IV. The nature of wounds in the third degree burns is similar so far as healing process&#xD;
      is concerned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypotheses that the application of R-Pdf/Gbb 0.01%&#xD;
      gel on the third degree thermal and electrical burns will heal these wounds within 3 months&#xD;
      and there will be improvement in general condition of the patients without any complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The R-Pdf/Gbb is recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor. It has been demonstrated&#xD;
      that rhPDGF is effective in enhancing wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of R-Pdf/Gbb gel&#xD;
      in treating wounds caused by III degree thermal and electrical burns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS 1: That the applications of R-Pdf/Gbb 0.01% gel on III degree thermal and&#xD;
      electrical burns will heal these wounds within 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS 2: Subjects, who having III degree thermal and electrical burns with the treatment&#xD;
      of R-Pdf/Gbb 0.01% gel, will show improvement in general condition without any complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to test these hypotheses by evaluating the clinical outcome in about 120 patients&#xD;
      after three months of treatment with R-Pdf/Gbb 0.01% gel applied once daily.&#xD;
