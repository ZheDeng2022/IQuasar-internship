      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre operative radio-chemotherapy might be not mandatory to improve local recurrent rate&#xD;
           and survival rate in the mid-lower rectal cancer patients with T3N0 clinical stage, if&#xD;
           surgical principals were kept.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laparoscopic resection is not inferior to Open surgery in the treatment of rectal&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is known that 20-60% of the rectal cancer patients treated with radical resection have the&#xD;
      local recurrence. Therefore, chemo-radiotherapy before or after operation have been the&#xD;
      standard treatment protocol in the rectal cancer patients to reduce the local recurrence,&#xD;
      preserve more surrounding pelvic viscera, improve the prognosis and eventually quality of&#xD;
      life. The preoperative chemo-radiotherapy was introduced by the German Rectal Cancer study,&#xD;
      which compared pre- and postoperative chemo and radiotherapy. In this study, the authors&#xD;
      reported that preoperative chemo-radiotherapy reduced local recurrent rate and 3 or 4 degree&#xD;
      toxicity and improved the compliance for treatment. Since the introduction of chemo and&#xD;
      radiotherapy in the treatment of rectal cancer, there have been numerous controversies on the&#xD;
      guidelines or protocols of chemo-radiotherapy. In 1990, National Institute of Health (NIH)&#xD;
      recommended postoperative chemo- radiotherapy to all the pT3 or pN1 rectal cancer patients at&#xD;
      the consensus conference. In some studies, they reported that good clinical outcome and low&#xD;
      local recurrence rate were obtained by only surgical treatment in the pT3N0 rectal cancer&#xD;
      patients with favourable pathological characteristics. They also insisted that the&#xD;
      effectiveness of postoperative chemo- radiotherapy was not evident. Gunderson, et al.&#xD;
      retrospectively evaluated the five-year survival rate of the pT3N0 patients. They reported&#xD;
      that the patients with surgery and chemotherapy showed the similar survival rate with the&#xD;
      patients who underwent surgery and postoperative chemo-radiotherapy. National Cancer Data&#xD;
      Base showed the similar report. However, there are some problems to apply theses results to&#xD;
      the decision of preoperative therapeutic options. Moreover, some papers showed the low local&#xD;
      recurrent rate (less than 5%) in the stage II without the supplement therapy, when the TME&#xD;
      was precisely performed. All these results present the controversies on the&#xD;
      radio-chemotherapy on all the T3N0 patients in terms of the clinical outcomes and the&#xD;
      prognosis. In Korea, numerous clinical trials have been performed on the rectal cancer&#xD;
      patients, however there has been no clinical study for preoperative chemo- radiotherapy in&#xD;
      the T3N0 rectal cancer patients. In this reason, the protocols are different among&#xD;
      institutions without unified standard treatment protocol. In this study, the authors compare&#xD;
      the accuracy of diagnosis, the functional differences according to the preoperative chemo-&#xD;
      radiotherapy, the local recurrent rate and survival rate between the two groups of T3N0&#xD;
      patients; one group with preoperative chemo-radiotherapy vs. the other without. In addition,&#xD;
      the authors evaluate the advantage of the laparoscopic surgery, such as an extensive vision,&#xD;
      so that laparoscopy can help rectal surgery as well as the surgical outcome.&#xD;
