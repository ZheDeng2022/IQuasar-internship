      This study aims to evaluate the utility of the atrial electromechanical interval and pulse&#xD;
      wave velocity in the prediction of recurrence of atrial fibrillation among patients who&#xD;
      underwent successful direct current cardioversion for atrial fibrillation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective cohort study designed to evaluate the value of atrial&#xD;
      electromechanical interval and pulse wave velocity in the prediction of recurrence of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation among patients with atrial fibrillation with successful direct-current&#xD;
      cardioversion to sinus rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should cardioversion be successful, a limited 2D echocardiogram will be done and the&#xD;
      following information will be measured: atrial electromechanical interval, left atrial&#xD;
      volume, left atrial size, ejection fraction, and maximal A-wave transmitral Doppler flow&#xD;
      velocity. The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy and valvular heart disease will be&#xD;
      recorded. In addition, baseline clinical information including age, gender, medications,&#xD;
      presence of HTN, DM, CAD, stroke, and prior history of atrial fibrillation will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radial artery applanation tonometry and pulse wave analysis will be used to calculate a&#xD;
      central aortic pressure and other parameters using commercially available SphygmoCor® system.&#xD;
      Central aortic pressures will be obtained immediately following measurement of brachial&#xD;
      artery pressures. Patients will be seated for 5 minutes in a quiet room after which time&#xD;
      blood pressure will be measured over the brachial artery three times at 5 minute intervals.&#xD;
      The mean of the last two measurements will be recorded as representative of the brachial&#xD;
      artery pressure. After the last measurement, radial artery pressure waveforms of the same arm&#xD;
      will be sampled over 10 seconds with a Millar tonometer and calibrated to the average&#xD;
      brachial pressure. Waveforms will be processed with dedicated software (SphygmoCor® version&#xD;
      7, AtCor). The software will be used to calculate an averaged radial artery waveform and to&#xD;
      derive a corresponding central aortic pressure. Aortic pressure waveforms will be subjected&#xD;
      to further analysis by the SphygmoCor® software to identify the time to the peak/shoulder of&#xD;
      the first and second pressure wave components (T1, T2) during systole. The pressure at the&#xD;
      peak/shoulder of the first component sill be identified as P1 height (outgoing pressure wave)&#xD;
      and the pressure difference between P1 and the maximal pressure during systole (∆P or&#xD;
      augmentation) will be identified as the reflected pressure wave occurring during systole.&#xD;
      Augmentation index (AIx), defined as the ratio of augmentation to central pulse pressure,&#xD;
      will be expressed as the percentage: AIx = (∆P/PP) x 100, where P is pressure and PP is pulse&#xD;
      pressure. Pulse pressure amplification (PPA) will be expressed as the ratio of central pulse&#xD;
      pressure (CPP) to peripheral (brachial) pulse pressure (PPP): PPA = PPP/CPP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information will be recorded and the patients will be followed by their respective&#xD;
      cardiologists and evaluated for recurrence of atrial fibrillation within 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint for this study is clinical recurrence of atrial fibrillation or 6 month time&#xD;
      frame of sustained maintenance of sinus rhythm whichever comes first.&#xD;
