      The purpose of this study is to determine whether low and intermediate GI Caribbean foods are&#xD;
      effective in the management of type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

      Recruitment: Subjects for the study were sourced primarily from the University Hospital of&#xD;
      the West Indices (Diabetic Clinic) and from the Diabetes Association of Jamaica Outreach&#xD;
      Centers in Kingston and St. Catherine. Volunteers were also recruited through clinical visits&#xD;
      and by opportunistic population screenings and by placing advertisements in local newspapers&#xD;
      and by distributing similar advertisements to the diabetes clinic and diabetes education&#xD;
      programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information Sessions: Approximately 112 volunteers in groups of 10-30 with or without spouses&#xD;
      will attend one of a number of evening information sessions at run from the Department of&#xD;
      Basic Medical Sciences (Biochemistry Section), University of the West Indies. During the&#xD;
      sessions the exact nature of the study will be described and volunteers will have the&#xD;
      opportunity to ask specific questions about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: Potential subjects will then fill in and return to the investigators a detailed&#xD;
      questionnaire concerning their medical history, medications (including vitamin, mineral and&#xD;
      nutritional supplements) smoking habits, alcohol intake and exercise pattern and whether they&#xD;
      are currently on a specific diet. Details will also be obtained concerning planned vacations.&#xD;
      Those subjects deemed potentially eligible will be asked to give a fasting blood sample at&#xD;
      the Biotechnology Center, University of the West Indies. Individuals who meet the study&#xD;
      criteria, are invited to return again to the Department. The principles of the diabetic diet&#xD;
      which they are already expected to be following will be reinforced by the study nutritionist&#xD;
      whereby consuming a diet with more than 50% of daily calories from carbohydrate; less than&#xD;
      10% from saturated fat and 20% from mono- and polyunsaturated fat, or up to 25% if the&#xD;
      surplus is from monounsaturated fat; cholesterol less than 300 mg/day; and approximately 1.0&#xD;
      g protein per kg ideal weight per day. An increase in the intake of dietary fiber to 15 g per&#xD;
      1000 kcal was encouraged. All subjects were then randomized to one 24-week treatment in a&#xD;
      two-treatment parallel design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments: 1) low glycemic index dietary advice (e.g. to eat intact grain cereals, boiled&#xD;
      green banana, boiled sweet potato, boiled round leaf yellow yams and boiled breadfruit) 2)&#xD;
      high cereal fiber diet. Background diets will be the subjects' diabetic diets, modified as&#xD;
      above, which will conform. Diet histories will be recorded at weekly for 24 weeks. These&#xD;
      diets will be assessed for consistency by the dietitian in the subject's presence through&#xD;
      dietary recall and semi-quantitative assessment of food portion sizes consumed. Where&#xD;
      necessary, modifications in diet will be made to ensure weight maintenance. Compliance will&#xD;
      be assessed by 7 day food records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: the study will consist of four months recruitment and patient selection, during&#xD;
      which time estimation of individual caloric requirements will be performed, and 6 months&#xD;
      treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Details: Fasting blood samples were obtained at day zero and weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and&#xD;
      24 of each study period. Twenty-four hour urine for urinary C-peptide analyses will be&#xD;
      obtained immediately prior to the beginning of the study and at the end of each 24-week&#xD;
      treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palatability and satiety: subjects will record their ratings using a 9-point bipolar semantic&#xD;
      scale at weekly intervals during each study phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measures: height at recruitment, waist and hip circumference, and body&#xD;
      composition will be taken immediately prior to and at the end of each study phase. Body&#xD;
      weight and blood pressure will be measured at clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will help to indicate whether a low-intermediate-GI indigenous Caribbean foods&#xD;
      dietary advice can reduce the postprandial glycemia, inflammation and cardiovascular risks in&#xD;
      person with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
