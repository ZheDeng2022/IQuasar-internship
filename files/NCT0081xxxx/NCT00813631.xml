      Background. Malignant fungating wounds(MFW) are caused by cancerous cells invading skin&#xD;
      tissue, which exhibit increased bacterial burdens that not only result in a negative physical&#xD;
      impact (odour, exudates, pain, and infection) on patients, impairing their quality of life,&#xD;
      but they also increase treatment costs. A systematic review of the effectiveness of that the&#xD;
      silver-releasing dressing in the management of infected chronic wounds can help enhance&#xD;
      control of wound bed infection and inflammation, tissue management, moisture balance, and&#xD;
      protect wound edge. However, few studies have examined the effects on people with MFW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothses In this study that the hypothesized that cancer patients in the ionic silver&#xD;
      dressing group will perception higher quality of life compared to patients in the control&#xD;
      group who receive non-ionic silver dressing. In addition, we hypothesized that cancer&#xD;
      patients who also receive ionic silver dressing will have lower level of symptom distress at&#xD;
      end of study compared to patients in the control group receive non-ionic silver dressing&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

      Introduction. At the beginning of the 21st century, cancer is increasing in the aging&#xD;
      population and patients often have a greater life expectancy than they did 40 years ago&#xD;
      (Payne et al 2004). As people age, and the incidence of cancer increases, it is essential to&#xD;
      push the frontiers of oncology care to meet the symptom management needs of these patients.&#xD;
      For many, cancer has become a slowly progressive, chronic disease - a change that brings with&#xD;
      it particular challenges for oncology nurses (Hoskin and Makin 1998). A systematic review of&#xD;
      the effectiveness of that the silver-releasing dressing in the management of infected chronic&#xD;
      wounds can help enhance control of wound bed infection and inflammation, tissue management,&#xD;
      moisture balance, and protect wound edge. This study is designed to assess the effects of&#xD;
      ionic silver dressing (AQUACEL Ag) in head and neck patients with malignant fungating wound&#xD;
      (MFW) on the quality of life, symptom distress and wound bed changed of patients with MFW&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of MFW. Malignant Fungating wounds arise as a result of infiltration of the&#xD;
      structures of the skin by malignant cells. These cells may arise from primary skin cancer, an&#xD;
      underlying malignant tumor or through metastasis spread from a distant malignant&#xD;
      tumor(Punder, 1998).A fungating cancer is a primary or secondary malignant growth in the skin&#xD;
      which has ulcerated and results in pain, exudates, bleeding, infection and malodour(Twycross,&#xD;
      1995) .A malignant tumor will invade and destroy adjacent tissues and can spread to other&#xD;
      tissues with in cells that break off and travel in the blood or lymph system. It can develop&#xD;
      its own blood supply, sometime outgrowing it and causing the tumor to become necrotic in the&#xD;
      middle(Mera, 1997).Dealey(1994) states that, as the tumor extends, capillaries rupture,&#xD;
      leading to epithelium results in ulceration through the skin, and lesions presents as a&#xD;
      fungating, foul-smelling mass(Daeley, 1994).Fungating malignant wounds are caused by the&#xD;
      infiltration of the skin and its supporting blood and lymph vessels by a local tumor or as a&#xD;
      result of metastasis growth from the primary tumor. Unless the malignant cells are checked by&#xD;
      single or combination cancer treatments the fungation extends with the potential for causing&#xD;
      massive damage at the wound site through a combination of proliferate growth, loss of&#xD;
      vascularity and ulceration(Mortimer, 1998) .A fungating wound is defined as a cancerous&#xD;
      lesion involving the skin, which is open and may be draining. The lesion may be result of a&#xD;
      primary cancer or metastasis to the skin from a local tumor or from a tumor in a distant&#xD;
      site. It may take the form of a cavity, an open area on the surface of the skin, skin&#xD;
      nodules, or a nodular growth extending from the surface of the skin(British Columbia Cancer&#xD;
      Agency, 2001) .As the malignant cells multiply in the skin they form a tumour that enlarges&#xD;
      causing disruption of skin capillaries and lymph vessels, eventually leading to tissues&#xD;
      Hypoxia and subsequent skin necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection control of MFW. All chronic wounds contain bacteria. Kingsley(2003) state that the&#xD;
      change in numbers of bacteria and the body's response as a continuum, rating from&#xD;
      contamination to infection(Kingsley, 2003). Contamination is mean that the bacteria present&#xD;
      on the wound surface but are not proliferating and have no clinic effect; colonised imply&#xD;
      bacteria have proliferated, but there is no host reaction; critical colonisation occurs where&#xD;
      the body's local host response starts to be initiated, but there are no systemic sign of&#xD;
      infection; Infection is point in time when the bacteria have multiplying and invaded deeper&#xD;
      tissues, healing is impaired and produced a systemic host reaction(Jacqui. Fletcher, 2005;&#xD;
      Verdu Soriano , Rueda Lopez, Martinez Cuervo, &amp; Soldevilla Agreda 2004) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical recognition of these rating stages is not easy because there are no clear&#xD;
      descriptors. However, Soriano et al (2004) defined classification according to the number of&#xD;
      bacteria present in the wound bed: Contamination-≦103 colony-forming unit (CFUs) per gram of&#xD;
      tissues; colonised -≦104 CFUs ; Infection -≧105 CFUs. Cutting and White noted several aspects&#xD;
      of wound infection such as: serous drainage with concurrent inflammation, discoloured&#xD;
      granulation tissue, pocketing at the wound base, unexpected pain , foul odour, increase in&#xD;
      exudates, exudates that becomes purulent instead of serous, and wound breakdown(White &amp;&#xD;
      Cutting, 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the MFW, the presence of hypoxic necrotic tissues within the wound provides an excellent&#xD;
      medium for growth of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria(J. Clark, 2002). Anaerobic and aerobic&#xD;
      bacteria thrive in these conditions, giving rise to excessive malodour wound&#xD;
      exudates(Haisfield-Wolfe &amp; Rund 1997). Lo et al (2006) survey of seventy cancer patients with&#xD;
      MFW in Taiwan, the study found that the 60.3% wound bed presented necrotic tissue ; malodour&#xD;
      was present in 50% of patients ; 81.4% shows moderate to large exudates and 71.4% reported&#xD;
      purulent(Lo, 2006). According above the data, infection has emerged as a major health problem&#xD;
      during the patient suffers MFW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ionic silver dressing. Silver, in its common ionic (active) form (Ag+), is particularly&#xD;
      attractive as an antibacterial agent because it can be readily incorporated into dressing&#xD;
      materials. When the materials contact an aqueous environment, the silver complex contained in&#xD;
      them is dissociated (Ovington 2004, White &amp; Cutting 2006). The mechanism of action for Ag+ is&#xD;
      that it binds to bacterial cell DNA, and enzymes, and proteins in the cell wall. Once the&#xD;
      silver cation attaches to these sites, it alters their structure, resulting in structural and&#xD;
      functional changes in the bacterial cell (Ovington 2004).It is suggested by numerous authors&#xD;
      that silver dressings should be utilized when critical colonization within a wound occurs&#xD;
      (Ovington 2004, White &amp; Cutting 2006, Lo et al 2008). Therefore, this study research&#xD;
      questions is (1)What are the effects of ionic silver dressing (AQUACEL Ag)in head and neck&#xD;
      patients with malignant fungating wound, as compared to hydrofiber dressing(AQUACEL), on the&#xD;
      individual perception subjective quality of life?(2) What are the effects of ionic silver&#xD;
      dressing (AQUACEL Ag) in head and neck patients with malignant fungating wound, as compared&#xD;
      to hydrofiber dressing (AQUACEL) alone, on the symptom distress and wound bed changed of&#xD;
      patients receiving ionic silver dressing (AQUACEL Ag) for cancer patients?&#xD;
