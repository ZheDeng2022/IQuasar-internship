  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the AcuFocus Corneal Inlay ACI 7000PDT will&#xD;
      provide an effective method for the correction of presbyopia in patients who have normal&#xD;
      distance vision but need a correction such as glasses or contact lenses to see clearly at&#xD;
      near.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The loss of near vision and the ability to perform tasks that require near vision is part of&#xD;
      the normal aging process. This natural transformation in the eye occurs as a result of the&#xD;
      loss of accommodation of the crystalline lens, a condition known as presbyopia. The&#xD;
      crystalline lens is responsible for the accommodative properties of the human eye, as&#xD;
      established by Young in 1801, over 200 years ago.1 During accommodation, the ciliary muscle&#xD;
      contracts, decreasing tension on the zonules, and allowing the crystalline lens to thicken,&#xD;
      increasing its refractive power. This mechanism of accommodation and thickening of the lens&#xD;
      provides the eye with adequate refractive power for near vision. The loss of accommodation&#xD;
      with aging is the result of changes in the crystalline lens composition that prevent the&#xD;
      natural accommodative process from occurring. This is associated with the gradual loss of&#xD;
      near vision without external correction, generally in the form of spectacles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AcuFocus™ ACI 7000PDT represents new technology based on the well-established concept of&#xD;
      small-aperture optics. In early cameras, depth of focus was controlled by reducing the&#xD;
      aperture through which light enters. The smaller the aperture, the greater the depth of focus&#xD;
      will be. This concept also applies to the human eye. In the eye of a presbyopic emmetrope,&#xD;
      the lens cannot accommodate sufficiently to focus the light rays from a near object onto a&#xD;
      single point on the retina. Thus, a point object is imaged as a blur circle on the retina,&#xD;
      and images of extended objects are degraded as well. If an opaque disc with a small aperture&#xD;
      in the center is placed in front of the eye, the peripheral rays will be obscured while the&#xD;
      central rays pass unaffected. Since peripheral rays enter the eye at a larger angle, they&#xD;
      create a larger blur circle at the retinal image plane. Eliminating these peripheral rays&#xD;
      reduces the size of the blur circle, improving image resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In presbyopic subjects, objects closer than arm's length are focused behind the retina, thus&#xD;
      creating blurred retinal images (which are composed of blur circles). A small aperture inlay&#xD;
      placed in front of the eye of these subjects allows them to see at near by reducing the size&#xD;
      of the blur circle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AcuFocus, Inc. has developed a stationary intracorneal inlay designed to create a small&#xD;
      aperture effect. The implant is intended to be placed intra-stromally; the corneal flap will&#xD;
      be newly created and fully lifted for presbyopic emmetropes. Placement of the ACI on the&#xD;
      stromal bed centered over the pupil in the non-dominant eye is expected to increase the depth&#xD;
      of focus of the eye by reducing the circle of blur. Based on theoretical calculations of&#xD;
      small aperture optics, the ACI is expected to provide presbyopic subjects with improvement of&#xD;
      near and intermediate vision.&#xD;
