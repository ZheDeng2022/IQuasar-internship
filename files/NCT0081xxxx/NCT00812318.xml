        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation&#xD;
             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and 12-lead ECG. A&#xD;
             subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference&#xD;
             range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and&#xD;
             the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional&#xD;
             risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential&#xD;
             (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant) including any female who:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Is pre-menopausal with a documented bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral&#xD;
                  oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) or hysterectomy, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Is post-menopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. A follicle&#xD;
                  stimulating hormone (FSH) level will be performed to confirm a post-menopausal&#xD;
                  status. For this study, FSH levels &gt; 40 mlU/ml is confirmatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A male is eligible to enter and participate in the study if he is surgically sterile&#xD;
             OR if he either agrees to abstain from sexual intercourse with a female partner or&#xD;
             agrees to use a condom/spermicide, in addition to having his female partner use&#xD;
             another form of contraception as outlined in Section 7.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight &gt;= 50 kg (110 lbs.) for men and &gt;= 45 kg (99 lbs) for women and body mass&#xD;
             index (BMI) within the range 18.5-31.0 kg/m2 (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A signed and dated written informed consent is obtained from the subject or the&#xD;
             subject's legal representative prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must be capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance&#xD;
             with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As a result of the medical interview, physical examination, or screening&#xD;
             investigations, the Investigator considers the subject unfit for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen; positive hepatitis C (HCV)&#xD;
             antibody or detectable HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA); or positive HIV-1 antibody result.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of regular alcohol consumption averaging &gt;7 drinks/week for women or &gt;14&#xD;
             drinks/week for men within 6 months of the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: 1 drink is equivalent to 12 g alcohol = 5 ounces (150 ml) of wine or 12 ounces (360&#xD;
        ml) of beer or 1.5 ounces (45 ml) of 80 proof distilled spirits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwilling to abstain from alcohol for 48 hours prior to the start of dosing until&#xD;
             collection of the final pharmacokinetic sample during each treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwilling to refrain from the use of illicit drugs and adhere to other protocol-stated&#xD;
             restrictions while participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has received an investigational drug or participated in any other research&#xD;
             trial within 30 days or 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the biological effect&#xD;
             of any drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of current study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in the study would result in donation of blood in excess of 500 mL&#xD;
             within a 56 day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: This does not include plasma donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - History or presence of allergy or intolerance to the study drug or its components or&#xD;
        drugs of its class, or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
        physician responsible, contraindicates their participation. In addition, if heparin is used&#xD;
        during PK sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced&#xD;
        thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: &quot;Study&quot; or &quot;investigational&quot; drugs include GSK1265744 or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a pre-existing condition interfering with normal gastrointestinal&#xD;
             anatomy or motility, hepatic and/or renal function, that could interfere with the&#xD;
             absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs. Subjects with a history&#xD;
             of cholecystectomy should be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion criteria for screening ECG per protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject's systolic blood pressure is outside the range of 90-140mmHg, or diastolic&#xD;
             blood pressure is outside the range of 45-90mmHg or heart rate is outside the range of&#xD;
             50-100bpm for female subjects or 45-100 bpm for male subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of regular use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products within 3&#xD;
             months of the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a positive pre-study drug and/or alcohol screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including antacids, vitamins, herbal&#xD;
             and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort and iron supplements) within 7 days&#xD;
             (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is&#xD;
             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator and sponsor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures&#xD;
             or compromise subject safety&#xD;
