    <textblock>
      We want to learn if dasatinib will make triple negative breast cancers smaller. We also hope&#xD;
      that we can learn more about what makes triple negative breast cancers grow. We believe this&#xD;
      information will help us to predict which patients will benefit from taking this drug or&#xD;
      other drugs like it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a &quot;neoadjuvant study&quot;, which means that it is only open to women who have not&#xD;
      had any treatment for their breast cancer. Neoadjuvant studies allow the study doctor to look&#xD;
      at how the cells in your cancer change after taking the study medication. This will help us&#xD;
      to understand whether or not dasatinib is an effective treatment for breast cancer. It will&#xD;
      also help us to learn more about triple negative breast cancer and how to treat it.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women who have been recently diagnosed with a type of breast cancer called &quot;triple negative&quot;,&#xD;
      and have not yet received any type of treatment (surgery, radiation therapy, etc.) for breast&#xD;
      cancer are among the patient population this study will seek. &quot;Triple negative&quot; means breast&#xD;
      cancer is not estrogen receptor positive (ER+), progesterone receptor positive (PgR+) or&#xD;
      human epidermal growth factor receptor positive (HER2+). Some types of breast cancers&#xD;
      &quot;overexpress&quot; one or more of these receptors. &quot;Overexpress&quot; means that the cancer cells have&#xD;
      too many of these receptors. ER and PgR are hormone receptors that are located on some types&#xD;
      of breast cancer cells. When these receptors are present, the hormones estrogen and&#xD;
      progesterone are able to tell cancer cells to grow and divide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This kind of breast cancer does not have an over-production (overexpression) of these three&#xD;
      receptors, and that is why we call it &quot;triple-negative&quot; breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are trying to find new and better treatments for women with triple negative breast cancer.&#xD;
      We do not know what causes triple negative breast cancers to grow. Other research studies&#xD;
      have shown that &quot;triple negative&quot; breast cancers overexpress different types of receptors.&#xD;
      These receptors might help the cancer to grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will be testing a drug called dasatinib. Dasatinib is a drug that is made by Bristol-Myers&#xD;
      Squibb. It is sold under the name of Sprycel. It was first used to treat patients with&#xD;
      leukemia, a type of blood cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dasatinib interferes with the growth of some cancers. Dasatinib attaches to the cancer cell&#xD;
      and slows down or stops the cancer cell from growing. It is approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA), but not for the kind of cancer that you have been diagnosed with.&#xD;
