  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Menkes disease and occipital horn syndrome are two forms of copper deficiency that must be&#xD;
      diagnosed and treated very early in life to prevent serious developmental problems. However,&#xD;
      these and other forms of copper deficiency are not very well understood, and further research&#xD;
      is needed to determine whether certain treatments are useful in treating copper deficiency.&#xD;
      One such treatment is copper histidine, a copper replacement that can be injected directly&#xD;
      into the body to avoid absorption through the gastrointestinal tract. This study will&#xD;
      investigate the effectiveness, side effects, and dosage of copper histidine treatment for&#xD;
      patients with copper deficiency. It will also collect medical history information from&#xD;
      patients to allow researchers to study possible genetic and nongenetic origins of copper&#xD;
      deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 100 subjects, all of whom will be children and adults who have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with Menkes disease, occipital horn syndrome, or other unexplained copper&#xD;
      deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a prescribed dose of copper histidine, which will be administered daily&#xD;
      as an injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, patients will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center on an outpatient basis&#xD;
      to evaluate their response to the copper histidine treatment. These evaluations will take&#xD;
      place every 8 months, with a final evaluation performed after 3 years of treatment. During&#xD;
      the outpatient visits, patients will be required to give blood and urine samples for testing&#xD;
      and undergo ultrasound testing. They will also undergo brain MRI scans at the initial visit&#xD;
      and at the 16-month and 36-month visits. Patients who agree will give additional blood&#xD;
      samples for genetic research purposes.&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to allow currently enrolled participants to complete their&#xD;
      three-year course of subcutaneous Copper Histidinate treatment under the protocol. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that subcutaneous injections of this drug will raise serum copper levels and&#xD;
      ceruloplasmin levels in enrolled participants, improve neurodevelopmental and neurological&#xD;
      outcomes, and reduce mortality compared to untreated affected subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Primary Objective: Evaluate responses to Copper Histidinate treatment for clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Completion of three years treatment by 13 remaining subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 13 remaining subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase: Clinical Care/Treatment only&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: The study will occur at the NIH&#xD;
      Clinical Center&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Study Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study intervention is administration of Copper Histidinate in dose(s) prescribed as&#xD;
      follows: 250 microgram sc b.i.d. in infants up to 12 months of age, and 250 microgram sc q.d.&#xD;
      for infants and children older than 12 months. The total duration of copper histidinate&#xD;
      treatment will not exceed three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated time from when the study opens to enrollment until completion is approximately&#xD;
      151 months (02/27/2009-09/30/2021). (May end sooner pending FDA new drug approval.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time it will take for each individual participant to complete all participant visits is&#xD;
      approximately 36 months. There are 13 subjects with a total of 31 visits to complete.&#xD;

&#xD;
        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent form by parent or legal guardian, or&#xD;
             the subject himself/herself.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female, aged 0 to 80 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosed with classic Menkes disease, Occipital Horn Syndrome (OHS), or unexplained&#xD;
             copper deficiency.&#xD;

          4. Serum copper level results between 0 and 75 mg/dl (normal range 80-180 microgram/dl).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ability to adhere to the prescribed subcutaneous Copper Histidinate injection regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willingness to comply with all study visits and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation&#xD;
        in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pre-existing liver (e.g., hepatitis, biliary atresia, cirrhosis) or kidney disease&#xD;
             (e.g., serum creatinine &gt;1.0 mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of bleeding diatheses&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pregnancy or lactation&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Diagnosis of Wilson disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any disease or condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, has a high&#xD;
             probability of precluding the patient from completing the study or where the patient&#xD;
             cannot or will not appropriately comply with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participation in any other investigational trial in which receipt of investigational&#xD;
             drug or device occurred within 30 days prior to screening for this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of diagnosed drug or alcohol dependence within the previous 3 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any disease process that may adversely affect gastrointestinal absorption, e.g. celiac&#xD;
             sprue&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Chronic/severe cardiac disease (applies to adult subjects only) that could make&#xD;
             participating in a clinical trial physically demanding, including but not limited to&#xD;
             cardiac insufficiency, arrhythmias, bradycardia, or hypotension, unless associated&#xD;
             with other features of dysautonomia, as in OHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of cerebrovascular accident (applies to adult subjects only) that could make&#xD;
             participating in a clinical trial difficult for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adults who are, or who may be, unable to consent will not be allowed to participate in this&#xD;
        study. This is because we did not encounter subjects in this category for whom enrollment&#xD;
        would be necessary or appropriate in our previous studies (90-CH-0149, 90-N-0149) with this&#xD;
        IND. The main populations to be recruited are 1) pediatric subjects under 18 years of age&#xD;
        with inherited copper transport disorders, and 2) non-cognitively-impaired adults with&#xD;
        unexplained copper deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NIH employees are eligible to participate in this protocol if they meet the Inclusion&#xD;
        criteria and have no exclusion criteria. Recruitment, enrollment and compensation of NIH&#xD;
        employee subjects will be consistent with the Guidelines for the Inclusion of Employees in&#xD;
        NIH Intramural Research Studies (December 2015) and NIH Policy Manual Chapter 2300-630-3,&#xD;
        &quot;Leave Policy for NIH Employees Participating in NIH Medical Research Studies&quot;. The&#xD;
        consenting research team member will make the NIH Information Sheet on Employee Research&#xD;
        Participation available to staff members who are considering enrolling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If the individual requesting to participate in the protocol is a co-worker, the consent&#xD;
        from the NIH staff member (co-worker) will not be obtained by the staff member s direct&#xD;
        supervisor but by another research staff member approved for obtaining informed consent who&#xD;
        is not a co-worker.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Neither participation nor refusal to participate as a subject in this protocol will have an&#xD;
        effect, either beneficial or adverse, on the participant s employment or position at NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Employee subjects' privacy and confidentiality will be respected by protocol and consenting&#xD;
        staff the same as for all subjects participating in research protocols. However, all&#xD;
        subjects will be made aware that there are limits to these protections.&#xD;
