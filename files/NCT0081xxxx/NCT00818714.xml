      This protocol is designed to use stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to deliver a&#xD;
      boost dose to residual primary tumor after definitive doses of standard external beam&#xD;
      radiation have been delivered concurrently with chemotherapy. It is designed to determine the&#xD;
      toxicity profile(side effects) in the context of dose escalation of stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiation therapy (SBRT) after definitive therapy with concurrent chemoradiation and to&#xD;
      define the maximum tolerated dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum levels of TGF-Beta1 have been demonstrated to correlate with the incidence of the&#xD;
      radiation toxicity, pneumonitis in patients treated with standard external beam radiation.&#xD;
      This study will serially follow TGF-Beta1 levels in patients to see if the same correlation&#xD;
      exists with SBRT toxicity.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histological confirmation of non-small cell lung cancer will be required by either&#xD;
             biopsy or cytology. The following primary cancer types are eligible: squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma, or&#xD;
             non-small cell carcinoma not otherwise specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Eligible patients must have appropriate staging studies identifying them as specific&#xD;
             subsets of AJCC stage III based on only one of the following combinations of TNM&#xD;
             staging:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  T1N2-3M0&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  T2N2-3M0&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  T3N1-3M0&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with T4 tumors (by any definition) are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have completed treatment with concurrent chemotherapy and external beam&#xD;
             radiation therapy to radiation doses &gt;59.4Gy but &lt;70.2Gy to the primary tumor and&#xD;
             doses &gt;45Gy but &lt;70.2Gy to mediastinal structures within 6 to 9 weeks of the first&#xD;
             SBRT &quot;Boost&quot; treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have had repeat staging performed after their chemoradiation and within&#xD;
             28 days of their first protocol treatment including: CT scan of chest and upper&#xD;
             abdomen, FDG-18 PET scan and MRI of the brain. These studies must demonstrate no&#xD;
             disease outside of the thorax.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The primary tumor must be deemed technically resectable after chemoradiation by an&#xD;
             experienced thoracic cancer clinician, with a reasonable possibility of obtaining a&#xD;
             gross total resection with negative margins (defined as a potentially curative&#xD;
             resection, PCR). However, the patient must not be a candidate for PCR based on&#xD;
             pathologic evidence of persistent mediastinal lymphadenopathy after chemoradiation or&#xD;
             because of underlying physiological medical problems that would prohibit a PCR due to&#xD;
             a low probability of tolerating general anesthesia, the operation, the postoperative&#xD;
             recovery period, or the removal of adjacent functioning lung. These types of patients&#xD;
             with severe underlying health problems are deemed &quot;medically inoperable.&quot; Standard&#xD;
             justification for deeming a patient medically inoperable based on pulmonary function&#xD;
             for surgical resection of NSCLC may include any of the following: Baseline FEV1 &lt; 40%&#xD;
             predicted, post-operative predicted FEV1 &lt; 30% predicted, severely reduced diffusion&#xD;
             capacity, baseline hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia, exercise oxygen consumption &lt; 50%&#xD;
             predicted, severe pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus with severe end organ&#xD;
             damage, severe cerebral, cardiac, or peripheral vascular disease, or severe chronic&#xD;
             heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must be â‰¥ 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The patient's Zubrod performance status must be Zubrod 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Women of childbearing potential and male participants must use an effective&#xD;
             contraceptive method such as condom/diaphragm and spermicidal foam, intrauterine&#xD;
             device (IUD), or prescription birth control pills.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Pretreatment Evaluations Required for Eligibility include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A medical history, physical examination, weight, assessment of Zubrod performance&#xD;
                  status within 2 weeks prior to study entry.&#xD;

                  lungs, the mediastinum, liver, and adrenal glands; Primary tumor dimension will&#xD;
                  be measured on CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Whole body positron emission tomography (PET) scan using FDG with adequate&#xD;
                  visualization of the primary tumor and draining lymph node basins in the hilar&#xD;
