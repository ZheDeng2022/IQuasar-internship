      Introduction: Gastric cancer is the world's second largest cause of cancer related deaths. In&#xD;
      the Western world, as well as in Israel, this malignancy is less prevalent than colorectal&#xD;
      cancer, but has higher morbidity and mortality. First degree relatives of patients with&#xD;
      gastric cancer have a 1.5-fold to 3-fold increased risk of developing gastric cancer&#xD;
      themselves. In relatives of gastric cancer patients who are also carriers of a CagA positive&#xD;
      strain of Helicobacter pylori, the risk is 8-fold. Mucosal atrophy, hypochlorhydria, high&#xD;
      lymphoid follicle density, pan gastritis, and interleukin 1 β polymorphism are frequent in&#xD;
      family members of gastric cancer patients and are associated with increased risk of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To characterize the high risk individual for gastric cancer development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To establish a screening plan for early detection and prevention of gastric cancer in&#xD;
           first degree relatives of gastric cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To validate new procedures for assessing risk factors for development of gastric cancer:&#xD;
           gastric acid output, gastric mucin output, serum levels of pepsinogen I, pepsinogen II,&#xD;
           gastrin B12, Helicobacter pylori status [serology, histology, urease test, 13C-urea&#xD;
           breath test (13C-UBT)].&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess genetic changes in the gastric mucosa of the screenees in comparison with&#xD;
           gastric cancer patients and controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will approach 50 gastric cancer patients treated in Rabin Medical Center, and ask for&#xD;
      their consent to approach first degree relatives for participating in the study. For each&#xD;
      gastric cancer patient 4 relatives will be asked to signed an informed consent and undergo&#xD;
      the study procedures. For each participant a matched control for age, sex and background&#xD;
      diseases, out of consecutive gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients undergoing&#xD;
      gastroscopy, will be asked to join the study. Thus, we will screen 50 gastric cancer&#xD;
      patients, 200 first degree relatives of gastric cancer patients, and 200 controls.&#xD;

      High Risk Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      First degree relatives of patients with gastric cancer have a 1.5-fold to 3-fold increased&#xD;
      risk of developing gastric cancer themselves (Brenner H et al, Cancer 2000;88:274-9). In&#xD;
      relatives of gastric cancer patients who are also carriers of a CagA positive strain of H.&#xD;
      pylori, the risk is 8-fold. Mucosal atrophy, hypochlorhydria, high lymphoid follicle density,&#xD;
      pangastritis, and interleukin 1 β polymorphism are frequent in family members of gastric&#xD;
      cancer patients and are associated with increased risk of the disease (El-Omar EM et al,&#xD;
      Gastroenterology 2000;118:22-30, Sepulveda A et al, Am J Gastroenterol 2002;97:1365-70).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Helicobacter Pylori - Carcinogen Number I&#xD;
&#xD;
      Helicobacter pylori is the main known carcinogen. The positive correlation between H. pylori&#xD;
      infection and development of gastric cancer is well established and proved in prospective,&#xD;
      controlled, studies, in Japan (Uemura N et al, N Engl J Med 2001;345:784-9, Fukase K et al,&#xD;
      JAMA 2008;372:392-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic changes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific changes (mutation in oncogens, LOH of tumor suppressor genes, deletion or&#xD;
      insertion), different for intestinal or diffuse type gastric cancer, were described. Most of&#xD;
      these pre-malignant changes happened on a background of long lasting chronic inflammation,&#xD;
      following the cascade of atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and dysplasia. Genetic syndromes are&#xD;
      rare and families clustering of gastric cancer are usually attributed to common H. pylori&#xD;
      infection. A family syndrome of gastric cancer due to germ-line mutation in E-cadherin has&#xD;
      been described, and gastric cancer may be part of Lynch syndrome (HNPCC). Mutations and&#xD;
      polymorphism of IL-1b and TNFa have been described in first degree relatives of gastric&#xD;
      cancer patients, and considered predictive factors for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for Gastric Cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for gastric cancer gained popularity in Japan, where the disease is highly&#xD;
      prevalent. This approach is not cost-effective in the Western word, where gastric cancer&#xD;
      incidence is low, but still cost-effective in high-risk population: Helicobacter pylori&#xD;
      infected people, first degree relatives of gastric cancer patients, patients with autoimmune&#xD;
      atrophic gastropathy and pernicious anemia, families with HNPCC and patients who underwent&#xD;
      partial gastrectomy. Since treatment for gastric cancer is not very effective and&#xD;
      5-year-survival is low, it is recommended to screen this population with periodic gastroscopy&#xD;
      and biopsies. The finding of high grade dysplasia or early gastric cancer will enable early&#xD;
      intervention and cure. In addition H. pylori may be diagnosed in gastric biopsies (direct&#xD;
      evaluation in H&amp;E, Giemsa or Genta staining, culture, PCR or urease rapid test), mucin&#xD;
      secretion pattern may be assessed by immunohistochemistry with PAb's, MAb's or lectins, JCV&#xD;
      TAg may be demonstrated by IMH or PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mucins in the Healthy Stomach and Gastric Cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal gastric mucus expresses the mucins MUC1, MUC5AC and MUC6 (Carrato C et al,&#xD;
      Gastroenterology 1994;107:160-72). The development of gastric carcinoma is associated with&#xD;
      changes in mucin expression, namely a decrease in MUC5AC and MUC6 and aberrant de novo&#xD;
      expression of other MUCs (Ho SB et al, Cancer Res 1995;55:2681-90). Helicobacter pylori&#xD;
      infection induces a wide range of changes in the gastric mucus. There is a reversible&#xD;
      alteration of mucus glycosylation, which affects the protective function of the gastric&#xD;
      mucins (Ota H et al, Virchows Arch 1998;433:419-26).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for the High-Risk Phenotype&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to gastroscopy and histology, which are the gold standards for screening and&#xD;
      prevention of gastric cancer, several other approaches, some of them are non-invasive, were&#xD;
      suggested. Acid hyposecretion can be measured directly or indirectly, mucin output can be&#xD;
      measured in gastric secretion collected by a naso-gastric tube and mucin species identified&#xD;
      by dot-blot for gastric mucins (MUC5AC, MUC6 and MUC1), H. pylori status can be defined with&#xD;
      13C-UBT, serology or stool antigen test, pepsinogen I, pepsinogen II, gastrin and B12 can be&#xD;
      measured in the serum. The combination of the procedures mentioned above may contribute to an&#xD;
      accurate characterization of the high-risk individual, suitable for invasive procedure such&#xD;
      as gastroscopy with biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To characterize the high risk individual for gastric cancer development&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To establish a screening plan for early detection and prevention of gastric cancer in&#xD;
           first degree relatives of gastric cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To validate new procedures for assessing risk factors for development of gastric cancer:&#xD;
           gastric acid output, gastric mucin output, serum levels of pepsinogen I, pepsinogen II,&#xD;
           gastrin B12, H. pylori status (serology, histology, urease test, 13C-UBT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess genetic changes in the gastric mucosa of the screenees in comparison with&#xD;
           gastric cancer patients and controls&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will approach 50 gastric cancer patients treated in Rabin Medical Center, and ask for&#xD;
      their consent to approach first degree relatives for participating in the study. For each&#xD;
      gastric cancer patient 4 relatives will be asked to signed an informed consent and undergo&#xD;
      the study procedures. For each participant a matched control for age, sex and background&#xD;
      diseases, out of consecutive GERD patients undergoing gastroscopy, will be asked to join the&#xD;
      study. Thus, we will screen 200 first degree relatives of gastric cancer patients, and 200&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First relative, man or woman, of gastric cancer patients.&#xD;

        2. Signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Age 18-60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Severe back ground disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. State after gastric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. COPD, CHF, CRF and any disease with respiratory disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Deviation of the nasal septum, lack of venous access at the dorsum of the hand or any&#xD;
           other technical problem prevents gastric acid collection or base excess evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, controlled, 4 days study. All procedures followed are in accordance&#xD;
      with the ethical standards of the committee on human experimentation of the Rabin Medical&#xD;
      Center, and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. In the screening meeting the&#xD;
      participant or the control will be told about the aims and nature of the study, and will be&#xD;
      comprehensively informed about all procedures, anticipated results and risks. After agreeing&#xD;
      to participate they will sign the informed consent. A medical history, family history and&#xD;
      symptomatic questionnaire will be filled, and the participant will be scheduled for&#xD;
      gastroscopy. After a night fast gastroscopy will be performed, biopsies will be taken as&#xD;
      needed for the different protocols (see below). Then gastric acid output, mucin output and&#xD;
      alkaline tide studies will be performed. Blood will be drawn for &quot;gastro panel&quot; of BioHit,&#xD;
      routine blood tests, B12, CEA, CA19-9, and CAG A serology. In another day, 13CUBT and IFOBT&#xD;
      will be performed.&#xD;
