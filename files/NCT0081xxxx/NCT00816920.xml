  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whether isolated distal DVT (IDDVT), DVT confined to the calf, should be looked for and&#xD;
      diagnosed to allow them to be treated with anticoagulants remains one of the still unsolved&#xD;
      issues in vascular medicine, especially because of the insufficient data on clinical risks of&#xD;
      untreated distal DVT. Management studies have shown that it is safe to withhold&#xD;
      anticoagulation in outpatients with suspected DVT if compression ultrasonography (CUS)&#xD;
      limited to the proximal deep veins yields normal results on presentation and on repeated&#xD;
      examination after 5 to 7 days. This strategy is based on the premise that IDDVT do not need&#xD;
      to be diagnosed and treated, what is necessary when they extend involving the proximal veins.&#xD;
      There is no general agreement, however, on the assumption that the non-extending IDDVT do not&#xD;
      need to be diagnosed and treated, and many authors recommend to perform a single CUS&#xD;
      examination extended to the distal deep veins. All the available studies have treated with&#xD;
      anticoagulants the diagnosed IDDVT and no adequate information is available on the risk of&#xD;
      IDDVT left untreated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study, performed in outpatients with suspected leg DVT, aims at assessing the&#xD;
      clinical consequences of IDDVT diagnosed (by a complete US investigation) but not treated&#xD;
      because the results of this investigation remain blind to both the patient and the treating&#xD;
      doctor, whereas the diagnostic-therapeutic procedure remains the usual one, based on CUS&#xD;
      investigation limited to diagnose proximal DVT, to be repeated after 5-7 days (or earlier) to&#xD;
      exclude an extension to proximal veins of an IDDVT potentially present.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Outpatients symptomatic for suspected DVT of a leg are examined by a vascular doctor&#xD;
      according to standard procedure based on pre-test clinical probability (PTCP) assessment,&#xD;
      D-dimer assay and a CUS limited to the proximal deep veins. Those in whom a proximal DVT is&#xD;
      excluded and have intermediate/high PTCP or altered D-dimer level are eligible for the study.&#xD;
      The included patients are immediately submitted to an extensive echo-color-Doppler&#xD;
      examination of calf deep veins by a different vascular doctor and results are closed in an&#xD;
      envelope that will be open after three months (or before if necessary). In the meantime,&#xD;
      patients will follow the standard diagnostic procedure: they receive an appointment to come&#xD;
      back in 5-7 days for a further CUS examination, or even before in case of worsening of&#xD;
      symptoms/signs. All the included patients receive a telephone call after three months to&#xD;
      exclude possible complications.&#xD;

        The study is not funded. As a result, it will not be possible to enroll all consecutive&#xD;
        eligible patients; rather patients will be included based on the availability of expert&#xD;
        medical staff in the day of their presentation (in general the first patient of the day).&#xD;
