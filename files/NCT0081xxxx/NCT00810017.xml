  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for women and men who have previously treated metastatic (has spread to other&#xD;
      parts in the body), Her2- positive breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to find out&#xD;
      what effects (good and bad) the FDA-approved drugs etoposide and trastuzumab have on this&#xD;
      type of breast cancer and to determine if these drugs are safe to use together. This research&#xD;
      is being done to find more effective treatment for this type of condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, trastuzumab and etoposide will be given by intravenous infusion (IV; through a&#xD;
      vein) on the first 3 days of every 3-week cycle. This is repeated for 6 cycles. After 6&#xD;
      cycles, only trastuzumab will be given until worsening of disease. In this study, a small&#xD;
      amount of your tissue that was collected when you had surgery will be evaluated in the lab to&#xD;
      look at genetic differences among people and how those differences may affect a response to a&#xD;
      specific drug or medicine. This testing will look for a gene called Top2A. Previous studies&#xD;
      suggest that people who have both the Top2A and Her2 genes respond to certain chemotherapies&#xD;
      (anti-cancer drugs) differently from those who only have the Her2 gene.&#xD;
