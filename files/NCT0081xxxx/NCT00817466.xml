  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiolitis is a common lower respiratory disease typically affecting infants and children&#xD;
      generally younger than 2 years of age. The disease leads to hospital admissions, is a major&#xD;
      cause for hospitalisation of young children and infants during winter epidemics, may be&#xD;
      severe sometimes requiring ventilatory support and rarely death. The clinical disease as&#xD;
      described by Court is characterised by nasal flaring, tachypnoea, dyspnoea, chest recessions,&#xD;
      crepitations and sometimes sibiliations. Respiratory Syncytial virus is the most common&#xD;
      cause, but also other respiratory vira may cause the disease. Bronchiolitis is a well known&#xD;
      risk factor of asthma development in childhood1,2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management is generally supportive, whereas symptom reducing therapy is debated with no&#xD;
      international consensus. Furthermore, there are many unresolved questions related to the&#xD;
      prognosis of bronchiolitis, its role in development of chronic lung disease in particular&#xD;
      regarding the association between early bronchiolitis and asthma development. The present&#xD;
      project will particularly focus on: 1)Treatment efficacy related to various outcomes during&#xD;
      active disease, 2) retrospectively assess treatment efficacy in relation to later development&#xD;
      of allergic disease, 3) assess the role between different vira and asthma prognosis as well&#xD;
      as 4) identify possible prognostic factors involved in the progression from bronchiolitis to&#xD;
      further airways disease.&#xD;

      OVERALL AIMS OF THE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the efficacy of two common treatments by determining whether inhalation&#xD;
           treatment with racemic adrenaline is more effective than saline inhalations in acute&#xD;
           bronchiolitis in children younger than 12 months throughout an hospital admission, as&#xD;
           well as to define the optimal inhalation treatment intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify clinical and virological risk factors for development of persisting&#xD;
           obstructive airways disease after an initial bronchiolitis, and to assess if specific&#xD;
           vira or subsequent asthma development influences the efficacy of bronchiolitis&#xD;
           management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess whether hospital admissions for bronchiolitis has increased in parallel with&#xD;
           the increase in childhood asthma seen in the last 10-15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS AND STUDY PROGRESSION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicenter study will be performed after initial appropriate common training by all&#xD;
      participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment study: The study will follow the standard operating procedure of Good Clinical&#xD;
           Practice, including a clinical monitor from Oslo University Hospital, Ullevål who will&#xD;
           provide study quality assurance in all centers. Two main groups randomised into RA vs&#xD;
           saline, each divided into two arms of the active drug/NaCl groups: fixed or on demand&#xD;
           inhalations. The trial will be double blinded by the pharmacy. One glass with sufficient&#xD;
           medication for the entire hospital stay will be designated per patient throughout. No&#xD;
           cross-over. Outcomes will be analysed by intention to treat, with treatment given and&#xD;
           recorded throughout the hospital admission. No interim analyses are planned since the&#xD;
           study compares two established treatment modalities used for the last decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion into the treatment study provides the basis for the follow-up (prognosis) part&#xD;
           of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prognosis: 18 months follow-up study (clinical assessment) of all subjects in the&#xD;
           treatment study.The prognosis study will also retrospectively answer whether treatment&#xD;
           efficacy depend upon later allergic disease development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Epidemiology: a retrospective chart study for hospital admissions for bronchiolitis&#xD;
           within populations referred to the collaborating centres in HSØ from 1995-2009&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Treatment: Randomisation: block randomisation. Randomization will be performed by computer&#xD;
      programs by the ORAACLE statistician, and provided to the Pharmacy preparing and labeling the&#xD;
      vials for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Nebulised racemic adrenaline vs saline throughout the hospital stay. Inhalations&#xD;
      given on demand (parents/nurse) vs fixed x 4--12. Open saline inhalations may be given at any&#xD;
      time, other inhalations is not allowed. Neither is systemic corticosteroids (which is not a&#xD;
      proper treatment for acute bronchiolitis, according to Norwegian guidelines). All other&#xD;
      treatment will be given according to usual local practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study end-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment study: Completion of the study at discharge + possible re-admission according&#xD;
           to protocol. Need for intensive care management or assisted ventilation (continuous&#xD;
           CPAP-Ventilator) in which conventional management will be given. Treatment failure when&#xD;
           the child is assessed severely ill and in need of open label treatment. These data will&#xD;
           be recorded and analysed to see if there is a difference between the two treatment&#xD;
           groups. We expect a small number of drop-outs, which should not make it necessary to&#xD;
           expand the study above our goal of 500 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prognosis study: Number of children with recurrent bronchial obstruction (wheeze),&#xD;
           secondary: asthma diagnosis, the &quot;Oslo severity score&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hospital admissions first time, secondary: re-admissions or multiple admissions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical scores will be assessed before and 30 minutes after inhalation the first time, and&#xD;
      subsequently once a day during ordinary doctor visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Global clinical assessment completed by nurses and parents will be done every morning and&#xD;
      evening until discharge. Time at start, end and hours with naso-gastric tube feeding as well&#xD;
      need for supplementary oxygen will be recorded daily and complications and adverse event will&#xD;
      be recorded as they appear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasopharynx aspiration is done at inclusion and is analysed by local routine, usually within&#xD;
      24 hours (except Sundays). Half of the aspirate will be frozen for batch PCR analyses at the&#xD;
      virological laboratory (Oslo University Hospital) after all patients are enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests are sampled at inclusion. General analyses (see table 6) and sample to biobank&#xD;
      for epigenetic analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva are sampled at inclusion and the following morning. Deemed fit for discharge will be&#xD;
      decided by the attending physician. Minimum requirement is clinical score 3 or less at least&#xD;
      2 hours after last inhalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine tests are sampled at inclusion. Will be analysed at leukotrienes and arachidonic acid&#xD;
      metabolites (eoxines) and other relevant inflammatory and infection markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes measured upon inclusion, after first inhalation (clinical score) as well as&#xD;
      throughout the hospital stay according to flow-chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome: No of hours before deemed fit for discharge from hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for feeding support (no. of hours) Need for supplementary oxygen. Clinical score&#xD;
      throughout admission Complications (presence of and time to confirmed) such as atelectasis&#xD;
      Global assessments (parents and nurses) Need for ICU treatment Data from each hospital will&#xD;
      in addition to collated data analysis be assessed independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Illness caused by different vira will be compared in regard to treatment efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. Prognosis: This follow-up-study will be performed in collaboration between the principal&#xD;
      investigator and the collaborating physicians at the local paediatric departments. The&#xD;
      clinical follow-up visit includes a structured parental interview, application of the &quot;Oslo&#xD;
      severity score&quot;20 for obstructive airways disease, assessment of atopic eczema and rhinitis,&#xD;
      skin prick test as well as blood sampling for analyses including IgE and DNA for epigenetic&#xD;
      studies (see table 4) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. Epidemiology: Retrospective study of all children 0-18 months admitted to hospital with&#xD;
      the diagnosis of bronchiolitis. The study will mainly be a hospital registry study, but with&#xD;
      20% random chart scrutiny to ensure appropriateness of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ammendment: Two further substudies were included;&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) Quality of life after bronchiolitis b) A population-based control group of 241 children&#xD;
      from Oslo and Fredrikstad were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Description Quality of Life:&#xD;
&#xD;
           ITQOL was sent to all children included in the RCT cohort, as well as the control group&#xD;
           (see below) 6-9 months after enrollement in the study, as well as prior to the 18-month&#xD;
           follow-up study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Main objective: To assess if quality of life after acute bronchiolitis in infancy is&#xD;
           associated with development of persisting obstructive airways disease or allergic&#xD;
           disease in early childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific aim 1: What is the quality of life in infants and parents 6 and 18 months after&#xD;
           hospital admission for acute bronchiolitis? Specific aim 2: Is quality of life in&#xD;
           infants and their parents 6 and 18 months after hospital admission for acute&#xD;
           bronchiolitis related to recurrent or persisting obstructive airways symptoms? Specific&#xD;
           aim 3: Is a possible association between quality of life and persistent obstructive&#xD;
           airways disease modified by allergic sensitisation, gender or type of virus infection&#xD;
           during the bronciolitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Description Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since we established the &quot;Bronchiolitis&quot; cohort of children admitted to hospital for acute&#xD;
      bronchiolitis, the prognostic perspective of this three-phase study has gained increasing&#xD;
      focus. This relates in particular to immunological influence of different viral agents during&#xD;
      the acute disease, as well as Quality of Life and the role of early &quot;stress&quot; in relation to&#xD;
      development of allergic diseases in children with as well as without acute bronchiolitis in&#xD;
      early life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims are to assess physiological, immunological, environmental and &quot;stress&quot; (including&#xD;
      psychosocial) factors in the development of allergic diseases, including asthma, atopic&#xD;
      eczema, allergic rhinitis and allergies in children who have been hospital admitted due to&#xD;
      acute bronchiolitis in infancy as well as children of the same age who have not been admitted&#xD;
      for bronchiolitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control children will be consecutively included at 2 Well-baby clinics in Fredrikstad and&#xD;
      Oslo, respectively, total number 150 (100 + 150, respectively) ensuring similar variability&#xD;
      of demographic data (age and ethnic background) as the enrolled bronchiolitis children.&#xD;
      Inclusion will be assessed mid-way for adequate demographic variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: children 1- 11 months (inclusive) of age presenting to the Well-Baby&#xD;
      Clinics, Exclusion criteria: Significant cardiac, previous severe respiratory disease,&#xD;
      neurologic, immunologic, oncologic or other disease that may significantly influence the&#xD;
      outcomes, including Down's syndrome.&#xD;
