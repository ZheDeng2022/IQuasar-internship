    <textblock>
      Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) is a FDA approved mode of mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
      This mode of ventilation is currently in routine use in adult, pediatric and neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care units. The electrical activity of the diaphragm, the largest muscle used&#xD;
      during respiration, is measured. The ventilator applies support in proportion to the measured&#xD;
      electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi). This electrical activity is measured through a&#xD;
      feeding tube that also has a multiple-array esophageal electrode in it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whenever a patient gets extubated in our MSICU, we conduct a routine extubation readiness&#xD;
      test. This is standard of care in our ICU. If the patient fails this test, the patient stays&#xD;
      on the ventilator. If he passes, he gets extubated. We wish to conduct a study during which&#xD;
      we will monitor the electrical activity of the diaphragm during this test. If the patient&#xD;
      passes the extubation readiness test, the study is complete. If he fails, he resumes on the&#xD;
      ventilator. In our study, we would then use the measured signal of the diaphragm to guide the&#xD;
      ventilator. This mode of ventilation is called NAVA. We do not currently use this mode of&#xD;
      ventilation in the ICU, but could do so since it is FDA approved. However, we wish to use&#xD;
      this protocol to gain more expertise with this mode of ventilation in the ICU in a controlled&#xD;
      fashion. We wish to enroll 20 pediatric patients. Patients in the ICU are routinely on a&#xD;
      variety of different models of ventilators. Usually, the respiratory therapist determines&#xD;
      which ventilator will be used. All patients in this study would be on the Servo-I ventilator,&#xD;
      which is an FDA approved ventilator and capable of monitoring electrical activity of the&#xD;
      diaphragm and currently used in our MSICU.&#xD;

      1. Specific Aims /Objectives Specific Aim 1: To determine if Edi is a predictor of&#xD;
           extubation readiness. (Hypothesis: an increase of 20-50% in Edi from baseline (prior to&#xD;
           ERT) will predict successful extubation.) Specific Aim 2: If the patient fails the ERT -&#xD;
           We hope to determine if NAVA will provide more information about why the patient failed&#xD;
           the ERT. (Hypothesis: a decrease in peak inspiratory pressure from baseline (post ERT&#xD;
           failure) is predictive of high frequency diaphragm fatigue and subsequent successful&#xD;
           ERT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background and Significance The diaphragmatic function plays a pivotal role in the&#xD;
           patient's ability to breathe on a ventilator, and on the successfulness of weaning from&#xD;
           a ventilator and extubation. However, diaphragmatic function is not routinely measured&#xD;
           in the ICU, which we would like to do in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           When the mechanical load of the respiratory system is too large or continues for a long&#xD;
           period of time, the diaphragm can develop contractile fatigue[1]. This fatigue can be&#xD;
           short or long term. Short term is also known as high-frequency fatigue that results from&#xD;
           the accumulation of inorganic phosphate[2][3], and to a lesser extent intramuscular&#xD;
           acidosis[4]. On the other hand long term fatigue, otherwise known as low-frequency&#xD;
           fatigue is consistent with muscle injury[5, 6] and can persist for days. Being able to&#xD;
           identify what type of diaphragm fatigue is present could help us understand the&#xD;
           patient's readiness to be extubated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Despite the frequent use of mechanical ventilation, determining when to appropriately&#xD;
           discontinue mechanical ventilation and extubate a patient remains a challenge. Many&#xD;
           weaning protocols exist but are typically extrapolated from adult studies. These&#xD;
           protocols can consist of but are not limited to use sprint weaning utilizing a T-piece&#xD;
           (no support, just oxygen), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or pressure&#xD;
           support (PSV) trail. Usually, data is gathered through spirometry with a ventilator&#xD;
           (shallow breathing index, tidal volumes, etc.) and vital signs are recorded [7, 8].&#xD;
           Despite the use of protocols extubation failure range from 15-24% (Randolph) in the&#xD;
           pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Investigators have explored physiological evidence of improving lung function to help&#xD;
           determine the appropriate time to discontinue mechanical ventilation. One notable effort&#xD;
           by Hubble et al was to obtain dead space to tidal volume ratio (Vd/Vt) to determine&#xD;
           extubation success after a 30 minute PSV trail prior to extubation[9]. They concluded&#xD;
           that a Vd/Vt ratio of less than or equal to 0.5 reliably predicted successful extubation&#xD;
           (96%). However, this only provides one part of the equation - lung function- but not&#xD;
           necessarily the central nervous system interaction or the work of breathing associated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Currently, the MSICU uses an extubation readiness test (ERT). This test determines if&#xD;
           patients are eligible for discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. This test consist&#xD;
           of a daily screen of changing the FIO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) to 50% (left at&#xD;
           current setting if lower than 50%) and decrease the PEEP to 5 cmH2O. Patients unable to&#xD;
           maintain saturation (SpO2) of 95%, or become tachypneic, or appear uncomfortable failed&#xD;
           the test; those who maintained SpO2 of 95% or higher have their mode of ventilation&#xD;
           changed to minimal pressure support (PSV). Minimal PSV was determined by the&#xD;
           endotracheal tube (ETT) size. Patients were classified as failing the test if at any&#xD;
           time in the two hour period their SpO2 was less than 95%, their exhaled tidal volume was&#xD;
           less than 5 mL/kg ideal body weight, or their respiratory rate was outside of the&#xD;
           acceptable range for age. If the patient fails an ERT they are returned to their&#xD;
           previous ventilator setting and evaluated for extubation readiness in 24 hours. It is&#xD;
           understood that sedation is one of the primary caused of extubation failure, however&#xD;
           there is additional concern regarding the diaphragmatic function. When the mechanical&#xD;
           load of the respiratory system is too large or continues for a long period of time, the&#xD;
           diaphragm can develop contractile fatigue[4]. This fatigue can be short or long term.&#xD;
           Short term is also known as high-frequency fatigue that results from the accumulation of&#xD;
           inorganic phosphate[5], failure of the membrane electrical potential[6], and to a lesser&#xD;
           extent intramuscular acidosis[7], but recover quickly. On the other hand long term&#xD;
           fatigue, otherwise known as low-frequency fatigue is consistent with muscle injury [8,&#xD;
           9] and can persist for days. Being able to identify what type of diaphragm fatigue could&#xD;
           lead us to hold on extubation readiness testing as to not re-injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
           When patients are extubated too early, respiratory failure can occur [10, 11]. When&#xD;
           extubation is delayed, lengths of time on mechanical ventilation and in the ICU stay&#xD;
           both increases. This leads to additional respiratory complications such as ventilator&#xD;
           associated pneumonia and overall lung damage[12]. Thus, the decision to extubate should&#xD;
           be made on the basis of accurate, objective and reproducible criteria. The diaphragmatic&#xD;
           activity is likely one of those criteria that are not yet measured. We aim to add some&#xD;
           additional information to this body of knowledge that may link the respiratory pump&#xD;
           (diaphragm) to lung function, muscle fatigue, and/or central nervous system depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Preliminary Studies/Progress Report To our knowledge there is not previous data&#xD;
           determining if Edi can predict extubation success. However, there are a few limited&#xD;
           studies on low and high-frequency diaphragm fatigue in adults and animals. Dr. Laghi and&#xD;
           colleagues carefully examined 11 who failed extubation and eight adults whom&#xD;
           successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation. They concluded that weaning itself did&#xD;
           not cause low-frequency fatigue [13]. While Edi was examined in six health adults at&#xD;
           high frequency fatigue levels. Edi was found to successfully assess neural drive and&#xD;
           that diaphragm fatigue did not affect respiratory drive.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Limits to the studies mentioned above that we plan to address are: none were done in&#xD;
           children with highly resistive endotracheal tubes, length of mechanical ventilation was&#xD;
           not examined (low vs. high frequency diaphragm fatigue risk), there was no formal ERT,&#xD;
           and examination of low and high frequency diaphragm fatigue in the same patient&#xD;
           population was not done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Design and Methods a. Study Design In a prospective, blinded (Edi information blinded to&#xD;
           the team) clinical trail we will study the diaphragmatic activity that occur prior and&#xD;
           following our standard extubation readiness test (minimum pressure support trial). We&#xD;
           will examine that diaphragmatic activity by examining the Edi prior to, during, and post&#xD;
           the trial on every patient who qualifies. Furthermore, patients who fail ERT will be&#xD;
           ventilated with the NAVA mode of ventilation. The entire protocol will be conducted on&#xD;
           the Maquet Servo I ventilator&#xD;
