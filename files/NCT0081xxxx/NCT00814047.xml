  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood flow autoregulation is defined as the ability of a tissue to maintain a relatively&#xD;
      constant flow, despite moderate alterations in perfusion pressure. Similar to the cerebral,&#xD;
      renal, coronary and skeletal muscle circulations, the ocular vascular bed shows the property&#xD;
      of flow autoregulation. This homeostatic mechanism allows blood supply to the eye to match&#xD;
      metabolic demand during daily activities, such as changes in posture, or in more critical&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autoregulation has been found to be a complex phenomenon, showing heterogeneity in its site&#xD;
      and time course of action. Since metabolic, myogenic, neurogenic and possibly&#xD;
      endothelium-related mechanisms may be involved, several factors may vary depending on the&#xD;
      challenging stimulus, the vessel tone, or the degree of impairment of autoregulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the dynamics of ocular autoregulation, it is necessary to introduce a step&#xD;
      disturbance (stimulus) in ocular perfusion pressure and to record the responses of ocular&#xD;
      blood flow continuously before and after this step disturbance. The investigators have&#xD;
      employed a mechanical noninvasive technique to induce an ocular perfusion pressure step&#xD;
      disturbance without drugs or changes in the concentration of vasoactive substances in the&#xD;
      blood by using the thigh cuff technique inducing a small step decrease in ocular perfusion&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this technique the investigators could show significant differences in the time response&#xD;
      of blood velocities in the ophthalmic and middle cerebral artery. This clearly indicates&#xD;
      different mechanisms to be responsible for autoregulatory mechanisms distal to the vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly our results indicate that in the ophthalmic artery a late vasoconstriction&#xD;
      occurs. Many previous investigations have demonstrated that sympathetic nerve stimulation&#xD;
      causes vasoconstriction in the ocular circulation. Accordingly, the present study tests the&#xD;
      hypothesis that α2-adrenoceptors are involved in the dynamic regulation of blood flow in the&#xD;
      ophthalmic and middle cerebral artery after a step decrease in perfusion pressure.&#xD;
