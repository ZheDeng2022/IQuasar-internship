      The primary endpoint of the study will be to compare the accuracy of two procedures (FICE&#xD;
      with target biopsies only, versus conventional white light colonoscopy with recommended&#xD;
      targeted and random biopsies) in the endoscopic surveillance of patient with long-standing&#xD;
      UC. Accuracy will be measured based on the number of patients with confirmed neoplasia using&#xD;
      each technique. The combined histological outcome following the two procedures will represent&#xD;
      the gold-standard diagnosis for each patient. Secondary outcomes will be the number of&#xD;
      patients with false-positive findings, the number of neoplastic lesions detected, the number&#xD;
      of false-positive lesions per patient for each technique and the total time required for each&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

      Patients will undergo two colonoscopies each, with an interval of three months between&#xD;
      procedures. This minimum time interval is chosen in order to allow for the healing of the&#xD;
      mucosa on sampled areas and thus prevent recognition of biopsy sites. The first procedure&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated to be either conventional white light endoscopy coupled with&#xD;
      targeted and random biopsies or high-resolution endoscopy with FICE system and magnification.&#xD;
      Randomisation will be achieved prior to the first endoscopy by means of sealed envelopes. In&#xD;
      each recruitment centre, one of the two endoscopists with experience in endoscopic&#xD;
      surveillance and treatment of ulcerative colitis will be assigned to carry out the first&#xD;
      procedure. The second procedure will automatically be scheduled with the second endoscopist,&#xD;
      who will be blinded as to the clinical and histological findings of the first investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two participating centres are already endowed with identical endoscopic equipment. All&#xD;
      examinations will be performed using the same high resolution endoscope (EC-590 ZW, Fujinon&#xD;
      Inc., Daitama, Japan). The zoom function on the device will only be used during the FICE&#xD;
      procedures. The system is equipped with the EPX 4400 processor (Fujinon Inc., Japan) that&#xD;
      enables the CVC technology. This digital processing system can switch between conventional&#xD;
      imaging and CVC imaging at any time during the procedure by means of a simple pushbutton on&#xD;
      the endoscope. The system has up to ten (# 10) settings designed to select the most suitable&#xD;
      wavelengths. In this study the CVC procedure will be performed using setting number three (#&#xD;
      3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The colonoscopy protocol will be the same in both participating centres. All patients will&#xD;
      undergo a bowel preparation consisting in the intake of four litres of hypertonic&#xD;
      polyethylene glycol solution. The procedures will be performed under conscious sedation using&#xD;
      propofol. The caecum will be reached in white light endoscopy in all cases. Cecal intubation&#xD;
      will be confirmed by identification of the ileocecal valve and appendiceal orifice. Upon&#xD;
      extubation, 20 mg of butyl scopolamine will be given intravenously, barring any&#xD;
      contraindication, to reduce colonic motility and facilitate the examination of the colon.&#xD;
      When performing the FICE procedure, the imaging mode will be switched to CVC at the caecum&#xD;
      and will then be used throughout withdrawal. The endoscopist will classify the degree of&#xD;
      inflammation in each segment of the colon on a scale and give the Mayo Clinic score&#xD;
      (proctosigmoiditis - left-sided colitis - Pan Colitis). The quality of the bowel preparation&#xD;
      will be noted. During the extubation phase, washing of the colon and aspiration of waste will&#xD;
      be accomplished in an optimal way to maximise the detection capabilities of each procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biopsy protocol is meant to reflect observed mucosal abnormalities and, in the case of&#xD;
      conventional colonoscopy, it will be supplemented by random samples taken every 10 cm of the&#xD;
      colon. A standard biopsy forceps will be used (Radial Jaw 4, Boston Scientific Inc., USA). To&#xD;
      reduce the risk of sampling error, a minimum of two biopsies for each suspicious lesion will&#xD;
      be performed. The number of lesions suspect of neoplasia will be noted and targeted by each&#xD;
      procedure. In the case of high-resolution FICE colonoscopy, an analysis of the surface&#xD;
      pattern will be performed for each targeted lesion according to the pit pattern&#xD;
      classification. Suspicious FICE lesions will be defined as having a polyploidy, flat or&#xD;
      irregular mucosal structure with Kudo pit pattern III - V, unusual ulcers, strictures or&#xD;
      areas with increased and disrupted vascular intensity revealed by dark&#xD;
      coloration/discoloration and confirmed with magnification (annexe 9). In conventional&#xD;
      endoscopy without FICE, suspicious lesions will be defined as polypoid or irregular mucosa,&#xD;
      and unusual ulcers or strictures. During the conventional white light endoscopy (but not&#xD;
      during FICE) additional four-quadrant random biopsies will be taken every 10 cm of colon and&#xD;
      placed in a specimen container of formalin. Targeted biopsy samples will be sent separately&#xD;
      for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The histopathological evaluation will be performed twice, by two different pathologists, at&#xD;
      each participating centre. The pathologists were recruited according to their expertise in&#xD;
      digestive histology. For the purposes of this study, they will be blinded to the assessment&#xD;
      of the endoscopist when analysing biopsy samples. The inflammation activity level of each&#xD;
      specimen will be ranked into the following categories: no inflammation, mild to moderate&#xD;
      inflammation or severe inflammation. Dysplasia will be classified according to the new Vienna&#xD;
      classification 21. Lesions classified as &quot;indefinite for neoplasia&quot; with no differentiation&#xD;
      between adenoma and colitis-associated dysplasia in biopsy material will be not considered as&#xD;
      neoplastic. The final histopathology findings will then be compared with the endoscopic&#xD;
      assessment with regards to the presence of intraepithelial neoplasia and colorectal cancer.&#xD;
