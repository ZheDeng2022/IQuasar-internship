      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin and dexamethasone,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) together&#xD;
      with bortezomib may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib together with doxorubicin&#xD;
      and dexamethasone works in treating patients with multiple myeloma that has relapsed or not&#xD;
      responded to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT POPULATION: Patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma requiring therapy&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in this study. Eligible patients will be &gt;18 years old and&#xD;
      able to give fully informed consent. Patients must have a Performance Score (PS) of 0-3&#xD;
      (ECOG), measurable serum and/or urine paraprotein, or serum free light chain, bilirubin value&#xD;
      of less than one and a half times the upper limit of normal with ALT/AST values less than two&#xD;
      and a half times the upper limit of normal. Patients with non-secretory multiple myeloma are&#xD;
      excluded from this study.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the response (partial and complete response) in patients with relapsed or&#xD;
           refractory multiple myeloma receiving bortezomib, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and&#xD;
           dexamethasone (PAD) after prior treatment with a maximum of 6 courses of vincristine,&#xD;
           doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (VAD) or VAD-like regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and toxicity of PAD therapy in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the original response to VAD with the response obtained with PAD as assessed&#xD;
           by percent fall in paraprotein or Bence Jones Protein, lowest level of abnormal protein&#xD;
           achieved, and duration of response in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN &amp; METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-randomised, open labelled phase II trial in patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory multiple myeloma. Patients will be treated with: Bortezomib 1.3mg/m^2 bolus IV&#xD;
      injection days 1, 4, 8 &amp; 11 + Dexamethasone 40mg po on days 1, 2, 3, 4 + Doxorubicin&#xD;
      9mg/m^2/day IV continuous infusion over days 1 - 4. In addition, for the first cycle only,&#xD;
      Dexamethasone will also be given at 40mg po on days 8 - 11 and 15 - 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each treatment regimen will continue for a minimum of four - and up to six - cycles of 21&#xD;
      days (maximum response and 1 cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study planned to recruit a total of 69 patients in up to 8 centres in Ireland and the&#xD;
      UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled in three groups of 23 patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relapsed patients, previously treated with VAD or VAD like regimen (VAMP, C-VAMP and&#xD;
           Z-Dex are examples of VAD like therapy) and who have had autologous transplants at least&#xD;
           1 year previously. Patients may proceed directly to PAD therapy or have had a maximum of&#xD;
           one other line of therapy before PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relapsed patients, previously treated with VAD or VAD-like regimen who have not had&#xD;
           autologous transplantation and achieved at least PR (Appendix A). Patients may proceed&#xD;
           directly to PAD therapy or have had a maximum of two other lines of therapy before PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients refractory (MR, NC or PD) to VAD or VAD-like therapy. Patients should proceed&#xD;
           directly to PAD therapy. Patients with NC or PD may proceed to PAD after a minimum of&#xD;
           two cycles of VAD or VAD-like therapy or a minimum of 4 cycles, if MR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year.&#xD;
