      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of R-mabHDI in patients with&#xD;
      late stage, widespread stage and recurrent Lymphocytic Predominant Hodgkin's Lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the combination of R-mabHDI with the standard ABVD therapy in patients&#xD;
      with late stage (Stage III and Stage IV) and recurrent stage Lymphocytic Predominant&#xD;
      Hodgkin's Lymphoma will have a favorable outcome on the response and progress free survival.&#xD;
      The study is also aimed at evaluating the safety of R-mabHDI .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to test this hypothesis by evaluating the clinical outcome in 1200&#xD;
      patients receiving combination of R-mabHDI once a week for 8 weeks and ABVD therapy every&#xD;
      other week for 12 treatments.&#xD;

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of R-mabHDI in Patients with&#xD;
      late stage, widespread stage and recurrent Lymphocytic Predominant Hodgkin's Lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the combination of R-mabHDI with the standard ABVD therapy in patients&#xD;
      with late stage (Stage III and Stage IV) and recurrent stage Lymphocytic Predominant&#xD;
      Hodgkin's Lymphoma will have a favorable outcome on the response and progress free survival.&#xD;
      The study is also aimed at evaluating the safety of R-mabHDI .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 1200 subjects will be recruited to the study from various centers. Enrollment&#xD;
      period will last for up to one and half year and treatment period is for six months.&#xD;
      Treatment will be considered a failure if the tumor size and signs of LPHD does not decrease&#xD;
      after 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects having late stage HD, widespread HD or recurrent HD fulfilling the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be recruited in this study. Females who are nursing babies or are&#xD;
      pregnant will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive the drugs according to the randomization process. The eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 &quot;treatment&quot; groups after screening. No matter&#xD;
      which group the subjects are assigned to, the doses of the drugs will be the standard doses&#xD;
      that are currently used to treat lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: subjects assigned to group 1 will receive the ABVD combination intravenously for&#xD;
      about 1 hour on day 1 and 15 of every cycle (every 2 weeks). Each cycle is 4 weeks. ABVD will&#xD;
      to be given for 6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will also receive R-mabHDI intravenously, separately for about 7 hours on days&#xD;
      1,8,15 and 22 (once a week) of every cycle. Each cycle is 4 weeks. R-mabHDI will be given for&#xD;
      2 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: subjects assigned to group 2 will receive the ABVD combination intravenously for&#xD;
      about 1 hour on day 1 and 15 of every cycle (every 2 weeks). Each cycle is 4 weeks. ABVD will&#xD;
      to be given for 6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in group 2 will not receive R-mabHDI .&#xD;
