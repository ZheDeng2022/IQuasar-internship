  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies have shown that the vast majority of patients experience cancer-related&#xD;
      fatigue (CRF) during cancer treatments. Research by our group showed that 71% percent of 84&#xD;
      prostate cancer patients reported CRF during radiation. Unlike fatigue caused by&#xD;
      overexertion, CRF is a pervasive, whole-body experience that is not alleviated by rest or&#xD;
      sleep and often lingers long after completing standard treatments like radiation therapy. It&#xD;
      has a detrimental effect on patients' quality of life and can interfere with completion of&#xD;
      prescribed treatment regimens. In addition, lasting fatigue for many patients impedes the&#xD;
      resumption of normal life following treatments. Unfortunately, effective, well-accepted&#xD;
      treatments for CRF are lacking. Although some research suggests that exercise may be a&#xD;
      promising intervention for reducing CRF, physicians are still hesitant to prescribe exercise&#xD;
      for fatigued patients, and, in fact, often encourage them to rest and conserve energy, which&#xD;
      may be in exact opposition to what is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One probable peripheral physiological mechanism that may affect the influence CRF is a loss&#xD;
      of skeletal muscle mass, which, ultimately, effects weakness and strength. This muscle loss&#xD;
      can result from deconditioning effects stemming from reduced physical activity resulting from&#xD;
      cancer and its treatment. It is plausible that patients may enter radiation therapy with a&#xD;
      certain degree of muscle loss, reduced strength and substantially decreased levels of&#xD;
      physical activity as a result of their cancer diagnosis and the associated stress, surgical&#xD;
      and systemic treatments, and/or the subsequent symptomology. Additionally, their physical&#xD;
      activity may decline even further during radiation and escalate the loss of muscle and&#xD;
      decreased strength. Recently, researchers have proposed that these deconditioning responses,&#xD;
      as well as generalized inflammatory responses resulting from the cancer and/or its treatment&#xD;
      result in skeletal muscle loss and strength deficits, which may play a significant role in&#xD;
      the etiology of CRF. Although mild exercise can counteract deconditioning, current research&#xD;
      has shown that cancer patients decrease the amount of physical activity they engage in after&#xD;
      diagnosis as well as during and after treatment. Additionally, a substantial number of&#xD;
      patients never return to prediagnosis levels of physical exercise and do not meet the minimal&#xD;
      ACSM or CDC guidelines for achieving the health-related benefits (e.g., increased muscle&#xD;
      mass, strength, and cardiorespiratory fitness) thought to be etiologically involved in CRF,&#xD;
      suggesting the need for formal intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to test an individually tailored physical exercise intervention, including both&#xD;
      aerobic and resistance exercise, for reducing CRF in prostate cancer patients receiving&#xD;
      radiation therapy. The proposed research will provide detailed information on the efficacy&#xD;
      and acceptance of a home-based aerobic and resistance exercise program for CRF among prostate&#xD;
      cancer patients receiving radiation. Data regarding the influence of this intervention on&#xD;
      potential factors related to CRF, including loss of strength, muscle atrophy and inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers will be gathered. The purpose of the proposed study is to extend the positive&#xD;
      findings from a feasibility study showing that our tailored home-based aerobic (walking) and&#xD;
      progressive resistance exercise program was effective in reducing CRF and improving strength,&#xD;
      skeletal muscle mass, aerobic capacity and quality of life in a small sample of prostate and&#xD;
      breast cancer patients (N=38).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Aim of the study is to examine the influence of a home-based aerobic and&#xD;
      progressive resistance exercise program on CRF in prostate cancer patients receiving&#xD;
      radiation therapy. The proposed study is a phase II randomized, 2-arm, controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial employing a repeated-measures design (baseline, post intervention, 3-month follow-up)&#xD;
      that will accrue 122 male prostate cancer patients receiving radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project builds upon very promising pilot data and includes a diverse research team with&#xD;
      substantial experience in exercise interventions, survivorship, and cancer control research.&#xD;
      This grant will allow us to discern the efficacy of a novel, tailored, home-based aerobic and&#xD;
      resistance exercise intervention for reducing CRF among prostate cancer patients during&#xD;
      radiation, and to identify potential factors (e.g., loss of strength, muscle atrophy,&#xD;
      dysregulation of bodily immune function} that may contribute to the development of CRF that,&#xD;
      in turn, can be more effectively targeted through tailoring future exercise interventions to&#xD;
      improve the impact of these exercise interventions on reducing CRF. These results will have&#xD;
      the direct potential to reduce the suffering experienced by prostate cancer patients during&#xD;
      radiation treatments, and to positively impact future research in exercise and cancer control&#xD;
      on side effect management, the practice of evidence-based medicine for the treatment of CRF,&#xD;
      and, eventually, public health policy and oncology practice.&#xD;
