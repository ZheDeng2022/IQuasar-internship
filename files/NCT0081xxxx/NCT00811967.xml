      The objective of the study is to evaluate the superiority of treatment with PegIntron and&#xD;
      Rebetol over no antiviral therapy (control group) in subjects with chronic hepatitis C and&#xD;
      type C compensated cirrhosis. Subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 2:1 (Treatment Arm to&#xD;
      Control Arm). Subjects in the Treatment Arm will receive combination therapy with PegIntron&#xD;
      and Rebetol for 48 weeks; then will enter a 24-week post-treatment Follow-up. Subjects who&#xD;
      have detectable Hepatitis C Virus-RNA at Treatment Week 24 will discontinue treatment and&#xD;
      enter Follow-up.&#xD;
