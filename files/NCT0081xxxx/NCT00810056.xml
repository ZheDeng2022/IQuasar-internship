  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-county randomized controlled trial of the Fostering Healthy Futures (FHF)&#xD;
      preventive intervention program (consisting of mentoring and skills groups) with 256&#xD;
      maltreated preadolescent youth in out-of-home care. It is hypothesized that participation in&#xD;
      the FHF program will result in better functioning in cognitive, social, and behavioral&#xD;
      domains, and that these gains will result in improved mental health functioning, quality of&#xD;
      life, and reductions in problem behaviors and adverse life-course outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Youth with a history of maltreatment and foster care placement are at risk for a host of&#xD;
      mental health, behavioral, and social problems, resulting in adverse life-course outcomes of&#xD;
      great public health significance. This is a 5-year efficacy trial of the Fostering Healthy&#xD;
      Futures Program (FHF), a preventive intervention designed to promote prosocial development,&#xD;
      and to reduce problem behaviors for youth in foster care. FHF is an innovative,&#xD;
      culturally-sensitive and multi-component intervention for 9-11-year-old children who have&#xD;
      been maltreated and placed in foster care. Through a 9-month intervention that includes&#xD;
      screening assessments, one-on-one mentoring, and skills groups, FHF targets cognitive, social&#xD;
      and behavioral domains in order to build competencies, improve mental health functioning and&#xD;
      quality of life, and reduce problem behaviors and adverse life outcomes (e.g. arrests, school&#xD;
      dropout, restrictive placements). Assessments with youth, caregivers and teachers will be&#xD;
      conducted at baseline (pre-randomization), post-intervention, and 1-year follow-up. Data will&#xD;
      also include child welfare, educational, and juvenile justice records. A randomized&#xD;
      controlled pilot trial of FHF in one county has produced program manuals for the mentoring&#xD;
      and skills group components, and evidence of program feasibility, with high recruitment and&#xD;
      retention rates. The FHF pilot study has demonstrated positive preliminary effects on&#xD;
      putative mediators. A multi-county randomized controlled trial of the FHF program with 256&#xD;
      youth will enable the investigators to: 1) examine intervention effects on both proximal and&#xD;
      distal outcomes, 2) examine potential moderators of the intervention, 3) conduct mediational&#xD;
      analyses to identify the mechanisms by which the program may enhance outcomes, and 4) conduct&#xD;
      within-group analyses. The goal is to design more efficacious interventions, thereby reducing&#xD;
      disability, morbidity, and mortality, not only for youth in foster care, but for all&#xD;
      high-risk youth.&#xD;
