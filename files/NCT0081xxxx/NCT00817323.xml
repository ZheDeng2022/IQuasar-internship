      PURPOSE The purpose of this study is to elucidate whether quetiapine fumurate (Seroquel)&#xD;
      exerts its antidepressant activity in bipolar disorder through altering either serotonergic&#xD;
      or catecholinergic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS By depleting either serotonin or catecholamines in successfully treated bipolar&#xD;
      patients, relapse will be induced and reveal which neurotransmitters are effected when&#xD;
      receiving normal treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION While the exact mechanism of action of the classical antidepressants is not&#xD;
      fully understood, strong evidence implicating serotonin and noradrenalin to be necessary&#xD;
      (albeit insufficient) for the resolution of depression comes from neurotransmitter depletion&#xD;
      studies. This biological evidence for each of these two neurotransmitters come from study&#xD;
      paradigms in which the neurotransmitter (or its precursor) are selectively and effectively&#xD;
      depleted from patients who have responded to antidepressants which either work through&#xD;
      enhancing serotonin (for example, SRI antidepressants) or catecholamines (such as secondary&#xD;
      amine tricyclics, Reboxetine, etc.). It has been shown, and replicated, that patients that&#xD;
      respond to serotonin enhancing drugs precipitously and dramatically relapse when given a diet&#xD;
      (often in the form of a milkshake) which is void of tryptophan, the precursor of serotonin.&#xD;
      This diet often contains other long-chain amino acids to prevent any residual tryptophan in&#xD;
      the system from entering the CNS. These patients who have then relapsed on the&#xD;
      tryptophan-free diet have their tryptophan repleted and their mood improves often over a very&#xD;
      short time frame (for example, five hours). When this technique is performed on patients&#xD;
      responding to catecholamine-enhancing drugs there is no significant clinical effect. A&#xD;
      similar approach can be taken with patients who respond to noradrelanine-enhancing drugs.&#xD;
      Specifically, their catecholamine stores can be depleted by using dietary tyrosine. This&#xD;
      reduces the synthesis of catecholamines and dopamine thus depleting pre-synaptic&#xD;
      noradrenaline. For patients who responded to noradrenaline-enhancing drugs, this results in a&#xD;
      relapse in terms of depressive symptomatology. When this dietary tyrosine strategy is applied&#xD;
      to serotonin responders, there is no significant clinical effect.&#xD;

      The study would be conducted at a single site: the University of British Columbia. This study&#xD;
      would involve the recruitment of out-patient responders to quetiapine who previously had the&#xD;
      diagnosis of bipolar disorder, depressed phase. These patients could then be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either serotonergic or catecholinergic depletion, through tryptophan or tyrosine&#xD;
      depletion respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessments would be conducted prior to the subjects being entered into the active&#xD;
      phase of depletion. As the depletion phase is short, i.e. a number of days, this phase of the&#xD;
      trial would be relatively short (i.e. one week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will see a clinician at a pre-depletion screening visit that occurs (maximum) 7&#xD;
      days prior to commencing depletion. In addition the a physical examination and taking medical&#xD;
      history, inclusion/exclusion criteria will be verified, an ECG will be taken by a hospital&#xD;
      cardiologist, and blood and urine samples will be collected for standard&#xD;
      haematology/urinalysis, and a baseline assessment of amino acid and neurotransmitter levels.&#xD;
      Patients would be maintained on their original dose of Quetiapine throughout the course of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amino acid and neurotransmitter concentrations will be determined on-site, by means of HPLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All depletion drinks will be mixed with 300ml of juice, to cover the taste of the amino acid&#xD;
      mixture prepared. Male participants receiving a tyrosine-free formula, will drink a mixture&#xD;
      of amino acids as administered in work by Sheenan et al (1996): L-isoleucine (7.5g);&#xD;
      L-leucine (11.25g), L-lysine monohydrochloride (8.75g), L-methionine (2.5g), L-valine&#xD;
      (8.75g), L-threonine (5g); L-tryptophan (1.25g). Female subjects will receive drinks of the&#xD;
      same composition, but 20% less by weight of each amino acid. Similarly, the tryptophan-free&#xD;
      formula for males will be as prepared by Hughes et al (2000, (Hughes, Dunne &amp; Young 2000)),&#xD;
      and formula that is 20% less, by weight, of amino acids will be used for females: L-alanine&#xD;
      (5.5g); L-arginine (4.9g); L-cysteine (2.7g); L-glycine (3.2g); L-histidine 3.2g);&#xD;
      L-isoleucine (8g); L-leucine (13.5); L-lysine monohydrochloride (11g); L-methionine (3g);&#xD;
      L-phenylalanine (5.7g); L-proline (12.2g); L-serine (6.9g); L-threonine (6.5g); L-tyrosine&#xD;
      (6.9g); L-valine (8.9g).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The depletion and post-depletion monitoring will occur daily for five (5) days, so depletion&#xD;
      will begin on a Monday, unless circumstances require otherwise. Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to have a low-protein diet in the day prior to their second visit (total content&#xD;
      of less than 20g), and fast from midnight until their visit. Subjects will arrive at the&#xD;
      clinic at 9AM on day 1 and commence depletion, under the supervision of the screening&#xD;
      physician, who will monitor the subject over the next four days, including at 0- and 4-hours&#xD;
      post-depletion. At 24 hours post-depletion, a blood sample will be drawn for analysis of&#xD;
      amino acid and neurotransmitter levels (5mL). Subjects will not be hospitalized during their&#xD;
      participation, unless it is deemed necessary by clinician's judgment, but will be given&#xD;
      24-hour contact information for the attending physician. The same physician will see a given&#xD;
      subject for the duration of their participation, and all raters involved in this study will&#xD;
      have previously demonstrated an inter-rater reliability of 0.85 for all scales. At all visits&#xD;
      (1-5), subjects will have mood assessed using a Visual Analog Scale, for self-rating, and by&#xD;
      the Hamilton Rating-Scale for Depression. Concomitant medications will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the final visit (96-hours post-depletion), a follow-up physical examination will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
