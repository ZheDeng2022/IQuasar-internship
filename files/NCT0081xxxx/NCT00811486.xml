      Secondary hyperaldosteronism and the non-osmotic release of arginine vasopressin (AVP) are&#xD;
      the major factors in sodium and water retention in pulmonary arterial hypertension with right&#xD;
      ventricular failure. Natriuretic doses of mineralocorticoid antagonist and aquaretic doses of&#xD;
      V2 receptor antagonist will attenuate the sodium and water retention respectively, and be&#xD;
      associated with clinical improvement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Much has been learned about the pathophysiological state that underlies the development of&#xD;
      increased total body volume and edema in left ventricular failure. Very little, however, is&#xD;
      known about the mechanism underlying systemic hypervolemia in patients with isolated right&#xD;
      ventricular dysfunction. Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) represent a&#xD;
      model of isolated right ventricular dysfunction in which these mechanisms may be elucidated.&#xD;
      Aldosterone has now been shown to have many properties that are likely to be detrimental in&#xD;
      congestive heart failure (CHF) and that are not shared by angiotensin II. Aldosterone&#xD;
      blockade has been associated with improved mortality in patients with left ventricular&#xD;
      failure, already receiving an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. But its role in&#xD;
      isolated right ventricular failure has not been elucidated. The plasma arginine vasopressin&#xD;
      levels are disproportionately elevated for the degree of serum osmolarity in patients with&#xD;
      heart failure and result in water retention and hyponatremia. Conivaptan, a vasopressin&#xD;
      receptor antagonist, appears to reduce body weight and improve signs of left heart failure,&#xD;
      though there is no study to evaluate its role in right ventricular failure with edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the role of spironolactone and conivaptan in patients with right&#xD;
      ventricular failure and pathophysiology of sodium and water retention in these patients.&#xD;
