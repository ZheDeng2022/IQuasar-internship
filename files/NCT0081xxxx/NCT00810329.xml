      The purpose of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify specific set of proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid (fluid surrounding the&#xD;
           brain and the spinal cord), that are believed to be seen in Chronic fatigue syndrome&#xD;
           (CFS) patients, but not in healthy controls (HC). A similar study that the investigators&#xD;
           had conducted before,suggested that significant changes in proteins in the cerebrospinal&#xD;
           fluid may be due to the fundamental pathology of this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure (pressure that helps the cerebrospinal fluid to&#xD;
           move around the brain and the spinal cord), may be related with certain symptoms like&#xD;
           headache, sleep problems, light headedness, increased pain, excessive tiredness&#xD;
           (fatigue) even with minimal work and memory problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessment of Autonomic Nervous system function (Sympathetic nervous system)between the&#xD;
           CFS and HC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Perform Lung Function Testing or pulmonary function test to estimate the lung capacities&#xD;
           and score shortness of breath while performing breathing maneuvers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Dolorimetry (18 tender point test) for assessment of pain threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Capsaicin skin test&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Allergy skin test&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Neurological dysfunction is a key component of the clinical expression and case designation&#xD;
      of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia (FM)and other related conditions.If the&#xD;
      central nervous system is involved, then evidence will be present in the cerebrospinal fluid.&#xD;
      Distinct patterns of proteins will be present in Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) compared to&#xD;
      healthy control (HC) subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other testing in our study would include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a)Assessment of lung function and capacities. Additional interests are to assess the&#xD;
           shortness of breath, lightheadedness, headache and chest tightness during the breathing&#xD;
           maneuvers. The rationale for recording these symptoms is to understand the&#xD;
           pathophysiology of sensory disturbances that are more noted in the CFS and Fibromyalgia&#xD;
           group, but not in HC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the blood pressure and heart rate response before and after hand grip exercise&#xD;
           testing. This is a test to measure the Autonomic Nervous system function (Sympathetic&#xD;
           nervous system).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Skin tests like:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i) Capsaicin skin test, to check for specific responses like burning sensation, area of&#xD;
           skin redness, itchy sensation to varying doses of capsaicin (essence of chilli pepper),&#xD;
           when placed on the forearm and to compare if there are any differences seen between the&#xD;
           responses in CFS and Healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii) Allergy skin test to look if there are any allergies that are seen in the set of CFS&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 18 tenderness point testing to compare the pain threshold before and after the lumbar&#xD;
           puncture also know as the spinal tap. 18 tenderness point testing is a diagnostic test&#xD;
           for Fibromyalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Many of the participants with CFS do have associated Migraine headaches and they&#xD;
           complain of severe light and sound sensitivity. We are analysing those group of people&#xD;
           and decision have to be made as to which medications would work at best, thus providing&#xD;
           immediate relief from headache.&#xD;
