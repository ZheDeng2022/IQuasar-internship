  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug-related illness accounts for 5% to 23% of hospital admissions, and is now claimed to be&#xD;
      the sixth leading cause of mortality. Older adults are at higher risk of adverse drug-related&#xD;
      events, and medication-related fall injuries are the most common adverse event that could be&#xD;
      potentially prevented. There are 1.2 million falls per year among Canadian elderly, at a cost&#xD;
      of $2.4 billion in health care services, and substantial risk of loss of independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall purpose of this research program is to reduce medication-related fall injuries by&#xD;
      using computerized electronic prescribing and drug management systems to identify high risk&#xD;
      patients and provide physicians with patient-specific recommendations for modifying&#xD;
      psychotropic medication use to reduce this risk.&#xD;

      Background: Fall-related injuries account for significant morbidity and mortality,&#xD;
      particularly in the elderly where multiple comorbidities and age-related changes in bone&#xD;
      density increase the risk of fall-related fractures Indeed use of psychotropic medications in&#xD;
      elderly persons is associated with a 2 to 29 fold increase in the risk of falls and a 2 to 5&#xD;
      fold increase in the risk of hip fracture. At particular risk are individuals over the age of&#xD;
      70, those with a prior history of falls, cognitive impairment, stroke, Parkinson's disease,&#xD;
      or other conditions that would impair balance or gait. In our particular study population,&#xD;
      67.5% of persons with a psychotropic drug prescribing problem had at least one additional&#xD;
      risk factor for fall-related injuries. This was particularly true for women who not only were&#xD;
      more likely to have a psychotropic drug prescribing alerts than men but were also more likely&#xD;
      to have other risk factors. 70.3% of women who had a psychotropic prescribing alert had other&#xD;
      risk factors in comparison to 62.1% of men, particularly as it related to older age and a&#xD;
      history of a fall-related fracture or soft-tissue injury in the past 12 months. A recent&#xD;
      in-hospital study showed that providing physicians with patient-specific recommendations for&#xD;
      changes in high risk psychotropic therapy through a computerized order-entry system reduced&#xD;
      the prescription of non-recommended drugs and doses by 10%, which in turn was associated with&#xD;
      a significant two-fold reduction in the in-hospital fall rate{5007}. If even a 5% reduction&#xD;
      (annual prevalence 16.1% to 11.1%) could be achieved in primary care through targeted&#xD;
      recommendations for high risk patients with psychotropic drug prescribing alerts, we would&#xD;
      expect that it could conservatively reduce the number of falls among Canadian elderly&#xD;
      (assuming the lowest risk of RR=1.66) from 116,064 to 82,212 and the number of fall-related&#xD;
      injuries from 11,606 to 8,221. Based on the average costs of treating fall-related injuries&#xD;
      of $20,000/injury{5006}, a reduction in adverse events of this magnitude would be associated&#xD;
      with an annual savings of $67,708,000 in direct care costs. The research question is the&#xD;
      following: Can medication-related fall injuries be reduced by using computerized electronic&#xD;
      prescribing and drug management systems to identify high risk patients and provide physicians&#xD;
      with patient-specific recommendations for modifying psychotropic medication use to reduce&#xD;
      this risk?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine the extent to which a targeted psychotropic drug alert and&#xD;
      recommendation system will reduce&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) the rate of potentially inappropriate psychotropic medication for patients at risk of&#xD;
      fall-related injuries, and b) fall-related injury risk, fall-related injuries and&#xD;
      hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan : A single blind, cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted to test&#xD;
      the hypothesized benefits of the targeted psychotropic drug alert and recommendation system&#xD;
      versus the standard automated generic drug alert system within a fixed cohort of primary care&#xD;
      physicians and an open cohort of patients seen by study physicians in the 16 month follow-up&#xD;
      period for the assessment of reductions in potentially inappropriate psychotropic&#xD;
      prescriptions and fall-related injuries. A single blind trial was planned because&#xD;
      intervention status cannot be blinded for physicians in the study. However, study&#xD;
      participants are blinded to the outcomes assessed, because the data required to assess these&#xD;
      outcomes can be predominantly collected and assessed using data sources that are independent&#xD;
      of the intervention status. Patients, clustered within physicians, is the unit of analysis&#xD;
      because patient level information provides the most precise, non-ecological, method of the&#xD;
      study outcomes as well as potential confounders, and because hierarchical multivariate&#xD;
      analytic methods are now available to model clustering in the assessment of treatment&#xD;
      effect{Chuang, 2000 4339 /id}. The benefit of the intervention will be assessed by comparing&#xD;
      patients of physicians who received the psychotropic drug alert and recommendation system and&#xD;
      patients of physicians who received automated drug decision support. This approach minimizes&#xD;
      Hawthorne effects, arising from the intensive nature of practice intervention required to&#xD;
      support computer-based systems in primary care that would likely result in over-estimation of&#xD;
      benefit if computer-based decision support for drug management were compared to physicians&#xD;
      with no computerized intervention. Further, it provides a means by which information on&#xD;
      prescriptions, drug and disease profile can be assessed in an equivalent way between patients&#xD;
      of physicians with automated control or targeted alert experimental decision-support,&#xD;
      reducing biases related to differences in measurement sources.&#xD;
