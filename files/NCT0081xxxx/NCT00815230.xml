  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinically widely used X-ray computed tomography examination has a low-grade radiation&#xD;
      effect and recently has attracted much attention concerning the possible adverse effects of&#xD;
      radiation on human body [ref. 1-5]. The radiation is harmful to human tissues and cells&#xD;
      mainly because it can interact with water (which makes up to 80% of cells) to generate&#xD;
      reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially the formation of hydroxyl radicals. So far as we&#xD;
      can reach, there is no report concerning the relation between X-ray computed tomography&#xD;
      examination and the blood ROS level. Therefore, we wish to conduct this study to clarify if&#xD;
      the cardiac computed tomography angiography (cardiac CTA) may induce a higher level of ROS in&#xD;
      the peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be OPD patients who are arranged for cardiac CTA examination because of&#xD;
      suspect coronary artery disease (CAD). In total, twenty cases will be enrolled for the study.&#xD;
      The formal consent will be delivered and explained to the patients and families after the&#xD;
      arrangement of cardiac CTA. It then will be retrieved just before the performance of cardiac&#xD;
      CTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each enrolled case, peripheral blood will be sampled three times (once before and twice&#xD;
      after the performance of cardiac CTA). Totally 60 blood samples will be collected from 20&#xD;
      study subjects within 3 months (January 1 ~ March 31, 2009). ROS level in the collected blood&#xD;
      samples will be then measured, compared, and analyzed.&#xD;
