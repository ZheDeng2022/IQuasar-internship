      The C-Pulse Feasibility Study is evaluating the safety and performance of a new product for&#xD;
      the treatment of heart failure. The product is designed to help reduce the symptoms of heart&#xD;
      failure and help patients function better with daily activities. The study evaluates multiple&#xD;
      measures of heart function and whether the patient's quality of life has been improved since&#xD;
      the device implant. The patient will have several visits after the device implant to assess&#xD;
      how well they are doing and to monitor any safety concerns.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sunshine Heart Inc. is sponsoring a prospective, multi-center trial to assess the safety and&#xD;
      provide indications for performance of the Sunshine Heart C-PulseTM System (&quot;C-Pulse™&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current need is for a counterpulsation device or method that is effective enough to make&#xD;
      its application appealing as a long-term implant to a large number of patients and&#xD;
      physicians. It must be simple and safe, with a straight-forward implant procedure, and with&#xD;
      long-term measurable patient benefits. Further, it would be advantageous for the&#xD;
      counterpulsation device to be smaller, easier to insert, ambulatory, disconnectable, and not&#xD;
      in the bloodstream. Such a device may be more readily adopted by a wider group of&#xD;
      cardiologists and surgeons, and be suitable for a wider group of people in NYHA Class III or&#xD;
      IV heart failure. It is important to point out that a counterpulsation device is aimed to&#xD;
      augment native heart function and is fundamentally different from total artificial hearts,&#xD;
      left ventricular assist devices and heart transplants which are meant to be a total&#xD;
      replacement or an alternative to the native heart. Thus, the counterpulsation device is&#xD;
      considered non-obligatory and not life-supporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sunshine Heart, Inc has proposed C-Pulse™, a novel ambulatory, non-obligatory, non-blood&#xD;
      contacting extra-ascending aortic counterpulsation system. The C-Pulse™ System is designed to&#xD;
      be implanted without the need for cardiopulmonary bypass or extensive dissection, to be able&#xD;
      to be activated immediately, to augment heart function in a safe manner and to provide&#xD;
      sustained relief from heart failure symptoms. It can be turned off safely, and similarly, in&#xD;
      failure modes, is considered to have an associated low risk of death or disability, other&#xD;
      than the recurrence of heart failure symptoms. C-Pulse™ is not an alternative to the heart,&#xD;
      it is an augmentation device, and it does not preclude the use of therapies that provide full&#xD;
      circulatory support such as heart transplantation or LVADs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The C-Pulse™ System consists of a counterpulsation Cuff secured around the outside of the&#xD;
      ascending aorta, the main blood vessel out of the heart. The Cuff and a heart signal sensing&#xD;
      wire are attached to an external driver. The external Driver inflates and deflates the Cuff&#xD;
      in sequence with the ECG signal to assist heart function and improve the pumping capacity of&#xD;
      the heart. The Cuff deflects the aorta in a &quot;thumb-printing&quot; manner which has been optimized&#xD;
      to minimize aortic wall strain and maximize blood volume displacement per beat. The C-Pulse™&#xD;
      System is non-blood contacting, simple to insert, and can be turned on and off as required;&#xD;
      all natural blood pathways are maintained - there is no exposure of foreign material to the&#xD;
      bloodstream.&#xD;
