  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plantar warts are benign skin lesions caused by human papillomavirus (HPV).There are several&#xD;
      treatment methods for this illness, but none of them can heal all patients. Cryotherapy using&#xD;
      liquid nitrogen is one of the most common local treatments. In this study, we will compare&#xD;
      the effectiveness of cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen with the association of organic acids&#xD;
      and nitric acid (nitric-zinc complex). In addition, as secondary objectives have been&#xD;
      defined: 1) know the number of applications necessary for each treatment to achieve the&#xD;
      complete resolution of the plantar wart, in order to compare the healing times between each&#xD;
      treatment and establish which treatment is faster, 2) analyze the influence of the HPV&#xD;
      biotype, the location of the lesion and the time of evolution in the response to the&#xD;
      different treatments, and 3) Compare the ultrasound signs of plantar warts with the&#xD;
      ultrasound signs of healthy skin after the resolution of the process.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled clinical trial is proposed. The recruitment of patients will be&#xD;
      carried out by including the sample of those patients who have diagnostic confirmation of&#xD;
      plantar wart in the Chiropodology and Surgery Service of the University Podiatry Clinic of&#xD;
      the Complutense University of Madrid, consecutively, between November 2020 and the date when&#xD;
      the estimated sample size is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the trial will be assigned with equal probability to each treatment arm,&#xD;
      based on their consecutive inclusion in the study. Subsequently, the treatment allocation&#xD;
      will be determined by a random code generated by the Epidat 4.1 program using random permuted&#xD;
      blocks. The treatment used will be evident both for the participant and for the research&#xD;
      podiatrist responsible for the intervention. However, the primary result will be confirmed by&#xD;
      the microbiological study carried out by the Department of Microbiology of the Complutense&#xD;
      University of Madrid, which does not know any data about the patient or the treatment group&#xD;
      to which it was initially assigned.&#xD;

    <description>Compare the cure rates of the following topical treatments of plantar warts: cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen; and the association of organic acids and nitric acid (nitric-zinc complex), in a period of 12 weeks.&#xD;
A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test will be performed when there is an absence of clinical signs and symptoms of plantar wart, considering cure when a negative result is obtained.&#xD;
In those patients in whom the maximum number of treatment sessions recommended in the technical sheet of each product has been carried out and clinical signs of plantar wart are still observed, as well as in those patients who after 12 weeks of follow-up continue to present signs and symptoms Clinicians will be considered as not cured, considering the study ended.</description>

    <description>Weekly, at each visit, before applying the treatment, a debridement of the hyperkeratotic tissue covering the wart will be performed with a scalpel handle of number 3 and a scalpel blade of number 15, and then the treatment will be applied.&#xD;
Subsequently, the application of cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen will be carried out using CryoPen b® (HO Equipment, Hhislenghien-Belgium). To analyze the homogeneous application in all the patients in the study, perform 2 applications of 15 seconds per session, with an interval of 30 seconds between each application, such and as manufacturers recommend. The number of sessions in which the product is applied will be a maximum of 5, following the procedure of previous studies.</description>
