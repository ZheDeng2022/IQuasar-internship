  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to check for side effects from icatibant in children and&#xD;
      teenagers with hereditary angioedema (HAE). Other aims are to check how well icatibant&#xD;
      controls HAE symptoms in these children and teenagers, and how much icatibant stays in their&#xD;
      blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, the study doctor will check if each child or teenager can take part. For&#xD;
      those who can take part, participants and their parents or caregivers will visit the clinic&#xD;
      or hospital when they have their next HAE attack. Participants will receive 1 injection&#xD;
      (shot) of icatibant in a vein and will stay at the clinic or hospital until their HAE&#xD;
      symptoms are under control. Participants can receive up to 2 more injections of icatibant&#xD;
      over time if their HAE symptoms don't improve or get worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the participants go home, the study staff will follow up with them by a telephone call&#xD;
      1 to 2 days later. Then, the participants will visit the clinic or hospital 1 week after they&#xD;
      received the icatabant injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant can visit the clinic or hospital and be treated with icatibant in the same&#xD;
      way for up to 3 HAE attacks in total.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-667. TAK-667 is being tested to treat&#xD;
      Japanese Children and Adolescents who experience acute attack of HAE. This study will look at&#xD;
      safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics (PK) of people who take TAK-667.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll at least 3 participants. Participants will take TAK-667 with SC&#xD;
      administration on the abdomen. The dose of TAK-667 will be dependent on the participant's&#xD;
      body weight (Up to 30 mg; 10 mg for 12 kg to 25 kg, 15 mg for 26 kg to 40 kg, 20 mg for 41 kg&#xD;
      to 50kg, 25 mg for 51 kg to 65 kg, 30 mg for &gt;65 kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this&#xD;
      study is 25 days as a maximum (screening day for initial attack plus 8 days post dose for&#xD;
      each 3 attacks as a maximum). Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and will&#xD;
      be closely monitored in the hospital/study center for at least 8 hours after administration&#xD;
      and receive physical examination and assessment to evaluate safety, efficacy and PK.&#xD;
      Hospitalization may be prolonged until, in the opinion of the investigator, the participant&#xD;
      is clinically stable and onset of HAE attack is completely resolved.&#xD;

Each of the 5 categories was scored from 0 to 2. Face(F): 0 (no particular expression/smile) - 2 (frequent to constant frown clenched jaw quivering chin); Legs(L): 0 (normal position/relaxed) - 2 (kicking/legs drawn up); Activity(A): 0 (lying quietly, normal position, moves easily) - 2 (arched rigid/jerking); Cry(C): 0 (No cry [awake/asleep]) - 2 (crying steadily/screams/sobs or frequent complaints); Consolability(C): 0 (content/relaxed) - 2 (difficult to console/comfort), resulting in a total score between 0 and 10.</description>

             nonsterilized male partner agrees to use routinely adequate contraception from signing&#xD;
             of informed consent throughout the duration of the study, and proves negative in the&#xD;
             pregnancy test at screening.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. The participant presents with an HAE attack with laryngeal/upper respiratory tract&#xD;
             symptoms which are considered severe in the investigator's clinical judgment and which&#xD;
             may necessitate urgent care and/or impede the conduct of study efficacy assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The participant has a diagnosis of angioedema other than HAE&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The participant has evidence of stroke or coronary artery disease based on medical&#xD;
             history at the screening examination or at pretreatment; eg, acute ischemic heart&#xD;
             disease, unstable angina pectoris, severe coronary heart disease or congestive heart&#xD;
             failure, that in the investigator's judgment would be a contraindication for&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. The participant has participated in another clinical study within the past 30 days&#xD;
             before screening.&#xD;
