      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of generating sufficient patient&#xD;
      derived micro-organospheres (PDMO) from a biopsy of a patient's advanced breast cancer to&#xD;
      determine sensitivity to the most common forms of chemotherapy used in advanced breast cancer&#xD;
      care. While subjects are on study, they will first receive a standard of care clinical biopsy&#xD;
      from which extra tissue is taken for research purposes. Following the biopsy, a PDMO will be&#xD;
      generated and they will receive a chemotherapy regimen as determined by their treating&#xD;
      physician. This study aims to enroll 15 patients. Of this 15 patient cohort we aim to enroll&#xD;
      5 patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2&#xD;
      negative (HER2-) disease, 5 patients with ER+/HER2+ or ER-/HER2+ disease, and 5 patients with&#xD;
      ER-/HER2- (TNBC) disease. There are risks to having biopsies and blood draws that may include&#xD;
      moderate bleeding and pain at the biopsy site.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of patients with successful generation of PDMO from the patient's biopsy</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days of biopsy</time_frame>
    <description>The PDMO establishment will be monitored and success will be defined as the formation of 3D organoid structures in at least 80% of droplets in each well, in 20 randomly sampled wells per PDMO model, within 7 days. With an anticipated generation of 90% we anticipate being able to generate 13 PDMO from the first 15 patients to perform a drug screen within 10 days of biopsy. The exact 90% lower confidence bound (LCB) will be computed for the proportion of patients with successful generation of PDMO and completed drug screen within 10 days. For the first 6 patients, if at least 5 PDMO can be generated and screened on 6 patients' samples the procedure will be deemed feasible. With 6 patients studied the exact 90% LCB assuming 5 successful cases is 0.71. We would thus be 90% confident that the success rate of this strategy is at least 71%.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Association between specific chemotherapy sensitivity in PDMO to clinical outcome of patient</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study (up to 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>For the 15 evaluable patients, the MODEL ABC platform will be used to assess sensitivity to chemotherapy and generate a prediction model for correlation with patient data. For each sample, two primary outcomes will be collected: i) PDMO drug sensitivity data, and ii) the patient's clinical outcome (PFS). Treating PDMO with 10 chemotherapy single agents at 10 drug concentrations each will generate drug sensitivity data. For all 15 samples, PDMO sensitivity to each concentration of each drug will be used alongside the 15 clinical responses (PFS) to develop a predictor of PFS by correlating drug response data to clinical data.</description>

    <description>Subjects will undergo image-guided biopsy as a standard of care clinical biopsy from which extra tissue is taken for research purposes. Following the biopsy, a PDMO will be generated and they will receive a chemotherapy regimen as determined by their treating physician. PDMO are successfully generated, and the patient begins treatment with a hemotherapy backbone. A patient will be considered evaluable if pathology results are available from the biopsy.</description>

    <description>Patients with ABC will be receiving a biopsy, and a PDMO from the patient's biopsies will be generated from it. It is a model correlating clinical response with PDMO sensitivity to the most common forms of chemotherapy used in advanced breast cancer care.</description>
