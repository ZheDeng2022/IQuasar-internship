  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to examine the validity of peripheral oxygen saturation measurement&#xD;
      during the 6-minute walk test in patients with Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and to examine the&#xD;
      utility of two other functional tests as markers of pulmonary involvement in patients with&#xD;
      SSc.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is a connective tissue disease characterized by progressive organ&#xD;
      fibrosis and vascular dysfunction. The leading causes of disease related morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality are interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The&#xD;
      6-minute walk test (6MWT) is a submaximal functional exercise test used to evaluate ILD and&#xD;
      PAH in patients with SSc. Desaturations during the 6MWT have been considered suggestive of&#xD;
      ILD and PAH. Still, the optimal method to measure peripheral oxygen saturation during the&#xD;
      6MWT in patients with SSc remains unclear. Furthermore, other functional exercise tests may&#xD;
      also be useful in patients with SSc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with SSc will perform three functional exercise tests, and approximately half of the&#xD;
      patients will be invited to repeat the tests 1 week later to determine test-retest&#xD;
      reliability. Additionally, nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) will be performed on every&#xD;
      patient to assess the capillary density of the nailfold of the fingers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 6MWT, the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) will be measured continuously on&#xD;
      three anatomical locations. An arterial line will be placed, and blood will be drawn at&#xD;
      baseline and after ended 6MWT and analysed for arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2). The&#xD;
      correlation between the capillary density of the nailfold and the SpO2 measured on the finger&#xD;
      will be assessed. Bland-Altman plot will be used to display the agreement between SaO2 and&#xD;
      SpO2 and between the two 6MWT. Further, the association between pulmonary variables and 6MWT&#xD;
      results will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two alternative functional exercise tests will be investigated and compared to results in the&#xD;
      6MWT: The 1-minute sit-to-stand test (1STST) and the 4-meter gait speed test (4MGS). The&#xD;
      association between the three functional exercise tests and clinical parameters in patients&#xD;
      with SSc will be examined.&#xD;
