  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, 53-week, outpatient, open-label extension (OLE) study to&#xD;
      evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of KarXT in subjects with&#xD;
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-Fifth Edition (DSM-5) schizophrenia who previously&#xD;
      completed the treatment period of one of the two Phase 3 double-blind studies, KAR-007 or&#xD;
      KAR-009. In this OLE study, all subjects will receive KarXT (a fixed combination of&#xD;
      xanomeline 125 mg and trospium chloride 30 mg twice daily [BID]) for up to 52 weeks&#xD;
      regardless of treatment assignment in the preceding Phase 3 acute study. The primary&#xD;
      objective of the study is to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of KarXT in&#xD;
      subjects with a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia. The secondary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the long-term efficacy and monitor trough concentrations of xanomeline and trospium&#xD;
      after administration of KarXT.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of participants with schizophrenia. The PANSS rating form contains 7 positive symptom scales, 7 negative system scales, and 16 general psychopathology symptom scales. Participants are rated from 1 to 7 on each symptom scale. The total score is the sum of all scales with a minimum score of 30 and a maximum score of 210. A decrease in PANSS total score correlates with an improvement in schizophrenia symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS rating form contains 7 positive symptom scales, 7 negative system scales, and 16 general psychopathology symptom scales. For positive symptoms in schizophrenia, participants are rated from 1 to 7 on each symptom scale, with a minimum score of 7 and a maximum score of 49. A decrease in PANSS total score correlates with an improvement in schizophrenia symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Negative Marder Factor Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The Negative Marder Factor score is derived from the PANSS and consists of the sum of 5 negative scales (N) and 2 general scales (G) (N1. Blunted affect; N2. Emotional withdrawal; N3. Poor rapport; N4. Passive/apathetic social withdrawal; N6. Lack of spontaneity; G7. Motor retardation; and G16. Active social avoidance), with a minimum score of 7 and a maximum score of 49.</description>

    <description>The CGI-S modified asked the clinician 1 question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience, how mentally ill is the participant at this time?&quot; The clinician's answer rated on the following 7-point scale: 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; 7 = among the most extremely ill participants.</description>

    <description>The PANSS is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of participants with schizophrenia. The PANSS rating form contains 7 positive symptom scales, 7 negative system scales, and 16 general psychopathology symptom scales. Participants are rated from 1 to 7 on each symptom scale. The total score is the sum of all scales with a minimum score of 30 and a maximum score of 210. A PANSS responder is defined as a participant with at least a 30% change in PANSS total score compared to baseline at Week 52.</description>

The dose is increased to xanomeline 125 mg/trospium 30 mg BID on days 8-364 unless the subject is experiencing adverse events from the xanomeline 100 mg/ trospium 20 mg dose. Subjects who were increased to xanomeline 125 mg/trospium 30 mg will have the option to return to xanomeline 100 mg/ trospium 20 mg depending on clinical response and tolerability. Re-escalation to 125/30 BID or re-titration in cases in which the subject has been off KarXT for a longer period of time (at least a week) is allowed and will require a discussion between the principal investigator and the medical monitor.</description>
