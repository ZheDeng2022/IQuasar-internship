  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the benefit of a complementary and integrative health (CIH) pain&#xD;
      management program when added to standard rehabilitative care (SC) compared to SC alone prior&#xD;
      to an intensive functional restoration (FR) program in a population of active duty service&#xD;
      members. In addition the study aims to identify factors that predict improvement in pain&#xD;
      impact following treatment, and to determine the proportion of participants who experience&#xD;
      clinically meaningful response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SC included physical and occupational therapy. CIH included chiropractic, acupuncture, yoga&#xD;
      and foam roller instruction. Both treatment groups also received education about pain&#xD;
      psychology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were randomly assigned to a 3-week course of either SC alone or CIH combined&#xD;
      with SC prior to a 3-week course of FR. Outcomes were collected at baseline, at end of stage&#xD;
      1, and post-FR. Outcomes included patient-reported and provider-determined measures.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in National Institutes of Health (NIH) Research Task Force (RTF) Impact Score - baseline to end of stage 1 treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline collected between 3 months before start of stage 1 through 2 days after start of Stage 1. End of stage 1 measures collected between &lt;/=2 treatment days before end of stage 1 through 4 treatment days after end of stage 1.</time_frame>
    <description>The RTF Impact score is was computed by adding the following three scores: 1) average pain intensity (range 0=no pain - 10=worst pain) from the Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS); 2) the NIH Patient Reported Outcome Measures Information System (PROMIS) pain interference score (range 4-20 with higher scores indicating worse status; 3) the REVERSE of the PROMIS physical function scores (range 4-20 with higher score indicating better status and higher score on reverse scale indicating worse status). The range of RTF impact score is 8 (best) -50 (worst). Change in Impact Score is computed by subtracting baseline Impact Score from the score at the time of reassessment. Improvement is indicated by change scores with negative values.</description>
