  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back leads to a significant socio-economic burden. It is associated with physical&#xD;
      and psychosocial deconditioning. Even a short &quot;nature experience&quot; has positive effects on the&#xD;
      affective and cognitive factors involved in chronic pain. In the brain, the anterior&#xD;
      cingulate cortex plays an important role in both pain and emotions. Exposure to a natural&#xD;
      environment may decrease activation of the anterior cingulate cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic horticulture&#xD;
      on the decrease of activation of the anterior cingulate cortex in people with chronic low&#xD;
      back pain participating in 2 sessions of 90 minutes of therapeutic horticulture and 2&#xD;
      sessions of 90 minutes of handiwork.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that therapeutic horticulture may reduce the activation of the&#xD;
      anterior cingulate cortex. The effects of therapeutic horticulture may be mediated through&#xD;
      the double exposure to both nature and physical activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-specific low back pain is the first cause of years lived with a disability in the world.&#xD;
      The network of biological, psychological and social contributors to chronic low back pain is&#xD;
      complex. Within this network, physical and mental deconditioning are a key point and a&#xD;
      privileged therapeutic target of multidisciplinary training programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exercise improves pain and function in people with chronic low back pain.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, its benefits decrease if it is not practiced regularly. The pleasure doing&#xD;
      physical exercises and the possibility of integrating them into daily life are important&#xD;
      factors of adherence. Gardening meets well the expectations of the physical treatment of&#xD;
      chronic low back pain as it involves exercises aiming to increase spinal flexibility,&#xD;
      strength and endurance of spine and lower limbs muscles, proprioception. Gardening is&#xD;
      associated with the notion of pleasure and can be practiced in a group thus promoting the&#xD;
      social bond. Moreover, therapeutic horticulture is suitable for the long term and can even be&#xD;
      practiced in urban environment. Painful sensations are modulated by the affective and&#xD;
      emotional state. Within the neuromatrix of pain, the cortex plays an important role in&#xD;
      encoding pain and associated emotions. Several studies suggest an impact on several&#xD;
      physiological parameters of an &quot;experience of nature&quot;, even on a short time. A randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial compared in 38 healthy volunteers, the effect of a 90-minute walk in nature&#xD;
      (forest) and in urban setting (city), on the activation of the anterior cingulate cortex&#xD;
      (specifically its subgenual part) assessed using variation in blood perfusion on MRI, and on&#xD;
      rumination, assessed using a self-administered questionnaire. The authors showed that neural&#xD;
      activation in the subgenual prefrontal cortex and rumination scores were lower in the group&#xD;
      of healthy volunteers exposed to nature. Little is known about the impact of a &quot;nature&#xD;
      experience&quot; on chronic low back pain. A non-randomized controlled study has shown that adding&#xD;
      7 sessions of therapeutic horticulture to a standardized pain management program improved&#xD;
      health status, anxiety and coping strategies in patients with chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By its nature and physical component, therapeutic horticulture could constitute a&#xD;
      non-pharmacological accurate intervention in people with chronic low back pain, targeting&#xD;
      both the neurobiological and physical aspects of deconditioning syndrome. Therapeutic&#xD;
      horticulture was introduced in October 2017 in the multidisciplinary training program&#xD;
      dedicated to chronic low back pain in our department. However, its effects have not yet been&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
