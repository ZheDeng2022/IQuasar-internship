    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled, double blinded clinical study to assess a reduction of esophageal lesions attributable to radiofrequency (RF) ablation with use of esolution (esophageal retractor) in comparison to conventional therapy (no use of an esophageal retractor). The randomization is with a 1:1 randomization scheme assigning consecutive patients who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria to either: placement of a luminal esophageal temperature probe(LET) (control group); or, to placement of a LET and insertion of esolution esophageal retractor (intervention group). In the control group, there will not be deviation of the esophagus and in the intervention group, esolution will be utilized to deviate the esophagus during RF catheter ablation. All randomized subjects will be included in the intent-to-treat population, which will be used in the primary study analysis.</intervention_model_description>
