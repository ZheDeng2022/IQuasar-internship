  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cosmetic outcome of a patient's surgical scar is important for patient satisfaction,&#xD;
      especially in more visibly exposed areas of the body such as the hand. A patient's surgical&#xD;
      scar often serves as a long-term reminder of their surgery experience, so optimizing final&#xD;
      scar appearance should be of high importance. Surgical incision closure techniques and suture&#xD;
      materials may vary by individual hand surgeons, even with common hand procedures.&#xD;
