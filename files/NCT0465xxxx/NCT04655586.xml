      Sequential randomized, multicenter, active comparator study to evaluate the hypothesis that&#xD;
      rNAPc2 (AB201), a novel, potent and highly selective tissue factor inhibitor with&#xD;
      anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory and potential antiviral properties, shortens time to&#xD;
      recovery compared to heparin in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer&#xD;

      Sequential randomized, multicenter, active comparator study to evaluate the hypothesis that&#xD;
      rNAPc2, a novel, potent and highly selective tissue factor inhibitor with anticoagulant,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and potential antiviral properties, shortens time to recovery compared to&#xD;
      heparin in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer levels. Study&#xD;
      participants and Clinical Endpoint Committee (CEC) members assessing the clinical endpoints&#xD;
      will be blinded to treatment assignment. The protocol comprises sequential Phase 2b and Phase&#xD;
      3 studies. Analysis of Phase 2b data could lead to study discontinuation, adjustment of&#xD;
      eligibility criteria or sample size, and will inform the rNAPc2 dose level to be studied in&#xD;
      Phase 3.&#xD;

&#xD;

             samples by PCR or validated other test of ongoing infection (not an antibody test for&#xD;
             prior exposure), within seven (7) days of hospitalization or screening assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. D-dimer level &gt; upper limit of normal at screening&#xD;

             with therapeutic anticoagulation. Patients receiving prophylactic anticoagulation are&#xD;
             eligible if they are willing to discontinue current anticoagulation.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Life expectancy estimated to be &lt; 72 hours based on current clinical condition&#xD;

          8. Unable to receive heparin, e.g. history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and&#xD;
             thrombosis (HITT)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participation in any interventional clinical study with an investigational product&#xD;
             within seven (7) days of the Screening assessment or within 5 half-lives of the&#xD;
