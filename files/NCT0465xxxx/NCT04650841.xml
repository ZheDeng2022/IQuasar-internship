  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study probes the involvement of the opioid system in placebo effects on social&#xD;
      pain, using the opioid antagonist naloxone. 60 participants who recently experienced an&#xD;
      unwanted breakup will experience rejection-related stimuli and receive painful heat and&#xD;
      pressure stimuli during fMRI scanning. Participants will be randomized to receive either a&#xD;
      naloxone or saline nasal spray, and be informed that the spray is either saline, or an&#xD;
      effective pain and negative emotion reducing agent.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loss of close relationships is one of the most aversive life events. An unwanted romantic&#xD;
      breakup leads to a 20% risk of developing depression within a month, a dramatic increase in&#xD;
      depression risk. The investigators recently identified brain pathways mediating placebo&#xD;
      effects on physical heat pain and the social pain associated with an unwanted breakup,&#xD;
      including common involvement of dlPFC-PAG pathways and vmPFC. Other recent studies have&#xD;
      identified rejection-related opioidergic activity in these circuits that may reflect&#xD;
      endogenous regulatory mechanisms. This experiment probes the involvement of the opioid system&#xD;
      in placebo effects on social pain, using the opioid antagonist naloxone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extending the investigator's previous design, participants who recently experienced an&#xD;
      unwanted breakup will submit pictures of their ex-partners, places associated with strong&#xD;
      memories of the partner, and written descriptions of memories that evoke rejection and social&#xD;
      pain. Participants will 1) experience rejection-related stimuli and 2) receive painful heat&#xD;
      and pressure stimuli in separate runs during fMRI scanning. FMRI scans after Control and&#xD;
      Placebo treatment-nasal spray with suggestions of efficacy for emotion and pain-will be&#xD;
      performed in a 2-session within-person counterbalanced design. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized into two groups that receive either (1) 4mg naloxone nasal spray or (2) saline in&#xD;
      the nasal spray in both sessions, implementing a 2 x 2 (Placebo/Control x Saline/Naloxone)&#xD;
      design.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>The investigators are strongly committed to contributing to open and reproducible science. All MRI and behavioral data will be submitted to the NIMH Data Archive (NDA) according to the terms and conditions outlined on their website (https://ndar.nih.gov/contribute_data_sharing_regimen.html ) and with OpenFMRI.&#xD;
The investigators will ensure that our IRB has approved our Data Sharing Plan. The investigators will use an informed consent document that permits subjects to allow sharing of de-identified (face removed) MRI and fMRI data with open-sharing repositories, including the NDA and OpenFMRI databases. The consent form will stipulate that: &quot;Scientists can use my information, without personal identifiers, for any kind of genetic research.&quot;</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>All data will be de-identified prior to sharing. Raw data will be submitted to NDA within one year from the end of data collection or 6 months from the acceptance date of the first primary study manuscript on the full dataset (excluding methods development papers), whichever is later. Analyzed data/maps of statistical results and models accompanying each paper will be submitted to NDA/OpenFMRI when the primary study manuscript is accepted.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>These data would generally be made available to any qualified investigator for neuroimaging studies only including:&#xD;
i. Research on any brain phenomenon; ii. Neuroimaging research on non-disease traits (intelligence, behavioral traits); iii. Methods development research.&#xD;
The requesting investigator must provide documentation of local IRB approval.&#xD;
These data would not be made available to:&#xD;
i. Any criminal justice organization, because data may not be used for any criminal justice applications; ii. Any commercial entity, because use of the data is limited to not-for-profit organizations and data may not be used for any commercial purposes.</ipd_access_criteria>
