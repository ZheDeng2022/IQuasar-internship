  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Converging evidence from the literature suggests that digestive inflammation may play a role&#xD;
      in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). The investigators showed in the laboratory in&#xD;
      a pilot study that PD patients have digestive inflammation and that the level of inflammation&#xD;
      was inversely related to the length of the disease course. This digestive inflammation could&#xD;
      be at the origin of an increased intestinal permeability in a subpopulation of parkinsonian&#xD;
      patients, cause or consequence of modifications of the intestinal microbiota, thus offering a&#xD;
      potential portal of entry for a pathogen according to Braak's theory. To opponents of this&#xD;
      theory, it could also reflect the spread of inflammation from the Central nervous System to&#xD;
      the Enteral Nervous System (ENS), via the brain-gut axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators' hypothesis is that digestive inflammation occurs very early in Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease and that it is associated with hyperpermeability of the intestinal epithelial barrier&#xD;
      and a change in the intestinal microbiota composition. The investigators propose to study the&#xD;
      inflammation markers in the ENS of patients with a pre-motor form of PD (idiopathic Rapid Eye&#xD;
      Movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, n = 20), early-stage PD (&lt;5 years, without&#xD;
      dopatherapy, n = 20), more advanced PD (&gt; 5 years, n = 20) and control subjects (n = 20), on&#xD;
      colonic biopsies taken during a rectosigmoidoscopy or a coloscopy. Intestinal permeability&#xD;
      will be measured by ex-vivo techniques (in a Ussing chamber), the composition of the&#xD;
      microbiota will be established by sequencing 16s RNA and the lesional load of phosphorylated&#xD;
      alpha-synuclein will be evaluated by immunohistochemistry. All of these parameters will be&#xD;
      correlated with clinical data on the severity of PD: duration of development, age, total&#xD;
      Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score and axial sub-score, cognitive&#xD;
      tests (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA), existence of a probable idiopathic REM sleep&#xD;
      behavior disorder (REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Screening Questionnaire RBDSQ), olfactory&#xD;
      tests, complaint of dysautonomia (SCales for Outcomes in Parkinson's disease - autonomic&#xD;
      dysfunction, SCOPA-Aut).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of inflammation markers, the intestinal barrier and the microbiota could be a&#xD;
      first step making it possible to formulate physiopathological hypotheses on the development&#xD;
      of PD, to propose predictive biomarkers of the disease and its severity and to design early&#xD;
      interventions in the hope of modifying the evolutionary course of the pathological process.&#xD;
