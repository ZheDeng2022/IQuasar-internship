  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will enroll participants to evaluate the effects of SPG block on&#xD;
      post-traumatic headache. The study hypothesizes that patients that receive a SPG block with&#xD;
      lidocaine vs. placebo (saline) will have a lower number of headache days in the week&#xD;
      following the procedure, and will also report lower symptom scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will receive one treatment (SPG block) as well as complete surveys&#xD;
      prior to and after receiving treatment (for a total of approximately 2 weeks).&#xD;
