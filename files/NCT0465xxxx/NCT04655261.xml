  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Lymphoid Leukemia (CLL) is the most common type of leukemia (cancer of blood cells)&#xD;
      in adults affecting men more so than women. The main objective of this study is to assess the&#xD;
      how effective venetoclax (Venclexta) in combination with Obinutuzumab is in treating Chronic&#xD;
      Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). Effectiveness is assessed by achievement of best response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venetoclax is an approved drug developed for the treatment of CLL. Approximately 50 adult&#xD;
      participants with previously untreated CLL will be enrolled in approximately 10 to 15 sites&#xD;
      in Russian Federation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive oral venetoclax tablets in combination with intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      Obinutuzumab as prescribed by the physician prior to enrolling in this study in accordance to&#xD;
      the local practice and label.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be a higher burden for participants in this study compared to standard of care.&#xD;
      Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect&#xD;
      of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side&#xD;
      effects and completing questionnaires.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above.</description>
