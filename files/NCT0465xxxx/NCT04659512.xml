  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate prospectively the recurrence rate of active&#xD;
      macular neovascularization (MNV) and the visual outcome in patients with nAMD previously on a&#xD;
      Treat and Extend regimen where treatment has been discontinued due to disease stability.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All study subjects had nAMD and were treated at diagnosis with three monthly aflibercept&#xD;
      injections and then subsequently followed in a treat and extend regimen with extensions by&#xD;
      two weeks if no signs of disease activity were seen. Hemorrhage, intraretinal macular edema&#xD;
      or subretinal fluid were considered signs of disease activity. Patients reaching 12-week&#xD;
      intervals without any evidence of disease activity on three consecutive visits, a BCVA&#xD;
      between 35-88 letters (Snellen 20/200- 20/20) and a near vision of at least 24 points were&#xD;
      eligible for study inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there were signs of recurrent disease activity during the follow-up, study participation&#xD;
      was concluded at that point and intravitreal therapy was resumed. Between scheduled visits&#xD;
      patients were encouraged to monitor their vision at home using monocular visual assessments&#xD;
      and were advised to return earlier than planned if symptoms of visual deterioration or&#xD;
      metamorphopsia occurred. At baseline and at every follow-up visit all patients had a full&#xD;
      dilated ophthalmic examination. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) images were obtained by&#xD;
      using the Zeiss Cirrus OCT instrument (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc.,Dublin, Ca). A pigment&#xD;
      epithelial detachment (PED) was identified as an elevation of the RPE band and included both&#xD;
      serous and fibrovascular PED. Near vision was tested at 40cm with the addition of +3 dioptres&#xD;
      to the BCVA refraction. For near vision assessment we used the LIX adult A chart (Ortho-KM,&#xD;
      Lund, Sweden) graded in typographical points, the largest text being 24 points and the&#xD;
      smallest 4 points.&#xD;
