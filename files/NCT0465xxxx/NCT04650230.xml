    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference between&#xD;
      nasal continuous positive airway pressure / nasal positive pressure ventilation (NCPAP/NPPV)&#xD;
      and high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) devices when applied as a first non-invasive respiratory&#xD;
      support mode for severe bronchiolitis&#xD;

      The authors conducted a randomized controlled trial in the PICU of Children's hospital of&#xD;
      Tunis. Participants aged from 7 days to 6 months, were eligible if all inclusion criteria&#xD;
      were verified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On admission, demographic and clinical data were collected. When a participant met the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria, respiratory support was randomly allocated as high flow nasal cannula&#xD;
      (HFNC) or nasal continuous positive airway pressure / nasal positive pressure ventilation&#xD;
      (CPAP/NPPV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical parameters were monitored at treatment start and every 6 hours during the first 24&#xD;
      hours and then twice daily thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the HFNC group received heated and humidified gas flow with the Fisher &amp;&#xD;
      Paykel Healthcare HFNC system. The flow rate was usually started at the maximum flow rate for&#xD;
      the size of cannula and a constant flow temperature of 37 °C.The flow rate will be&#xD;
      progressively decreased when inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO2) was inferior to 30 percent&#xD;
      (%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the CPAP/NPPV group received for first CPAP using a neonatal ventilator. The&#xD;
      recommended starting pressure for CPAP was +6 centimeter of water (cmH2O). Positive&#xD;
      continuous pressure could be increased to a maximum of +8 cmH2O. Optimal positive end&#xD;
      expiratory pressure (PEEP) was what could maintain SpO2 at 94 per cent using the lowest&#xD;
      fraction of inspired oxygen. PEEP will be decreased progressively of 1cmH2O every 6 hours&#xD;
      from the optimal PEEP when FiO2 was inferior to 30% and there is no increased work of&#xD;
      breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If CPAP failed to improve clinical respiratory distress, infant was allocated to NPPV&#xD;
      strategy. Clinicians were not be authorized to change from CPAP to HFNC but if HFNC failed,&#xD;
      they had to change HFNC to CPAP/NPPV strategy ventilation before intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment failure criteria were urgent need to intubation or FiO2 superior to 60 % to&#xD;
      maintain SpO2 ≥ 90% or increased work of breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size (134 per group) was calculated on the basis of Type I error equal to 0,05, on&#xD;
      statistical power equal to 0.95 on failure rate among controls estimated at 30% and assuming&#xD;
      a minimum difference of failure rate to declare the superiority of intervention equal to 20%.&#xD;
      A dropout rate equal to 20% was used for this calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Comparison of proportions was performed using Fisher exact test, and&#xD;
      Student t test was used for comparison of means. For all analyses, significance level was&#xD;
      defined as p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel 365.&#xD;
