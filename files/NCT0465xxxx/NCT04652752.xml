    <textblock>
      This is an open, single arm, prospective clinical investigation to evaluate the performance&#xD;
      of CONNETTIVINA HI TECH, in terms of safety and efficacy in the management of superficial&#xD;
      cutaneous lesions. The study will be conducted in one center, in Italy and will enroll 50&#xD;
      subjects . Subjects will be followed until confirmation of complete wound closure, and for a&#xD;
      maximum of 26 days, with a follow up of 4 days after re-epithelization will be confirmed.&#xD;
