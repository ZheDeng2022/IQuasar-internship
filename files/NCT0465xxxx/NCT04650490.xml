      This trial is a randomized, 2-arm, phase II study to determine the effect, if any, of the&#xD;
      timing of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) relative to immune checkpoint inhibitor (IO)&#xD;
      therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread (metastasized) to&#xD;
      the brain.&#xD;
