    <textblock>
      This is retrospective study. The patients treated with oral propranolol at a dose of 2.0&#xD;
      mg/kg per day. Growth parameters (height and weight) were measured at the beginning, the end&#xD;
      of treatment and 2 years after treatment. The weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ), height-for-age&#xD;
      Z-score (HAZ) and weight-for-height Z-score (WHZ) calculated by the WHO Anthro software were&#xD;
      used to assess physical development, and the WHO Child Growth Standards were used as the&#xD;
      standards.&#xD;

        Overall, 52 males and 76 females, with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.46, were included in&#xD;
        this study. Of the 128 patients, 16 (12.5%) were born prematurely. The median age at the&#xD;
        start of propranolol therapy was 3.75 months (0.5-12.5 months). Propranolol was&#xD;
        administered for a median duration of 10.52 months (2-24 months).&#xD;
