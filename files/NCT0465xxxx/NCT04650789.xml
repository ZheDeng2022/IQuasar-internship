      Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To investigate the prevalence of Frailty in community older residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To explore the causes and risk factors of frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The survey is a Community-based, multicenter prospective cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
                1). 6,000 participants are expected to be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Through a questionnaire and physical examination form, carries on the investigation&#xD;
                to the more than 65 years old people during the 3-year follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The questionnaires include survey date, participant characteristics and related&#xD;
                risk factors, such as comprise demographic characteristics, Chinese ethnic&#xD;
                nationality, marital status, education level, family incomes, occupation, pregnancy&#xD;
                and parity history, menstrual history, frequency and amount of daily smoking and&#xD;
                alcohol drinking, frequency of urination and defecation, dietary habits, hours per&#xD;
                day of sleep and sun exposure. Medical history including medication use and disease&#xD;
                status for comorbidities, will be obtained from participants' medical records.&#xD;
                Syndrome differentiation of deficiency of the five zang-organs in TCM will be&#xD;
                analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Height and body weight will be measured for body mass index (BMI) calculation. The&#xD;
                waist circumference and hip circumference will be recorded, and the ratios&#xD;
                calculated. The muscle strengths of both hands will be measured with a hand&#xD;
                dynamometer. Each of these measures will be assessed twice and the average score&#xD;
                used in analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subjects will be asked to walk a distance of 4 meters and record the time at the&#xD;
                same time to measure the walking speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clock Drawing Test (CDT), physical frailty examination, Mini-Mental State&#xD;
                Examination (MMSE), Skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) will also be conducted or&#xD;
                calculated .&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Each participant will provide a total of 7 mL of venous blood after an overnight&#xD;
                fast (10-hour).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being collected, markers of frailty will be measured, such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6),&#xD;
      insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and estrogen (E). And blood routine, urine routine,&#xD;
      liver and kidney function, fasting plasma glucose, serum lipid will be detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physicians in each community as the backbone, Shanghai Geriatric Institute of Chinese&#xD;
           Medicine is responsible for personnel training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shanghai community health service centers are responsible for organization and&#xD;
           coordination.&#xD;
