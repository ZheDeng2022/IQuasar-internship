  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The exact function of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is one of the largest riddles in&#xD;
      cognitive neuroscience and a major challenge in mental health research. ACC dysfunction&#xD;
      contributes to a broad spectrum of neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as&#xD;
      depression, ADHD, Parkinson's disease, OCD and many others, but nobody knows what it actually&#xD;
      does. Recently a new theory has been developed about ACC function; the HRL-ACC (Hierarchical&#xD;
      Reinforcement Learning Theory of ACC). This theory proposes that the ACC selects and&#xD;
      motivates high-level tasks based on the principles of hierarchical reinforcement learning.&#xD;
      The ACC associates values with tasks (these values are based on the reward positivity&#xD;
      produced by the midbrain dopamine system), selects the correct tasks and applies control over&#xD;
      other neural networks (such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia), which&#xD;
      execute the tasks. The goal of this study is to investigate the consequences of ACC damage&#xD;
      (and other areas of the frontal lobe) on task regulation within a group of patients who have&#xD;
      suffered a stroke in the frontal lobe. Furthermore, the correlation between ACC damage and&#xD;
      mood disorders such as depression and apathy is going to be investigated.&#xD;

      This is a monocentric prospective interventional clinical trial that will include patients&#xD;
      with a stroke in the frontal lobe. Depending on the recruitment manner, participants will&#xD;
      undergo one or two sessions of cognitive experiments. The patients will be recruited in two&#xD;
      ways, through the Stroke unit and through the outpatient clinic:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If a patient with an acute stroke in the frontal lobe is admitted to the Stroke unit and&#xD;
           is eligible for this study, the patient will be asked if he is willing to participate.&#xD;
           After giving informed consent, the first session will take place once the patient has&#xD;
           been transferred to a regular neurological ward. After discharge, a second session will&#xD;
           take place 6 to 12 months later at the outpatient clinic, preferably combined with a&#xD;
           consultation (as part of the standard of care of stroke patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients who have had a stroke are followed at the outpatient clinic. Patients who are&#xD;
           eligible for this study, will be contacted by the treating stroke supervisor during&#xD;
           their consultation (either Prof. Veerle De Herdt or Dr. Dimitri Hemelsoet). If they are&#xD;
           willing to participate, the first session will take place either right after the&#xD;
           consultation at the outpatient clinic, or - if the patient is not available at that time&#xD;
           - a new appointment will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One experimental session consists of the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical neurological examination with determining of NIHSS score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First cognitive task: the coffee-tea task. During this task, a sequence of 7 images is&#xD;
           shown and each image contains three objects. The patient has to choose the right objects&#xD;
           to make either coffee or tea. At the end of each sequence they get feedback if they have&#xD;
           prepared the beverage correctly or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Short break with positioning of 21 EEG electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second task: the virtual T-maze task with video-EEG recording. During this task, a&#xD;
           virtual T-maze is shown and the patient has to choose at each junction whether they go&#xD;
           left or right. Depending on which direction they choose, they either get positive or&#xD;
           negative feedback. This task is known to elicit the reward positivity. During this task,&#xD;
           video-EEG will be recorded and this EEG-data will later on be analysed using ERP&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If second session, administering of questionnaires: Oxford Cognitive Screen, Becker&#xD;
           Depression Inventory, DEX apathy questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators are going to use voxel-based lesion symptom mapping to analyze&#xD;
      the relationship between tissue damage and behavioural problems and reward positivity&#xD;
      amplitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the coffee-tea task will be more difficult for patients with ACC damage&#xD;
      compared to patients with lesions in other areas of the frontal lobe. Also, the amplitude of&#xD;
      the ERP signals during the virtual T-maze task will be smaller in patients with ACC damage.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators expect to find a connection between ACC damage and mood&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
