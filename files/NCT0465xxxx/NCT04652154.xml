  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims to transition the approach used to care for children with complex conditions&#xD;
      and care pathways into a more holistic and coordinated model. The traditional model where&#xD;
      specialists independently treat single diseases, makes joint and coordinated decisions about&#xD;
      patients with multiple and unclear conditions difficult. In particular there is a gap between&#xD;
      mental and somatic services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preparation for re-designing the care model, several pre-studies are conducted, both a&#xD;
      register study and a collection of user reported experiences. Built on the results, we have&#xD;
      invented multi-disciplinary teams of complementary competences including paediatricians,&#xD;
      psychologists, and physiotherapists to meet the patient and family. The study includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To implement the new team intervention in a clinical case-control study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To scientifically evaluate the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To systematise lessons learned in regard to potential spread across systems and patient&#xD;
           groups Children 6-12 years together with family and professionals will constitute the&#xD;
           team. The assessment aims to clarify the patient's condition through shared decision&#xD;
           making and to develop a treatment plan for the child. It is a clinical randomised&#xD;
           controlled trial where TpT children will be compared to children following treatment as&#xD;
           usual. It includes a two years follow-up regarding a set of evaluation domains: provider&#xD;
           perspectives, user-centred experiences and outcomes, as well as health care outcomes.&#xD;

      200 children with multi-referrals will be invited and randomised to either intervention or&#xD;
      treatment as usual at their third or more referral to Haukeland university hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention group the child and family will meet a complementary team of&#xD;
      professionals for more than two hours aimimg to get a clarification of the patient's&#xD;
      condition and giving coping strategies for their condition. Outcome defined as better mental&#xD;
      health and quality of life as well as increased school attendence are some of the measures&#xD;
      being collected. THese outcomes will be compared to the control group after 12 and 24 mth.&#xD;
