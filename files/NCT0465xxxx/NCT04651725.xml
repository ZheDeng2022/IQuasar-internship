  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A mechanical horse-riding simulator (MHRS) is a robotic device with a dynamic saddle that&#xD;
      mimics the movement of a horse for purpose of hippotherapy. By simulating the rhythmic&#xD;
      movements of the horse MHRS aims to increase the patient's balance, flexibility and&#xD;
      adaptation and to provide postural adjustment. MHRS is supposed to produce walking patterns&#xD;
      of a horse in a three-dimensional aspect. Movements in rhythmic repetitions improve postural&#xD;
      coordination, allow to produce a reciprocal pattern. By simulating the rhythmic movements of&#xD;
      a horse, MHRS aims to increase the patient's balance, flexibility and adaptation and to&#xD;
      provide postural adjustment. This study aims to research the potential benefits of the&#xD;
      mechanical horseback riding simulator on the postural balance and symptoms of multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hippotherapy or therapeutic horseback riding therapy is a form of animal-assisted therapy&#xD;
      that uses the horse as a modality that aims to improve postural control, balance and&#xD;
      mobility. With hippotherapy, it is aimed to change the center of gravity by using the&#xD;
      movements of the horse and to ensure the adaptation of the trunk and pelvis by developing&#xD;
      righting and balance reactions against this new position. Current studies suggest that&#xD;
      hippotherapy may be a useful complementary treatment approach for improving balance, fatigue,&#xD;
      spasticity, walking and quality of life in MS patients. However, horseback riding therapy&#xD;
      itself has some limitations as a treatment due to costs, location and risks. By its nature&#xD;
      horse-riding is too dynamic for patients and requires a large outdoor space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective clinical study aims to show potential benefits of horse riding in people&#xD;
      with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) via a mechanical simulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primer outcomes of the study are postural balance and muscle strength. Sample size&#xD;
      calculation was performed and forty patients (inclusion and exclusion criteria will listed&#xD;
      separately) were planned to be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be allocated to the different treatment groups using the block&#xD;
      randomization method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in both groups will planned to complete exercise sessions 3 times a week for 12&#xD;
      weeks, each lasting 35 minutes per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the Group 1 (horse-riding simulator group), patients will will perform a horse riding&#xD;
      simulation exercise at speeds of 15km/h, 18km/h, 20km/h, 22km/h, 25km/h, each lasting 5&#xD;
      minutes after warm-up for 5 minutes in each session. Then they will rest for 5 minutes.For&#xD;
      the safety, a physiotherapist will be accompanied to the exercises for this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the Group 2 (home exercise group) patients will perform home exercises. Home exercises&#xD;
      will be consist of a warm-up, stretching, balance, back walking, fingertip walking exercises,&#xD;
      the first of which is shown by the physiatrist or physiotherapist to the patients. These&#xD;
      patients will be called twice a month to ask whether they have done the exercises, and the&#xD;
      patients whose participation rate is below 80% will be excluded from the study by following&#xD;
      the exercise schedule when they come to the physician's control monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be filled with My Multiple Sclerosis (MMMS) scale, Berg Balance Scale&#xD;
      (BBS), Timed Up and Go Test, before treatment and at the end of the 12th week. Quadriceps&#xD;
      muscle strength will be measured with the microFET®2 Dynamometer before treatment and at the&#xD;
      end of the 12th week.&#xD;

    <description>Disability associated with Multiple Sclerosis will be detected with The Expanded Disability Status Scale.&#xD;
The Expanded Disability Status Scale is a method of quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time. The scale ranges from 0 to 10 in 0.5 unit increments that represent higher levels of disability. Scoring is based on an examination by a physiatrist.</description>
