  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), are effective in treating many&#xD;
      different types of cancers. ICIs fight cancer by driving the immune system into an &quot;activated&#xD;
      state&quot; that makes it harder for tumor cells to hide and easier for the immune system to&#xD;
      destroy them. In doing this, oncologists risk &quot;over activation&quot; where immune cells can cause&#xD;
      side effects that could affect any part of the body. These are known as immune related&#xD;
      adverse events (irAEs). While irAEs are a known risk of ICIs, scientists and doctors do not&#xD;
      understand how they develop, who is more likely to get them, and what is the best way to&#xD;
      manage them while still getting the anti-tumor effects from ICIs. The aim of this project is&#xD;
      to build an infrastructure for researchers to collaborate in clinical, translational, and&#xD;
      basic science research focused on understanding and managing immune related adverse events&#xD;
      (irAEs). The investigators will collect research data and samples from patients who receive&#xD;
      ICI treatment, including when patients might experience immunotherapy side effects, to store&#xD;
      for use in future research studies.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumors evolve to evade the body's anti-tumor immune response by targeting cancer cells and&#xD;
      downregulating immune pathways. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) prevent this tumor&#xD;
      evasion by driving the immune system into an &quot;activated state&quot;, and upregulating the&#xD;
      patient's immune system to destroy tumor cells. While enhancing the immune system disrupts&#xD;
      tumor growth, in doing so oncologists risk &quot;over activation&quot; resulting in immune-mediated&#xD;
      toxicity known as immune related adverse events (irAEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      irAEs are an emerging disease entity, affecting many organ systems with diverse clinical&#xD;
      presentations similar to known autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus,&#xD;
      inflammatory arthritis, psoriasis, thyroiditis, inflammatory bowel disease, hepatitis,&#xD;
      pneumonitis, and myocarditis. The most common presentations of irAEs are dermatologic&#xD;
      (rashes), endocrine (hypo/hyper-active thyroid, hypophysitis, adrenal), and gastrointestinal&#xD;
      (colitis). However, any organ system can be affected resulting in a wide array of irAEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapy, especially ICIs, are being increasingly used in a wide variety of cancer&#xD;
      therapy and have been found to effectively treat many different types of cancers. ICIs are&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies targeting cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed&#xD;
      cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathways. CTLA-4 and&#xD;
      PD-1/PD-L1 are involved in deactivating T-cell and attenuating T-cell effector response,&#xD;
      respectively. These are already being used to treat a wide range of cancers with several&#xD;
      clinical trials currently underway examining response of additional cancer types to current&#xD;
      ICIs as well as for developing new ICI treatments. The investigators anticipate that there&#xD;
      will be additional immune checkpoint targets in the future given that some are already in&#xD;
      clinical trials and the high interest in cancer immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to collect, curate, and store data and specimens for future&#xD;
      studies presented in separate protocols. This patient registry will provide biological&#xD;
      specimens for biomarker analysis, immunophenotyping, genetic and microbiome analysis to&#xD;
      understand development of autoimmune conditions. Clinical data can be used for&#xD;
      epidemiological studies as well as clinical, functional, psychosocial and economic outcomes&#xD;
      research regarding impact of ICIs and irAEs on cancer patients. Moreover, this infrastructure&#xD;
      can inform the development of clinical algorithms and help determine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      medical interventions targeting cancer outcomes and irAEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OUTLINE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be involved in the study from the time of consent (before starting ICI therapy)&#xD;
      until 2 years after the end of ICI treatment. The investigators will collect clinical data&#xD;
      (including demographic information, medical history, cancer diagnosis and treatment,&#xD;
      management of adverse events, and outcomes), specimens (including blood, urine, stool,&#xD;
      biofluids and/or tissue samples), and questionnaires at multiple time points. All patient&#xD;
      data and samples will be linked by a de-identified study ID and will be stored indefinitely&#xD;
      until used or patient withdraw from the study in writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this project is to build an infrastructure that will provide resources&#xD;
      for researchers at UNC Chapel Hill and beyond to conduct multidisciplinary clinical,&#xD;
      translational, and basic research in elucidating pathways involved in cancer biology and&#xD;
      irAEs.&#xD;
