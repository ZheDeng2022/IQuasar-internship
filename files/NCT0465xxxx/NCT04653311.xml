    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of liver diseases characterized by&#xD;
      liver steatosis which can, in a minority of patients, progress to nonalcoholic&#xD;
      steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma and liver failure.&#xD;
      NASH is also recognized as an independent cardiovascular risk factor. Currently, weight loss&#xD;
      is the only validated treatment for NASH and also positively affect all the features of&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome. Considering the known positive metabolic effects of bariatric surgery,&#xD;
      efforts have been exerted to develop minimally endoscopic procedures aiming to induce weight&#xD;
      loss. Therefore, we would like to evaluate in patients with NASH disease and fibrosis, the&#xD;
      impact of an endoscopic sutured gastroplasty (with Endomina® device) on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mainly liver histological endpoints but also,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surrogate markers of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surrogate markers of insulin resistance as well as fasting lipid and glycemic profiles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and Rationale: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a chronic and progressive&#xD;
      disease which can evolve to advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure or liver cancer and&#xD;
      is associated to a higher risk of death related mainly to cardiovascular events. Weight loss&#xD;
      affects positively histological and metabolic features of NASH. Similarly, bariatric surgery&#xD;
      improves NASH and fibrosis in morbidly obese patients. New medical devices have been&#xD;
      developed to perform endoscopic sutured gastroplasty (ESG) in obese patients. Those affected&#xD;
      with coexisting NASH might constitute a good indication for such procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine whether ESG improves liver histology, defined as resolution of NASH&#xD;
      without worsening of fibrosis at 48 weeks (primary outcome) after ESG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design, setting and participants: The ENDONASH trial is an investigator-initiated,&#xD;
      randomized, controlled, European multicenter study with centrally blinded assessment of the&#xD;
      primary outcome. Biopsy proven NASH patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either ESG&#xD;
      associated to lifestyle intervention (LSI) or LSI alone using a computer-generated, centrally&#xD;
      administered allocation, stratified by diabetes status, gender and fibrosis stage. Main&#xD;
      inclusion criteria are: biopsy-proven NASH (i.e. Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Score ≥4),&#xD;
      fibrosis stage ≥1, BMI between 27-40, controlled type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: The study is powered to establish a 50% response rate of NASH&#xD;
      resolution without worsening of fibrosis in the ESG group and a 10% response rate in the&#xD;
      control group (according to our previous study1 and a study2 which has evaluated the impact&#xD;
      of weight loss on NASH). Accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 (bilateral), a beta risk of 0.2 and&#xD;
      a loss rate of 20%, a sample size of 100 patients is needed to achieve statistical&#xD;
      significance. Analysis will be carried out by intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all&#xD;
      patients who will undergo end-of treatment liver biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Eligible patients will be allocated to one arm of the study by means of an online&#xD;
      platform (ViedocTM). Demographics, anthropometric measurements, medical history, blood&#xD;
      samples and transient elastography will be performed at baseline and at different time points&#xD;
      after the randomization during the 48 weeks of follow-up. Finally, all patients will undergo&#xD;
      an end-of treatment liver biopsy 48 weeks after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: The expected conclusion will allow to demonstrate if ESG, as an add on to LSI,&#xD;
      may increases the number of patients with resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis at&#xD;
      one year.&#xD;
