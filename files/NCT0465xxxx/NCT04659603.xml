&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of SAR408701&#xD;

      The expected duration of study intervention for participants may vary, based on progression&#xD;
      date and the cohort; median expected duration of study per participant is estimated at 8&#xD;
      months for the mBC cohorts and 6 months for the mPAC cohort (up to 1 month for screening, a&#xD;
      median of 4 or 2 months for treatment in the mBC and mPAC cohorts respectively, a median of 1&#xD;
      month for EOT, and follow-up visit 90 days after the last IMP administration).&#xD;
