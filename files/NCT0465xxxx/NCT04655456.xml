    <textblock>
      Background: measuring the prevalence of malnutrition, frailty and sarcopenia in same group of&#xD;
      older adults is effective in understanding the relation between these conditions. This could&#xD;
      support diagnosing, treatment and prevention in future practice. The research is aiming to&#xD;
      measure the estimate prevalence of malnutrition, frailty, sarcopenia and their overlap in&#xD;
      older adults, using the UK Biobank. In addition, it will aim to compare the two models of&#xD;
      frailty the phenotype and deficit accumulation using the UK Biobank database, as data&#xD;
      comparing these models is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/design: This is a cross-sectional study design that will use the UK Biobank database,&#xD;
      which includes 381,000 participants males and females, aged 50 years and above, who completed&#xD;
      the UK Biobank baseline assessments were included that is a subset from the main sample size&#xD;
      from the UK Biobank. For baseline, details of participant's characteristics will be included.&#xD;
      All three conditions will be identified as malnutrition by using GLIM criteria, while frailty&#xD;
      by using two models; the first model will be the 36 deficits model and phenotype model.&#xD;
      Finally, sarcopenia condition will be judge according to EWGSOP standard. All these models&#xD;
      will be determining the feasibility to apply it using the available database in the UK&#xD;
      Biobank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: This proposed study will help in understanding the relation between malnutrition,&#xD;
      frailty and sarcopenia. As in worldwide, there is little published research on the overlap&#xD;
      between malnutrition, frailty and sarcopenia. Despite definitions and diagnostic criteria&#xD;
      were developed for these conditions. There is conflict extend to the definitions and&#xD;
      identification criteria's. This study will use UK Biobank database to measuring the estimate&#xD;
      prevalence in older people and determine the overlap between three conditions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The UK Biobank is a population-based study of a large prospective longitudinal cohort with&#xD;
      information on 500,000 people, who were aged 40-69 when recruited in 2006-2010 from England,&#xD;
      Scotland and Wales. The database includes demographic data, online questionnaires, X-rays and&#xD;
      scan image of (brain, heart, abdomen, bones and carotid artery), as well as urine and saliva&#xD;
      samples and blood biochemistry including: hormones and blood lipid. The online questionnaires&#xD;
      (about: diet, cognitive function, work history and digestive health). It aims to improve the&#xD;
      following: prevention, diagnosis and treatment for a broad number of diseases including&#xD;
      cancer, heart diseases, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, osteoporosis, eye disorders, depression&#xD;
      and forms of dementia. This detailed information on participants provide a resource for&#xD;
      investigators to conduct research related a particular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are four phases of assessment in UK Biobank. The first phase was the UK Biobank Pilot&#xD;
      assessment that included 3798 participants from Stockport only in 2006. Then, the second&#xD;
      phase was the initial assessment visit that started in 2007 until 2010. This was the baseline&#xD;
      assessment and included approximately 500000 participants. After that, the third phase was&#xD;
      conducted and called the first repeat assessment visit which took place between 2012-2013 and&#xD;
      included 20346 participants. Lastly, the imaging visit which is considered the fourth phase&#xD;
      started in 2014 until present.&#xD;

        Virtually all members of the general population are registered with a general practitioner&#xD;
        through the NHS. Subsequently, recruitment was through NHS and all people aged 40-69 were&#xD;
        eligible to participate. An invitation by mail was sent to those people who were living&#xD;
        within reasonable travelling distance from assessment centres of UK Biobank. Additional&#xD;
        information was collected prior sending an invitation; title, forename, gender, address,&#xD;
        date of birth, name and address of General Practitioner and NHS number.&#xD;
