  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 0/I exploratory study. Patients at first or second recurrence of glioblastoma&#xD;
      will be enrolled. The study will be divided into two cohorts: Cohort A (safety cohort) and&#xD;
      Cohort B (surgical patient cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A: Eligible patients will be sequentially enrolled to receive intravenous AB154&#xD;
      combined with AB122 (N=6). AB154 will be given at a dose of 10 mg/kg and AB122 will be given&#xD;
      at a dose of 240 mg (flat).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B: Expansion surgical cohort. The purpose of cohort B is to provide an additional&#xD;
      safety evaluation of AB154 + AB122 as well as tissue and blood for exploratory ancillary&#xD;
      studies investigating the effects of AB154 + AB122 in the tumor and tumor microenvironment. A&#xD;
      total of 40 patients will be enrolled in this cohort.&#xD;

      Cohort B (surgical patient cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A: Eligible patients will be sequentially enrolled to receive intravenous AB154&#xD;
      combined with AB122 (N=6). AB154 will be given at a dose of 10 mg/kg and AB122 will be given&#xD;

&#xD;
      Cohort B: Expansion surgical cohort. The purpose of cohort B is to provide an additional&#xD;
      safety evaluation of AB154 + AB122 as well as tissue and blood for exploratory ancillary&#xD;
      studies investigating the effects of AB154 + AB122 in the tumor and tumor microenvironment. A&#xD;
      total of 40 patients will be enrolled in this cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of cohort A, patients who are candidates for surgical resection for&#xD;
      management of tumor progression (i.e. need for diagnostic confirmation or tumor debulking)&#xD;
      will be enrolled prior to surgical resection, and initiate study treatment approximately two&#xD;
      weeks prior to the resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to one of the four treatment arms and initiate treatment prior to&#xD;
      surgery, according to treatment assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-surgical dose (neoadjuvant treatment) will be double-blinded. A total of 10 patients&#xD;
      will be allocated to each one of the following groups in a blinded fashion, approximately two&#xD;
      weeks before surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B1 (N=10): AB154 single agent (10 mg/kg) + placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B2 (N=10): AB122 single agent (240 mg) + placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B3 (N=10): AB154 (10 mg/kg) +AB122 (240 mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B4 (N=10): Two placebo infusions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following surgery, all patients (N=40) will initiate treatment with the combination of AB154&#xD;
      and AB122.&#xD;

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;

             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Unable to undergo MRI of the brain with and without contrast enhancement (i.e.&#xD;
             pacemaker, allergy to MRI contrast agent or any other contraindication for MRIs).&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:&#xD;
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live&#xD;
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
