      Phase 1b, multi-center, open label, sequential dose escalation trial assessing 3 dose cohorts&#xD;
      using a 3+3 design to evaluate safety and tolerability of Allocetra-OTS in adult patients&#xD;
      with moderate COVID-19. The sample size for this trial is anticipated to range from 9 to 18&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential patients, who will be identified as suffering from moderate COVID-19 (as set forth&#xD;
      in the FDA guidance for industry dated May 2020) will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patient has signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF), and after confirmation that the&#xD;
      patient meets all eligibility criteria, the patient will be enrolled to the relevant dose&#xD;
      group according to the following sequential design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single Intravenous (IV) dose of Allocetra-OTS with 5x10^9 cells, Single Intravenous (IV) dose&#xD;
      of Allocetra-OTS with 10x10^9 cells, Two IV doses of Allocetra-OTS with10x10^9 cells each&#xD;
      dose (separated by 72 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each dose cohort will consist of 3 and up to 6 patients. In each dose cohort, starting with&#xD;
      dose cohort 1, a single patient will be enrolled and dosed. If no dose limiting toxicity&#xD;
      (DLT) is observed after at least 1 week and following review of relevant safety data of the&#xD;
      first patient in that cohort by the DMC, 2 additional patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If no DLT is seen in the initial 3 dosed patients within a certain cohort and following DMC&#xD;
      review, the first patient in the next dose cohort can be enrolled, repeating the same&#xD;
      sequence of enrollment as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If 1 DLT is seen in the initial 3 dosed patients within a certain cohort, the cohort will be&#xD;
      expanded to a total of 6 patients. If &gt;2/6 patients experience a DLT, the MTD will be&#xD;
      reached. If no more than 1 patient out of 6 experiences a DLT, the next sequence of&#xD;
      enrollment will be continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DMC will review and assess safety data at the predefined timepoints to recommend on cohort&#xD;
      expansion or cohort escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Product (IP) administration will occur on Day 1 within 12±4 hours from the&#xD;
      time of eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following IP administration (Day 1), patients will be followed for safety and efficacy&#xD;
      assessments through 6 months.&#xD;
