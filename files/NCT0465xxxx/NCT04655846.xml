  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 40% of children under six months are breastfed. However, in adolescent mothers there&#xD;
      are greater barriers to making the decision to breastfeed. Counseling on breastfeeding could&#xD;
      be a helpful intervention in sustaining this practice. This is a single-blind randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial type study, with a control group that will receive routine care, and an&#xD;
      intervention group that will additionally receive &quot;Counseling: breastfeeding&quot; through a&#xD;
      maternity preparation course, both conducted by trained nurses. 59 pregnant women will be&#xD;
      included in each group that attend the prenatal control program, for a total of 118 users.&#xD;
      The level of knowledge about breastfeeding, the rate of cessation of breastfeeding and the&#xD;
      rate of cessation will be evaluated in three measurements during follow-up.&#xD;

      Introduction: The World Health Organization establishes that only 38% of children under six&#xD;
      months of age in the developing world are exclusively breastfed and only 39% of children&#xD;
      between 20 and 23 months they benefit from this practice. This problem is more evident in&#xD;
      adolescent mothers, in whom the social, family and cultural influence, their level of&#xD;
      knowledge, and the quality of health care services are decisive in the decision to give&#xD;
      breast milk to their babies or not. sons. In this sense, nursing must design and implement&#xD;
      educational intervention strategies for the promotion, protection and support of exclusive&#xD;
      breastfeeding in the first six months of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine the efficacy of an educational intervention in first pregnant&#xD;
      adolescents for the maintenance of exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: experimental study type randomized controlled clinical trial with first-pregnant&#xD;
      adolescents assigned to an intervention group and a control group. The sample will be made up&#xD;
      of a total of 118 first-pregnant women, 59 first-pregnant women in each study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervened group, in addition to receiving the usual prenatal care education, will&#xD;
      receive an educational intervention of counseling on breastfeeding. The control group, in&#xD;
      addition to the usual information on prenatal care, will receive an educational intervention&#xD;
      related to infant care activities. The educational intervention will take place in 4 weekly&#xD;
      sessions. Likewise, the intervention and control group will be given the final assessment of&#xD;
      knowledge once the fourth educational intervention is finished and at 6 months postpartum. In&#xD;
      addition, the maintenance of exclusive breastfeeding will be verified in the intervention and&#xD;
      control group through home visits at two, four and six months postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: It will be carried out by blocks in groups of equal size, randomized 1: 1. The&#xD;
      generation will be given by one of the researchers who will not perform the intervention, nor&#xD;
      the initial or final evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: it is expected to increase the level of knowledge and a lower rate of&#xD;
      abandonment of breastfeeding in the group of first pregnant adolescents operated on.&#xD;
