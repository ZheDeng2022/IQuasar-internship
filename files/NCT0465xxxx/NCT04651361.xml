      Laparoscopic gastric sleeve and bypass surgeries the most common bariatric procedures for&#xD;
      weight loss and improved management of metabolic syndromes. Patients may suffer from wound&#xD;
      pain or referred pain after laparoscopic bariatric operation. Most importantly, 11.8% of&#xD;
      these patients complained surgical-related pain one year after operation, and 8% of them&#xD;
      required prolonged use of opioid to control chronic postoperative pain (CPSP). However, there&#xD;
      are currently lack of clinical practice guidelines or recommendations for prevention of CPSP&#xD;
      after laparoscopic abdominal surgery. Although regional block techniques (i.e. truncal block&#xD;
      or intrathecal opioid) are considered as effective supplementary analgesic approaches to&#xD;
      improve postoperative pain control, parenteral administration of analgesics remain as the&#xD;
      mainstay for pain management of laparoscopic abdominal surgery. Naldebain® is prodrug of&#xD;
      nalbuphine, which was approved by the Taiwan FDA in 2017. Naldebain® is an extended-release&#xD;
      dinalbuphine sebacate, and is rapidly hydrolyzed by tissue of plasma esterase to release&#xD;
      nalbuphine. A number of clinical studies have shown that single-dose of pre-operative&#xD;
      intramuscular administration of Naldebain® provides significantly higher analgesic effect up&#xD;
      to 1 week in hemorrhoidectomy and laparotomy surgery with a well-tolerated safety profile.&#xD;
      Therefore, this PI-initiated randomized, double-blind, placebo-control trial aims to&#xD;
      investigate the clinical efficacy of Naldebain® in management of acute postoperative pain in&#xD;
      patients receiving laparoscopic gastric sleeve or bypass surgery, and prevention of the&#xD;
      development of CPSP after surgery. This study will also analyze the plasma levels of&#xD;
      nalbuphine following a single intramuscular injection in obese patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical studies indicate that more than 80% of patients suffer from surgical-related pain in&#xD;
      the first few days after major laparotomy or laparoscopic abdominal surgery and about 10% of&#xD;
      these patients may develop chronic postoperative pain (CPSP), which can last up to several&#xD;
      years after surgery. One of the major risk factors for developing CPSP is inadequate&#xD;
      management of the acute postoperative pain. Laparoscopic gastric sleeve and bypass surgeries&#xD;
      the most common bariatric procedures for weight loss and improved management of metabolic&#xD;
      syndromes. Patients may suffer from wound pain or referred pain after laparoscopic bariatric&#xD;
      operation. Most importantly, 11.8% of these patients complained surgical-related pain one&#xD;
      year after operation, and 8% of them required prolonged use of opioid to control CPSP.&#xD;
      However, there are currently lack of clinical practice guidelines or recommendations for&#xD;
      prevention of CPSP after laparoscopic abdominal surgery. Although regional block techniques&#xD;
      (i.e. truncal block or intrathecal opioid) are considered as effective supplementary&#xD;
      analgesic approaches to improve postoperative pain control, parenteral administration of&#xD;
      analgesics remain as the mainstay for pain management of laparoscopic abdominal surgery.&#xD;
      Nalbuphine is a semi-synthetic opioid that acts as a mixed kappa opioid agonist and mu opioid&#xD;
      antagonist, but its clinical applications in relieving acute postoperative pain is limited by&#xD;
      the relatively short duration of action of 3-6h. Naldebain® is prodrug of nalbuphine, which&#xD;
      was approved by the Taiwan FDA in 2017. Naldebain® is an extended-release dinalbuphine&#xD;
      sebacate, and is rapidly hydrolyzed by tissue of plasma esterase to release nalbuphine. A&#xD;
      number of clinical studies have shown that single-dose of pre-operative intramuscular&#xD;
      administration of Naldebain® provides significantly higher analgesic effect up to 1 week in&#xD;
      hemorrhoidectomy and laparotomy surgery with a well-tolerated safety profile. Naldebain® has&#xD;
      not been tested in laparoscopic bariatric surgery and its pharmacokinetic profiles in&#xD;
      overweight patients are undetermined. Therefore, this PI-initiated randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-control trial aims to investigate the clinical efficacy of Naldebain® in management&#xD;
      of acute postoperative pain in patients receiving laparoscopic gastric sleeve or bypass&#xD;
      surgery, and prevention of the development of CPSP after surgery. This study will also&#xD;
      analyze the plasma levels of nalbuphine following a single intramuscular injection in obese&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
