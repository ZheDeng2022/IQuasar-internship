  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, single arm, single center study designed to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of radiofrequency ablation combined with PD-1 monoclonal antibody in patients&#xD;
      with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC), with the secondary study objective to preliminarily&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation combined with PD-1 monoclonal antibody in&#xD;
      patients with HCC and the exploratory study objective to evaluate the effect of ablation&#xD;
      combined with PD-1 monoclonal antibody on immune function and hepatitis virus infection&#xD;
      status in patients with HCC. This study will be divided into two stages, and the first stage&#xD;
      is to enroll 6 patients for dose-limited toxicity (DLT) observation. If DLT appeared in &lt; 2&#xD;
      patients, the second stage was entered and the other 24 patients were further enrolled.&#xD;
