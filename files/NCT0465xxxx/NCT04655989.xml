      The study objective is to verify the safety and effectiveness of the DBB-EXA ES Hemodialysis&#xD;
      Delivery System to consistently deliver dialysate of the appropriate quality for infusion.&#xD;
      The safety will be evaluated by comparing the adverse event rate in the DBB-EXA ES&#xD;
      Hemodialysis group (investigational) vs. the standard dialysis group (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include eligible adult patients diagnosed with chronic renal&#xD;
      failure requiring routine dialysis treatments for a minimum of 90 days and with a minimum of&#xD;
      3 weekly sessions. Treatment duration will be at the discretion of the investigator. The&#xD;
      duration of study participation for each subject is approximately eight (8) weeks; four (4)&#xD;
      weeks of routine dialysis and four (4) weeks of treatment dialysis. The expected total study&#xD;
      duration across all subjects (from recruitment to last subject visits) is approximately five&#xD;
      (5) to six (6) months, dependent upon subject recruitment/enrollment and meeting 360&#xD;
      evaluable treatments. A minimum of 30 eligible subjects will be enrolled into the study&#xD;
      ensuring a minimum of 360 evaluable treatments in the treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sub-study, VARRM, was conducted following the subject's completion of the primary eight&#xD;
      (8) week clinical study. The total participation time for the VARRM sub-study was&#xD;
      approximately 1.5 weeks. Subjects that participated in the VARRM sub-study had their vascular&#xD;
      recirculation rates collected during treatments. A minimum of 12 subjects were expected to&#xD;
      participate in this sub-study, with a minimum of 21 and maximum of 36 dialysis accesses&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
