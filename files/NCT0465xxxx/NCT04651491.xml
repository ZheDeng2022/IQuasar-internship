    <textblock>
      This study examined the etiology of acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI) during the&#xD;
      2015-2016 season, evaluated the statistics of the incidence of influenza and ARVI in this&#xD;
      period (epidemiology: severity of the disease and bacterial exacerbations; demographics of&#xD;
      patients; duration and timing of treatment; safety; quality of treatment), and evaluated the&#xD;
      effectiveness of complex therapy with an emphasis on the using of interferon inducers in&#xD;
      hospitalized children aged 3 to 11 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This non-interventional observational study included 80 patients aged 3 to 11 years who were&#xD;
      hospitalized with influenza and acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI) symptoms at any&#xD;
      time from the onset of the disease (up to 15 days) and who were prescribed the interferon&#xD;
      inducer Kagocel as an antiviral medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of influenza and ARVI was confirmed in accordance with the world health&#xD;
      organization (who) guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of pandemic influenza A&#xD;
      (H1N1) 2009 and other influenza viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient examinations are conducted in accordance with local routine clinical practice and&#xD;
      local and international standards of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of treatment, the following data were collected and analyzed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  demography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  disease severity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anamnesis data (data of influenza vaccination in the current season; pre-school&#xD;
           facilities visits; previous contacts with a patient with influenza / ARVI; previous&#xD;
           antiviral therapy for the current episode of the disease; concomitant diseases)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body temperature (morning/evening)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  chills and fever (cumulative score based on all symptoms: 0-no symptoms, 1-mild,&#xD;
           2-moderate, 3-severe)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intoxication symptom (cumulative score based on all symptoms: 0-no symptoms, 1-mild,&#xD;
           2-moderate, 3-severe)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  catarrhal symptoms (cumulative score based on all symptoms: 0 - no symptoms, 1-mild,&#xD;
           2-moderate, 3-severe)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  timelines: the beginning of the disease, the first visit to the doctor, the beginning of&#xD;
           treatment, the duration of the disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determination the causative agent by PCR (on presentation of patients and their&#xD;
           discharge on 5-6 days from start of therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  antiviral therapy (Kagocel dose depending on age)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  symptomatic treatment of the current episode of influenza or ARVI before and during the&#xD;
           patient's hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bacterial exacerbations (Yes/no)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  treatment of bacterial exacerbations (drug name)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  adverse events&#xD;
