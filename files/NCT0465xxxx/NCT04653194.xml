  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The administration of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) to HIV-infected patients has&#xD;
      been associated with a dramatic reduction in AIDS-related morbidity and mortality. Time to&#xD;
      cART start is currently approximately 2-4 weeks after diagnosis, mostly deferred for reasons&#xD;
      of waiting for baseline blood test results; in particular HIV genotype, CD4 count, OI screen&#xD;
      and logistics of a consultant clinical review. Whilst there is a clear rationale for this&#xD;
      delay there is a risk of loss to follow-up as well as the potential risk of onward viral&#xD;
      transmission. The balance between &quot;readiness&quot; to start ART against pragmatic and practical&#xD;
      safe initiation of treatment needs to be tested using currently available safe potent&#xD;
      antiretroviral agents in a head-to-head comparison study to allow careful rigorous&#xD;
      comparisons of outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit 36 newly diagnosed HIV patients to be started on treatment&#xD;
      immediately upon diagnosis. This would optimally be within 7 days, for eligibility to the&#xD;
      study up to 14 days will be permissible. Patients will be randomised to one of two open-label&#xD;
      combination therapies known to be highly effective; Biktarvy or Symtuza. The patients will&#xD;
      receive study treatment for 48 weeks. The two therapies will be compared by the change in HIV&#xD;
      viral load from start of treatment to 12 weeks. Further clinical data will be recorded for&#xD;
      the trial patients and exploratory investigations undertaken. As those recruited to the trial&#xD;
      may not be representative of the full cohort of newly diagnosed HIV patients there will also&#xD;
      be data collected on all newly diagnosed patients in a given period. This data will&#xD;
      contribute to conclusions on the benefits and issues of implementing test and treat.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be an open-label two arm clinical trial with participants randomised to Biktarvy&#xD;
      or Symtuza with equal probability. Study treatment will last for 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline - Following confirmatory HIV testing potential participants will have a appointment&#xD;
      with a study doctor. Full medical check and medical history undertaken. Patients will be&#xD;
      offered opportunity to participate in the study. To avoid unnecessary visits and in line with&#xD;
      the study aim of getting patients on treatment rapidly patients can consent on the same day&#xD;
      that HIV diagnosis is confirmed to them. Treatment to be initiated following appointment in&#xD;
      line with test and treat procedure. Samples will be taken (if not available from previous&#xD;
      days) for all initial required tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given baseline questionnaires that they can return on week 2 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1 call - Call to check drug adherence, adverse events and patient wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 2 visit - Appointment with study doctor to review all results from initial tests.&#xD;
      Following undertaken: viral load; vital signs; adverse events; adherence assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 4, 12, 24, 48 Follow-up visits - Full medical review undertaken at each visit including&#xD;
      safety blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following undertaken: viral load; adverse events; adherence assessment; questionnaires;&#xD;
      samples taken for secondary and exploratory objectives. Week 48 visit will be the end of&#xD;
      study treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visit - up to 30 days after the week 48 visit there will be a follow-up visit to&#xD;
      complete final medical assessment and final adverse events reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be collected from participants further to those required for stated objectives&#xD;
      to be retained for future research into HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also collect and clinical data cohort of data on all patients newly diagnosed with&#xD;
      HIV during a set window.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be collected from their first year after diagnosis.&#xD;
