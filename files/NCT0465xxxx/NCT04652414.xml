  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, blinded, placebo-controlled pilot RCT evaluating corticosteroids for&#xD;
      the treatment of Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) that will enroll 100 adults hospitalized&#xD;
      with community-acquired pneumonia. The primary goal is to assess the feasibility of proposed&#xD;
      trial procedures for use in a subsequent phase III trial powered on 6-month cognitive outcome&#xD;
      (MOCA-Blind score). Key outcomes are six-month cognitive and functional status, duration and&#xD;
      severity of symptoms, and mortality.&#xD;
