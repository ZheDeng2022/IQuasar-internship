      Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of adaptive swiss ball&#xD;
      seating as an alternative for standard chair seating on hand function in children with&#xD;
      hemiparesis. Subjects: A total of 30 spastic hemiparetic cerebral palsied children (19 boys&#xD;
      and 11 girls), aged 3-6 years participated in this study. They were randomly assigned into&#xD;
      control and study groups of equal numbers each consisted of fifteen children (n=15). Methods:&#xD;
      Peabody Developmental Motor Scales 2 (PDMS-2) was used to evaluate each child individually&#xD;
      before and after three successive months of treatment (3 sessions per week), to assess 2&#xD;
      subtests (the grasping skills and visual motor integration skills) for all children of both&#xD;
      groups. Control group who received a specially selected physical therapy program for hand&#xD;
      function on a standard chair seating. Study group who received the same selected program for&#xD;
      hand function on adaptive swiss ball seating.&#xD;

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of adaptive swiss ball seating as an&#xD;
      alternative for standard chair seating on hand function in children with hemiparesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, a total of 30 spastic hemiparetic cerebral palsied children (19 boys and 11&#xD;
      girls) aged 3-6 years, they were selected from general hospitals and private centers in kafr&#xD;
      El-Sheikh government, randomly assigned to either the control group (n=15), who received a&#xD;
      specially selected physical therapy program for hand function on standard chair seating, or&#xD;
      the study group (n=15), who received the same selected program for hand function but on&#xD;
      adaptive Swiss ball seating. Both groups received 3 sessions per week for 3 successive&#xD;
      months. Peabody Developmental Motor Scales 2 (PDMS-2) was used to evaluate each child&#xD;
      individually before and after three successive months of treatment, to assess 2 subtests&#xD;
      (grasping skills and visual motor integration skills).&#xD;
