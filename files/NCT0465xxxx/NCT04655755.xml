    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of venetoclax in combination&#xD;
      with cedazuridine and decitabine (ASTX727) in treating patients with high risk&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia who have not received prior&#xD;
      treatment (treatment-naive). Chemotherapy drugs, such as venetoclax, cedazuridine, and&#xD;
      decitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability (phase 1) and overall response rate (ORR) (phase&#xD;
      2) of venetoclax in combination with ASTX727 in patients with treatment-naive high-risk&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) with bone marrow&#xD;
      excess blasts &gt; 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Rate of complete remission (CR). II. Rate of marrow/morphologic complete remission (mCR).&#xD;
      III. Rate of hematologic improvement (HI; erythroid/platelet/neutrophil responses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Rate of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence. V. Rate of platelet (PLT)&#xD;
      transfusion independence. VI. Rate of cytogenetic response. VII. Rate of bone marrow blast&#xD;
      response. VIII. Time to transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). IX. Duration of&#xD;
      response (DOR). X. Overall survival (OS). XI. Progression-free survival (PFS). XII.&#xD;
      Disease-free survival (DFS). XIII. Time to next MDS treatment (TTNT). XIV. Event-free&#xD;
      survival (EFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the effects of therapy on MDS and to identify biological markers of&#xD;
      response to venetoclax and/or its combination with ASTX727.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of venetoclax, followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14. Patients also receive&#xD;
      ASTX727 PO QD on days 1-5. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
