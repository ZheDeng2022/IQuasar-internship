  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the known benefits of geriatric care models among hospitalized older adults outside&#xD;
      the intensive care unit (ICU), few studies have addressed the needs of older adults in the&#xD;
      ICU; for example, sensory impairment, functional decline, and de-prescribing of potentially&#xD;
      inappropriate medications (PIMs) are rarely addressed in routine ICU practice. This pilot&#xD;
      study will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and barriers to implementation of a&#xD;
      geriatrics bundle (occupational therapy, assessment and treatment of hearing impairment, and&#xD;
      de-prescribing PIMs) in the ICU.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of bundle delivery</measure>
    <time_frame>From ICU admission to hospital discharge, up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility of bundle delivery will be measured by review of electronic medical record (EMR) documentation of each bundle component and a daily-check in with the patient and team. We will determine the proportion of eligible patients receiving each component as well as delivery of the overall bundle. A feasibility threshold of 70% will be used for the individual bundle components, as well as the combined bundle.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of bundle delivery</measure>
    <time_frame>From ICU admission to hospital discharge, up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability of the bundle among providers delivering the interventions will be assessed with a survey using a 5-point Likert scale (range 1-5, where 5 indicates that the bundle is completely acceptable for use in its current form).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Barriers (and facilitators) to bundle implementation</measure>
    <time_frame>From ICU admission to hospital discharge, up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Barriers and facilitators to bundle implementation will be assessed using qualitative methods.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Delirium</measure>
    <time_frame>From ICU admission to hospital discharge, up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Incident delirium and days of delirium will be determined by review of the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) charting in the electronic medical record.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mobility level</measure>
    <time_frame>From ICU admission to hospital discharge, up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Data about mobility level during hospitalization will be gathered from the physical therapy and occupational therapy flowsheets.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>From ICU admission to hospital discharge, up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Manual muscle testing via the 6-point MRC system: Strength in each of 12 muscle groups is assessed via a 6-point system, in which a score of 0=no contraction, 1=flicker of a contraction, 2=active movement with gravity eliminated, 3=active movement against gravity, 4=active movement against gravity and resistance, 5= normal power.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>30-day functional outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days after hospital discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked whether they were independently able to complete a series of functional activities, including activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), and mobility activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>30-day hospital readmissions</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days after hospital discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked if they were readmitted to a hospital within 30 days of hospital. The electronic medical record will also be reviewed for readmissions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Use and perceived benefit of amplifying device after hospital discharge</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days after hospital discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked whether they are still using the portable amplifying device after hospital discharge and whether they perceive benefit from its use.</description>
