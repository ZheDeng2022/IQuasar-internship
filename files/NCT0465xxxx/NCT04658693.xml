  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to apply implanted electrical stimulation to the residual nerves in Veterans&#xD;
      who have lost lower limbs due to diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The goal would be to provide&#xD;
      sensation to the missing limb to improve standing, walking and balance, and improve the&#xD;
      health of the residual limb.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to enhance the mobility and daily function of Veterans who have&#xD;
      lost a lower limb due to diabetic peripheral neuropathy by providing feedback of foot-floor&#xD;
      interactions via a Sensory Neuroprosthesis employing neural stimulation. In parallel, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to assess the potential of this intervention to impact reports of phantom&#xD;
      pain and improve the health and viability of the tissue of the residual limb in all&#xD;
      recipients of the system regardless of the etiology of their limb loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrodes are surgically implanted on one to four nerves of the residual limb. An external&#xD;
      stimulation device will send pulses to the electrodes. The participant will be asked what&#xD;
      they feel, and to draw the location of any perceived sensation on schematic maps. A&#xD;
      sensorized prosthesis will be worn and stimulation will be administered while the participant&#xD;
      is engaging in various functional tasks, such as standing, walking or climbing stairs or with&#xD;
      visual or mental distractions. The investigators will apply standard subjective pain&#xD;
      inventories and objective physiological measures of tissue health (e.g., temperature or&#xD;
      oxygen perfusion) to document systemic changes related to context-appropriate electrically&#xD;
      induced sensory input.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The project will take the form of a series of controlled single-subject feasibility and proof-of-concept studies with repeated measures. Subjects will act as their own concurrent controls with and without sensory stimulation, as well as their own longitudinal (historical) controls pre- and post-implementation of the Sensory Neuroprosthesis.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Functional Gait Assessment (FGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post implant</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Gait Assessment is a 10 task test that measures postural stability. Each task is scored from 0 -3 with 0 indicating severe impairment in the task and 3 indicating normal ambulation. The scores are combined to give a total score. The maximum score is 30. A higher score indicates a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropathic Pain Syndrome Inventory (NPSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years post implant</time_frame>
    <description>The NPSI is comprised of five subscales, each representing different dimensions of neuropathic pain: burning spontaneous pain (burning), pressing spontaneous pain (pressing), paroxysmal pain (paroxysmal), evoked pain (evoked), and paresthesia/dysesthesia Each area subscale is scored between 0-10. The scores are not combined, but are able to report on different aspects of neuropathic pain. A higher score indicates a worse outcome.</description>
