    <textblock>
      The goal of the parent R01 study has been to determine how beliefs about chronic illness and&#xD;
      their treatments affect SMB in the context of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)&#xD;
      with comorbid hypertension (HTN) and or diabetes (DM). The educational counseling modules the&#xD;
      study team plans to pilot test are rooted in the Self-Regulation Model (SRM), a theory of&#xD;
      health behaviors that has been used to develop interventions, but has only been applied to&#xD;
      research on behaviors around single diseases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Outcomes for patients with multimorbidity (MM) are often poor, in part because of low&#xD;
      adherence to self-management behaviors (SMB). Research has identified key determinants of SMB&#xD;
      for individual diseases and shown the powerful influence that illness representations and&#xD;
      medication beliefs have on these behaviors. Yet, little is known about the impact of illness&#xD;
      representations in the context of MM where beliefs about one illness and its treatments may&#xD;
      be at odds, or symbiotic, with those for comorbidities. Without this knowledge, ability to&#xD;
      provide optimal self-management support for MM patients is limited. The Pilot will be&#xD;
      focusing on three mayor components with the hopes to provide optimal self-management support&#xD;
      for MM patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Beliefs about Multi-Morbidity The Care Coach will discuss the participant's individual&#xD;
      disease &amp; self-management-related beliefs. This discussion will be guided by a&#xD;
      semi-structured questionnaire covering domains from Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire&#xD;
      (BIPQ) and the Beliefs about Medication Questionnaire (BMQ) for each pertinent&#xD;
      multi-morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For example, the Care Coach will ask: &quot;How long do you believe that your COPD will continue?&quot;&#xD;
      &quot;And how about your hypertension, how long will it continue?&quot; The Care Coach will note the&#xD;
      participants' responses to each question, and mark which beliefs seem to be potentially&#xD;
      counterproductive to self-management (e.g. very concerned about taking DM medications&#xD;
      long-term). These beliefs will be used to focus the intervention session section on cognitive&#xD;
      restructuring. Beliefs will be addressed using a Cognitive restructuring approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Emotional Response Next, the Care Coach will ask the participant about the role of&#xD;
      emotional responses and mental state in their disease management. This will consist of 1-2&#xD;
      semi-structured questions about symptoms of anxiety and depression, as well as the emotional&#xD;
      impact of each comorbidity in the participant's life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For example: &quot;Does your COPD affect you emotionally? [If yes] In what ways?&quot; The Care Coach&#xD;
      will take notes on the participants' self-reported emotional response to their comorbidities,&#xD;
      as well as any observed indications of distress/emotional reaction to their illnesses. This&#xD;
      information, combined with the participants' data from the 15-month DISH interview&#xD;
      (Diagnostic Interview and Structured Hamilton assessment tool), will be used to determine the&#xD;
      focus of the emotional response portion of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Self-Management Behaviors (SMB) Finally, the Care Coach will discuss patient's&#xD;
      self-management behaviors for their comorbidities. He/she will ask the patient to explain how&#xD;
      he/she manages each condition, and any challenges he/she faces in self-management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For example: &quot;Can you describe to me how you manage your COPD? How about your hypertension?&quot;&#xD;
      The Care Coach will use the participant's responses, combined with self-reported and&#xD;
      objective medication adherence from the observational study, to determine the focus of the&#xD;
      SMB portion of 2nd session.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A nine-item scale designed to rapidly assess the cognitive and emotional representations of illness. Full scale range 0 to 10. A higher score reflects a more threatening view of the illness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ scores)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BMQ assess beliefs about medications. The BMQ has two components: beliefs about overuse (score range from 3-15) and perceived risk of medicines (score range from 5-25), total scale 8-40, higher score indicates stronger beliefs in the concepts of the scale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS) to assess asthma, diabetes, hypertension beliefs about asthma, diabetes and hypertension medication adherence. MARS is a 10-item self-reported instrument. Total scores range from 0 (low likelihood of medication adherence) to 10 (high likelihood), with higher score indicating higher likelihood of medication adherence.</description>

    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of the questionnaires is to provide common instruments that can be used to obtain internationally comparable data on health-related physical activity. The IPAQ results can be reported in categories (low activity levels, moderate activity levels or high activity levels) or as a continuous variable (MET minutes a week). MET minutes represent the amount of energy expended carrying out physical activity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Illness Perceptions Questionnaire (IPQ scores)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Multi-factorial pencil-and-paper questionnaire which assesses the five cognitive illness representations on a five-point Likert scale. A revised version of this scale, the Illness Perception Questionnaire- Revised (IPQ-R), extended the original scale by adding more items, splitting the control dimension into personal control and treatment control, and incorporating a cyclical timeline dimension, an overall comprehension of illness factor, and an emotional representation. The IPQ is an 80-item instrument, total scale from 0-10, with higher score indicating higher perception of effects on illness.</description>
