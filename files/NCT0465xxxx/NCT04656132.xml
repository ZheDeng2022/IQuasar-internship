      Brief Summary This is a pilot study implemented physical activity assessment, promotion and&#xD;
      monitoring in patients. Patients will be assessed by the physical activity vital sign (PAVS)&#xD;
      during check-in for their appointment. During their visit with the cardiologist, a clinical&#xD;
      decision support tool will alert the cardiologist to patients achieving low (&lt;50% of&#xD;
      recommended) physical activity. The cardiologist may refer the patient to cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation if appropriate and/or counsel them to increase their physical activity levels.&#xD;
      The patients may opt to enroll in the monitoring phase of the study. They will be given a&#xD;
      Fitbit pedometer and their Fitbit account can sync to their MyChart account. After that sync,&#xD;
      the patients step counts will be available for their cardiologists to review as needed.&#xD;
