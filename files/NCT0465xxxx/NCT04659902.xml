  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hormones that are produced by our stomach and intestines play a role in regulating our&#xD;
      appetite and health, and are therefore of high interest for managing conditions such as&#xD;
      obesity and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Two important hormones, called GLP-1 and PYY, are released&#xD;
      from the same intestinal cell. The food we eat influences the release of these hormone and&#xD;
      evidence suggests that protein and calcium are key nutrients that stimulate the secretion of&#xD;
      GLP-1, while the influence of this combination on PYY release is less clear. Furthermore,&#xD;
      gastric emptying affects the rate of absorption of nutrients and by manipulating the&#xD;
      structural form of protein, in the absence or presence of calcium, we may be able to learn&#xD;
      more about the processes mediating the gut hormone response. We hypothesise that gut hormone&#xD;
      secretion will be enhanced following the ingestion of a partially digested protein in the&#xD;
      presence of calcium versus a control protein without calcium. Additionally, the ingestion of&#xD;
      the partially digested protein will result in faster gastric emptying compared to the control&#xD;
      protein.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recent work at the University of Bath has shown that when ingested with 50 g whey protein&#xD;
      hydrolysate, Capolac® (milk minerals high in calcium) potently stimulates availability of the&#xD;
      important hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). However, it is currently unclear how the&#xD;
      form of protein ingested with the presence or absence of calcium may affect gut hormone&#xD;
      secretion and gastric emptying. Therefore we aim to perform a study on the effect of&#xD;
      co-ingesting two different forms of protein in the presence or absence of calcium on gut&#xD;
      hormone availability and gastric emptying. This project will help provide key evidence to aid&#xD;
      future work and recommendations for nutrition-based interventions for the prevention and&#xD;
      management of obesity and T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen metabolically healthy men and women, age 18-65 years, BMI between 18.5 and 25 kg/m2&#xD;
      will be recruited to participate in a randomised crossover study. Each participant will&#xD;
      undergo 4 trials. Each trial will last ~3 hours and will be separated by a minimum of 48h:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTROL (CON) - 30 g Control protein only CONTROL + CALCIUM (CON-C) - 30 g Control protein +&#xD;
      9547 mg Capolac® (2500 mg of calcium ingested) PROTEIN (PRO) - 30 g Aggregate protein only&#xD;
      PROTEIN + CALCIUM (PRO-C) - 30 g Aggregate protein + 9547 mg Capolac® (2500 mg of calcium&#xD;
      ingested)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of these drinks will also contain 500 mL of water, low calorie sweetener (80 mg&#xD;
      sucralose) and will be labelled with 150 mg 13C1 sodium acetate, and 100 mg 13C1 sodium&#xD;
      octanoate for the measurement of gastric emptying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to arrive to the laboratory between 09:00 and 10:00 am after not&#xD;
      eating for between 10-14 hours i.e. in a fasted state (water intake is permitted and&#xD;
      encouraged). Upon arrival at the laboratory a trained phlebotomist staff member will insert a&#xD;
      cannula (a small plastic tube) into a pre-heated dorsal hand vein on the back of the hand, or&#xD;
      if unsuccessful, the antecubital vein. Participants will then be given one of the four test&#xD;
      drinks, which once ingested will initiate the trial. Just after the ingestion of the test&#xD;
      drink we will ask participants to fill out a palatability scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken at baseline, and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after&#xD;
      ingestion of the test drink. Breath samples will be collected in exetainers at baseline, and&#xD;
      every 5 minutes until the 120-minute time point to determine gastric emptying. An appetite&#xD;
      questionnaire will also be completed at baseline and every 60 minutes after ingestion of the&#xD;
      test drink to assess appetite sensations. After the 120-minute time point participants will&#xD;
      be asked to consume a lunch meal until they are comfortably full. Once satisfied with the&#xD;
      lunch meal they will fill out the final appetite questionnaire. The trial day will then be&#xD;
      complete. Following study completion participants will be asked to complete a restrained&#xD;
      eating questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of 5 participants will be fitted with a nasogastric tube by a qualified BAPEN nurse.&#xD;
      5ml aspirate from the stomach will be samples at baseline, 30, 60, and 120 minutes which will&#xD;
      be distributed equally for analyte profiling and in vitro culture work. 3 ml gastric aspirate&#xD;
      will be used to stimulate a GLUTag cell line. Experiments will be performed by incubating&#xD;
      cells with the neutralised gastric aspirate in 250 µl Krebs Ringer Buffer (KRB) for 2 h at&#xD;
      37˚C, 5 % CO2. A second culture, identical to that previously described will be conducted,&#xD;
      only with the addition of specific cell receptor antagonists.&#xD;
