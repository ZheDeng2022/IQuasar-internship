  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center multi-national rollover study to allow continued access to&#xD;
      crizanlizumab for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) who are on crizanlizumab treatment&#xD;
      in a Novartis-sponsored study (parent study) and are benefiting from the treatment as judged&#xD;
      by the investigator.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be no screening period for this study as patients will transfer directly from&#xD;
      parent studies. After providing informed consent, all eligible participants should start&#xD;
      crizanlizumab treatment at the earliest convenience following the treatment schedule of 28&#xD;
      days of the last dose in the parent study. Crizanlizumab will be administered at the same&#xD;
      dose/schedule as in the parent study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 105 days of the last dose of the parent study the participants will have a safety&#xD;
      follow up visit (overlapping with the treatment phase of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to remain open for 10 years from the first Patient's first visit (FPFV)&#xD;
      in this clinical study or until study treatment becomes commercially available and is&#xD;
      reimbursed in the respective indication or until such time that all enrolled patients no&#xD;
      longer need treatment with crizanlizumab, whichever comes first.&#xD;

             patients. In the population under 18 years, it will be signed by the patient and/or by&#xD;
             the parents or legal guardian prior to enrolling in the rollover study and receiving&#xD;
             study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. SCD patient currently enrolled in a Novartis-sponsored study receiving crizanlizumab&#xD;
             and has fulfilled all the requirements in the parent study. Patient is currently&#xD;
             benefiting from the treatment with crizanlizumab as determined by the investigator and&#xD;
             has completed the treatment schedule as planned in the parent study&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has demonstrated compliance to the planned visit schedule in the parent study,&#xD;
             and in the opinion of the investigator has shown willingness and ability to comply&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Ongoing/unresolved treatment-related Grade 3 or higher AEs, and/or any ongoing AE&#xD;
             requiring dose interruption. Patients meeting all other eligibility criteria may be&#xD;
             enrolled once toxicities have resolved unless those toxicities were grade 4&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Concurrent participation in any other investigational clinical trial other than the&#xD;
             parent study or plan to participate in any other investigational clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. SCD patients who do not meet parent study protocol criteria to continue with&#xD;
             crizanlizumab&#xD;
