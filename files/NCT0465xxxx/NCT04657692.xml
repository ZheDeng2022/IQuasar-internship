  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of obesity parturient has been increasing worldwide. There was a report&#xD;
      revealing one third of pregnant women in United state considered obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is associated with increased in maternal and neonatal complications. Also, there was&#xD;
      an increasing in the rate of cesarean delivery. Anesthetic management of the obese parturient&#xD;
      is differ from non-obese parturients. There were higher risk of difficult intubation, failed&#xD;
      intubation, pulmonary aspiration and difficult regional anesthesia such as spinal anesthesia&#xD;
      or epidural catheter placement comparing with non-obese parturient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to report complication associated with anesthesia in obese patients&#xD;
      undergoing cesarean delivery in Single University hospital, Bangkok, THAILAND.&#xD;

      The incidence of obesity parturient has been increasing worldwide. There was a report&#xD;
      revealing one third of pregnant women in United state considered obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is associated with increased in maternal and neonatal complications. Also, there was&#xD;
      an increasing in the rate of cesarean delivery. Anesthetic management of the obese parturient&#xD;
      is differ from non-obese parturients. There were higher risk of difficult intubation and&#xD;
      difficult regional anesthesia such as spinal anesthesia or epidural catheter placement&#xD;
      comparing with non-obese parturient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHO categorised obesity into 3 classification; grade 1: BMI 30-34.9 kg/m2, grade 2: BMI&#xD;
      35-39.9 kg/m2, grade 3: BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2. This study emphasised in grade 3 obese pregnant women&#xD;
      (BMI&gt;40 kg/m2) undergoing cesarean delivery that were at risk of increasing in anesthetic&#xD;
      complications such as airway complications as well as complications derived from regional&#xD;
      anesthesia eg. high spinal block, failed spinal block etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the primary objective of the study is to report complication associated with&#xD;
      anesthesia in obese patients undergoing cesarean delivery in Single University hospital,&#xD;
      Bangkok, THAILAND. The secondary objectives rate of postpartum haemorrhage, rate of&#xD;
      hysterectomy and neonatal outcomes.&#xD;
