  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Telogen effluvium (TE) is one of the most common causes of non-scarring diffuse hair loss,&#xD;
      defined as global diminution of hair with no formation of areas completely bald.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premature termination of anagen into catagen and telogen hair follicle is the main mechanism&#xD;
      observed in TE. It results in increased, synchronized telogen shedding leading to a decrease&#xD;
      in global hair density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute telogen effluvium (ATE) has an abrupt onset and generalized scalp hair loss occurring&#xD;
      2-3 months after a triggering event, which could be unidentifiable in up to 33% cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The degree of effluvium depends on the severity, duration of exposure and the type of agent,&#xD;
      that can be: emotional stress, hormonal changes in the postpartum period, high fever,&#xD;
      surgery, surgical/accidental trauma, severe haemorrhage, chronic systemic illness, or immense&#xD;
      psychological stress, changes in medication or crash-diets. A summer effect possibly&#xD;
      ultraviolet (UV) light induced, manifesting itself in autumn can cause ATE. The incidence of&#xD;
      TE is not known, although it is likely that most women will experience at least 1 episode of&#xD;
      TE during a lifetime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATE can be diagnosed based on relevant medical and personal history and examination&#xD;
      subjective complaints, clinical and physical exams or relevant investigations (hair pull&#xD;
      test, phototrichogram, blood test…). ATE generates a lot of anxiety in the patient:&#xD;
      significant impact on quality of life, self-esteem impairment, and stress increase. Thus,&#xD;
      stress may act as a primary inducer; an aggravating factor or be a response to hair loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATE usually remits within few months (3-4 to 6 months) in 95% of cases if the trigger is&#xD;
      removed or treated. Complete recovery may take until 1 year. A resolving TE is characterized&#xD;
      by the absence of hair shedding, a negative hair pull test and synchronized hair growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, our aim is to assess the effects of the RV3466F lotion on hair growth,&#xD;
      compared to a control group, with clinical and biometrological non- invasive methods on an&#xD;
      adult female population with telogen effluvium.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to evaluate the interest of the RV3466F lotion in the remission of ET, which occurs&#xD;
      naturally when the triggering cause is stopped, ,a comparative controlled group is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, due to the type of product (lotion) and the area of application ( scalp), the&#xD;
      parallel groups design is adapted to the study purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To increase the adherence to the study protocol and to limit the negative psychological&#xD;
      impact of hair shedding without treatment, the control group receive a neutral shampoo (extra&#xD;
      mild shampoo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to avoid a bias between groups regarding the associated products, the same shampoo&#xD;
      is given for the two groups. It should be used at the usual frequency. The allocation of the&#xD;
      study product is randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only women are included in the study as specified in the claim of the study product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study area is the whole scalp. For evaluations the scalp is divided into 4 parts:&#xD;
      centroparietal, parietal (right/left), frontal, and occipital areas The concerned part of the&#xD;
      scalp which is evaluated can change according to the outcome measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phototrichogram (PTG) is a painless, non-invasive and objective method, used done in 2&#xD;
      steps 48 hours apart to provide an accurate chronological following of hair growth on a&#xD;
      specific scalp area . All data and images are computerized, which enables a semi-automatic&#xD;
      quantification of hair growth variables (density, growth…). A preliminary dyeing of the hair&#xD;
      is performed, in order to enhance the contrast between hair and scalp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hair pull test is a semi quantitative method usually used to diagnose ongoing hair&#xD;
      shedding and it helps to assess severity and location of hair loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Global photographs help to illustrate the scalp hair coverage and the overall course of hair&#xD;
      volume. For a better standardization of the shooting conditions, a stereotactic device is&#xD;
      used, allowing their comparison from time to time, which is done ideally by trained people,&#xD;
      the photographs being subsequently time blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 60 seconds hair count test is a non-invasive and painless test performed by the subject&#xD;
      itself, on the whole scalp in order to count the total number of hairs shed during a 60&#xD;
      seconds combing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical study includes 9 visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1 - Selection (D1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2 - Inclusion - 48 hours (±2h) after V1&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Visit 7- Intermediate - 12 weeks (D85 ± 4 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 8 - Intermediate - 16 weeks (D113± 4 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 9 - Study end: 48 hours (±2h) after V8&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximal duration of participation for a subject is 119 days.&#xD;
