      The Research Question of the present study is the following: in a population of men and women&#xD;
      affected by face wrinkles and skin tones and irregularities (atrophies) of the skin surface&#xD;
      in neck, abdomen, thighs and buttocks, will Plenhyage® significantly decrease the appearance&#xD;
      of treated areas, results observed after 8 and 12 weeks?&#xD;

      Open, non-comparative, interventional, multicenter study with the total number of screened&#xD;
      subjects of 66 (60 evaluable subjects +6 potential screening failure):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20 patients will be administered Plenhyage® thin for the treatment of mild wrinkles;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20 patients will be administered Plenhyage® medium for the treatment of moderate&#xD;
           wrinkles;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20 patients will be administered Plenhyage® strong for improving the skin tones and&#xD;
           irregularities (atrophies) of the skin surface in neck, abdomen, thighs and buttocks;&#xD;

Very Much Improved (1) = Optimal cosmetic result; Much Improved (2) = Market improvement in appearance but not completely optimal. A touch-up would slightly improve the result; Improved (3) = Obvious improvement in appearance from the initial condition, but a touch-up or re-treatment is indicated; No Change (4) = The appearance is essentially the same as the original condition; Worse (5) = The appearance is worse than the original condition.</description>
