      The aim of this study was to determine the subcutaneous connective tissue reactions to these&#xD;
      new materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods These materials were placed in polyethylene tubes and implanted into&#xD;
      the dorsal connective tissue of Sprague Dawley rats. The presence of inflammation, edema,&#xD;
      necrosis, dystrophic calcification, and thickness of fibrous capsule formation was recorded&#xD;
      by histological examination 7, 30, and 60 days after the implantation procedure. Inflammation&#xD;
      scores were defined as follows: 0 = no or few inflammatory cells, no reaction, 1 = &lt;25 cells,&#xD;
      mild reaction; 2 = 25 to 125 cells, moderate reaction; and 3 = ≥125 cells, severe reaction.&#xD;
      Fibrous capsule thickness, necrosis, and formation of calcification were recorded.&#xD;

      24 Twenty-four male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 250--300 gr were used in the study. For&#xD;
      preliminary study, 1 one rat was used on each experimental day . During the study period, the&#xD;
      animals were kept in cages in groups of five and taken to daily care under standard care&#xD;
      conditions without restriction ofno feed and water supply restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ProRoot White MTA, Medcem Pure Portland Cement, and Medcem MTA mixed according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's' instructions were filled placed into sterile p olyethylene tubules (internal&#xD;
      diameter: 1.3 mm internal diameter, x external diameter: 1.6 mm external diameter, x length:&#xD;
      5.0 mm length) sterilized with ethylene oxide gas, as specified by ISO , with using a sterile&#xD;
      Llentulo. Twenty-one empty polyethylene tubes remained empty to bewere used as in the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Procedures The rats were anesthetized in an ether jar, followed byand then received&#xD;
      intraperitoneal administration of 70- mg/kg ketamine and 10- mg/kg xylazine&#xD;
      intraperitoneally. The operation area (backs) of the anesthetizedeach rats were was shaved&#xD;
      with a certain razor blade, and the surgical area was disinfected with Betadine skin&#xD;
      disinfectant ,. After shaving, the operation area wasand covered with sterile drapes to be&#xD;
      exposed. In orderTo induce local hemostasis, operations of 0.5 cc, 0.006- mg/ml 4% articaine&#xD;
      containing epinephrine (Ultracaine D-S-Aventis Forte, Istanbul, Turkey) by infiltrating local&#xD;
      anesthesia was performedadministered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incision lines were determined marked on the dorsal, anterior, and posterior extremities of&#xD;
      the experimental animals, two in the anterior and two in the posterior region and two in the&#xD;
      posterior region. When determining the incision lines, cCare was taken to keep a distance of&#xD;
      at least 2 cm distance between the placed materials to prevent them from being affected .&#xD;
      Skin iIncisions of approximately 1 cm length long was performedwere made with the a sterile&#xD;
      scalpel in the designated areas. The cCanals were entered through the incision site with a&#xD;
      sterile periosteal elevator, and ducts were opened under the skin by blunt dissection&#xD;
      approximately 2 cm deep. Subsequently, polyethylene tubules filled with the experimental&#xD;
      material according toof the each groups and sterile empty polyethylene tubules for the&#xD;
      control groups were placed in the prepared subcutaneous canals. The incision sites were then&#xD;
      closed primarily using 3/0 silk sutures. Antibacterial spray was applied on the sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histological Procedures After surgery, on the 7th, 30th and 60th days, 7seven animals from&#xD;
      each group, (21 animals) were euthanized intraperitoneally with high doses of&#xD;
      thiopentalsodium (Pental, İ.E. Ulagay Med. San. , Istanbul, Turkey) administered&#xD;
      intraperitoneally under ether anesthesia on Days 7, 30, and 60. Then, tThe test tubules&#xD;
      placed were then removed together with the surrounding tissues and placed in bottles&#xD;
      containing 10% neutral formalin. Paraffin blocks were prepared from test samples fixed in&#xD;
      bottles containing 10% formalin for 2 two days. From the tissues embedded in the paraffin&#xD;
      blocks, 4- μm serial sections parallel to the long axis of the tube were taken cut with a&#xD;
      microtome (Leica SM 2000R, Leica Instruments, Wetzlar, Germany) and stained with hematoxylin&#xD;
      and eosin (H&amp;E).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All histological evaluations were performed The tissue samples were histologically examined&#xD;
      under an optical microscope (Nikon Eclipse E 600, Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan) at 40×x, 100×x,&#xD;
      200×x, and 400×x magnifications. All the slides were examined and rated by a pathologists&#xD;
      blinded to all procedures.&#xD;
