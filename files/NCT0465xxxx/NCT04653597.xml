  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A decreased level of consciousness is a common reason for presentation to the emergency&#xD;
      department (ED) and is often the result of intoxication (up to 1% of all ED visits and 3% of&#xD;
      ICU admission). In France, approximately 165 000 poisoned patients are managed each year.&#xD;
      Originally developed in head injured patients, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a validated&#xD;
      reproducible score evaluating the level of consciousness: a GCS ≤ 8 is strongly associated&#xD;
      with reduced gag reflex and increased incidence of aspiration pneumonia. Although recommended&#xD;
      for patients with traumatic brain injury and coma, it remains unknown whether the benefit of&#xD;
      an invasive management of airways with sedation, intubation and mechanical ventilation should&#xD;
      be applied to other causes of coma in particular for acute poisoned patients. The&#xD;
      investigator hypothesize that a conservative management with close monitoring without&#xD;
      immediate endotracheal intubation of these patients is effective and associated with less&#xD;
      in-hospital complications (truncated at 28 days) compared to routine practice management (in&#xD;
      which the decision of immediate intubation is left to the discretion of the emergency&#xD;
      physician).&#xD;

      A decreased level of consciousness is a common reason for presentation to the emergency&#xD;
      department (ED) and is often the result of intoxication (up to 1% of all ED visits and 3% of&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) admission). In France, approximately 165 000 poisoned patients are&#xD;
      managed each year.1 Originally developed in head injured patients, the Glasgow Coma Scale&#xD;
      (GCS) is a validated reproducible score evaluating the level of consciousness - a GCS ≤ 8 is&#xD;
      associated with reduced gag reflex and increased incidence of aspiration pneumonia (with an&#xD;
      adjusted odds ratio of 2.32, 95%CI =1.60 to 3.33). However, whether this risk of aspiration&#xD;
      pneumonia (AP) may be decreased by early intubation is unknown, and no difference in the risk&#xD;
      of AP was reported between patients that were intubated early and patients who were not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it is well established that in trauma patients, a GCS ≤ 8 mandates airway management&#xD;
      by endotracheal intubation, it remains unknown whether this strategy should be applied to&#xD;
      other etiologies of coma, in particular for acute poisoned patients. Tracheal intubation and&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation allow to prevent aspiration pneumonia, to optimize oxygenation and gas&#xD;
      exchange.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will include patients with a decreased level of consciousness (defined by a GCS&#xD;
      of 8 or less) caused by acute intoxication (alcohol, recreative drugs, or other prescription&#xD;
      drugs (with the exception intoxication with cardiotropic drugs, e.g. beta blockers, calcium&#xD;
      channel inhibitor, angiotensin conversion enzyme)). These patients will be included at the&#xD;
      initial stage of their management: in the ED, or out of hospital with a pre-hospital&#xD;
      emergency physician. Patients with clear proven benefit of intubation will be excluded :&#xD;
      patients in shock, patients with suspicion of brain lesion, seizure related with poisoning,&#xD;
      visualization of regurgitation of gastric content or sign of respiratory distress.&#xD;
      Conservative airway management. Patients will be conservatively managed, i.e. close&#xD;
      monitoring and no intubation and mechanical ventilation unless the patient presents a&#xD;
      clinical event that needs intubation (shock, sign of respiratory distress, visualization of&#xD;
      regurgitation or seizure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute poisoning is a common reason for presentation to the ED or MICU intervention (up to 1%&#xD;
      of all ED visits and 3% of intensive care unit (ICU) admission). These patients are often&#xD;
      intubated (reported rate ranging from 20 to 50% in different cohort studies), when their GCS&#xD;
      is below 8, in order to protect their airways. However there is currently no clear&#xD;
      demonstration of its efficacy in this specific target population, while it is known that&#xD;
      intubation is associated with morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intubated patients need subsequent intensive care unit admission and invasive monitoring, and&#xD;
      this can be associated with increased risk of pulmonary complications, length of&#xD;
      hospital-stay, nosocomial infections and cost. In a context of expenditures control in health&#xD;
      care, appropriate intensive care resource utilization is an important issue. When considering&#xD;
      the increasing demand for intensive care among emergency patients, the importance of health&#xD;
      care resource allocation and expenditure control, and the possible absence benefit of&#xD;
      intubation and intensive care, an endotracheal airway management of poisoned coma patients&#xD;
      might be detrimental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, if our hypothesis is demonstrated, the results of NICO study will change practice and&#xD;
      guidelines for management of acute coma poisoned patients, with less exposure to the&#xD;
      morbidity of endotracheal intubation and associated with decrease of ICU stay, and reduction&#xD;
      of their health costs.&#xD;
