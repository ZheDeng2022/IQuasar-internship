  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether delayed boosting (an extra administration of a&#xD;
      vaccine) with the IHV01 (FLSC) protein and A244/AHFG with or without ALFQ will cause your&#xD;
      body to make higher amounts of antibodies or different types of antibodies after the&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to define the safety and immunogenicity of IHV01 and A244/AHFG&#xD;
      with and without ALFQ at a full dose and at a fractional dose (one-fifth of a full dose) in a&#xD;
      late boost setting for participants who had previously received a late boost of AIDSVAX®B/E&#xD;
      with or without ALVAC in RV306. Safety will be assessed through the frequency of the overall&#xD;
      and specific post-vaccination reactions. Blood, lymph nodes, sigmoid tissue, and mucosal&#xD;
      specimens/secretions will be collected to assess humoral, cell-mediated, innate, and mucosal&#xD;
      immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy, HIV-uninfected participants, at a low risk for HIV infection, available for 12&#xD;
      months, who were randomized to receive active vaccine in RV306 and completed all vaccinations&#xD;
      will be enrolled. A total of 120 participants will be enrolled across four vaccination&#xD;
      groups. In each group, 25 participants will receive IHV01 and A244/AHFG at a full or&#xD;
      fractional dose with or without ALFQ and 5 participants will receive placebo. All injections,&#xD;
      whether vaccine or placebo, will be a one-time intramuscular (IM) administration into the&#xD;
      quadriceps muscle at study Day 0. Participants will be followed-up for up to 48 weeks after&#xD;
      enrollment on days 1, 7, 14, 168 and 336. Mucosal secretion collections and endocervical&#xD;
      cytobrush/swab procedures will be performed at Weeks 0, 2, 24, and 48 on consenting&#xD;
      participants. Leukapheresis, sigmoid biopsy, and lymph node biopsy procedures will be&#xD;
      performed only at Week 2 on consenting participants.&#xD;
