  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this pilot study is to obtain information, which will be used for the&#xD;
      design of a main randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a larger size based on feasibility,&#xD;
      validity and sample size estimation as well as the potential effects of pre- and probiotic&#xD;
      intake on intestinal microbiota. A larger trial will then be designed to test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that adding probiotics or prebiotics may improve gut microbiome composition, gastrointestinal&#xD;
      symptoms as well as cardiometabolic health indices in mid-term and possibly lead to improved&#xD;
      sports performance over a longer-term period in athletes with a Spinal Cord Injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot crossover randomized controlled trial, twenty (N = 20) para-athletes will&#xD;
      participate in an intervention consisting of a four-week intake of probiotic, using the&#xD;
      commercially available multistrain probiotic preparation &quot;BactoSan pro FOS&quot; from Mepha&#xD;
      (Basel, Switzerland), followed by a four-week wash-out period, and a four-week prebiotic&#xD;
      intervention using &quot;Naturaplan Bio Oat Bran&quot; (Coop, Switzerland). Total duration of the study&#xD;
      will be 16 weeks.&#xD;
