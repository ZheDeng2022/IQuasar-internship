  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The placement of mega knee prosthesis is a necessity after a large tumor resection and&#xD;
      oncological. These mega knee prostheses implanted in the context of oncological surgery have&#xD;
      been very few evaluated in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active knee extension is essential in order to walk properly. The study propose the&#xD;
      evaluation of this prosthesis by checking the possibility of locking of the prosthetic joint&#xD;
      and thus the possibility of active walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more in-depth, isokinetic analysis at 1 year of follow-up will also be done in an&#xD;
      exploratory manner, as the literature has no data on this subject.&#xD;

    <description>The MSTS Score may be used as a functional measure for patients with sarcoma involving the upper limb. The score includes 6 measures (pain, function, emotional acceptance, hand position, manual dexterity, lifting ability) each measure with a maximum of 5 points. The maximum overall score is 30 points. The score is designed to be used after the procedure and is therefore only collected post-operatively.</description>

    <description>The Oxford Knee Score (OKS) is a Patient Reported Outcome questionnaire that was developed to specifically assess the patient's perspective of outcome following Total Knee Arthroplasty.&#xD;
Each of the 12 answers are assigned the previously defined number of points. They range from 1 = least difficult to 5 = most difficult. The 12 ratings are then added together to give a total score used to assess the patient.&#xD;
