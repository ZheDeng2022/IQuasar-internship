  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is a chronic disease that leads to the loss of teeth. It has been associated to&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Periodontal therapy (NSPT) has been shown to have systemic&#xD;
      effects. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of non-surgical periodontal&#xD;
      therapy on biochemical parameters of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), periodontal parameters and&#xD;
      quality of life in patients with and without RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients with and RA and periodontitis can participate in the study. Participants&#xD;
      benefit from the effects of conventional tooth cleaning (periodontal therapy) and oral&#xD;
      hygiene instructions. There are no significant risk associated with periodontal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is conducted at the Universidad de Antioquia in Medellin, Colombia. The study is&#xD;
      set to start 2019 and end mid 2021. The study is funded by a grant from the Universidad de&#xD;
      Antioquia. Contact person: Javier Enrique Botero (javier.botero@udea.edu.co)&#xD;

      After participants are screened for inclusion, serum samples will be collected for the&#xD;
      analysis of C-reactive protein (CRP; mg/L), rheumatoid factor (RF; UI/mL) and&#xD;
      anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs; UI/mL) in a reference laboratory. A complete&#xD;
      periodontal chart will be carried out at six sites per tooth excluding third molars by a&#xD;
      single experienced clinician using a calibrated probe (Hu-Friedy Mfg. Co.). Subgingival&#xD;
      plaque samples will be collected by means of paper points inserted to the bottom of the&#xD;
      pocket and processed immediately for culture analysis and detection of Porphyromonas&#xD;
      gingivalis. RA patients will be examined by an experienced rheumatologist to determine their&#xD;
      Disease Activity Score (DAS-28). All examinations will be taken at baseline and repeated 3&#xD;
      months after intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) will be administered on the following 5 days of&#xD;
      inclusion. A single 1-hour session of full-mouth debridement with an ultrasonic device will&#xD;
      be carried out in each participant under local anesthesia by an experienced clinician. After&#xD;
      NSPT is completed, each patient will receive oral hygiene instructions and oral care pack&#xD;
      including toothbrush and toothpaste (toothbrush Vitis Encias Medium; Toothpaste Vitis Encias;&#xD;
      Dentaid, Colombia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic ,clinical history as well as medication data for all participants will be&#xD;
      collected. Periodontal parameters of PD (mm), PAL (mm) and BOP (%) will be recorded at each&#xD;
      visit. The stage and grade of periodontitis will be established according to the new&#xD;
      classification of periodontal diseases (Papapanou et al. 2018). The clinician who records&#xD;
      data will not be blinded to the condition of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated to detect a 50 % change in CRP with a power of &gt;80% (alpha 0,05)&#xD;
      which resulted in 15 per group (Cosgarea et al. 2018). Considering possible dropouts, 20&#xD;
      participants will be included per group. Randomization will not be performed since the&#xD;
      purpose was to compare the effects of NSPT in patients with and without RA. The clinical&#xD;
      investigator who records periodontal parameters will be calibrated for repeated measurements&#xD;
      before patient inclusion (Kappa value was ≥0.80 for PAL and PD). Continuous variables will be&#xD;
      presented as the mean and 95% confidence interval (CI) or median [interquartile range] when&#xD;
      appropriate. Change in biochemical markers (CRP, RF, ACPAs) and periodontal parameters (PAL,&#xD;
      PD, BOP, microbial counts) will be expressed as the delta (∆) from baseline to 3 months after&#xD;
      intervention. Differences in means will be determined by the student t test for paired and&#xD;
      unpaired samples or non-parametric tests when appropriate. Categorical variables will be&#xD;
      presented as frequencies (%) and analyzed in contingency tables and X2. Logistic regression&#xD;
      analysis for categorical variables and linear models will be used to test for associations&#xD;
      and the odds ratio with 95%CI will be calculated. The primary analysis will be performed as&#xD;
      intention to treat and then compared to per-protocol analysis results. The level of&#xD;
      statistical significance will be set at 5% (P≤0,05).&#xD;
