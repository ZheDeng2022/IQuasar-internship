  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with type 2 diabetes are two-and-a-half times more likely to experience heart failure&#xD;
      and twice more likely to have a heart attack compared to people without diabetes. People&#xD;
      coming to hospital often have unknown hyperglycaemia. It is thought that three quarters of&#xD;
      people admitted to the Coronary care unit with a myocardial infarction have hyperglycaemia&#xD;
      and over a third of whom are undiagnosed with diabetes and over 40% with impaired glucose&#xD;
      tolerance (IGT). All of these patients are at greater risk of poor outcomes in the presence&#xD;
      of uncontrolled hyperglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting to A&amp;E have routine bloods taken for condition which are they are being&#xD;
      investigated and treated for. Therefore the aim of the study is to identify the prevalence of&#xD;
      undiagnosed diabetes (HbA1c &gt;48mmol/mol) or impaired glucose tolerance/pre-diabetes (HbA1c&#xD;
      &gt;39mmol/mol) in patients attending the accident and emergency department or acute medical&#xD;
      unit and to see if this is a good screening measure for diagnosis of diabetes. This project&#xD;
      will help identify those undiagnosed with glucose intolerance (T2D and IGT) and instigate&#xD;
      appropriate treatment and improve outcomes for this group of patients. This will in the long&#xD;
      term reduce the burden to the NHS. This project will help in the development of guidance for&#xD;
      diagnosis of T2D in an acute setting and treatment for hospital admission and continued care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will include 10,000 consecutive patients over the age of 30 years attending the&#xD;
      A&amp;E or AMU departments of Tameside and Glossop Integrated Care NHS FT. All patients will be&#xD;
      screened for glucose intolerance with a blood test in which patients' blood would be taken&#xD;
      anyway for clinical reasons and the laboratory will perform an HbA1c investigation on the&#xD;
      sample collected.&#xD;

      Study aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary research question What is the prevalence of glucose intolerance (diabetes and IGT) in&#xD;
      patients presenting to an acute medical emergency department?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to see whether this is a simple method of identifying the many&#xD;
      patients who have undiagnosed glucose intolerance and ensuring those who are identified are&#xD;
      commenced on the right treatment path for them to reduce both individual risk and burden to&#xD;
      the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting to A&amp;E have routine bloods taken for condition which are they are being&#xD;
      investigated and treated for. Therefore the aim is to identify the prevalence of undiagnosed&#xD;
      diabetes (HbA1c &gt;48mmol/mol) or impaired glucose tolerance/pre-diabetes (HbA1c &gt;39mmol/mol)&#xD;
      in patients attending the accident and emergency department or acute medical unit and to see&#xD;
      if this is a good screening measure for diagnosis of diabetes. This project will help&#xD;
      identify those undiagnosed with glucose intolerance (T2D and IGT) and instigate appropriate&#xD;
      treatment and improve outcomes for this group of patients. This will in the long term reduce&#xD;
      the burden to the NHS. This project will help in the development of guidance for diagnosis of&#xD;
      T2D in an acute setting and treatment for hospital admission and continued care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will include 10,000 consecutive patients over the age of 30 years attending the&#xD;
      A&amp;E or AMU departments of Tameside and Glossop Integrated Care NHS FT. All patients will be&#xD;
      screened for glucose intolerance with a blood test in which patients' blood would be taken&#xD;
      anyway for clinical reasons and we will perform an HbA1c investigation on the sample&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to measuring HbA1c the investigators will look for other risk factors, such as&#xD;
      socio economic status, obesity, ethnicity, weekly exercise patterns and other metabolic&#xD;
      factors (e.g. lipids).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All results will be forwarded to the GP with advice on management if HbA1c is raised and to&#xD;
      follow-up the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the largest UK project to include patients presenting to A&amp;E and assessed for&#xD;
      underlying glucose intolerance. The project will run for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the observational nature of this study, no blinding is required to the investigators&#xD;
      as the primary question is laboratory diagnosis and not treatment received&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an observational cohort study of patients hospitalised at Tameside General&#xD;
      Hospital,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient demographic details will be extracted from their clinical notes and electronic&#xD;
      patient records, then placed on an anonymised database for analysis. Data will be analysed to&#xD;
      determine findings, including diagnosis of T2D/IGT, reason for admission, presence of&#xD;
      diabetic complications (microvascular / macrovascular). Projected recruitment is minimum of&#xD;
      10,000 patients to be opportunistically recruited from A&amp;E and AMU and acute medical wards of&#xD;
      TGH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be opportunistically recruited from in-patient admissions with a medical&#xD;
      illness and presenting either to the A&amp;E, AMU or acute medical wards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aged â‰¥30 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Males and female sex&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aged &lt;30 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type 1 diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected for patients based on whether they have been recorded as having a&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of diabetes or not by history and GP records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secure, password-encrypted database will be held on a secure server at the hospital,&#xD;
      detailing the patient's identifiable details, as well as an assigned study number. Once&#xD;
      patient study demographics have been obtained, these will be held on a separate, anonymised&#xD;
      database with only the study number as the identifier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FINDRISC score will be assessed for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Data to be collected Please see Appendix 1 for the data extraction pro forma A detailed&#xD;
      list of data to be extracted is laid out in Tables 1 and 2. Data will be collected by&#xD;
      co-investigators/research nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1. Data to be collected at enrolment, if available as part of clinical care&#xD;
&#xD;

      medical records Binary i.e. yes/no&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data handling and record keeping Data will be manually extracted from the sources detailed&#xD;
      above and stored on a password-encrypted database held on Microsoft Excel software. This will&#xD;
      be stored on a secure server with standard NHS encryption and firewalls at Tameside General&#xD;
      Hospital. Data will be cross-validated by two independent investigators to ensure validity of&#xD;
      data and quality of data entry. Records will be retained for ten years after the study&#xD;
      concludes for the purposes of potential secondary analysis, then it will be destroyed.&#xD;
      However all personal identifiable data will be destroyed at 5 years. All data collection will&#xD;
      adhere to the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Caldicott Principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations Since this is an observational study sample size calculation is not&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis All analysis will be carried out by principal investigator. Subgroup analysis will&#xD;
      also be carried out, stratified by age group, gender and ethnicity. Approximately 20% of the&#xD;
      general population of Tameside and Glossop are Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME), so it&#xD;
      is anticipated that subanalysis will be able to be conducted by ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analysis will also include logistic regression of ethnic groups against the above&#xD;
      treatment outcome variables, with adjustment for age, gender and diabetes status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject compliance Compliance will not be an issue, as all data will be gathered from&#xD;
      hospital in-patient admission data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal of subjects As this is an observational study, there is no cause for the&#xD;
      investigators to withdraw a subject from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate ethical approvals will be sought through the current Health Research Authority&#xD;
      (HRA) approval system. Once an outcome has been established, we will update the protocol with&#xD;
      the IRAS number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the patient data required will already be available as part of clinical care, there will&#xD;
      be no need to obtain informed consent from patients. As patients will already be having blood&#xD;
      taken for routine care no extra blood will be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal identifiable data will not leave Tameside and Glossop Integrated Care NHS Foundation&#xD;
      Trust and will adhere to the GDPR. Confidential patient information will be processed solely&#xD;
      for research, in accordance with the Department of Health and Social care Regulation of the&#xD;
      Health Service Control of Patient Information Regulations 2002'. Only anonymised data will be&#xD;
      included in the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are diagnosed with diabetes will have their results sent to the GP. Appropriate&#xD;
      treatment will be instituted if necessary prior to hospital discharge. Patients will receive&#xD;
      a copy of the discharge summary and information about diagnosis, blood results and&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting and dissemination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, aiming for&#xD;
      those of high impact factor. All data will be anonymised before publication. In addition,&#xD;
      results will also be presented at relevant medical conferences, both nationally and&#xD;
      internationally. Furthermore, a plain English summary of results will be provided for the&#xD;
      Trust and the NIHR websites. Media engagement will be managed via the Trust press office. The&#xD;
      plain English summary and overall findings will also be disseminated via the Trust's social&#xD;
      media outlets.&#xD;
