    <textblock>
      Elderly people often have comorbidities. However, there could be a big difference in their&#xD;
      health status. Frailty is considered to be relevant to adverse outcomes. Some studies have&#xD;
      found that preoperative frailty assessment and comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) of&#xD;
      the elderly can improve clinical outcomes, but there has been no valid assessment established&#xD;
      in China. Therefore it is important to design a research and help to solve this problem.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      With an aging population and the improvement of medical technology, the number of elderly&#xD;
      patients who need surgery is gradually increasing. Elderly people often have comorbidities,&#xD;
      malnutrition, and other conditions leading to an increased risk of anesthesia. What's more,&#xD;
      there could be a big difference in the health status of the elderly with the same age.&#xD;
      Frailty is considered to be highly prevalent with increasing age and to confer high risk for&#xD;
      adverse outcomes. A complete evaluation of elderly patients before surgery may help improve&#xD;
      the prognosis. Some studies have found that preoperative frailty assessment and comprehensive&#xD;
      geriatric assessment (CGA) of the elderly can improve clinical outcomes, but there has been&#xD;
      no valid assessment established in China. In this study, we plan to use a comprehensive&#xD;
      preoperative frailty assessment and follow up for 30 days after surgery to explore the effect&#xD;
      of preoperative frailty on postoperative complications in the elderly after major surgeries.&#xD;
      To better evaluate the postoperative complications, we choose comprehensive complication&#xD;
      index (CCI), which integrates all complication of the Clavien-Dindo classification and offers&#xD;
      a metric approach to measure morbidity.&#xD;
