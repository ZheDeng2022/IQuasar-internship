  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to measure the total cost of performing next-generation sequencing&#xD;
      (NGS) in clinical practice in France, in both germline and somatic cancer genetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was performed on 15 French representative cancer molecular genetics laboratories&#xD;
      performing NGS panels' tests. The production cost was estimated using a micro-costing method&#xD;
      with resources consumed collected in situ in each laboratory from a healthcare provider&#xD;
      perspective. A top-down methodology for specific post-sequencing steps was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional non-specific costs were also included and costs were detailed per step of the&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
