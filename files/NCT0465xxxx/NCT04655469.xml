      The primary and general objective of this protocol as the current standard of care is to&#xD;
      improve the quality of radiotherapy for HNC patients. This will ultimately be achieved by&#xD;
      optimizing locoregional tumour control and overall survival and by reducing radiation-induced&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will also allow the assessment of the effects of newly introduced radiation technology&#xD;
      (e.g. proton therapy) for this particular group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical introduction of this standard follow-up program (SFP) will allow for a&#xD;
      systematic and broad scale quality improvement cycle for HNC patients treated with&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;

      &quot;Big data analytics in cancer care holds immense potential to unlock valuable clinical&#xD;
      insights from an abundance of patient medical records, aided by sophisticated statistical&#xD;
      models, that will lead to improved population-based outcomes and deeper personalization of&#xD;
      cancer treatment. However, the clinical data (which includes medical images, clinical&#xD;
      examinations and laboratory results) has been locked away in disconnected &quot;silos&quot; within&#xD;
      every clinic. Additionally, patient information is exceedingly sensitive to privacy issues&#xD;
      and confidentiality breaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have pioneered the innovative Personal Health Train approach, whereby&#xD;
      support for choosing the best treatment (i.e. decision support) is accessible without any&#xD;
      patient records ever leaving the clinic of origin. This extends our current work on an&#xD;
      extensible data architecture to learn from quantitative imaging data in India and The&#xD;
      Netherlands (without images being taken out of the clinic) - NWO/DeITy BIONIC. The&#xD;
      investigators have now developed numerous models of clinical outcome after treatment,&#xD;
      including those for undesirable side-effects of treatment. The investigators continue to lead&#xD;
      big data integration work within multicenter clinical decision support projects such as&#xD;
      KWF-ProTraIT and Horizon2020-BD2DECIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of the TRAIN project is to combine big data (including images, laboratory&#xD;
      tests and clinical examinations) to improve the outcomes for head &amp; neck cancer patients in&#xD;
      both India and The Netherlands. The investigators will do this by creating data-driven&#xD;
      Decision Support Systems to predict which treatment gives the best outcome given individual&#xD;
      patient characteristics, and local diagnostic and treatment capabilities. Cancer specialists&#xD;
      in both countries will lead the design and clinical evaluation of this decision support&#xD;
      system, which could be deployed in multiple clinics across all of the settings encountered in&#xD;
      India and The Netherlands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Head and neck cancer is a relatively rare condition in the Netherlands, such that the data&#xD;
      volume available to learn from is much smaller than in India. Conversely, Indian patients&#xD;
      typically present at a more advanced stage of cancer compared to Dutch patients. These&#xD;
      differences in patients and treatments can be leveraged by machine learning algorithms to&#xD;
      learn better predictive models. Decision support systems are essential, since guideline&#xD;
      deviations in both countries are common due to individual patient characteristics, patient&#xD;
      preferences and uneven distribution of treatment capacity outside major urban centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve the above, The investigators first deploy the ICT infrastructure (in collaboration&#xD;
      with Philips India) to connect local hospital information systems so that clinical, imaging&#xD;
      and outcome data on head &amp; neck cancer patients becomes findable, accessible, interoperable&#xD;
      and reusable (FAIR) big data. The investigators then deploy learning algorithms that traverse&#xD;
      the big data repositories of each participating hospital, using the privacy-preserving&#xD;
      Personal Health Train approach, to develop a decision support system. Cancer specialists in&#xD;
      India and the Netherlands will jointly evaluate the clinical utility of the decision support&#xD;
      system by means of a prospective randomized clinical trial.&quot;&#xD;

        This UMBRELLA protocol can be used for any patient with HNC that is scheduled for curative&#xD;
        intent primary or postoperative radiotherapy with or without systemic therapy. It is to be&#xD;
        used prospectively for new patients entering the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion in clinical trials is not an exclusion criterion. It is possible to add&#xD;
        additional assessments required for the clinical study.&#xD;
