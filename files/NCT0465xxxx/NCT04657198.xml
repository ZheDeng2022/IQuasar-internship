  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nine different formulations of the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine were tested in the&#xD;
      parent study (NCT03814590). Based on safety and immunogenicity data from the parent study,&#xD;
      RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine will be evaluated in further clinical research.&#xD;
      Participants in selected groups will be invited to participate in this extension study. All&#xD;
      participants who will be enrolled in the current extension study will receive the RSV&#xD;
      investigational vaccine approximately 18 months after they received their respective dose-2&#xD;
      in the parent study.&#xD;
