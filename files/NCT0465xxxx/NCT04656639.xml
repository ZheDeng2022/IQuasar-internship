  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Detection of multifocal, multicentric and contralateral breast cancer in patients with breast&#xD;
      cancer affects surgical decision. Histology-proven additional cancer foci have been reported&#xD;
      to be detected in 21.0% to 63.0% of affected breasts in women thought to have localized&#xD;
      cancer based on clinical assessment and mammography. In women with newly diagnosed breast&#xD;
      cancer, synchronous contralateral breast cancer is reported in 3.0% to 5.5%. Dynamic&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI is often applied in the preoperative local staging of breast&#xD;
      cancer due to its high sensitivity and identifies additional foci that would have otherwise&#xD;
      remained undetected on clinical assessment and conventional imaging (mammography and&#xD;
      ultrasonography). However, DCE MRI is limited in use due to its low specificity with high&#xD;
      false positive rate, causing unnecessary and incorrect conversion to more extensive surgery.&#xD;
      Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) is a fast, functional MRI technique that measures the movement&#xD;
      of water molecules to create tissue contrast without the need for contrast injection. Breast&#xD;
      malignancies exhibit hindered diffusion and appear hyperintense on DWI with low apparent&#xD;
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) values compared to normal surrounding tissue or benign tumors.&#xD;
      Multiple studies including one prospective multi-center trial showed that DWI can reduce&#xD;
      unnecessary benign biopsies of suspicious mammographic or DCE MRI-detected lesions and DWI is&#xD;
      now considered as an important part of multi-parametric breast MRI protocols. However, little&#xD;
      is known about the role of DWI as an adjunct to DCE MRI in the local staging of women with&#xD;
      breast cancer. The purpose of our study is to determine whether DWI improves the performance&#xD;
      of preoperative DCE MRI in the evaluation of additional lesions in breast cancer patients.&#xD;

      Primary objective: to compare the diagnostic performance of DCE MRI vs combination of DWI and&#xD;
      DCE MRI for detection of multifocal, multicentric and contralateral breast cancer in patients&#xD;
      planning for breast conservation surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a multicenter, intraindividual comparative cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of 676 women with newly diagnosed breast cancer will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each eligible woman with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer will undergo DCE MRI and&#xD;
           DWI at a 3T MR scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contrast-enhanced MRI and DWI will be interpreted independently according to the Breast&#xD;
           Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) and likelihood of malignancy (Score range,&#xD;
           0%-100%) by trained radiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multifocal breast cancer is defined as presence of more than 2 separate (â‰¥1.0cm) foci of&#xD;
           breast cancer in the same quadrant or within 5 cm of the primary lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multicentric cancer is defined as two or more synchronous ipsilateral neoplasm located&#xD;
           in different quadrant or beyond 5 cm from the primary lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BI-RADS final assessment score of 4 or 5 are considered to be positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pathology of core or surgical biopsy and 1 year follow up is the reference standard.&#xD;
