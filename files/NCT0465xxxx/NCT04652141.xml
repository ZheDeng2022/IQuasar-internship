      Guidelines suggests that asthma should not be treated prior to a reversibility test and/or an&#xD;
      assessment with peak expiratory flow (PEF) unless there is a clinical urgency for the patient&#xD;
      to be treated. Approximately one third of patients with diagnosed asthma can safely step-wise&#xD;
      withdraw their asthma medication and diagnosis based on repeated objective lung function&#xD;
      measurements. AsthmaTuner is CE-marked and provides doctors and nurses with information on&#xD;
      patient spirometry incl. reversibility test and diurnal or weekly variability of PEF in&#xD;
      relation perceived symptoms. Thereby, digital supported asthma care with AsthmaTuner can&#xD;
      improve objective diagnosis of asthma. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity to establish objective asthma diagnosis with spirometry including&#xD;
      reversibility test and PEF-monitoring with AsthmaTuner, and secondary, assess the number of&#xD;
      asthma patients with objective verified asthma diagnosis with use of spirometry including&#xD;
      reversibility test and/or periodic variability with PEF/FEV1 between traditional trial&#xD;
      treatment and treatment with AsthmaTuner. At least 146 patients will be included who are at&#xD;
      least six years old, with respiratory symptoms that can be signed to asthma last month or&#xD;
      with physician-diagnosed asthma last five years without intake of anti-inflammatory treatment&#xD;
      in the last three months. This is a randomised controlled trial evaluating a diagnostic two&#xD;
      step algorithm that firstly includes dynamic spirometry with a reversibility test and&#xD;
      PEF/FEV1 monitoring with AsthmaTuner during 2-4 weeks, and secondly randomization to&#xD;
      traditional trial treatment with dynamic spirometry with a reversibility test, or AsthmaTuner&#xD;
      incl. PEF/FEV1 monitoring during trial treatment. We plan to include in total 146 patients in&#xD;
      primary care with either undiagnosed asthma having respiratory symptoms that can be signed to&#xD;
      asthma last month, or patients with a asthma diagnosis last 5 years but no intake of regular&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory asthma medication last 3 months. The study start in early 2021 and finish&#xD;
      in 2023.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines suggests that asthma should not be treated&#xD;
      prior to a reversibility test and/or an assessment of peak expiratory flow (PEF) variability&#xD;
      over time unless there is a clinical urgency for the patient to be treated. If lung function&#xD;
      measurements do not verify an asthma diagnosis, GINA suggests repeating these tests at a&#xD;
      later time or applying alternative tests such as bronchial challenges. In spite of clear&#xD;
      diagnostic guidelines, current clinical practice relies mostly on evidence of symptoms and&#xD;
      assessments of the effect of trial treatments instead of frequently use objective lung&#xD;
      function measurements to verify obstructive airway disease. Trial treatments including&#xD;
      testing responses to anti-inflammatory medications have lead to increasing numbers of normal&#xD;
      spirometry tests and fewer patients with an objective verified asthma diagnosis. Aaron et al.&#xD;
      (JAMA 2017) showed that a current diagnosis of asthma could not be established in 33% of&#xD;
      patients with a physician-diagnosed asthma within the last five years. Further, Aaron et al.&#xD;
      gradually tapered off patients' asthma medication and defined them as mis-diagnosed if they&#xD;
      were still symptom-free after 12 months of observation. Altogether, to solve the problem of&#xD;
      mis-diagnosed asthma, it is necessary to secure objective evidence of airway obstruction, and&#xD;
      if trial treatment is needed due to the clinical urgency of the patient's respiratory&#xD;
      condition, reassessment with lung function test is mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CE-marked AsthmaTuner provides doctors and nurses with daily automated percentage&#xD;
      calculations of diurnal and weekly variability of PEF or forced expiratory volume in one&#xD;
      second (FEV1) in close relation with the patient's symptoms, thereby supporting asthma care&#xD;
      with information if the patient has variable expiratory airflow limitation and a history of&#xD;
      typical asthma symptoms. These collected data contain unexpected amounts of information for&#xD;
      correct diagnosis of individuals with asthma and different phenotypes. Hence, AsthmaTuner may&#xD;
      improve the quality of asthma care and support more precise diagnosis according to objective&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria based on lung function, and if correctly validated and applied, reduce&#xD;
      the problem with over- and under-diagnosis in asthma care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity to establish&#xD;
      objective asthma diagnosis with spirometry including reversibility test and PEF-monitoring&#xD;
      with AsthmaTuner, and secondary, assess the number of asthma patients with objective verified&#xD;
      asthma diagnosis with use of spirometry including reversibility test and/or periodic&#xD;
      variability with PEF/FEV1 between traditional trial treatment and treatment with AsthmaTuner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population At least 146 participants will be included who are at least six years old,&#xD;
      with respiratory symptoms that can be signed to asthma last month or with diagnosed asthma&#xD;
      last five years, but no regular intake of anti-inflammatory treatment in the last three&#xD;
      months. Exclusion criteria are daily intake of asthma control medication, use of oral&#xD;
      corticosteroids, pregnancy, breast feeding, inability to perform spirometry, or a&#xD;
      contraindication of a severe a medical condition, i.e. heart failure or aorta or cerebral&#xD;
      aneurysm or history of myocardial infarction or stroke within three months or a smoking&#xD;
      history greater than ten pack-years (possible COPD). Patients will be included at Liljeholmen&#xD;
      Healthcare Centre, Ekerö Healthcare Centre in the region of Stockholm County Council, and&#xD;
      Närhälsan Färgelanda Healthcare Centre, Västra Götaland County Council in Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design This is a randomised controlled trial evaluating a diagnostic algorithm that includes&#xD;
      dynamic spirometry with a reversibility test, PEF/FEV1 monitoring with AsthmaTuner and&#xD;
      traditional trial treatment with dynamic spirometry with a reversibility test, PEF/FEV1&#xD;
      monitoring with AsthmaTuner and trial treatment with AsthmaTuner in a primary care setting.&#xD;
      In the first stage, each patient will perform spirometry with a reversibility test and two&#xD;
      weeks of daily monitoring with AsthmaTuner. Patients will be prescribed an inhaler with&#xD;
      beta-2 agonist to prevent respiratory symptoms during daily lung function measurements in&#xD;
      morning (after awaking) and evening. If any test is positive, the patient will fulfil the&#xD;
      study definition of current asthma. If both tests are negative, a trial treatment of at least&#xD;
      three months will be performed that is either traditional or with AsthmaTuner. The allocation&#xD;
      to either AsthmaTuner or trial treatment will be 1:1 and masked to investigator. After the&#xD;
      three months trial treatment, participants will at final clinical visit perform spirometry&#xD;
      with reversibility test. If current asthma is still unverified, physician may rule out asthma&#xD;
      medication and diagnosis or initiate further investigations including measures in the regular&#xD;
      clinical work-up or let patient continue with trial treatment up to 12 months after&#xD;
      inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AsthmaTuner (Medituner AB, Stockholm, Sweden) is a CE-marked cloud computing-based system&#xD;
      with a healthcare interface and a downloadable patient app (Android or iOS). Patients&#xD;
      download the app from the AppStore or Google Play and create a user account. The app consists&#xD;
      of two features: 1) diagnosis based on serial measurements of PEF/FEV1, and 2)&#xD;
      self-management with a physician-prescribed treatment recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intended use is to improve diagnosis and management of asthma with an automated clinical&#xD;
      decision support system called AsthmaTuner by letting patients register symptoms and measure&#xD;
      FEV1. The self-management feature consists of a treatment-adjusting algorithm that gives&#xD;
      patient immediate feedback on the status of symptom control (i.e. controlled, partly&#xD;
      controlled or uncontrolled) and a treatment recommendation with an image of the correct&#xD;
      inhaler or other type of medication and the dose. Symptom control is quantified based on lung&#xD;
      function, i.e. liter to percentage of personalized best FEV1 using a cut-off of ≤80% and&#xD;
      symptoms during the last week based on answers to four questions about the following: 1) the&#xD;
      need for rescue medication more than twice due to asthma symptoms, 2) any daytime symptoms,&#xD;
      3) nocturnal symptoms/awakenings, and 4) limitations in physical activities. AsthmaTuner&#xD;
      offers patients and health care providers longitudinal data views of assessed symptom&#xD;
      control, prescribed treatments and lung function measurements. The back-end data storage of&#xD;
      the cloud-based system provides information about participant adherence with AsthmaTuner use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic spirometry with reversibility test Lung function will be measured at study enrolment,&#xD;
      including analysis of FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC and forced expiratory flow&#xD;
      after 25-75% of vital capacity (FEF 25-75). A reversibility test will be performed after&#xD;
      intake of at least four standard doses of salbutamol or terbutaline. During trial treatment,&#xD;
      dynamic spirometry will be performed using AsthmaTuner online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires Participants will complete an electronic questionnaire concerning demographic&#xD;
      background factors, respiratory symptoms, treatment, and healthcare utilization at study&#xD;
      enrollment and again about respiratory symptoms at study end, as well as answer questions&#xD;
      about the usability and feasibility of using AsthmaTuner at study end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses The statistical power analysis is based on Aaron et al., who reported a&#xD;
      proportion of positive reversibility tests of 14 percentage points among 613 randomised&#xD;
      selected individuals with doctor-diagnosed asthma. An estimated proportion of 28% of&#xD;
      participants with asthma will have positive diurnal or weekly PEF/FEV1 variability of at&#xD;
      least 10% or more, including 146 participants who would provide a power of 80% at a 5%&#xD;
      significance level with adjustment for a 10% drop out rate. A receiver-operating&#xD;
      characteristic (ROC) curve will be plotted for spirometry and reversibility tests, and&#xD;
      PEF/FEV1 percentage variability given by AsthmaTuner with Spearmen's rank correlations to&#xD;
      estimate the predictive values. The optimal cut-off level for sensitivity and specificity&#xD;
      will be estimated based on the area under the curve.&#xD;
