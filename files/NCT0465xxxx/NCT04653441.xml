    <textblock>
      Parental illness and death from HIV/AIDS has a profound and lasting impact on a child's&#xD;
      psychosocial well-being, potentially challenging the basic needs for survival and&#xD;
      compromising the child's future. Therefore, the impact of parental HIV/AIDS on children needs&#xD;
      to be treated from both a public health and a developmental perspective. However, to date the&#xD;
      role of a resilience-based approach among children affected by HIV is hypothesized but not&#xD;
      evidence-based. In this application, we propose to develop a theory-guided, resilience-based,&#xD;
      multimodal intervention by culturally adapting and integrating components from three SAMHSA&#xD;
      model programs which show strong evidence in promoting protective factors among young&#xD;
      children. The multimodal intervention will include three approach levels: the individual&#xD;
      child (peer-group activities), the family (caregiver parenting skill training), and the local&#xD;
      community (community advocacy). The short, medium, and long-term efficacy of the&#xD;
      Child-Caregiver-Advocacy-Resilience [ChildCARE] intervention to improve health and&#xD;
      psychosocial well-being of children will be evaluated over 36 months through a cluster&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial. About 800 HIV/AIDS-affected children (8 to 11 years of age) and&#xD;
      their primary caregivers will be recruited from central China where we have built a strong&#xD;
      research infrastructure and community collaboration during our previous study. The primary&#xD;
      outcome measures for the children will include physical health, mental health, growth and&#xD;
      development, school performance, and a biological indicator of neurobiological stress&#xD;
      response (salivary cortisol). The outcome measures at caregiver level will include parenting&#xD;
      style, parental engagement, and mental health well-being. The changes at the community level&#xD;
      will be measured using children's and caregivers' perceptions of social support and&#xD;
      HIV-related public stigma. We will also examine the potential mechanism through which the&#xD;
      ChildCARE intervention is exerting its impact by identifying improvement in protective&#xD;
      factors and other individual and contextual factors that potentially mediate or moderate the&#xD;
      intervention effect. This proposed project will examine whether the multilevel protective&#xD;
      factors we identified in our initial project are amenable to intervention and whether their&#xD;
      hypothesized changes explain improvement in children outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      During the past five years (09/05-08/10) we were funded by R01MH76488 to study the&#xD;
      psychosocial needs of children affected by HIV including both orphans (children under 18 who&#xD;
      lost one or both of their parents to HIV/AIDS) and vulnerable children (children with one or&#xD;
      both parents infected with HIV) in rural China. The overarching goal of our previous study&#xD;
      was to inform the development of effective, culturally appropriate, and sustainable&#xD;
      psychosocial interventions for these children. Guided by a developmental psychopathology&#xD;
      perspective, we constructed an assessment model that integrated research findings from the&#xD;
      literatures on bereavement, attachment, risk and resilience to delineate the children's&#xD;
      psychosocial needs following HIV-related parental death or illness1. We incorporated both&#xD;
      individual and environmental factors that potentially could moderate or mediate the negative&#xD;
      effects of parental HIV/AIDS on these children. The comprehensive qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative data we collected and reported in 29 peer-reviewed publications during the past&#xD;
      five years have provided the critical foundation for a cultural adaptation of theory-driven&#xD;
      psychosocial prevention programs among children affected by HIV. The main findings from this&#xD;
      body of research included 1) children affected by HIV experienced greater mental and&#xD;
      developmental challenges (e.g., trauma symptoms, depression, social isolation, poor school&#xD;
      performance) than comparison children who were from the same community but did not experience&#xD;
      HIV-related illness and death in their families; 2) some children demonstrated tremendous&#xD;
      resilience reflected in good school performances and the absence of elevated levels of&#xD;
      psychosocial problems despite parental HIV/AIDS and other traumatic events in their lives;&#xD;
      and, 3) key protective factors exist within the child and the social environment (e.g.,&#xD;
      positive future orientation, trusted caregivers, and supportive community) which could&#xD;
      contribute to resilience in these children, and hence buffer the children from the&#xD;
      detrimental effects of parental HIV/AIDS. The proposed project will examine whether the&#xD;
      protective factors identified in our previous study are amenable to intervention and whether&#xD;
      their hypothesized changes can indeed explain improvement in mental and developmental&#xD;
      outcomes among participating children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From research on early childhood development, compelling evidence has revealed the critical&#xD;
      importance of successful adaptation in the face of adversity (&quot;resilience&quot;) for laying the&#xD;
      foundation for successful adjustment later in life2-4. However, to date the utility of a&#xD;
      resilience-based intervention approach among children affected by HIV is hypothesized but not&#xD;
      evidence-based5-6.Therefore, in this application, we propose to adapt three evidence-based&#xD;
      programs to produce a theory-driven resilience-based intervention to improve the well-being&#xD;
      of children affected by HIV in rural China. The proposed multimodal &quot;Child&#xD;
      Caregiver-Advocacy-Resilience&quot; intervention (ChildCARE) will include three integrated&#xD;
      components: the individual child (peer-group activities), family (caregiver parenting skill&#xD;
      training), and the local community (community advocacy). The short, medium, and long-term&#xD;
      efficacy of the ChildCARe intervention will be evaluated over 36 months through a cluster&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT). The primary outcome measures for the children will include&#xD;
      physical health, mental health, growth and development, school performance, and a biological&#xD;
      indicator of neurobiological stress response (i.e., salivary cortisol). There are three&#xD;
      specific aims and four hypotheses in our application:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM #1: Develop a theory-guided, resilience-based, multimodal intervention [ChildCARe] by&#xD;
      culturally adapting and integrating components from three SAMHSA model programs which show&#xD;
      strong evidence in promoting protective factors among children; the adaptation process will&#xD;
      be informed by 1) the data collected from our previous study; 2) our 18 years' experience in&#xD;
      developing and adapting effective HIV behavioral prevention programs in various cultural&#xD;
      settings including China; and 3) input from the local collaborators and communities (e.g.,&#xD;
      community advisory board and research participants); AIM #2: Test the efficacy of the&#xD;
      ChildCARe intervention through a cluster RCT involving 800 HIV-affected children (8 to 11&#xD;
      years of age) and their primary caregivers from 80 villages in central China where we have&#xD;
      built a strong research infrastructure and community collaboration during our previous study;&#xD;
      AIM #3: Examine the potential mechanism of the intervention by identifying improvement in&#xD;
      protective factors and other individual and contextual factors that potentially mediate or&#xD;
      moderate the intervention effect;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #1: The ChildCARe intervention will demonstrate short, medium, and long-term&#xD;
      efficacy in improving children's primary outcomes and biological indicator (salivary&#xD;
      cortisol); Hypothesis #2: The ChildCARE intervention will demonstrate short, medium, and&#xD;
      long-term efficacy in improving children's intermediate outcomes (e.g., social-emotional&#xD;
      competence, positive future orientation, and trusting relationship with current caregivers),&#xD;
      caregiver's outcomes (e.g., parenting skills, mental health well-being), and community-level&#xD;
      outcomes (e.g., children's and caregivers' perceptions of social support); Hypothesis #3:&#xD;
      Improvement in intermediate outcomes at levels of child, family, and community will mediate&#xD;
      the effect of the ChildCARE intervention on the children's primary outcomes and biological&#xD;
      indicator; Hypothesis #4: Some contextual factors (e.g., care arrangement, household&#xD;
      socioeconomic status [SES], caregiver's physical health status, disease progression for&#xD;
      caregivers living with HIV) will moderate the effect of ChildCARE intervention on the&#xD;
      children's primary outcomes and biological indicator.&#xD;
