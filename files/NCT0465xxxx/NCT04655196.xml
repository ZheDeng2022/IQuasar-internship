  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, people who suffer from loneliness will be randomized to three study&#xD;
      conditions. The first and second group get an account to an internet-based self-help&#xD;
      intervention. The first group also receives weekly feedback from a coach and the second group&#xD;
      receives an automated email on a weekly basis. The third group is a waiting control group. In&#xD;
      all three conditions additional care or treatment is allowed. The aim of the study is to&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy of an internet-based self-help intervention to reduce feelings of&#xD;
      loneliness compared to a waiting list and the effect of support during the intervention.&#xD;
      Assessments are at baseline, 5-week, 10-week, 6-months and 12-months post-randomization.&#xD;
      Participants in the waiting control group get also access to the intervention and fill out&#xD;
      questionnaires at baseline, 5-week and 10-week post-randomization and get also access to the&#xD;
      intervention 10 weeks after randomization.&#xD;
