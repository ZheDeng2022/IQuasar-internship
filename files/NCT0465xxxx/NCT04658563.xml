      Purpose: Specific effects of high-density Hatha Yoga(HY) training in adolescents have not yet&#xD;
      been clarified. Aim of our study is to investigate the effects of high-density HY education&#xD;
      on physical fitness, pulmonary function and quality of life in healthy adolescents. Methods:&#xD;
      28 female adolescents will be randomly divided into two groups as yoga training and control&#xD;
      groups. Training group will receive high-density HY training for 8 weeks, two days a week&#xD;
      under the supervision of a physiotherapist and one day a week home program. Control group&#xD;
      will not receive any exercise. Flexibility of individuals will be determined by sit-reach,&#xD;
      back scratching, lateral flexion tests; muscular endurance by sit-ups, sit down-stand up on&#xD;
      chair tests, balance by time up-go test; cardiorespiratory capacity by incremental shuttle&#xD;
      walking test(ISWT) and respiratory functions by spirometry, quality of life will be&#xD;
      determined by with the Quality of Life Scale for Children.&#xD;

    <measure>Assessment of Respiratory Functions</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The pulmonary functions of the individuals will be evaluated in the sitting position using the portable spirometer device (COSMED, Micro Quark Spirometer, Rome, Italy) according to the ATS/ERS criteria. The individuals who participated in the study will be informed about the test before the test. The test will be repeated twice and the best results will be recorded. The individual is seated on a chair without a cuff, a latch is attached to his nose, his mouth is asked to be closed tightly so that the edges of the mouths could fully grasp the device. In respiratory function test, forced vital capacity (FVC) (Liter-L and %), first-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1)(L and %), FEV1/FVC, peak flow rate (PEF)(L/second), 25-75% of forced expiratory flow rate (FEF (25-75%)(L)), inspiratory capacity (IC) (L) and vital capasity (VC) (L) values will be recorded along with expected values and percentages by age, height, body weight and gender.</description>

    <description>The form which is prepared for adolescents aged 13-18 and validated and reliable in our country of The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. The 23 items of the scale developed for children aged 2-18 are scored between 0-100; the answers will be 100 if 'never' are preferred, 75 if 'rarely, 50 if 'sometimes, 25 if 'often, and 0 if 'always,. The higher the total score, the better the quality of life is.</description>

    <description>A total of 8 weeks will be applied in our study, each session of the high-density yoga program will be started with 10 minute pranayama (breath) exercises as it is in classical yoga as a preliminary preparation for the participation of individuals; the program will be completed by applying 10-20 minutes warming-stretching movements, 40 minutes surya namaskar (SN) sets, 20-30 minutes dynamic yoga asanas and 10 minutes savasana. Participants will be encouraged to study the perceived difficulty levels between 14 and 17 using the Borg scale during the sessions</description>
