  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Varus positioning is the most common femoral malposition in total hip arthroplasty (THA). The&#xD;
      aim of this study was to compare the long-term results of an anatomical cementless femoral&#xD;
      stem positioned in varus with those in neutral alignment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data were prospectively collected and retrospectively reviewed for all patients who received&#xD;
      a cementless anatomical femoral stem in THA between 1998 and 2008. After exclusion criteria&#xD;
      applied, 127 stems had an varus axis deviated by more than 3 degrees (varus group) and 156&#xD;
      had an alignment between 0 and 2.9° from the femoral axis (neutral group). Survivorship&#xD;
      rates, complications, clinical scores, thigh pain, radiological score, cortical hypertrophy&#xD;
      and filling rate were analyzed. Mean follow-up was 10 years.&#xD;

    <description>Radiographic stem axis was assessed on standard anteroposterior hip radiographs performed at the 3-month follow-up visit. Alignment was evaluated as described by Reina et al., by the angular deviation of the anatomic femoral axis and the stem axis. The 3 degrees minimal-value was considered to be the threshold defining a varus stem.</description>

        The investigators identified all patients who underwent proximal HA-coated anatomic tapered&#xD;
        femoral stem primary THAs between October 1998 and July 2008, through our institutional&#xD;
        total joint registry. The data were prospectively collected on the Orthowave© database.&#xD;
        This included patients who had an uncemented ABG-2 stem (Stryker, Mahwah, NJ). The study&#xD;
        was a test-case retrospective analysis and an institutional review board approval was&#xD;
        obtained prior to initiation of the study.&#xD;
