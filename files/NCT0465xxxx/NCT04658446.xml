      Comparing two indirect bonding techniques. Augmented Reality-assisted bonding and Digital 3D&#xD;
      printed indirect bonding trays in regards to patient convenience, accuracy of bracket&#xD;
      placement and time consumption of each technique used.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Augmented reality is a relatively new addition to the digital armamentarium. It is becoming&#xD;
      increasingly popular especially among surgeons, whether general or dental. In light of the&#xD;
      clinicians whom have relied on augmented reality in their fields of work, it was suggested&#xD;
      that an augmented reality-assisted orthodontic bonding guide be of use. Such an application&#xD;
      would theoretically solve many issues of the indirect bonding techniques at hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we shall investigate whether the theory behind such an augmented&#xD;
      reality-assisted bonding guide is on par with the digitally-assisted indirect bonding in&#xD;
      terms of patient convenience, accuracy of bracket placement and time consumption of the&#xD;
      bonding process, to see whether it qualifies to be a method among all the other methods&#xD;
      stated in the literature for indirect bonding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital indirect bonding has many advantages, one of which is achieving greater accuracy in&#xD;
      bracket positioning, however it has some down sides such as excess composite flashes around&#xD;
      brackets after curing and the cost of 3D printing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the Study Is to evaluate the patients' convenience upon using the newly introduced&#xD;
      augmented reality-assisted bonding guide in comparison to the digitally-assisted indirect&#xD;
      bonding tray. Secondary objectives such as accuracy and procedure time consumption between&#xD;
      the two methods are also of importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis There will be no difference in the patients' convenience, accuracy and&#xD;
      procedure time consumption between the two methods proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design Split-mouth, randomized, clinical superiority trial with 1:1 allocation ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size 96 Teeth with different attachments (Brackets and Tubes)&#xD;
