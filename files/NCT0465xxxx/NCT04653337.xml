  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is relatively insufficient evidence on whether rTMS can improve suicidal ideation in&#xD;
      depressive patients. And existing studies have been inconsistent in the treatment of&#xD;
      depressive suicidal thoughts. The possible reason is inaccurate stimuli localization.&#xD;
      Improving the accuracy of rTMS stimulus positioning may further improve the intervention&#xD;
      effect of suicidal ideation. This study will introduce an automated TMS system with robot&#xD;
      control and optical sensor combined with neuronavigation softwarea. By using the robot based&#xD;
      on neuronavigation system, the rTMS coil can be accurately positioned over any preselected&#xD;
      brain region. An infrared optical measurement device is also used in order to detect and&#xD;
      compensate for head movements of the patient. The purpose of this randomized double-blind and&#xD;
      sham-controlled study is to test the efficacy and safety of robot-assisted rTMS based on&#xD;
      neuronavigation in the treatment of depressive suicidal ideation.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, after 7 days of treatment, after 15 days of treatment and at 2 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome measured by a change in BSI-CV score from baseline to 2 weeks post-treatment. BSI-CV is a self-reported questionnaire with 19 items. Each item is rated on a 3 point scale from 0 to 2. Scores range from 0 to 48. Total scoreScores of 0 - 16 indicate low risk for suicide; scores of 16 or greater indicate higher risk for suicide.</description>

    <description>Outcome measured by a change in HAMD-17 score from baseline to 2 weeks post-treatment.The HAMD Total Score comprises a sum of the 17 individual item scores. Each item is rated on a 3 point scale from 0 to 2. The Total Score can range from 0 to 52, and higher scores indicate a greater degree of depression. Response is defined as having a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in HAMD total score. Remission is defined as having a HAMD total score of ≤7</description>
