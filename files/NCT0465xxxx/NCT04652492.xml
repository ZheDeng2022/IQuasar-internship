    <textblock>
      This is a multicentric, open-label, single-arm prospective study to assess the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of tislelizumab combined with conventional transarterial chemoembolization(cTACE) as&#xD;
      first-line treatment in BCLC stage C HCC patients without extrahepatic spread. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is time to progression (TTP).&#xD;
