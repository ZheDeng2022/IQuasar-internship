      Infusion Treatment Using Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cell (bmMSC) Derived Extracellular&#xD;
      Vesicle Product, ExoFlo™, for COVID-19 Associated ARDS (EXIT COVID-19), is currently being&#xD;
      studied in Protocol DB-EF-PhaseII-001 in patients with COVID-19 associated moderate to severe&#xD;
      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This expanded access protocol is an open-label study intended to provide ExoFlo to critically&#xD;
      ill patients who do not qualify for the Phase II randomized controlled trial because they:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do not meet phase II eligibility criteria at current phase II sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do meet phase II eligibility criteria but cannot access phase II sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do not meet phase II eligibility criteria &amp; cannot access phase II sites. •&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent form (either by the individual or by&#xD;
             the individual's healthcare proxy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the&#xD;
             duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male or female of any age ≥ 18 years of age.&#xD;

             Reaction (RT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Moderate to severe ARDS as defined by modified Berlin definition (see Table 3), which&#xD;
             includes timing within 1 week of known clinical insult or new or worsening respiratory&#xD;
             symptoms; bilateral opacities not fully explained by effusions, or lung collapse;&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Acute presentation of hypoxia requiring noninvasive oxygen support such as NC, NRB,&#xD;

             double barrier method OR maintenance of abstinence must include the time from the&#xD;
             beginning of the screening period until 90 days following the last dose of the study&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
