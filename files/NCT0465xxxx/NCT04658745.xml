      The study aims to test the hypothesis that rTMS in the form of theta burst stimulation (TBS)&#xD;
      over the ipsilateral and contralateral motor cortices can modulate mirror illusion-induced&#xD;
      rhythm suppression while observing unilateral arm movement in stroke individuals. The&#xD;
      investigators further hypothesize that this intervention will lead to the revision of&#xD;
      interhemispheric asymmetry. Finally, this study will also explore the longitudinal&#xD;
      relationship between rhythm suppression and motor recovery as indicated by motor excitability&#xD;
      in the form of MEP. The results of this study will provide significant new information&#xD;
      regarding neurophysiological motor relearning mechanisms which could inform the development&#xD;
      and evaluation of innovative treatments for individuals with stroke&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of physical disability. Facilitating the process of motor&#xD;
      relearning would greatly accelerate the rehabilitation of motor functions and elicit positive&#xD;
      neuroplasticity of the damaged brain area. Previous research has already explored the&#xD;
      feasibility of motor priming techniques embedded in stroke rehabilitation programs using&#xD;
      strategies such as non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) and mirror therapy (MT). These&#xD;
      treatments are usually implemented along with the standardized rehabilitation, sequentially&#xD;
      or simultaneously, and have been demonstrated to be more effective than the standardized&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mirror neuron, as indicated traditionally by the decrease in the amplitude of Mu rhythm, i.e.&#xD;
      a suppression over central electrodes of electroencephalography (EEG), reflects the &quot;seeing&quot;&#xD;
      of movement after &quot;perception&quot;. Such oscillations are based on neural substrates that are&#xD;
      discharged during the observation and execution of a motor act, which is also associated with&#xD;
      other human functions, such as imitation, language, etc. The core mirror neuron system (MNS)&#xD;
      is thought to be located in the premotor and the primary sensorimotor cortices, indicating&#xD;
      that motor learning could be enhanced during action observation and overt movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary research has shown that repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) can&#xD;
      enhance the corticomotor excitability in mirror neurons during both observation of movement&#xD;
      (by others) or imagined movement in healthy subjects; in particular, as measured by enhanced&#xD;
      motor evoked potentials (MEP). Increases in MEP has also been induced by short-term action&#xD;
      observation and mirror visual feedback in stroke survivors. However, it is not yet known if&#xD;
      MNS can be activated by TMS in MT following a stroke, and the relationship between mirror&#xD;
      neuron activation and clinical improvements in stroke remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have already published preliminary findings in patients with hemiplegic&#xD;
      upper extremity, rTMS, and MT. Here, the investigators propose to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      rTMS in the form of theta-burst stimulation (TBS) over the ipsilateral and contralateral&#xD;
      motor cortices can modulate mirror illusion-induced rhythm suppression while observing&#xD;
      unilateral arm movement in stroke individuals. The investigators further hypothesize that&#xD;
      this intervention will lead to the revision of interhemispheric asymmetry. Finally, this&#xD;
      study will also explore the longitudinal relationship between rhythm suppression and motor&#xD;
      recovery as indicated by motor excitability in the form of MEP. The results of this study&#xD;
      will provide significant new information regarding neurophysiological motor relearning&#xD;
      mechanisms which could inform the development and evaluation of innovative treatments for&#xD;
      individuals with stroke&#xD;
