  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Being physically active and exercising is important for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes as&#xD;
      it helps control blood sugar and improve physical function. Lots of people find it hard to be&#xD;
      physically active and sticking with exercise is difficult for most people. In this project we&#xD;
      will investigate two strategies to support people with Type 2 diabetes to increase and then&#xD;
      maintain a physically active lifestyle, which includes exercising regularly. Participants in&#xD;
      one group (Exercise Counselling) will complete a 6-month structured exercise and physical&#xD;
      activity programme supported by regular (virtual) contact with an exercise specialist.&#xD;
      Participants in the second group (Mobile health technology (mHealth)) will receive the same&#xD;
      6-month exercise and physical activity programme supported by an exercise specialist, but&#xD;
      participants in this group will also receive a fitness watch that links to a mobile phone&#xD;
      application (App). The fitness watch and mobile App will allow the exercise specialist to&#xD;
      provide greater support and feedback throughout the programme.&#xD;
