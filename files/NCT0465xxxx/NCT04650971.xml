  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase I clinical study of the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, reactogenicity and immunogenic activity of the universal influenza vector&#xD;
      vaccine &quot;UniFluVec&quot; at two dose levels after two intranasal administrations in healthy&#xD;
      adults. The volunteers randomized to the study group received intranasally 0.5 ml of the&#xD;
      vaccine (0.25 ml in each nostril) as nasal aerosol stray twice with an interval of 3 weeks.&#xD;
      The vaccine of the first dose level contained 6.7 log EID50/0.5 ml (50% egg infective dose)&#xD;
      of attenuated recombinant influenza A/H1N1pdm09 virus; vaccine of the second dose level&#xD;
      contained 7.7 log EID50/0.5 ml of attenuated recombinant influenza A/H1N1pdm09 virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      reactogenicity profile of vaccine &quot;UniFluVec&quot; based on the frequency and severity of adverse&#xD;
      events. The secondary objective of the study was to assess the immunogenicity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One center located in Russia (Saint-Petersburg) was approved for participation in this study.&#xD;
      The study consisted of 3 periods: screening, double vaccination with an interval of 3 weeks&#xD;
      and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible subjects were randomized into the study in appropriate cohort groups&#xD;
      sequentially. Randomization was performed within each cohort in ratio 2:1 to the vaccine and&#xD;
      placebo groups, respectively:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1 (total 30 volunteers) - 20 volunteers received the vaccine twice, 6.7 log&#xD;
           EID50/dose; 10 volunteers received Placebo twice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2 (total 30 volunteers) - 20 volunteers received the vaccine twice, 7.7 log&#xD;
           EID50/dose; 10 volunteers received Placebo twice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to administer the second dose of vaccine or increased vaccine dose (cohort 2)&#xD;
      was approved by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee on the basis of preliminary safety&#xD;
      results assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up period lasted 3 months after the second vaccination.&#xD;

    <description>Adverse events (AEs) were summarized per treatment arm according to the current Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (medDRA) version 21.1. For each preferred term, frequency counts and percentages were calculated.&#xD;
Related and unrelated AEs were assessed.&#xD;
Special attention was paid to vaccine-specific significant AEs:&#xD;
Immediate AEs occurring within two hours after administration of the vaccine and detected both by the medical personnel and based on the information provided by the volunteer to the research staff.&#xD;
Post-vaccination reactions (foreseen local and systemic clinical signs), usually caused by intranasal vaccination within two hours and the subsequent 7 days after administration of the vaccine.</description>
