    <textblock>
      This prospective double-blinded randomized study will be conducted to compare&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided intra-articular injection and ultrasound-guided genicular nerve block for&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia after knee arthroscopy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arthroscopic knee surgery has become increasingly popular in modern orthopedics.&#xD;
      Post-operative knee pain management has become a challenge to provide early relief and&#xD;
      pain-free postoperative care to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain management has become a priority for management as a daycare procedure. Patients&#xD;
      operated as a daycare procedure should have minimal postoperative pain which influences the&#xD;
      timing of discharge. Pain is due to multifactorial causes such as irritation of free nerve&#xD;
      endings of the joint capsule, synovial tissue, anterior fat pad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective pain relief allows the patients to obtain early knee mobilization and optimal&#xD;
      rehabilitation and thus improves patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain after knee arthroscopy is commonly moderate to severe and can affect the&#xD;
      patient's activity level and satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort to provide safe, effective, and long-lasting post-arthroscopy pain relief, many&#xD;
      drug regimens were injected intra-articularly including local anesthetics alone or with&#xD;
      additive drugs to prolong and improve the quality of postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genicular nerve block (GNB) and ablation have been used for managing chronic pain from knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis with good success.&#xD;

    <description>will receive ultrasound guided intraarticular injection consisting of 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine before surgical procedure. The surgical procedure will be started 30 min after intraarticular injection.</description>

    <arm_group_label>genicular nerve block group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>will receive ultrasound guided genicular nerve block at three nerves, i.e., superomedial, superolateral, and inferomedial genicular nerves consisting of 15 ml bupivacaine 0.25% before surgical procedure. The surgical procedure will be started 30 min after genicular nerve block.</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>intra-articular injection</intervention_name>
    <description>The injection will be performed under ultrasound guidance by placing the patient's knee in approximately 90° of flexion with the leg hanging off the side of the bed (left). A high-frequency linear transducer ultrasound probe is placed in the superolateral corner of the patella, directed medially toward the patellofemoral joint space. In the extended leg, from anterior to posterior, the right image shows the quadriceps femoris tendon (QF), suprapatellar fat pad (SF), suprapatellar bursa (SB), prefemoral fat pad (PF), and femur (F). When the knee is flexed to 90°, the size of the suprapatellar bursa image is increased. Using an in-plane approach, the needle will be directed into the suprapatellar joint space, and 20 ml of bupivacaine 0.25% will be injected.</description>

    <intervention_name>genicular nerve block</intervention_name>
    <description>The transducer will be first placed parallel to the long bone shaft and moved up or down to identify the epicondyle of the long bone. The genicular arteries will be identified near the periosteal areas, confirmed by color Doppler ultrasound. Accordingly, genicular nerve block target points should be next to each genicular artery. After using color Doppler to confirm the genicular artery, the needle will be inserted in the plane of the ultrasound probe in the long-axis view. a gentle aspiration will be performed and a 2 mL injection volume will be administered.</description>
