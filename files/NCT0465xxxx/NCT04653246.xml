    <textblock>
      This research is testing whether the investigational drug isatuximab is safe and effective&#xD;
      when used in combination with standard agents for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, single-arm, open-label, Phase 2 study in patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) eligible for high dose therapy (HDT) and autologous stem&#xD;
      cell transplant (ASCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, investigators are evaluating whether isatuximab is safe and effective&#xD;
      in participants with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma when given in combination with&#xD;
      lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethsone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This research study involves administration of a four-drug chemotherapy regimen that&#xD;
           combines the Investigational drug isatuximab with a standard chemotherapy regimen&#xD;
           comprised of lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This 4-drug regimen is not considered standard of the treatment of newly diagnosed&#xD;
           multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug or combination of drugs to learn whether the&#xD;
      drug works in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved lenalidomide, bortezomib, and&#xD;
      dexamethasone as treatment options for this disease but the combination of these agents with&#xD;
      isatuximab hasn't been approved.&#xD;
