  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF), often referred to as an 'irregular heartbeat', is the most common&#xD;
      abnormal heart rhythm worldwide. AF may be intermittent (termed paroxysmal) or sustained&#xD;
      (termed persistent).Catheter ablation is increasingly being used to manage individuals with&#xD;
      AF, however in a significant proportion of cases AF recurs. Such rhythm control interventions&#xD;
      are known to be less effective in individuals with persistent AF compared with those with&#xD;
      paroxysmal AF. Analysis of heart tissue of individuals with AF show deposition of scar tissue&#xD;
      within the heart muscle and this scar tissue promotes abnormal electrical activity that is&#xD;
      involved in causing AF. The aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the feasibility and&#xD;
      effectiveness of combining conventional pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) during catheter&#xD;
      ablation for AF with adjunctive substrate ablation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, non-randomized study investigating the feasibility, safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of substrate guided ablation in persistent AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be patients between the ages of 18 and 80 with symptomatic,&#xD;
      persistent atrial fibrillation (≥1 year) referred for catheter ablation on standard clinical&#xD;
      grounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The catheter ablation procedure will be performed using the Precision Ensite™ three&#xD;
      dimensional mapping system and the Advisor High Density Grid™ mapping catheter (Abbott&#xD;
      Medical Incorporated). All patients will undergo conventional pulmonary vein isolation (PVI).&#xD;
      As an adjunctive strategy to PVI, low voltage areas (used as a surrogate for atrial scar), as&#xD;
      derived from the voltage map, will be targeted for ablation in order to isolate or homogenise&#xD;
      these areas of the atrium. A pre-procedural cardiac magnetic resonance imaging scan will be&#xD;
      performed in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo 12 months follow-up with an ECG and ambulatory holter monitoring at&#xD;
      3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
