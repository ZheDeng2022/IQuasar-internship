    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JNJ-64304500 as add-on&#xD;
      therapy to standard of care (SOC) biologic treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha or&#xD;
      anti-interleukin 12/23 inhibitors in participants with active Crohn's disease in response but&#xD;
      not remission to SOC biologic therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biologic agents such as anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-12/23&#xD;
      antagonists have become the standard of care (SOC) in the treatment of patients with Crohn's&#xD;
      disease. However, many patients fail to fully respond to treatment. This study will evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of 10 week add on treatment with JNJ-64304500, compared to placebo, in patients&#xD;
      taking SOC anti-TNF or anti-IL12/23 biologics. The study consists of a screening phase (up to&#xD;
      8 weeks); treatment phase (up to 12 weeks and follow-up phase (up to 16 weeks after the last&#xD;
      administration of study agent). The total study duration will be up to 34 weeks. Key safety&#xD;
      assessments include adverse events, clinical laboratory tests (hematology and chemistry),&#xD;
      vital signs, monitoring for injection-site and hypersensitivity reactions, and early&#xD;
      detection of active tuberculosis.&#xD;

    <description>An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product. TEAEs are AEs with onset during the intervention phase or that are a consequence of a preexisting condition that has worsened since baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the CDAI score at Week 12 will be reported.
