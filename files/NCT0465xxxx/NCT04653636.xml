  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify clinical and MRI factors associated to a better&#xD;
      response to arthrographic distension in patients with severe capsulitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting to the physical medicine and rehabilitation department [tertiary care] of&#xD;
      Cochin Hospital for severe adhesive capsulitis for whom first-line medical treatment is not&#xD;
      effective. The first-line treatment including analgesic, NSAIDs and / or intra-articular&#xD;
      infiltration of a corticosteroid derivative and multi-weekly physiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients are integrated into a usual protocol (routine care) consisting of performing&#xD;
      an MRI with intravenous injection of gadolinium to confirm the diagnostic and eliminated&#xD;
      others causes of shoulder stiffness. IV gadolinium-enhanced MRI can increase the performance&#xD;
      of the signal analysis changes of the Synovium and capsule in the Axillary Recess and Rotator&#xD;
      interval as compared with unenhanced measures The treatment consists in one to three&#xD;
      arthrographic distensions by physiological serum, xylocaine 1% and injection of an ampoule of&#xD;
      corticosteroids (DIPROSTENE) associated with intensive (immediate mobilization, recovery of&#xD;
      maximum amplitudes by the physiotherapist and on arthro-motor). The primary objective of&#xD;
      arthrographic distension is the expansion and rupture of the glenohumeral capsule in the&#xD;
      subscapularis recess. It consists after local anesthesia, in an injection under pressure of&#xD;
      air or liquid - opacifier or physiological serum - in the glenohumeral joint associated with&#xD;
      an infiltration of cortisone derivatives at the end of the operation. Physical treatment&#xD;
      aimed at rapid amplitude gain is started immediately after the arthrographic distension,&#xD;
      under the effect of local anesthesia. It is at best continued daily at a rate of 2 to 8 hours&#xD;
      per day for one to 2 weeks. Depending on the effect obtained on pain and the daily&#xD;
      progression of rehabilitation, arthro-distension may be repeated once or twice during the&#xD;
      mobilization period.&#xD;

    <description>Patient reported questionnaire which specifically focuses on how a patient's fear avoidance beliefs about physical activity and work.&#xD;
The questionnaire consists of 16 items in which a patient rates their agreement with each statement on a 7-point Likert scale. Where 0= completely disagree, 6=completely agree. There is a maximum score of 96. A higher score indicates more strongly held fear avoidance beliefs There are two subscales; the work subscale (FABQw) with 7 questions (maximum score of 42) and the physical activity subscale (FABQpa) with 4 questions (maximum score of 24).</description>
