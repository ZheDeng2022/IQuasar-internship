      This phase II trial studies the effect of polatuzumab vedotin, venetoclax, and rituximab and&#xD;
      hyaluronidase human in treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma that has come back&#xD;
      (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Polatuzumab vedotin is a monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody, polatuzumab, linked to a toxic agent called vedotin. Polatuzumab attaches to CD79B&#xD;
      positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. Venetoclax may&#xD;
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Rituximab hyaluronidase is a combination of rituximab and hyaluronidase. Rituximab binds to a&#xD;
      molecule called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types&#xD;
      of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Hyaluronidase allows&#xD;
      rituximab to be given by injection under the skin. Giving rituximab and hyaluronidase by&#xD;
      injection under the skin is faster than giving rituximab alone by infusion into the blood.&#xD;
      Giving polatuzumab vedotin, venetoclax, and rituximab and hyaluronidase human may work better&#xD;
      than standard therapy in treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the end of induction (EOI) complete response rate (CR) for treatment with the&#xD;
      regimen of rituximab and hyaluronidase human + polatuzumab vedotin + venetoclax (RSC + Pola +&#xD;
      Ven) in relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the EOI overall response rate (ORR) for the combination of RSC + Pola + Ven in&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory MCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the best response (CR, partial response [PR]) in patients who continue on to&#xD;
      maintenance therapy and evaluate the improvement in the depth of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for the&#xD;
      combination of RSC + Pola + Ven) in relapsed/ refractory MCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To compare the ORR, CR, PFS, and OS in ibrutinib refractory compared to ibrutinib naive&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate regimen-related toxicity for patients treated with RSC + Pola + Ven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate changes in minimal residual disease (MRD) status in both responding and&#xD;
      non-responding patients at EOI and end of maintenance and compared to baseline as well as&#xD;
      correlate MRD status with PFS and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate changes in systemic immune profiles and T cell activation induced by&#xD;
      treatment with RituxSC (RSC) + Pola + Ven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the prognostic importance of high risk cytogenetic alterations, and other&#xD;
      risk stratification scores in patients with relapsed/refractory MCL receiving RituxSC + Pola&#xD;
      + Ven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on day 1 of cycle 1 and rituximab&#xD;
      and hyaluronidase human subcutaneously (SC) over 5 minutes on day 1 of cycles 2-6. Patients&#xD;
      also receive polatuzumab vedotin IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and venetoclax orally (PO)&#xD;
      daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive venetoclax PO daily and rituximab and hyaluronidase human SC&#xD;
      over 5 minutes every 60 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 90 days for up to 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
