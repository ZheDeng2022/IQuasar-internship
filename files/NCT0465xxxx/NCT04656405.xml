    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new online real-time quality&#xD;
      measurement and feedback video-based CPR training program. The study participants will be&#xD;
      allocated to three different CPR training programs: online real-time quality measurement and&#xD;
      feedback video-based CPR training program, online real-time feedback video-based CPR training&#xD;
      without quality measurement program, and conventional CPR training program. After CPR&#xD;
      training, each participant will perform a 6 minute CPR simulation test. The investigators&#xD;
      will compare the quality of chest compression between the three study groups. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the new online real-time quality measurement and feedback&#xD;
      video-based CPR training program is non-inferior to the preexisting conventional CPR training&#xD;
      program and is superior to online real-time feedback video-based CPR training without quality&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bystander CPR is important for the survival of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients. CPR&#xD;
      training for the general public is important to improve the rate and quality of bystander&#xD;
      CPR. Preexisting CPR education was conducted under face-to-face contact with instructors and&#xD;
      multiple trainees gathering at a training center, but after the coronavirus disease 2019&#xD;
      pandemic, face-to-face training became difficult. To overcome this limitation the&#xD;
      investigators have developed a new online real-time quality measurement and feedback&#xD;
      video-based CPR training program that uses online video conferencing, Little Anne QCPR&#xD;
      mannequin (Laerdal, Stavanger, Norway) and SkillGuide (Laerdal, Stavanger, Norway) device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new online real-time quality&#xD;
      measurement and feedback video-based CPR training program. To evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the new CPR training program the investigators propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      with three arms: online real-time quality measurement and feedback video-based CPR training&#xD;
      program, online real-time feedback video-based CPR training without quality measurement&#xD;
      program, and conventional CPR training program. 60 non healthcare provider, healthy adult&#xD;
      volunteers will be randomized to each study arm. After CPR training, each participant will&#xD;
      perform a 6 minute CPR simulation test. The investigators will measure the depth and rate of&#xD;
      chest compression, hand positioning during chest compression, no-flow time and start to chest&#xD;
      compression time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study is mean chest compression depth. Chest compression rate,&#xD;
      hand position, total no flow time, and time to chest compression will also be measured. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the new online real-time quality measurement and feedback&#xD;
      video-based CPR training program is non-inferior to the preexisting conventional CPR training&#xD;
      program and is superior to online real-time feedback video-based CPR training without quality&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the online real-time quality measurement and feedback video-based CPR training program group will access an online training center with laptop computers provided by the researcher. All education and communication is conducted online. The study instructors shows the study participants an edited version of the CPR training video used in the conventional CPR training program. A Little Anne QCPR mannequin (Laerdal, Stavanger, Norway) and SkillGuide (Laerdal, Stavanger, Norway) are provided so that the participants can use while watching the video and during the following hands-on practice session.&#xD;
After watching the video, hands-on practice will be conducted by the instructor on-line. The instructor will watch each individual participants CPR performance via video conferencing and collect real-time performance data using the QCPR mannequin device. Using this information, the instructor will provide real-time online feedback to participants.</description>

    <description>Participants in the conventional CPR training program group will be provided CPR education with the &quot;Home Education and Resuscitation Outcome Study (HEROS)&quot; program that is currently provided in Seoul, Korea. The HEROS program is a 1-hour training course, consisting of a 30-minute video-based self-instruction training with a mannequin. The program also includes a bystander CPR simulation with a simulated dispatcher using the participants own cell phone. Little Anne QCPR mannequin (Laerdal, Stavanger, Norway) and SkillGuide (Laerdal, Stavanger, Norway) device are provided to measure and give feedback on the participants CPR performance.</description>
