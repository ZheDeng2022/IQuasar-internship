  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted as a single blind, prospective, and simple randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. The study was conducted in the fall semester of 2016 and in the fall semester of 2017&#xD;
      in the midwifery department of a university.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study universe comprised 79 students who took the course about vaginal delivery (which is&#xD;
      included in the midwifery curriculum) provided using simulation-based training and 90&#xD;
      students taking this course for the first time. The study included 120 participants,&#xD;
      including 60 randomly selected students who agreed to participate in the study, were enrolled&#xD;
      in midwifery, and took the course explaining vaginal delivery for the first time and 60&#xD;
      randomly selected students who received this education using simulation-based training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The simulation training included the activities that midwives should do during the birth and&#xD;
      management of vaginal delivery. Bone pelvis, fetal head, fetus, cervical&#xD;
      dilatation-effacement, fetal descensus, maternal-neonatal birthing simulators and chicken&#xD;
      breast model for episiotomy were used by the researchers to monitor, manage, and provide care&#xD;
      for the progress of labor. The students in the control group received theoretical training&#xD;
      about management and care of vaginal delivery. In addition, the researchers demonstrated them&#xD;
      how to monitor and manage the delivery process and provide care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection tools included a personal information form, medical malpractice tendency&#xD;
      scale in nursing, and caring assessment questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses were made using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM SPSS)&#xD;
      Statistics 22 software. The findings were analyzed using descriptive statistics (average,&#xD;
      standard deviation, frequency, and percentage). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to&#xD;
      determine normal distribution of the data.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study was conducted as a single blind, prospective, and simple randomized controlled trial. A power calculation was performed and with a standard deviation of 0.25 and statistical significance of 0.05, the number of students needed to total participate was determined to be 116, 58 per group. Out of 79 students, 60 were randomly assigned to the experimental group receiving education using simulation-based training and out of 90 students, 60 were randomly assigned to the control group that received the course explaining vaginal delivery for the first time.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The medical malpractice tendency scale in nursing includes routine patient care activities of the nurses. It was developed by Özata and Altunkan (14). The Likert-type scale, scored between 1 and 5, includes 49 items and consists of five subscales. The scoring is 1=Never, 2=Rarely, 3=Sometimes, 4=Often, 5=Always. The minimum score is 49 and maximum is 245 points. A higher total score indicates that nurses have less medical malpractice tendencies. The scale includes five subscales: drug and transfusion administration, prevention of infections, patient monitıring and material-device safety, prevention of falls, and communication.</description>

    <description>Caring Assessment Questionnaire/Care-Q scale: The caring assessment questionnaire/Care-Q was developed by Lee, Larson, and Holzemer (18) and adapted to Turkish by Eskimez and Acaroğlu (19). This Likert-type scale, scored between 1 and 7, includes 50 items and consists of six subscales. The scoring is 1=Never, 2=Rarely, 3=Occasionally, 4=Sometimes, 5=Frequently, 6=Usually, 7=Every time. The minimum score is 50 and maximum is 350 points. A higher score indicates a positive increase in the frequency of providing and perceiving care behaviors. The six subscales are attainability, descriptions and facilities, comfort, expectations, reassuring communication, and observation and follow-up.</description>

    <description>The simulation training included the activities that midwives should do during the birth and management of vaginal delivery with episiotomy. The students received theoretical training, and to reinforce it, they were asked to mold a fetal head from a potato, make a cardboard cervix showing dilatation measurements during vaginal delivery, and make a fetal position identification model taking the occiput as a reference point.</description>
