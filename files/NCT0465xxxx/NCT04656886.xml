    <textblock>
      Rumination and anhedonia are two of the most common characteristics of depression that&#xD;
      persist during remission and are not easily targeted by commonly prescribed antidepressants.&#xD;
      Ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, has emerged within the last decade as a potent,&#xD;
      fast-acting antidepressant that can significantly improve anhedonia as early as two hours&#xD;
      after a single infusion. The brain mechanisms, however, by which ketamine exerts its&#xD;
      antidepressant action remain largely unknown. The aim of this study is to examine the early&#xD;
      antidepressant action of ketamine, 2h post infusion, in patients who remitted from depression&#xD;
      using fMRI. Participants are scanned while performing a personalised, autobiographical,&#xD;
      emotional memory task and a monetary reward task. Ketamine is expected to reduce the&#xD;
      activation of limbic areas such as the amygdala during emotional memory recall. Increased&#xD;
      activations after ketamine are expected in reward processing areas, including striatal&#xD;
      regions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is one of the leading causes of disease worldwide with detrimental personal,&#xD;
      interpersonal and societal impact.The current treatments available for depression involve&#xD;
      psychotherapy as well as antidepressant medication. SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake&#xD;
      Inhibitors) are the primary antidepressant medications considered for depression due to their&#xD;
      relatively mild side effects and broad effect on depression symptoms. However, other drug&#xD;
      types are also available and include tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase&#xD;
      inhibitors. Despite the variety of psychotherapeutic approaches and antidepressant&#xD;
      medication, 20% of patients suffering from depression fail to respond to any pharmacological&#xD;
      or psychological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently and in an effort to overcome the limitations of the current antidepressant&#xD;
      treatments, ketamine has emerged as an effective antidepressant with especially promising&#xD;
      results in treatment resistant depression as well as a rather effective antidepressant&#xD;
      maintenance strategy.Ketamine is not a novel drug and has used safely and effectively as a&#xD;
      dissociative anaesthetic since its introduction in the 1960s. It is commonly used in medicine&#xD;
      for starting and maintaining general anaesthesia, sedation in intensive care as well as a&#xD;
      painkiller and is also known for its recreational use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies investigating the antidepressant effects of ketamine have shown that a single&#xD;
      ketamine infusion produced a significant decrease in depressive symptoms in treatment&#xD;
      resistant patients. This decrease occurred within approximately 2 hours after the infusion&#xD;
      and the antidepressant effects of the drug persisted, in some cases, for up to 3 days after&#xD;
      the drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism by which ketamine exercises its antidepressant effect is unknown. However,&#xD;
      recent research has implicated the intracellular mTOR pathway, a signalling system that&#xD;
      controls the translation of synaptic proteins. At the molecular level, ketamine is an&#xD;
      uncompetitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor and can disrupt memory formation and retrieval.&#xD;
      Animal research has shown that ketamine administration leads to proactive interference of&#xD;
      spatial memory representations whereas in humans ketamine can modulate hippocampal activity&#xD;
      during simple episodic memory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rumination and anhedonia are two of the most prevalent symptoms of depression that also&#xD;
      persist in remission and are not easily targeted by commonly prescribed antidepressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ruminative patterns of thought mediate the relationship between the risk factors for the&#xD;
      development of depression and onset of depression and could reinforce depressive symptoms in&#xD;
      patients already suffering from the depression. According to the cognitive models of&#xD;
      depression which try to identify and understand the factors that could maintain an episode of&#xD;
      depression, rumination is associated with altered emotional and memory processing. The brain&#xD;
      regions that are known to be involved in these processes include the amygdala, hippocampus&#xD;
      and subgenual cingulate cortex, which are involved in emotional processing, the MPFC (medial&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex), a brain area involved in representation of self, the ACC (anterior&#xD;
      cingulate cortex) which is involved in the inhibition of emotional stimuli as well as the&#xD;
      VLPFC (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) and DLPFC (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) which are&#xD;
      involved in cognitive control. In depressed individuals, dysfunction of this memory system&#xD;
      could lead to biased recall of autobiographical memories, greater rumination and often more&#xD;
      severe episodes of depression. The NMDA receptor system, targeted by ketamine, plays a&#xD;
      central role in memory formation processes in these brain regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anhedonia is a complex construct that demonstrates as reduced motivation to work for rewards,&#xD;
      reduced anticipatory pleasure, reduced consummatory pleasure and deficits in reinforcement&#xD;
      learning. In the brain, the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways mediate reward processing&#xD;
      and are subserved by the neurotransmitter dopamine. In depression, several key brain ares&#xD;
      that are part of those pathways, including the VTA, striatal areas and the thalamus, present&#xD;
      with reduced function during the anticipation of rewards but also upon receipt of expected&#xD;
      rewards. Ketamine, as an antidepressant, has been shown to significantly improve anhedonia as&#xD;
      early as two hours after a single ketamine infusion. Moreover, ketamine 2h post&#xD;
      administration was shown to significantly increase the metabolism of striatal areas,&#xD;
      indicating that the drug might improve anhedonia by directly targeting brain areas important&#xD;
      for reward processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the early antidepressant effects of ketamine, 2h after a&#xD;
      single drug infusion. Autobiographical emotional memory recall - linked to rumination and&#xD;
      reward processing - linked to anhedonia, will be examined using fMRI tasks in a sample of&#xD;
      remitted depressed volunteers. If successful, this study will help better understand the&#xD;
      mechanisms via which ketamine exerts its early antidepressant action and determine whether it&#xD;
      could alter the activation of brain areas that are important for rumination and anhedonia in&#xD;
      a way that would be beneficial to depression.&#xD;
