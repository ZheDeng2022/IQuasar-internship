      This study is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled,&#xD;
      within-subject design, 3-treatment, 3-period cross-over study involving 38 subjects with&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease who have the wearing-off phenomenon on oral levodopa therapy. All&#xD;
      participants will receive three treatments on different days, each with different stimulation&#xD;
      conditions. All subjects will wear the Earstim device on the ear ipsilateral to the side of&#xD;
      the body more affected by Parkinson's Disease for 120 minutes during each of the three&#xD;
      treatment applications.&#xD;
