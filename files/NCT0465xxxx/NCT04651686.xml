  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The postoperative complications of thoracoscopic radical surgery for lung cancer mainly&#xD;
      include postoperative bleeding, pulmonary infection, chylothorax, nerve injury, pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism, arrhythmia, postoperative cough, bronchopleural fistula and so on. Among them,&#xD;
      postoperative cough is one of the most common complications after lung surgery, and the&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative cough is 25% - 50%. Cough after pneumonectomy can last for a long&#xD;
      time, which affects the rapid recovery of patients after surgery, and brings serious adverse&#xD;
      effects to the physiological, psychological and social functions of patients.&#xD;

      After pneumonectomy cough on patients' daily life will bring different degrees of adverse&#xD;
      effects, so through certain methods to intervene, in order to reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative cough, accelerate the rapid recovery of patients after surgery, improve the&#xD;
      quality of life of patients, which should also be worthy of attention of surgeons. In recent&#xD;
      years, the research on intervention measures and treatment methods to reduce cough after&#xD;
      thoracoscopic lobectomy is mainly focused on drug treatment, traditional Chinese medicine&#xD;
      treatment, surgical operation and anesthesia intervention. However, the research on reducing&#xD;
      postoperative cough by improving surgical operation is rare. The purpose of this prospective&#xD;
      study was to investigate whether preoperative three-dimensional reconstruction and&#xD;
      intraoperative protection of bronchial artery can reduce the severity of cough after&#xD;
      thoracoscopic lobectomy, so as to further explore the effective intervention measures of&#xD;
      postoperative cough and enrich the concept of accelerated rehabilitation surgery.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Sixty patients with thoracoscopic lobectomy and systemic lymph node dissection were selected from the same surgical group in the thoracic surgery department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University from August 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020. According to the random number grouping method, they were divided into two groups: the bronchial artery protection group (the experimental group) and the conventional surgical treatment group (the control group). In the experimental group, 64 slice spiral CT was used for chest enhanced CT examination before operation, and mimics software was used for 3D reconstruction of bronchial artery. During the operation, the bronchial artery was protected according to the preoperative three-dimensional reconstruction image during lymph node dissection. In the control group, three-dimensional reconstruction of bronchial artery was not performed before operation, and lobectomy and systematic lymph node dissection were performed routinely</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Cough visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to evaluate the diagnosis of cough. Vas is a linear scoring method, using 0-100 mm scale, 0 means no cough, 100 means the most serious cough. Patients are required to mark the severity of cough on the scale line according to their own perception of cough, and measure the distance from the starting point to the marking point as a score. The higher the score is, the more serious the cough is. When the scale reaches 60mm, the patient can be diagnosed as postoperative cough.</description>
