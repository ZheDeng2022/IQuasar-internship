    <textblock>
      We intend to develop intelligent quality control and management software based on the work of&#xD;
      digestive endoscopic artificial intelligence in the Department of Gastroenterology, Wuhan&#xD;
      University Renmin Hospital, to accurately and comprehensively assess the quality of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal endoscopy and to provide a practical basis for improving the quality of&#xD;
      digestive endoscopy in our endoscopic center.&#xD;
