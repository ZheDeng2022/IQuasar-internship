      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fifth most frequent cancer in the world, with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      more than 500,000 new cases per year. It is considered the third leading cause of cancer&#xD;
      mortality and presents well-defined risk factors. Liver cirrhosis is the main risk factor for&#xD;
      developing HCC, therefore screening programs in cirrhotic patients will allow the early&#xD;
      diagnosis of this neoplasia. Despite this, most HCCs are diagnosed at a stage in which the&#xD;
      application of curative therapies is no longer possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) belongs to the arterially directed&#xD;
      embolization therapies for the treatment of unresectable early-to-advanced hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma (HCC). It is the only therapy that has shown to improve survival in&#xD;
      intermediate-stage HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug-eluting beads (DEB)-TACE has shown to provide slow drug elution, reduced liver and&#xD;
      systemic toxicity, increased local drug concentration, and tissue necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aside from TACE, other transarterial options include bland embolization, or hepatic artery&#xD;
      embolization (HAE), and transarterial radioembolization (TARE). All have an acceptable safety&#xD;
      profile, and each has its associated procedural and peri-procedural complications. One&#xD;
      potential complication that may occur during all embolization procedures is when the embolic&#xD;
      material migrates outside of the desired treatment area, leading to non-target embolization&#xD;
      (NTE). In fact, when collateral vessels are embolized, there is a risk that these may be&#xD;
      feeders of non-target tissue or organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NTE following TACE in particular may lead to a double-layer problem: dangerous components&#xD;
      affecting healthy tissue, one ischemic and one related to cytotoxicity from the&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agent, which may have clinical consequences, and potential incomplete&#xD;
      treatment of the lesion (due to beads being &quot;deviated&quot; from target).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NTE is highly recognized, but often thought to be uncommon, and although different&#xD;
      complications can be caused by it, there may appear to be no evidence of NTE during the&#xD;
      intraprocedural imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid the complications due to NTE, apart from the importance of the pre-, intra- and&#xD;
      post-procedural imaging, and the thorough study of the anatomical picture, the&#xD;
      catheters/microcatheters should also be chosen with reason and care. In particular, selective&#xD;
      catheterization should be achieved by placing the microcatheter tip as close as possible to&#xD;
      the target, through the specific branch/branches supplying it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, even with the microcatheter selectively positioned in the vessel to be embolized,&#xD;
      the risk of NTE might not be eliminated, since it could happen as a result of changes in flow&#xD;
      dynamics that occur during embolization, particularly when the endpoint is stasis. These&#xD;
      changes could result in reflux into non-target territories and, as such, might be better&#xD;
      prevented with the use of microcatheters intended to reduce reflux. To this purpose, the use&#xD;
      of a dedicated delivery device should be taken into consideration, in order to optimize and&#xD;
      save time during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microcatheters are commonly used during most arterial embolization procedures, and as&#xD;
      explained above, there is a strong rationale to use a reflux-control microcatheter - like&#xD;
      Sequre - for DEB-TACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main expectation is to achieve technical success with Sequre in all patients with a&#xD;
      reachable target lesion, with the intent not only to minimize potential damage to surrounding&#xD;
      tissue, but also to potentially deliver more treatment embolics, as all the beads are&#xD;
      (re)directed towards the target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of small diameter particles (100 micron-TANDEM ® spheres), induces superior tumor&#xD;
      necrosis response (Urbano et al., European Journal of Radiology, 2020); with the synergistic&#xD;
      effect of being administered through the SEQURE anti-reflux protection system, there is&#xD;
      reason to believe that it will be possible to administer maximum doses of doxorubicin, while&#xD;
      avoiding the occlusion of non-target arterial segments (SYNERGIC EFFECT).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      We propose a prospective observational study with data collection from a single center&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Microcatheters are commonly used during most arterial embolization procedures. SEQURE®&#xD;
      (Guerbet, France) is an innovative reflux-control microcatheter for peripheral embolization&#xD;
      procedures which relies on flow dynamics as the foundation of its' mechanism of action. It&#xD;
      can optimize the delivery of calibrated microspheres of specific sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device presents as a regular microcatheter with a non-tapered internal lumen for delivery&#xD;
      of embolics (typically in suspension with contrast media), and 2 radiopaque markers (placed&#xD;
      at a distance of 11 mm) at the tip (distal marker being at 0.5-1 mm from the point of exit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near the distal atraumatic tip, between the two markers, it has side slits (approximately 50&#xD;
      µm in width) which allow contrast media to exit radially in addition to the standard fluid&#xD;
      flow through the distal tip of the catheter. The contrast media that comes out of the&#xD;
      side-holes creates a turbulence in the space surrounding the slits, between microcatheter and&#xD;
      vessel, which acts as a fluid barrier in that given portion. This fluid-dynamic barrier&#xD;
      redirects the beads that tend to upstream reflux back to their flow-directed trajectory,&#xD;
      preventing the beads from migrating in non-target areas, and thus eliminating, or strongly&#xD;
      reducing, undesired non-target embolization (NTE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, SEQURE® allows for haemodynamic arrangement to be preserved, by favoring and&#xD;
      maintaining unaltered the natural blood flow. Under fluoroscopy, the radial flow of contrast&#xD;
      media exiting through the side holes in the SEQURE® microcatheter can be seen, giving the&#xD;
      physician indication of the vessel flow dynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lesions were identified and then treated supra-selectively with the microcatheter, with the&#xD;
      embolic materials infused in a slow and controlled manner, in order to reduce reflux into&#xD;
      non-target branches&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of 100 micron-TANDEM ® spheres will be studied with the synergistic effect of being&#xD;
      administered through SEQURE® microcatheter anti-reflux protection system, which may allow the&#xD;
      administration of the maximum doses of doxorubicin, avoiding the undesired oclussion of&#xD;
      collateral arterial segments (SYNERGIC EFFECT) in a prospective study in patients with&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma early-intermediate stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT SELECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between October 2020 and December 2021, and expected number of 30 patients will be treated.&#xD;
      The diagnosis of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will confirm in accordance with the American&#xD;
      Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines and HCC staged according to Barcelona&#xD;
      Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEB-TACE is indicated according to clinical practice guidelines referred above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TECHNICAL PROCEDURE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The embolization will be performed using TANDEM ® spheres (each cc of spheres can be loaded&#xD;
      with up to 50 mg of doxorubicin. The maximum dose of doxorubicin used per procedure was 150&#xD;
      mg, corresponding to 3 cc of spheres) and SEQURE ® microcatheter in a super-selective&#xD;
      tumour´s arterial position avoiding undesired arterial branches. The procedure will consider&#xD;
      super-selective when the micro-catheter tip reached the tumour feeding artery. Each cc of&#xD;
      microspheres will mix with 7-10 cc of non-ionic contrast medium. Embolization endpoint is&#xD;
      considered vascular stasis or 150 mg of Doxorubin administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES AND END-POINTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Technical success will be defined as a composite outcome measurement: ability to place&#xD;
           the microcatheter inside the required vascular segment and qualitative assessment of&#xD;
           microspheres deposition in the target tumour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to Progression (TTP) [Time Frame: 6 months]. Time at which progression is first&#xD;
           observed in a tumor assessment according to mRECIST as assessed by CT or MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective Response Rate (ORR) and Disease Control Rate (DCR) [Time Frame: Assessed at 1,&#xD;
           3, and 6 months after first treatment]. ORR is defined as a complete or partial response&#xD;
           among the total number of cases and DCR is defined as a complete, partial response or&#xD;
           stable disease among the total number of cases , according to mRECIST evaluated by CT or&#xD;
           MRI. Time to retreatment included as consequential secondary objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) [Time Frame: Assessed at 1, 3, and&#xD;
           6 months after first treatment. The incidence of emerging AE and SAE will be summarized&#xD;
           according to standardized qualification criteria [Journal of Vascular Interventional&#xD;
           Radiology (JVIR) SAE], including pancreatitis, cholecystitis, clinical presentations,&#xD;
           postembolization syndrome (PES), etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non Target embolization (NTE) by thorough angiographic assessment of the whole liver&#xD;
           vasculature after TACE, as well as Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) performed&#xD;
           immediately following embolization (within 30 minutes from the end of procedure) to&#xD;
           evaluate off-target distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health-Related Quality of Life questionary (HRQOL): pre-treatment and post-treatment&#xD;
           quality of life assessment using the specific questionnaire for functional assessment&#xD;
           for cancer treatment (FACT-G).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION AND FOLLOW-UP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information will be collected through the electronic database of the patient (includes&#xD;
      laboratory data). Patients will be evaluated starting from the date of inclusion as&#xD;
      candidates for TACE treatment, and followed up for 6 months (unless patients are lost to&#xD;
      clinical follow-up or death occurs). Mortality data are obtainable by searching the&#xD;
      electronic history of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in the serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase&#xD;
      (ALT), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, albumin and patients' complete hematological&#xD;
      profile, as well as serum lipase and amylase levels within the 1st week post-TACE to detect&#xD;
      pancreatitis, will be evaluated at the following time-points: pre-embolization, at one month,&#xD;
      three months, and six months. Computed tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      with contrast will be performed at the same time-points as just indicated; modified Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( m-RECIST) will be used, and images will be assessed by&#xD;
      two experienced radiologists (any discordant interpretation will be solved through team&#xD;
      consensus). All serologic toxicities would be classified according to common terminology&#xD;
      criteria for adverse effects. On this scale, severe hepato-toxicity (grade 3) is classified&#xD;
      as the increase of up to 5 times the normal limit of AST, ALT, FA or the increase of&#xD;
      bilirubin level to over 3 g/dl.&#xD;
