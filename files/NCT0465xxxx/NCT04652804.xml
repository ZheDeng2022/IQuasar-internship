  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to improve HCV care continuum outcomes for people who inject drugs&#xD;
      (PWID), reduce potential onward transmission to others and improve HIV outcomes among those&#xD;
      who are HIV/HCV coinfected. The study will evaluate whether HCV treatment outcomes (sustained&#xD;
      virologic response, treatment completion, adherence) and post treatment outcomes (HCV&#xD;
      reinfection, HIV viral suppression) in HCV mono- and HIV/HCV co-infected PWID can be&#xD;
      optimized by tailoring treatment support in 7 PWID-focused integrated HIV/HCV prevention and&#xD;
      treatment centers in India.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate whether the intensity of treatment adherence support&#xD;
      affects sustained virologic response rates in HCV mono- and HIV/HCV co-infected participants&#xD;
      receiving HCV direct-acting antivirals (DAA) in PWID-focused centers. Secondary objectives&#xD;
      are: 1. To evaluate whether the intensity of treatment adherence support affects HCV&#xD;
      treatment completion rates. 2. To evaluate whether the intensity of treatment adherence&#xD;
      support affects HCV treatment adherence. 3. To estimate the incidence and correlates of HCV&#xD;
      reinfection among HCV mono- and HIV/HCV coinfected PWID who achieve HCV cure. 4. To evaluate&#xD;
      the impact of HCV cure on HIV viral suppression among HIV/HCV coinfected PWID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will evaluate this via a 3-arm, individual-level randomized clinical trial, in&#xD;
      which treatment assignment probabilities vary according to participants' estimated propensity&#xD;
      for treatment failure at baseline (precision randomization). An estimated 3,000 persons will&#xD;
      be enrolled and randomized at 7 community-based integrated care centers (ICCs) across India&#xD;
      across a duration of 18 - 24 months. Data from these 7 ICCs on early HIV treatment&#xD;
      refills/viral suppression (3-6 months after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation) will be&#xD;
      used to develop and validate an algorithm to predict propensity for HCV treatment failure.&#xD;
      Prior to treatment initiation, each participant will undergo a questionnaire to capture&#xD;
      information on barriers/ facilitators to treatment adherence identified in the prediction&#xD;
      model in order to determine the propensity for HCV treatment failure (minimal or elevated&#xD;
      risk). Individuals will be preferentially randomized to the support level that matches their&#xD;
      failure risk. Those at elevated risk for treatment failure will be randomized at an&#xD;
      allocation ratio of 3:2:1 for Arm 3 (high intensity support), Arm 2 (medium intensity&#xD;
      support) and Arm 1 (low intensity support), respectively. Conversely, those at minimal risk&#xD;
      will be randomized at a ratio of 1:2:3 to Arm 3 (high intensity support), Arm 2 (medium&#xD;
      intensity support) and Arm 1 (low intensity support), respectively. Participants and study&#xD;
      staff will be blinded to the risk classification (minimal, elevated) but, because of the&#xD;
      nature of the interventions, blinding to intervention assignment is not possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons will be treated for HCV according to the standard of care in India. Minimal&#xD;
      laboratory monitoring will be used except when clinically indicated. Participants with&#xD;
      decompensated cirrhosis will be excluded from treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All HIV/HCV co-infected participants and those HCV monoinfected participants who achieve SVR&#xD;
      will be followed post-treatment. These individuals will be followed every six months after&#xD;
      the SVR assessment to assess HCV reinfection and HIV viral suppression (among HIV/HCV&#xD;
      coinfected participants) for up to 30 months after SVR.&#xD;

    <description>The medium intensity intervention will include standard of care dispensation of a 28-day supply of medication at entry, 4 weeks and 8 weeks. Participants will be assigned to a patient navigator (PN) and receive tailored patient navigation support for medication reminders, picking up medication refills (or home or field delivery of study medications), overcoming barriers as well as service linkage. Participant will be contacted by the PN at least once every two weeks.</description>

    <description>The high intensity intervention will involve patient-centered DOT with flexibility in terms of the frequency of pickup and the site of DOT (ICC, field-based) with a minimum of at least 1 observed dose per week. Participants in this arm will also receive PN support for overcoming barriers and service linkage similar to participants in Arm 2. The main differences between Arms 2 and 3 are: (i) medications will not be dispensed for more than one week at a time (to coincide with opioid agonist therapy (OAT) dosing, where applicable); and (ii) ≥1 dose/week will be observed.</description>
