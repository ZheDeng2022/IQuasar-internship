  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an effectiveness trial investigating neurofeedback (NFB) in adults with PTSD&#xD;
      (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
      treatment conditions - i) NFB, or ii) wait list. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, our study&#xD;
      will, primarily, take place online (i.e., online assessment and treatment, with option of&#xD;
      in-person fMRI, or functional magnetic resonance imaging, scans). NFB sessions will be&#xD;
      conducted from home, with videoconferenced supervision by research staff. After study&#xD;
      completion, individuals in the wait list condition will be offered the same NFB treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTSD has an emotional impact on individuals, but it is also associated with impaired&#xD;
      cognitive functioning (e.g., processing speed, attention, executive functioning).&#xD;
      Unfortunately, there is little research investigating both issues simultaneously. The current&#xD;
      study is an effectiveness trial for an intervention called neurofeedback (NFB), which may be&#xD;
      helpful in addressing both PTSD symptom severity, and cognitive dysfunction. NFB is a type of&#xD;
      brain training in which a person is given real-time information (or feedback) from their own&#xD;
      brain activity to help them potentially change how their brain is functioning (i.e., to work&#xD;
      in a healthier or more effective manner). NFB has been in use for over 30 years, and it is&#xD;
      proven to be quite effective in treating ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder);&#xD;
      however, it has not been embraced as a clinical intervention for other mental health&#xD;
      disorders. Recent systematic reviews of NFB suggest that this treatment intervention can lead&#xD;
      to significant clinical improvements (e.g., reduction in PTSD severity), and it can impact&#xD;
      both functional brain activity and cognitive function. The current study hopes to bring these&#xD;
      3 areas of interest together by investigating the impact of NFB on PTSD symptoms, cognitive&#xD;
      ability, and intrinsic neurological connectivity (via fMRI - function magnetic imaging).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, participants will be randomized into one of two conditions: NFB or Wait&#xD;
      List. Those in the NFB condition will begin 19 weekly, supervised (via teleconferencing)&#xD;
      sessions of NFB, while the Wait List will not receive NFB for approximately 31 weeks (i.e.,&#xD;
      not until final assessments are complete). After all assessments are complete, participants&#xD;
      in the Wait List condition will be able to begin the same 19 sessions of NFB. Study&#xD;
      participation includes pre-, post-, and 3-month follow-up assessments, and 2 optional fMRI&#xD;
      scans. Due to the current coronavirus pandemic, this study will be conducted primarily&#xD;
      online.&#xD;
