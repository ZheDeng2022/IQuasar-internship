  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is a condition of fluctuating confusion and agitation that affects as many as 80% of&#xD;
      patients in critical care. Hyperactive delirium consumes a significant amount of clinical&#xD;
      attention and resources due to the associated psychomotor agitation. Patients can become&#xD;
      aggressive or combative putting both themselves and healthcare workers at risk of harm.&#xD;
      Delirium has been linked to an increased risk of death and poor overall outcomes. Management&#xD;
      largely relies on the use of potentially toxic medications and physical restraints despite&#xD;
      limited proof of success of these interventions. Our research group will study the use of a&#xD;
      novel interactive digital therapeutic behavior modification platform aimed at reducing&#xD;
      anxiety and agitation associated with hyperactive delirium. We hypothesize that Use of the&#xD;
      Mindful Garden behavioral modification platform will result in reduced incidence of&#xD;
      medication usage for the management of delirium associated agitation in the adult delirious&#xD;
      critical care population compared to standard care alone.&#xD;

      Mindful Garden is a digital behavior modification platform that utilizes screen based&#xD;
      delivery systems and sensor technologies. Mindful Garden delivers real 2-dimensional nature&#xD;
      video layered with hyper-real 3-dimensional animations of growing and receding flowers and&#xD;
      butterflies in flight which aims to reduce anxiety and agitation in the delirious critical&#xD;
      care population. In doing so, a reduction in the need for reliance on pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions and the use of physical restraints, which have been linked to adverse outcomes&#xD;
      and significant side effects, may be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with a diagnosis of hyperactive delirium in the critical care units will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive 4 hours of exposure to the MG platform in addition to standard care or&#xD;
      to the control arm of monitoring with standard care only for the same time period.&#xD;
