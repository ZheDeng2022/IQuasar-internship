  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of single and&#xD;
      multiple oral administration of HS-10356 in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose (SAD)&#xD;
      and multiple ascending dose (MAD) clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of HS-10356 oral formulation in Chinese healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately five sequential dose panels (single oral doses of 2,6,15,30,45mg HS-10356) will&#xD;
      be evaluated in SAD. To protect the safety of volunteers, two sentinel volunteers were first&#xD;
      enrolled in the first dose panel (2mg panel) and randomly assigned to HS-10356 or placebo in&#xD;
      a 1:1 ratio. After the sentinel volunteers were given the dose for at least 24 hours and&#xD;
      confirmed that they were safe, the remaining 6 volunteers were randomly assigned to HS-10356&#xD;
      or placebo in a ratio of 5:1. For the follow-up panels of SAD, volunteers were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either the experimental group or the placebo group (6 cases in HS-10356 and 2&#xD;
      cases in placebo) in a 3:1 ratio using block randomization method. Approximately three&#xD;
      sequential dose panels (14 consecutive days for respectively daily oral doses of 6,15,30mg&#xD;
      HS-10356, QD) will be evaluated in MAD. Volunteers were randomly assigned to either the&#xD;
      experimental group or the placebo group (9 cases in the HS-10356 and 3 cases in the placebo)&#xD;
      in a ratio of 3:1 using block randomization method. Each subject will receive only one&#xD;
      regimen in this study. Safety data up to Day12 (±2) in SAD and up to Day25 (±2) in MAD will&#xD;
      be reviewed prior to dose escalation. Cohorts of SAD and MAD will be added or removed&#xD;
      depending on the assessment results of SRC.&#xD;
