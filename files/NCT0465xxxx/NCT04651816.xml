  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This initiative, which is a partnership between State College area Penn State Health&#xD;
      ambulatory care clinics located off campus in the State College area, has two primary goals:&#xD;
      1) improve the health and quality of life of Penn State Health patients with pre-diabetes and&#xD;
      2) decrease associated health care costs due to type 2 diabetes and its complications. The&#xD;
      results from the study may serve as a model for additional chronic disease prevention&#xD;
      programs to implement in additional Penn State Health clinics in the future.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through this initiative, providers in Penn State Health ambulatory health care clinics (PSH&#xD;
      clinics) will identify pre-diabetic patients to take part in a Diabetes Prevention Program&#xD;
      (DPP), modeled after the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DPP is a CDC-recognized lifestyle change program developed specifically to prevent type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. It is designed for people who have prediabetes or are at risk for type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      but who do not already have diabetes. We will be using the DPP distance learning program&#xD;
      which allows online delivery of classes. A trained lifestyle coach leads the program to help&#xD;
      subjects change certain aspects of their lifestyle, like eating healthier, reducing stress,&#xD;
      and getting more physically activity. The program also includes group support. The DPP is a&#xD;
      year-long program focused on long-term changes and lasting results. Key components of the&#xD;
      program include a CDC-approved curriculum with lessons, handouts, and other resources; a&#xD;
      lifestyle coach, specifically trained to lead the program; and a support group of people with&#xD;
      similar goals and challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To that end, this study has multiple arms that will test whether participation in the PSH DPP&#xD;
      - and exposure to motivational messages that encourage physical activity or participation in&#xD;
      lotteries, an increasingly common strategy for behavioral motivation, - significantly&#xD;
      improves program retention and health-related outcomes, compared to those who only&#xD;
      participate in the PSH DPP.&#xD;
