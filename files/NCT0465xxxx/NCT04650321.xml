  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety of home ocrelizumab infusion will be assessed by monitoring for infusion reactions&#xD;
      and adverse events, and comparing proportions/rates to existing studies. Patient reported&#xD;
      outcomes (PROs) will compare pre to post infusion.&#xD;
