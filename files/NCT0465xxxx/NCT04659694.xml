  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Care home residents spent 79% of their time being sedentary. Reduced physical activity and&#xD;
      lack of mental stimulation causes general weakness and frailty in older adults that can&#xD;
      result in increased healthcare needs. It is important that care home residents spend their&#xD;
      time being both physically and psychosocially engaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the effect of a wellness programme on physical and&#xD;
      psychosocial wellbeing in older adults living in care homes. Through this process this study&#xD;
      will assess the feasibility of implementing the programme and collecting data in care home&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two main groups of participants, 1) care home residents and 2) care home staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care home residents will have data collected at three time points. The first time point will&#xD;
      be before the intervention (baseline) in the care home setting. The second time point will be&#xD;
      three months after the intervention has been delivered. The third time point will be 6 months&#xD;
      after the intervention has been delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following measurements will be conducted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measuring hand grip strength by having to grip a device as firmly as possible and&#xD;
           measurements will be taken,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Answering questionnaires about quality of life, daily routine, appetite, thoughts about&#xD;
           wellness activities the participants have participated in,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Wearing a little 'match box-like' device (that measures daily movements and sleep&#xD;
           patterns) for 7 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care home staff will be invited to participate in a focus group discussion 6 months after the&#xD;
      intervention. Hence, this research will aim to understand the impact of a wellness programme&#xD;
      that incorporates physical and psychosocial components that targets the holistic wellbeing of&#xD;
      older adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The following potential issues have been identified:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. This feasibility study is being carried out in older adults living in care homes. Older&#xD;
           adults are considered to be vulnerable population by the definition of the World Health&#xD;
           Organisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. This study involves residents with cognitive impairment who may not be able to give&#xD;
           consent for themselves to take part in the study. To overcome these issues, the research&#xD;
           team is very mindful not to exclude residents with cognitive impairment who otherwise&#xD;
           are able to participate in the Wellness activities. Th investigators will strictly adopt&#xD;
           the Dewing process of gaining consent for older adults with cognitive impairment which&#xD;
           involves ongoing consent monitoring. The investigators have followed the guidelines of&#xD;
           Mental Capacity Act 2005 and designed participant information sheets and consulted&#xD;
           declaration form who could consent on the participant's behalf (consultee). If consent&#xD;
           is not obtained, the participant will not be recruited into the study. The consultee&#xD;
           will be able to withdraw consent at any time in the study. Any visible distress observed&#xD;
           during participation (eg. use of handgrip dynamometer &amp; accelerometer) will be recorded&#xD;
           and the participant will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will also be regularly reminded that they can choose to withdraw from the&#xD;
           study at any point, without any explanation and that care received would not be affected&#xD;
           or compromised due to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All data collected will be stored on password protected computers and/or the BU secure&#xD;
           server and will be handled in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation&#xD;
           2018 and Data Protection Act 2018. Data will only be accessed by the investigator and&#xD;
           the supervisor, and the participant's identity will be anonymised using a coding system.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Conflict of Interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. There will be no conflict of interest in the study.&#xD;
