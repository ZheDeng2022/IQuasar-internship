  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of C-reactive&#xD;
      protein (CRP), serum procalcitonin (PCT) and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor&#xD;
      (suPAR) in the initial investigation of patients acute hospitalized with suspected&#xD;
      community-acquired-pneumonia (CAP)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Target pneumonia treatment should be initiated within a few hours, which is why early and&#xD;
      accurate diagnosis is extremely important. Uncertain or delayed diagnosis will often lead to&#xD;
      an overconsumption of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which contributes to increased development&#xD;
      of resistant bacteria and thus threaten the treatment options of the future. Pneumonia&#xD;
      diagnosis is primarily made today on the basis of clinical symptoms and findings in the form&#xD;
      of cough, vomiting, chest pain, fever, shortness of breath, supplemented with X-ray of the&#xD;
      lungs, relevant blood tests and analysis of expectoration. However, X-ray is an imprecise&#xD;
      diagnostic tool. The diagnosis of CAP is challenged by nonspecific symptoms, uncertain&#xD;
      diagnostic methods and waiting time for test results up to several days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, numerous studies have investigated biomarkers that can possibly support the&#xD;
      diagnosis of CAP. C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum procalcitonin (PCT) are biomarkers that&#xD;
      may distinguish CAP from other causes of acute respiratory infections. The CRP biomarker has&#xD;
      been endorsed as a guide for antibiotic treatment by the National Institute for Health and&#xD;
      Care Excellence (NICE) and PCT was suggested by the American Infectious Diseases Society of&#xD;
      America. Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) has emerged as a&#xD;
      potentially novel biomarker for inflammatory diseases including pneumonia. Several studies&#xD;
      have highlighted suPAR as a significant prognostic mortality marker and strongly related to&#xD;
      disease severity and worse outcome in a variety of conditions. It is also a promising&#xD;
      biological marker in the diagnosis of CAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic value of the optimal biomarkers for the diagnosis of CAP remains&#xD;
      controversial. The investigators hypothesize that serum CRP, PTC and suPAR have an impact on&#xD;
      diagnosing, prognosis, and treatment of patients with a verified&#xD;
      community-acquired-pneumonia. The objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the diagnostic accuracy of CRP, PCT and suPAR in community-acquired&#xD;
           pneumonia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the prognostic value of CRP, PCT and suPAR in relation to adverse events&#xD;

    <description>The percentage of patients diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia determined by an expert panel. This outcome measure is a binary variable - verified pneumonia or no pneumonia.&#xD;
The expert panel consists of two independent consultants from the emergency department with experience in infection and emergency medicine, who individually will determine whether the patient admitted with suspected community-acquired pneumonia, had the diagnosis. The diagnosis will be based on all available relevant information from the patient medical record within 48 hours from admission including computed tomography. A standardized template will be used. Disagreement will be discussed until a consensus is reached.&#xD;
