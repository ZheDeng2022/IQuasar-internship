  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In humanitarian settings, sexual and gender-based violence disproportionately impacts women&#xD;
      and children. However, there continues to be a lack of evidence regarding both sexual&#xD;
      violence prevention and post-rape care interventions in low- and middle-income humanitarian&#xD;
      contexts, with even less evidence supporting adolescents and youth in these settings.&#xD;
      Participatory comics offer a youth-friendly, low-cost, scalable approach for preventing&#xD;
      sexual violence and training clinicians in post-rape care in humanitarian settings. This&#xD;
      study aims to develop, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of a comic intervention on&#xD;
      preventing sexual violence and improving post-rape care with youth aged 16-24 and health care&#xD;
      providers in the Bidi Bidi refugee settlement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uganda is Sub-Saharan Africa's largest refugee host community; with over 250,000 residents,&#xD;
      Bidi Bidi is the largest refugee settlement in Uganda and the second largest globally. In&#xD;
      humanitarian settings, sexual and gender-based violence disproportionately impacts women and&#xD;
      children. However, there continues to be a lack of evidence regarding both sexual violence&#xD;
      prevention and post-rape care interventions in low- and middle-income humanitarian contexts,&#xD;
      with even less evidence supporting adolescents and youth in these settings. Stigma directed&#xD;
      toward adolescent sexual practices and engagement in sexual and reproductive health services,&#xD;
      such as contraception, HIV testing, and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), is also associated&#xD;
      with social isolation, violence and mental health challenges. Participatory comics offer a&#xD;
      youth-friendly, low-cost, scalable approach for preventing sexual violence and training&#xD;
      clinicians in post-rape care in humanitarian settings. This study aims to develop, implement,&#xD;
      and evaluate the effectiveness of a comic intervention on preventing sexual violence and&#xD;
      improving post-rape care with youth aged 16-24 and health care providers in the Bidi Bidi&#xD;
      refugee settlement. Participating youth and health care providers will take part in 4-hour&#xD;
      peer-facilitated workshops exploring topics of social, sexual, and psychological needs and&#xD;
      pro-social interventions (youth) and post-rape care responses and attending to the needs of&#xD;
      youth refugees who have experienced sexual violence (health care providers) using comics&#xD;
      developed with qualitative data collected from an earlier study phase. Using a&#xD;
      pre-test/post-test design, this study will assess changes in participants' PEP knowledge and&#xD;
      acceptance, bystander behaviour, and sexual violence stigma.&#xD;

    <description>This participatory comic intervention promotes sexual violence prevention and post-rape care with refugee youth and health care providers. In 4-hour workshops, a customized comic book featuring eight sexual violence scenarios will be distributed. Each 1-page scenario speaks to a unique theme of sexual violence experiences among youth or post-rape care preferences. During the workshop participants will explore social, sexual, and psychological needs of youth in Bidi Bidi and practice ways of developing and maintaining healthy relationships (youth) as well as discuss post-rape care responses that attend to the needs and priorities of young refugees in Bidi Bidi who have experienced sexual violence (health care providers). Each workshop will include 20 participants and will be facilitated by trained staff from Real Medicine, Uganda. Further, each workshop will have at least 2 facilitators who are trained in the bystander model.</description>
