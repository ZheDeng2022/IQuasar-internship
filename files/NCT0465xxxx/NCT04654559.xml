    <textblock>
      Fever of infants up to 18 months of age will be monitored in the hospital using the standard&#xD;
      clinical methods and wearable research prototypes. These research prototypes will be&#xD;
      measuring continuously and non-invasively skin based parameters, with which the feasibility&#xD;
      of developing a fever detection algorithm will be investigated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In daily clinical practice, core body temperature (CBT) of infants with fever symptoms is&#xD;
      monitored using sporadic rectal measurements. Because these sporadic invasive measurements&#xD;
      are time consuming for the medical staff and displeasing for patients, an alternative method&#xD;
      to assess CBT/fever is needed. The company greenTEG is developing a CBT algorithm which&#xD;
      calculates CBT continuously form skin temperature (ST), corresponding heat flux (HF) and&#xD;
      other skin-based parameters. The algorithm development will be achieved by collecting&#xD;
      skin-based parameters and reference CBT values from infants having fever in a clinical&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Develop and validate an algorithm that allows the detection of fever in infants through a&#xD;
      non-invasive sensor system, which calculates CBT from ST, HF and other skin-based data&#xD;
      streams, allowing a more effective patient management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measures of quality will be: 1) The mean absolute difference (MAD) between the CBT&#xD;
      prediction and the reference signal where the mean is taken over the whole measurement of a&#xD;
      single patient. An aggregate performance measure over a group of patients is defined by&#xD;
      averaging the MAD values of each patient in the group. 2) the 2Ïƒ (standard deviation) range&#xD;
      of the Bland-Altmann-Plot between the CBT prediction and the reference signal. This is&#xD;
      calculated either for individual patient data or for the combined data of all patients&#xD;
      together. As we have defined a group of patients for algorithm validation, the total&#xD;
      improvement will be defined by comparing the above aggregate performance measures of old and&#xD;
      new algorithm for the validation group. We expect the factors age, sex to influence the&#xD;
      algorithmic prediction. Balancing the probability of occurrence of the factors in the&#xD;
      population and the overall size of the study, a final size of 50 patients is reasonable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants will be recruited and screened 1 days before the measurements starts. Two research&#xD;
      prototypes will be applied to the patient on the left side of the body (lateral ribcage and&#xD;
      foot), after being admitted to the hospital and parents having signed the informed consent.&#xD;
      For all infants rectal measurement will be asses every 8 hours, as reference temperature. For&#xD;
      infants older than 6 months, in addition to rectal temperature, ear temperature will be&#xD;
      assessed every 4 hours with an infrared ear thermometer. The whole measurement procedure will&#xD;
      last 18-72 hours, depending on the stationary stay of the individual patient.&#xD;
