  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kawasaki disease (KD) is the most frequent vasculitis in younger children &lt;5years, and the&#xD;
      first cause of acquired ischemic myocardiopathy in childhood. Exceptionally, KD may cause&#xD;
      early death during the acute phase by myocardial infarction, but may compromise the long-term&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcome by accelerating atherosclerotic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of KD is high in far-Eastern countries and Hawaii but KD is relatively rare in&#xD;
      other regions (10/100000 children &lt;5years in northern Europe) which makes it difficult to&#xD;
      develop research on these rare population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early recognition and treatment by intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) influences the&#xD;
      prognosis positively. IVIG are the standard of care and decrease significantly the risk of&#xD;
      coronary aneurysms. However, despite a first infusion of IVIG, 20% of KD patients remain&#xD;
      febrile and have high risk of coronary vasculitis. Recent Japanese research group assessed&#xD;
      additional cyclosporine treatment in first line KD treatment but failed preventing relapse.&#xD;
      To date there is no agreement for a more effective second line treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the auto-inflammatory pattern of KD, the investigators hypothesize that anti IL-1&#xD;
      blocking agents could bring a rapid and sustained effect on systemic and coronary&#xD;
      inflammation in patients with KD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anakinra treatment may reduce the early and long-term mortality of patients with&#xD;
           Kawasaki Disease (KD), by a rapid and sustained effect on vascular inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The safety of anakinra is good, as the drug has a very short half-life, which allows its&#xD;
           rapid withdrawal in case of serious adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of anakinra is not associated with the risk of contamination by infectious agents,&#xD;
      which remain even minimal, a possibility with the use of IVIG.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a multicentric national randomized controlled, parallel-group in a 1:1 ratio, open&#xD;
      labelled trial of superiority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to compare the efficacy of Anakinra (Interleukin 1 receptor type 1 -&#xD;
      receptor antagonist) with 2nd IVIG infusion, in second line, on fever in patients with KD,&#xD;
      who failed to respond to one infusion of IVIG(standard treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main criterion-evaluating efficacy in both groups is: the patient must reach a body&#xD;
      (axillary (+0.5°C), tympanic, oral) temperature &lt;38˚C within 2 days after initiation of&#xD;
      treatment (i.e. a binary outcome: success/failure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to compare Anakinra with IVIG retreatment in terms of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy on fever at 72h&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy on disease activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy on KD symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy on coronary lesions (e.g.: dilatation and aneurysm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy on inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety and tolerability Secondary End Points (linked with the secondary objectives)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare Anakinra with IVIG retreatment in terms of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temperature &lt;38˚C within 3 days (72h) after initiation of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrease of the CRP values from baseline to day 30(CRP&lt;6 mg/L at day 30)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction in physician assessment of disease activity, on a 10 points scale, of at least&#xD;
           to 50% between baseline and day 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction in patient's parent's assessment of disease activity, on a 10 points scale, of&#xD;
           to at least 50% between baseline and day 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resolution of coronary abnormalities; i.e worst Z score &lt;2.5, by echocardiogram if&#xD;
           present at day 45.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events: pain/redness at injection site, bacterial infection hepatitis,&#xD;
           macrophage activation syndrome, severe neutropenia,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitoring of adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical examination: Complete clinical exam will be performed at each visit to&#xD;
                detect symptoms of KD (rash, cervical nodes, mucous lesions, extremities, GI,&#xD;
                pulmonary, cardio vascular, neurologic and muscular/joint evaluation) and possible&#xD;
                associated morbidity: e.g. concomitant infection&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Local tolerability of injections: will be evaluated by physician from V2 to V8:&#xD;
                pain, redness, swelling, induration, itching, haemorrhage, (and quoted from none,&#xD;
                mild, moderate, severe)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Vital signs and body measurements: at each visit: V1 to V9. The body temperature&#xD;
                will be measured daily until d30. Parents will receive a follow-up booklet..&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Laboratory evaluations: hematologic, hepatic and renal assessment will be followed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: KINERET:&#xD;
&#xD;
      KINERET® in the form of prefilled syringe with 100 mg of anakinra per 0.67 ml (150 mg/mL) and&#xD;
      adapted to paediatric population, in pack sizes of 7. Patients in group I, will receive a&#xD;
      starting dose of anakinra is 4 mg/kg at visit D1 (or day 0, if possible). During visits D1&#xD;
      and D2, if patients are still febrile with 12 hours (H12) of treatment, they will receive a&#xD;
      supplementary dose of 2 mg/Kg; otherwise, they will remain at a starting dose of 4mg/kg. If&#xD;
      they are still febrile at H24, they will receive a dose of 8mg/kg; otherwise, they will&#xD;
      maintain their dose of 6 mg/kg. Patients with temperature &lt;38°C at any point between&#xD;
      initiation and day 14, but who develop secondary fever due to KD could have further&#xD;
      escalation dose of anakinra until a maximum dose of 8mg/Kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: IVIG Immunoglobulins concentrates used for the ANACOMP study should be preferably&#xD;
      the specialty PRIVIGEN® 100mg/mL (=10g of human immunoglobulins) solute for intravenous&#xD;
      infusion, manufactured by CSL Behring (Commonwealth Serum Laboratories). Other presentations&#xD;
      in mL (25, 50, 200, 400 exist corresponding to respectively 2.5g, 5g, 20, and 40g of&#xD;
      immunoglobulins). Patients in group II, will receive one infusion of 2g/kg of intravenous&#xD;
      Immunoglobulins at visit D1 (or day 0, if possible)&#xD;
